  <description>As Matthew Kelly reflected on his twenty-five years of speaking and writing, he realized that his biggest inspiration continues to come from the many faithful individuals who support the mission of Dynamic Catholic. He decided to send an email to all of these Ambassadors, asking for their answers to three questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do you love being Catholic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is your favorite memory as a Catholic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Catholic, what are your hopes for the future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The response was overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I Love Being Catholic is the result of that rallying call. Compiled from thousands of answers, this collection of insights, stories, hopes, and dreams is both inspirational and motivational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors are people just like you they've laughed, cried, suffered, and celebrated their way through all the ups and downs of life. Some have been Catholic all their lives; others have taken a longer route home. All, however, can speak to the amazing gift that the Catholic faith has been in their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, it's challenging to be a Catholic. The collection of entries in Why I Love Being Catholic celebrates the best of the Catholic faith, highlights the everyday miracles taking place all around us, and reminds us that there are thousands of everyday heroes out there who dare to have big dreams for the Church. Even amidst the challenges of our times, holiness is possible, grace abounds, and there is every reason to live our lives with hope!</description>

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone‚Äîa recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn‚Äôt, her world begins to crumble‚Äîand its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one‚Äîand nothing‚Äîis what it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;With wry wit and hard-earned wisdom, popular online personality and founder of TheChicSite.com founder Rachel Hollis helps readers break free from the lies keeping them from the joy-filled and exuberant life they are meant to have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Chic Media, Rachel Hollis has created an online fan base of hundreds of thousands of fans by sharing tips for living a better life while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own. Now comes her highly anticipated first book featuring her signature combination of honesty, humor, and direct, no-nonsense advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;Girl, Wash Your Face&lt;/em&gt; begins with a specific lie Hollis once believed that left her feeling overwhelmed, unworthy, or ready to give up. As a working mother, a former foster parent, and a woman who has dealt with insecurities about her body and relationships, she speaks with the insight and kindness of a BFF, helping women unpack the limiting mind-sets that destroy their self-confidence and keep them from moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her temporary obsession with marrying Matt Damon to a daydream involving hypnotic iguanas to her son's request that she buy a necklace to "be like the other moms," Hollis holds nothing back. With unflinching faith and tenacity, Hollis spurs other women to live with passion and hustle and to awaken their slumbering goals.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A LIBRARY JOURNAL BEST BOOK OF 2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heartbroken woman stumbled upon a diary and steps into the life of its anonymous author. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In her twenties, Emily Wilson was on top of the world: she had a bestselling novel, a husband plucked from the pages of &lt;i&gt;GQ&lt;/i&gt;, and a one-way ticket to happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ten years later, the tide has turned on Emily's good fortune. So when her great-aunt Bee invites her to spend the month of March on Bainbridge Island in Washington State, Emily accepts, longing to be healed by the sea. Researching her next book, Emily discovers a red velvet diary, dated 1943, whose contents reveal startling connections to her own life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A mesmerizing debut with an idyllic setting and intriguing dual story line, &lt;i&gt;The Violets of March&lt;/i&gt; announces Sarah Jio as a writer to watch.</description>

  <description>Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of the #1 New York Times bestseller and global phenomenon The Girl on the Train returns with Into the Water, her addictive new novel of psychological suspense.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single mother turns up dead at the bottom of the river that runs through town. Earlier in the summer, a vulnerable teenage girl met the same fate. They are not the first women lost to these dark waters, but their deaths disturb the river and its history, dredging up secrets long submerged.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Left behind is a lonely fifteen-year-old girl. Parentless and friendless, she now finds herself in the care of her mother's sister, a fearful stranger who has been dragged back to the place she deliberately ran from‚Äîa place to which she vowed she'd never return.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the same propulsive writing and acute understanding of human instincts that captivated millions of readers around the world in her explosive debut thriller, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22557272.The_Girl_on_the_Train" title="The Girl on the Train" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/a&gt;, Paula Hawkins delivers an urgent, twisting, deeply satisfying read that hinges on the deceptiveness of emotion and memory, as well as the devastating ways that the past can reach a long arm into the present.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beware a calm surface‚Äîyou never know what lies beneath.</description>

  <description>A new poignant and breathtaking novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Things We Keep&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Secrets of Midwives&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every book, Sally Hepworth becomes more and more known for her searing emotional portraits of families‚Äîand the things that test their bonds. In &lt;i&gt;The Mother‚Äôs Promise&lt;/i&gt;, she delivers her most powerful novel yet: the story of a single mother who is dying, the troubled teenaged daughter who is battling her own demons, and the two women who come into their lives at the most critical moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice and her daughter Zoe have been a family of two all their lives. Zoe has always struggled with crippling social anxiety and her mother has been her constant and fierce protector. With no family to speak of, and the identity of Zoe‚Äôs father shrouded in mystery, their team of two works‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. Until Alice gets sick and is given a grim prognosis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find stability for Zoe, Alice reaches out to two women who are practically strangers, but who are her only hope: Kate, her oncology nurse, and Sonja, a social worker. As the four of them come together, a chain of events is set into motion and all four of them must confront their sharpest fears and secrets‚Äîsecrets about abandonment, abuse, estrangement, and the deepest longing for family. Imbued with heart and humor in even the darkest moments, &lt;i&gt;The Mother‚Äôs Promise&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable novel about the power of love and forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Rachel Jenner is walking in a Bristol park with her eight-year-old son, Ben, when he asks if he can run ahead. It‚Äôs an ordinary request on an ordinary Sunday afternoon, and Rachel has no reason to worry‚Äîuntil Ben vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Police are called, search parties go out, and Rachel, already insecure after her recent divorce, feels herself coming undone. As hours and then days pass without a sign of Ben, everyone who knew him is called into question, from Rachel‚Äôs newly married ex-husband to her mother-of-the-year sister. Inevitably, media attention focuses on Rachel too, and the public‚Äôs attitude toward her begins to shift from sympathy to suspicion.¬†&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she desperately pieces together the threadbare clues, Rachel realizes that the greatest dangers may lie not in the anonymous strangers of every parent‚Äôs nightmares, but behind the familiar smiles of those she trusts the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is Ben? The clock is ticking...</description>

  <description>Katie and Eric Knox have dedicated their lives to their fifteen-year-old daughter Devon, a gymnastics prodigy and Olympic hopeful. But when a violent death rocks their close-knit gymnastics community just weeks before an all-important competition, everything the Knoxes have worked so hard for feels suddenly at risk. As rumors swirl among the other parents, revealing hidden plots and allegiances, Katie tries frantically to hold her family together while also finding herself drawn, irresistibly, to the crime itself, and the dark corners it threatens to illuminate. From a writer with "exceptional gifts for making nerves jangle and skin crawl," (Janet Maslin) &lt;i&gt;You Will Know Me&lt;/i&gt; is a breathless rollercoaster of a novel about the desperate limits of desire, jealousy, and ambition.</description>

  <description>In this dazzling new novel, Emily Giffin, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed, Where We Belong, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The One &amp;amp; Only&lt;/i&gt; introduces a pair of sisters who find themselves at a crossroads.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; Growing up, Josie and Meredith Garland shared a loving, if sometimes contentious relationship. Josie was impulsive, spirited, and outgoing; Meredith hardworking, thoughtful, and reserved. When tragedy strikes their family, their different responses to the event splinter their delicate bond.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; Fifteen years later, Josie and Meredith are in their late thirties, following very different paths. Josie, a first grade teacher, is single‚Äîand &lt;i&gt;this close&lt;/i&gt; to swearing off dating for good. What she wants more than the right guy, however, is to become a mother‚Äîa feeling that is heightened when her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs daughter ends up in her class. Determined to have the future she‚Äôs always wanted, Josie decides to take matters into her own hands.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; On the outside, Meredith is the model daughter with the perfect life. A successful attorney, she‚Äôs married to a wonderful man, and together they‚Äôre raising a beautiful four-year-old daughter. Yet lately, Meredith feels dissatisfied and restless, secretly wondering if she chose the life that was expected of her rather than the one she truly desired. &lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; As the anniversary of their tragedy looms and painful secrets from the past begin to surface, Josie and Meredith must not only confront the issues that divide them, but also come to terms with their own choices. In their journey toward understanding and forgiveness, both sisters discover they need each other more than they knew . . . and that in the recipe for true happiness, love always comes first.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; Emotionally honest and utterly enthralling, &lt;i&gt;First Comes Love&lt;/i&gt; is a story about family, friendship, and the courage to follow your own heart‚Äîwherever that may lead.</description>

  <description>It's been more than six months since her husband's brutal death, and Julia Ransom is just beginning to breathe again. She loved her husband, renowned psychic August Ransom, but the media frenzy that followed his murder sapped what little strength she had left. Now, after dinner with friends, strolling along San Francisco's Pier 39, she realizes that she's happy. Standing at the railing, she savors the sounds around her-tourists, seals on a barge-and for a moment enjoys the sheer normalcy of it all. And then it comes to an end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Out of nowhere she's approached by a respectable-looking man who distracts her with conversation before violently attacking her and throwing her the railing. If it hadn't been for Special Agent Cheney Stone, out to stretch his legs between courses at a local restaurant, Julia would have vanished into the bay's murky depths. Not only does he save her from a watery grave, but he senses a connection between her assault and her husband's death, and sets out to serve as her protector while reopening August Ransom's murder investigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, in Maestro, Virginia, Sheriff Dixon Noble-last seen in &lt;i&gt;Point Blank&lt;/i&gt;-still mourns his wife, Christie, who vanished hree years earlier. His life, too, is just getting back to normal when he learns of a San Francisco woman named Charlotte Pallack, whose shocking resemblance to Christie sends Dix across the country. Though he knows in his heart that she can't possibly be his wife, Dix is compelled to see her with his own eyes. Once in San Francisco, Dix and Cheney's paths inevitably cross. With the help of agents Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock, whose San Francisco connections prove essential in unlocking the mystery behind Charlotte Pallack's identity as well as the forces behind Julia Ransom's attempted murder, Sheriff Noble and Agent Stone push deep into a complex world of psychics and poseurs. As the stakes and the body count rise, Savich, Sherlock, Dix, and Cheney fight for answers-and their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by the life of a real World War II heroine, this debut novel reveals a story of love, redemption, and secrets that were hidden for decades.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;¬†&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But Caroline‚Äôs world is forever changed when Hitler‚Äôs army invades Poland in September 1939‚Äîand then sets its sights on France.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she is drawn deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspecting neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; For the ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. Once hired, though, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to Ravensbr√ºck, the notorious Nazi concentration camp for women. Their stories cross continents‚Äîfrom New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland‚Äîas Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.</description>

  <description>On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked into Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Over the course of minutes, they would kill twelve students and a teacher and wound twenty-four others before taking their own lives.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; For the last sixteen years, Sue Klebold, Dylan‚Äôs mother, has lived with the indescribable grief and shame of that day. How could her child, the promising young man she had loved and raised, be responsible for such horror? And how, as his mother, had she not known something was wrong? Were there subtle signs she had missed? What, if anything, could she have done differently?&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; These are questions that Klebold has grappled with every day since the Columbine tragedy. In¬†&lt;i&gt;A Mother‚Äôs Reckoning&lt;/i&gt;, she chronicles with unflinching honesty her journey as a mother trying to come to terms with the incomprehensible. In the hope that the insights and understanding she has gained may help other families recognize when a child is in distress, she tells her story in full, drawing upon her personal journals, the videos and writings that Dylan left behind, and on countless interviews with mental health experts.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; Filled with hard-won wisdom and compassion,¬†&lt;i&gt;A Mother‚Äôs Reckoning¬†&lt;/i&gt;is a powerful and haunting book that sheds light on one of the most pressing issues of our time. And with fresh wounds from the recent Newtown and Charleston shootings, never has the need for understanding been more urgent.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All author profits from the book will be donated to research and to charitable organizations focusing on mental health issues.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade‚Äôs worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. &lt;i&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Kalanithi‚Äôs transformation from a na√Øve medical student ‚Äúpossessed,‚Äù as he wrote, ‚Äúby the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life‚Äù into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.</description>

  <description>Growing up on Long Island, Shelby Richmond is an ordinary girl until one night an extraordinary tragedy changes her fate. Her best friend‚Äôs future is destroyed in an accident, while Shelby walks away with the burden of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when a life is turned inside out? When love is something so distant it may as well be a star in the sky? Faithful is the story of a survivor, filled with emotion‚Äîfrom dark suffering to true happiness‚Äîa moving portrait of a young woman finding her way in the modern world. A fan of Chinese food, dogs, bookstores, and men she should stay away from, Shelby has to fight her way back to her own future. In New York City she finds a circle of lost and found souls‚Äîincluding an angel who‚Äôs been watching over her ever since that fateful icy night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a character you will fall in love with, so believable and real and endearing, that she captures both the ache of loneliness and the joy of finding yourself at last. For anyone who‚Äôs ever been a hurt teenager, for every mother of a daughter who has lost her way, Faithful is a roadmap.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn‚Äôt always had it easy, but that‚Äôs never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She‚Äôs come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; ‚Äî she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily‚Äôs life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He‚Äôs also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt. Lily can‚Äôt get him out of her head. But Ryle‚Äôs complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ‚Äúno dating‚Äù rule, she can‚Äôt help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan ‚Äî her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is your family all that it could be? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many feel bombarded by images and experiences of broken families, but this is not how God intended families to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So often we examine the traits of unhealthy families, but Gary Chapman paints a biblical portrait of what a loving, stable family looks like. He details five timeless characteristics that create a healthy family environment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart for service&lt;br /&gt;Husbands and wives who relate intimately&lt;br /&gt;Parents who guide their children&lt;br /&gt;Children who obey and honor their parents&lt;br /&gt;Husbands who love and lead&lt;br /&gt;In Dr. Chapman's own words, "What happens to your family does make a difference not only to you and your children, but to the thousands of young observers who are in search of a functional family."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is not merely for reading, but for living. Experience God's design for family.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the¬† &lt;i&gt;New York Times¬†&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of¬† &lt;i&gt;Midwives&lt;/i&gt; and¬† &lt;i&gt;The Sandcastle Girls¬†&lt;/i&gt; comes the spellbinding tale of a party gone horribly wrong: two men lie dead in a suburban living room; two women are on the run from police; and a marriage is ripping apart at the seams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;¬†¬†¬†When Richard Chapman offers to host his younger brother's bachelor party, he expects a certain amount of debauchery. He sends his wife, Kristin, and young daughter off to his mother-in-law's for the weekend, and he opens his Westchester home to his brother's friends and their hired entertainment. What he does not expect is this: bacchanalian drunkenness, a dangerously intimate moment in his guest bedroom, and two naked women stabbing and killing their Russian bodyguards before driving off into the night. In the aftermath, Richard's life rapidly spirals into a nightmare. The police throw him out of his home, now a crime scene; his investment banking firm puts him on indefinite leave; and his wife finds herself unable to forgive him for the moment he shared with a dark-haired girl in the guest room. But the dark-haired girl, Alexandra, faces a much graver danger. In one breathless, violent night, she is free, running to escape the police who will arrest her and the gangsters who will kill her in a heartbeat. A captivating, chilling story about shame and scandal,¬†&lt;i&gt;The Guest Room&lt;/i&gt;¬†is a riveting novel from one of our greatest storytellers.</description>

  <description>Over the past hundred years, scholars have attacked the historical truth of the Gospels and argued that they were originally anonymous and filled with contradictions. In The Case for Jesus, Brant Pitre taps into the wells of Christian scripture, history, and tradition to ask and answer a number of different questions, including: If we don't know who wrote the Gospels, how can we trust them? How are the four Gospels different from other gospels, such as the lost gospel of "Q" and the Gospel of Thomas? How can the four Gospels be historically true when there are differences between them? How much faith should be put into these writings? As The Case for Jesus will show, recent discoveries in New Testament scholarship, as well as neglected evidence from ancient manuscripts and the early church fathers, together have the potential to pull the rug out from under a century of skepticism toward the apostolic authorship and historical truth of the traditional Gospels.</description>

  <description>When Melody Grace McCartney was six years old, she and her parents witnessed an act of violence so brutal that it changed their lives forever. The federal government lured them into the Witness Protection Program with the promise of safety, and they went gratefully. But the program took Melody's name, her home, her innocence, and, ultimately, her family. She's been May Adams, Karen Smith, Anne Johnson, and countless others--everyone but the one person she longs to be: herself. So when the feds spirit her off to begin yet another new life in another town, she's stunned when a man confronts her and calls her by her real name. Jonathan Bovaro, the mafioso sent to hunt her down, knows her, the real her, and it's a dangerous thrill that Melody can't resist. He's insistent that she's just a pawn in the government's war against the Bovaro family. But can she trust her life and her identity to this vicious stranger whose acts of violence are legendary?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wrapped Up: God‚Äôs Ten Gifts for Women&lt;/i&gt; offers a healthy alternative to the false messages women hear today. Each chapter focuses on a different gift a woman is meant to discover and unwrap, ultimately leading to peace and fulfillment. Cheryl draws from her extensive knowledge of Old Testament women to unveil life lessons found in the rich history of our faith, and Teresa uses her media expertise to reveal how to counter the cultural messages that inundate women today. Together, the authors provide a timeless and timely look at God‚Äôs life-giving gifts.</description>

  <description>At a time when so many people are spiritually disillusioned and searching for ways to live, love, work, and play that nurture the soul rather than destroy it, Matthew Kelly once again delivers a powerful book that encourages us in our weariness, challenges us in our comfort, and invites us to rediscover the beautiful possibilities God places before us daily. Rediscover Jesus is a profound invitation to seek deeply personal answers to our deeply personal questions. Each page seems to effortlessly reach into every aspect our lives, providing spiritual wisdom and practical insights that help us to know both Jesus and ourselves in a new way. Some books find us at just the right time, and those books change our lives forever. Rediscover Jesus is one of those books. How Well Do You Know Jesus? I think about this often, and I always come to the same realization. I don't know Jesus anywhere near as well as I would like to know him. The desire is there, but life gets in the way. There are times when I seem to be making great progress, and other times when I wonder if I know him at all. But I always arrive back at the same inspiring and haunting idea: If there is one person that we should each get to know in a deeply personal way, it is Jesus the carpenter from Nazareth, the itinerant preacher, the Son of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, the Lamb of God, the new Adam, the Messiah, the Alpha and the Omega, the Chosen One, the Light of the World, the God-Man who wants good things for us more than we want them for ourselves, the healer of our souls.</description>

  <description>In her previous books, Beth Moore has introduced her readers to David and Paul. In &lt;i&gt;Jesus, the One and Only&lt;/i&gt;, Beth introduces them to an intimate Savior as they get a close-up and personal portrait of the life of Jesus the Messiah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is far more than just a work on the life of Christ. As He has done in the past, God uses Beth‚Äôs words to woo the reader into a romance with the One and Only. The reader comes to know Christ personally, watching and listening as He breaks up a funeral by raising the dead, confronts conniving religious leaders of His day, teaches on a Galilean hillside, or walks on the waves and calms the storm.</description>

  <description>When young, pretty Catherine Bailey meets Lee Brightman, she can't believe her luck. Gorgeous, charismatic, and a bit mysterious, Lee seems almost too perfect to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what begins as flattering attention and spontaneous, passionate sex transforms into raging jealousy, and Catherine soon discovers that Lee's dazzling blue eyes and blond good looks hide a dark, violent nature. Disturbed by his increasingly erratic, controlling behavior, she tries to break it off; turning to her friends for support, she's stunned to find they don't believe her. Increasingly isolated and driven into the darkest corner of her world, a desperate Catherine plans a meticulous escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years later, Lee is behind bars and Catherine‚Äînow Cathy‚Äîis trying to build a new life in a new city. Though her body has healed, the trauma of the past still haunts her. Then Stuart Richardson, her attractive new neighbor, moves in. Encouraging her to confront her fears, he sparks unexpected hope and the possibility of love and a normal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day the phone rings . . .</description>

  <description>Christine wakes up every morning in an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar man. She looks in the mirror and sees an unfamiliar, middle-aged face. And every morning, the man she has woken up with must explain that he is Ben, he is her husband, she is forty-seven years old, and a terrible accident two decades earlier decimated her ability to form new memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, Christine must begin again the reconstruction of her past. And the closer she gets to the truth, the more unbelievable it seems.</description>

  <description>The national C-section rate is at an all-time high of 31 percent. Are all these C-sections necessary, or are some of them done simply for the sake of convenience? Inductions seem to be the norm, but are they always needed? Today, expectant mothers are often left feeling powerless, as their instincts are replaced by drugs and routine medical procedures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you are about to discover is that you have a choice, and you have the power to plan the kind of birth that's right for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;-whether it is at a birth center, a hospital, or at home. In YOUR BEST BIRTH, internationally known advocates of informed choice RickiLake and Abby Epstein inspire women to take back the birth experience, with essential advice on:&lt;br /&gt;¬∑ Positive and negative effects of epidurals, Pitocin, and other drugs and interventions &lt;br /&gt;¬∑ Inducing vs. allowing your labor to progress naturally &lt;br /&gt;¬∑ The truth behind our country's staggering C-section rate &lt;br /&gt;¬∑ Assembling your birth team and creating your birth plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With chapters such as "Obstetricians: Finding Dr. Right," "Epidurals: You Haven't Got Time for the Pain," and "Electronic Monitors: Reading between the Lines," Lake and Epstein will encourage you to consider whatever your doctor, mother, and best friend may suggest in a new light. The book also includes inspiring birth stories, including those from well-known personalities, such as Laila Ali and Cindy Crawford. Packed with crucial advice from childbirth professionals, and delivered in a down-to-earth, engaging voice, YOUR BEST BIRTH is sure to renew your confidence and put the control back where it belongs: with parents-to-be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Abby Epstein and Ricki Lake have taken a wonderful and constructive approach to ensuring an optimal birthing experience. Their language creates a 'climate of confidence' for pregnant women and their families, who must make key decisions about where, how and with whom to give birth in a health care system often unresponsive to our needs. This book is like a good friend giving wise counsel." --Judy Norsigian, co-editor of &lt;em&gt;Our Bodies, Ourselves: Pregnancy and Birth&lt;/em&gt; and Executive Director, Our Bodies Ourselves</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; Sophie Honeywell always wondered if Thomas Gordon was the one she let get away. He was the perfect boyfriend, but on the day he was to propose, she broke his heart. A year later he married his travel agent, while Sophie has been mortifyingly single ever since. Now Thomas is back in her life because Sophie has unexpectedly inherited his aunt Connie's house on Scribbly Gum Island -- home of the famously unsolved Munro Baby mystery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sophie moves onto the island and begins a new life as part of an unconventional family where it seems everyone has a secret. Grace, a beautiful young mother, is feverishly planning a shocking escape from her perfect life. Margie, a frumpy housewife, has made a pact with a stranger, while dreamy Aunt Rose wonders if maybe it's about time she started making her own decisions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As Sophie's life becomes increasingly complicated, she discovers that sometimes you have to stop waiting around -- and come up with your own fairy-tale ending. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As she so adroitly did in her smashing debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Three Wishes&lt;/i&gt;, the incomparable Liane Moriarty once again combines sharp wit, lovable and eccentric characters, and a page-turning story for an unforgettable &lt;i&gt;Last Anniversary&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A woman's faith in God is challenged by the first question Satan asks Eve in the Bible: "Did God really say you can‚Äôt eat from any tree in the garden?" That seed of doubt and the story it begins to unfold breed a concept of fear still haunting each of us on some level every day-the idea that our actions could ruin something beautiful, and God might not have control of things.¬†&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In What Women Fear&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed writer and speaker Angie Smith admits, "fear is a major part of my testimony" and talks openly about her treatment for anxiety as a child. Giving a voice to the problem, she says, "I truly believe every single one of us struggles with some type of fear, whether it's fear of flying or fear of being 'found out.' Maybe you don‚Äôt worry about dying, but you get sick thinking about the fact that you might fail."¬†&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than suggesting that those who truly love the Lord would never fear, Angie blends her own experiences with those of men and women from throughout Scripture to help us start dealing more effectively with these true, human emotions. Whether it‚Äôs a constant "What if?," a nagging fear of abandonment or betrayal, fear of your own or someone else‚Äôs death, fear of trusting God's plan, or even the fear that God's existence is a lie, Angie will walk you through stories of others who have simultaneously loved God and struggled with fear. Join Angie and discover how to let Jesus redeem this struggle as only He can, that He will be glorified, and you will be transformed!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"Sometimes the greatest things are the most embarrassing." Ellen Degeneres' winning, upbeat candor has made her show one of the most popular, resilient and honored daytime shows on the air. (To date, it has won no fewer than 31 Emmys.) &lt;i&gt;Seriously... I'm Kidding&lt;/i&gt;, Degeneres' first book in eight years, brings us up to date about the life of a kindhearted woman who bowed out of &lt;i&gt;American Idol&lt;/i&gt; because she didn't want to be mean. Lively; hilarious; often sweetly poignant.</description>

  <description>It's been three years since the devastating accident... three years since Mia walked out of Adam's life forever.&lt;p&gt;Now living on opposite coasts, Mia is Juilliard's rising star and Adam is LA tabloid fodder, thanks to his new rock star status and celebrity girlfriend. When Adam gets stuck in New York by himself, chance brings the couple together again, for one last night. As they explore the city that has become Mia's home, Adam and Mia revisit the past and open their hearts to the future - and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from Adam's point of view in the spare, lyrical prose that defined &lt;i&gt;If I Stay&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Where She Went&lt;/i&gt; explores the devastation of grief, the promise of new hope, and the flame of rekindled romance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In love we find out who we want to be. In war we find out who we are.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France, 1939&lt;br /&gt;In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says goodbye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front. She doesn‚Äôt believe that the Nazis will invade France...but invade they do, in droves of marching soldiers, in caravans of trucks and tanks, in planes that fill the skies and drop bombs upon the innocent. When France is overrun, Vianne is forced to take an enemy into her house, and suddenly her every move is watched; her life and her child‚Äôs life is at constant risk. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates around her, she must make one terrible choice after another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vianne‚Äôs sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old girl, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth. While thousands of Parisians march into the unknown terrors of war, she meets the compelling and mysterious G√§etan, a partisan who believes the French can fight the Nazis from within France, and she falls in love as only the young can...completely. When he betrays her, Isabelle races headlong into danger and joins the Resistance, never looking back or giving a thought to the real--and deadly--consequences.</description>

  <description>Common wisdom portrays sex and church to be at odds, yet studies show that Catholics have better sex, and more often. This witty, frank, and refreshingly orthodox book draws from the beautiful truths of Catholic teaching to show people of all faiths about rich and satisfying sexuality. Hailed by Christians across the spectrum from Christopher West and Janet E. Smith to John L. Allen, Jr., &lt;i&gt;Holy Sex!&lt;/i&gt; includes dozens of questionnaires, quizzes, and valuable lessons from real-life stories.</description>

  <description>A heart-wrenching debut novel in the bestselling tradition of P.S. I Love You about a young woman with breast cancer who undertakes a mission to find a new wife for her husband before she passes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-seven-year-old Daisy already beat breast cancer three years ago. How can this be happening to her again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of what was supposed to be a triumphant ‚ÄúCancerversary‚Äù with her husband Jack to celebrate three years of being cancer-free, Daisy suffers a devastating blow: her doctor tells her that the cancer is back, but this time it‚Äôs an aggressive stage four diagnosis. She may have as few as four months left to live. Death is a frightening prospect‚Äîbut not because she‚Äôs afraid for herself. She‚Äôs terrified of what will happen to her brilliant but otherwise charmingly helpless husband when she‚Äôs no longer there to take care of him. It‚Äôs this fear that keeps her up at night, until she stumbles on the solution: she has to find him another wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a singular determination, Daisy scouts local parks and coffee shops and online dating sites looking for Jack‚Äôs perfect match. But the further she gets on her quest, the more she questions the sanity of her plan. As the thought of her husband with another woman becomes all too real, Daisy‚Äôs forced to decide what‚Äôs more important in the short amount of time she has left: her husband‚Äôs happiness‚Äîor her own?</description>

  <description>Lyn, Cat, and Gemma Kettle, beautiful thirty-three-year-old triplets, seem to attract attention everywhere they go. Whenever they're together, laughter, drama, and mayhem seem to follow. But apart, each is very much her own woman, dealing with her own share of ups and downs. Lyn has organized her life into one big checklist, juggling the many balls of work, marriage, and motherhood with expert precision, but is she as together as her datebook would have her seem? Cat has just learned a startling secret about her marriage -- can she bring another life into her very precarious world? And can free-spirited Gemma, who bolts every time a relationship hits the six-month mark, ever hope to find lasting love? In this wise, witty, hilarious new novel, we follow the Kettle sisters through their thirty-third-year, as they struggle to survive their divorced parents' dating each other, their technologically savvy grandmother, a cheating husband, champagne hangovers, and the fabulous, frustrating .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;At the heart of The Husband‚Äôs Secret is a letter that‚Äôs not meant to be read&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My darling Cecilia, if you‚Äôre reading this, then I‚Äôve died...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret‚Äîsomething with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all‚Äîshe‚Äôs an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia‚Äîor each other‚Äîbut they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband‚Äôs secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spouses‚Äîand, ultimately, ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Lydia is dead. But they don‚Äôt know this yet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins this exquisite novel about a Chinese American family living in 1970s small-town Ohio. Lydia is the favorite child of Marilyn and James Lee, and her parents are determined that she will fulfill the dreams they were unable to pursue. But when Lydia‚Äôs body is found in the local lake, the delicate balancing act that has been keeping the Lee family together is destroyed, tumbling them into chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A profoundly moving story of family, secrets, and longing, &lt;i&gt;Everything I Never Told You &lt;/i&gt;is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive family portrait, uncovering the ways in which mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives struggle, all their lives, to understand one another.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn‚Äôt love at first sight. They wouldn‚Äôt even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn‚Äôt want love, she doesn‚Äôt have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ask about the past.&lt;br /&gt;Don‚Äôt expect a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can‚Äôt handle it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearts get infiltrated.&lt;br /&gt;Promises get broken.&lt;br /&gt;Rules get shattered.&lt;br /&gt;Love gets ugly.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; follows three women, each at a crossroads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She‚Äôs funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline‚Äôs youngest (&lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;is this possible?). And to top it all off,¬†Madeline‚Äôs teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline‚Äôs ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn‚Äôt be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This emotional, hilarious, devastating, and ultimately triumphant YA debut, based on actual events, recounts one girl‚Äôs rejection of her high school‚Äôs hierarchy‚Äîand her discovery of her true self in the face of tragedy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fall‚Äôs buzzed-about, in-house favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside, Anika Dragomir is all lip gloss and blond hair‚Äîthe third most popular girl in school. Inside, she‚Äôs a freak: a mix of dark thoughts, diabolical plots, and, if local chatter is to be believed, vampire DNA (after all, her father is Romanian). But she keeps it under wraps to maintain her social position. One step out of line and Becky Vilhauer, first most popular girl in school, will make her life hell. So when former loner Logan McDonough shows up one September hotter, smarter, and more mysterious than ever, Anika knows she can‚Äôt get involved. It would be insane to throw away her social safety for a nerd. So what if that nerd is now a black-leather-jacket-wearing dreamboat, and his loner status is clearly the result of his troubled home life? Who cares if the right girl could help him with all that, maybe even save him from it? Who needs him when Jared Kline, the bad boy every girl dreams of, is asking her on dates? Who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anatomy of a Misfit&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/i&gt;, and Anika‚Äôs hilariously deadpan delivery will appeal to readers for its honesty and depth. The so-sad-it‚Äôs-funny high school setting will pull readers in, but when the story‚Äôs dark foreboding gradually takes over, the devastating penultimate tragedy hits like a punch to the gut. Readers will ride the highs and lows alongside funny, flawed Anika ‚Äî from laughter to tears, and everything in between.</description>

  <description>Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, reporter Camille Preaker faces a troubling assignment: she must return to her tiny hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims‚Äîa bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story‚Äîand survive this homecoming.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br /&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor&lt;/i&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Park&lt;/i&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds‚Äîsmart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club‚Äîa secret secret society obsessed with notorious crimes‚Äîlocates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She‚Äôll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club‚Äîfor a fee. As Libby‚Äôs search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started‚Äîon the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe she was abandoned, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice‚Äôs old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother‚Äôs whereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jenna‚Äôs memories dovetail with the events in her mother‚Äôs journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Writing a new future takes a little time‚Äîand a lot of love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Vison never expected to run a book club, until her life took an unexpected turn.¬†Now, with Jean‚Äôs husband gone, what began as an off-the-cuff idea has grown into a group of six women who meet the second Tuesday of every month for a potluck supper, for wine and laughter‚Äîand for books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There‚Äôs Loretta, who deals with the lack of intimacy in her marriage by diving into erotic novels. Dorothy, whose ruffian sons are a never-ending source of stress.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Year of Magical Thinking&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What Remains&lt;/i&gt;, this breathtaking memoir by a young Army widow shares her heartbreaking, candid story about recovering from her husband's death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;A world traveler, Artis Henderson dreamed of living abroad after college and one day becoming a writer. Marrying a conservative Texan soldier and being an Army wife was never in her plan. Nor was the devastating helicopter crash that took his life soon after their marriage. On November 6, 2006, the Apache helicopter carrying Artis‚Äôs husband Miles crashed in Iraq, leaving her‚Äîin official military terms‚Äîan ‚Äúunremarried widow.‚Äù She was twenty-six years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Unremarried Widow&lt;/i&gt;, Artis gracefully and fearlessly traces the arduous process of rebuilding her life after this loss, from the dark hours following the military notification to the first fumbling attempts at new love. She recounts the bond that led her and Miles to start a life together, even in the face of unexpected challenges, and offers a compassionate critique of the difficulties of military life. In one of the book's most unexpected elements, Artis reveals how Miles‚Äôs death mirrored her own father‚Äôs‚Äîin a plane crash that she survived when she was five. In her journey through devastation and heartbreak, Artis is able to reach a new understanding with her widowed mother and together they find solace in their shared loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for all its raw emotion and devastatingly honest reflections, this is more than a grief memoir.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Delivered in breathtaking prose, &lt;i&gt;Unremarried Widow&lt;/i&gt; is a celebration of the unlikely love between two very different people and the universality of both grief and hope.</description>

  <description>In the name of the Father, the Son, and ... the Holy Spirit. We pray in the name of all three, but how often do we live with an awareness of only the first two? As Jesus ascended into heaven, He promised to send the Holy Spirit‚Äîthe Helper‚Äîso that we could be true and living witnesses for Christ. Unfortunately, today's church has admired the gift but neglected to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakthrough author Francis Chan rips away paper and bows to get at the true source of the church's power‚Äîthe Holy Spirit. Chan contends that we've ignored the Spirit for far too long, and we are reaping the disastrous results. Thorough scriptural support and compelling narrative form Chan's invitation to stop and remember the One we've forgotten, the Spirit of the living God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Before WICKED was formed, before the Glade was built, before Thomas entered the Maze, sun flares hit the earth and mankind fell to disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark and Trina were there when it happened, and they survived. But surviving the sun flares was easy compared to what came next. Now a disease of rage and lunacy races across the eastern United States, and there‚Äôs something suspicious about its origin. Worse yet, it‚Äôs mutating, and all evidence suggests that it will bring humanity to its knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark and Trina are convinced there‚Äôs a way to save those left living from descending into madness. And they‚Äôre determined to find it‚Äîif they can stay alive. Because in this new, devastated world, every life has a price. And to some, you‚Äôre worth more dead than alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It‚Äôs the end of the line.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WICKED has taken everything from Thomas: his life, his memories, and now his only friends‚Äîthe Gladers. But it‚Äôs finally over. The trials are complete, after one final test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will anyone survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What WICKED doesn‚Äôt know is that Thomas remembers far more than they think. And it‚Äôs enough to prove that he can‚Äôt believe a word of what they say.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The truth will be terrifying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas beat the Maze. He survived the Scorch. He‚Äôll risk anything to save his friends. But the truth might be what ends it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The time for lies is over.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn‚Äôt done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch. &lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch‚Äîthe most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them. &lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers‚Äô destruction‚Äîand they‚Äôre determined to survive.</description>

  <description>Once in nine lives, something extraordinary happens... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Gwen Cooper wanted was another cat. She already had two, not to mention a phenomenally underpaying job and a recently broken heart. Then Gwen‚Äôs veterinarian called with a story about a three-week-old eyeless kitten who‚Äôd been abandoned. It was love at first sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone warned that Homer would always be an "underachiever," never as playful or independent as other cats. But the kitten nobody believed in quickly grew into a three-pound dynamo, a tiny daredevil with a giant heart who eagerly made friends with every human who crossed his path. Homer scaled seven-foot bookcases with ease and leapt five feet into the air to catch flies in mid-buzz. He survived being trapped alone for days after 9/11 in an apartment near the World Trade Center, and even saved Gwen‚Äôs life when he chased off an intruder who broke into their home in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was Homer‚Äôs unswerving loyalty, his infinite capacity for love, and his joy in the face of all obstacles that inspired Gwen daily and transformed her life. And by the time she met the man she would marry, she realized Homer had taught her the most important lesson of all: Love isn‚Äôt something you see with your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Homer‚Äôs Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; is the once-in-a-lifetime story of an extraordinary cat and his human companion. It celebrates the refusal to accept limits‚Äîon love, ability, or hope against overwhelming odds. By turns jubilant and moving, it‚Äôs a memoir for anybody who‚Äôs ever fallen completely and helplessly in love with a pet.</description>

  <description>Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.</description>

  <description>With the end of summer closing in and a steamy Labor Day weekend looming in the town of Holton Mills, New Hampshire, thirteen-year-old Henry‚Äîlonely, friendless, not too good at sports‚Äîspends most of his time watching television, reading, and daydreaming about the soft skin and budding bodies of his female classmates. For company Henry has his long-divorced mother, Adele‚Äîa onetime dancer whose summer project was to teach him how to foxtrot; his hamster, Joe; and awkward Saturday-night outings to Friendly's with his estranged father and new stepfamily. As much as he tries, Henry knows that even with his jokes and his "Husband for a Day" coupon, he still can't make his emotionally fragile mother happy. Adele has a secret that makes it hard for her to leave their house, and seems to possess an irreparably broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that changes on the Thursday before Labor Day, when a mysterious bleeding man named Frank approaches Henry and asks for a hand. Over the next five days, Henry will learn some of life's most valuable lessons: how to throw a baseball, the secret to perfect piecrust, the breathless pain of jealousy, the power of betrayal, and the importance of putting others‚Äîespecially those we love‚Äîabove ourselves. And the knowledge that real love is worth waiting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a manner evoking Ian McEwan's Atonement and Nick Hornby's About a Boy, acclaimed author Joyce Maynard weaves a beautiful, poignant tale of love, sex, adolescence, and devastating treachery as seen through the eyes of a young teenage boy‚Äîand the man he later becomes‚Äîlooking back at an unexpected encounter that begins one single long, hot, life-altering weekend.</description>

  <description>"I just can't be a mother today."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These words have been whispered to God in quiet desperation by mothers who love their children to the depths of their soul, but who are struggling with how hard motherhood is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motherhood turns you inside out. Sometimes you feel overwhelmed by how tired you feel; the days go on and on, and you want to be a "good" mom, but you feel like a failure so much of the time. What happened to all your ideals? When did you end up feeling so...lost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Mae and Sally Clarkson have been to the edge and back. "Desperate" is the story of one young mother's trials and one experienced mentor's priceless exhortations. "Desperate" is not a book about despair, nor is it a rule-laden mothering manual. It is a bouquet from a friend who has been there, reminding us that we are not alone. Sarah Mae's unvarnished account of her own struggles mothering three feisty young children is a lesson in learning patience, loving idiosyncrasies, accepting help, and--most of all--leaning on God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chapter includes a brief Bible study with journal exercises to help you find your own quiet center, and get you back into the fray soul-filled and refreshed. Written with candor, empathy, and faith, "Desperate "is like coffee with a trusted girlfriend; one who knows how hard being a mother can be, and how to navigate the often turbulent road.</description>

  <description>The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summer that Nixon resigns, six teenagers at a summer camp for the arts become inseparable. Decades later the bond remains powerful, but so much else has changed. In The Interestings, Wolitzer follows these characters from the height of youth through middle age, as their talents, fortunes, and degrees of satisfaction diverge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kind of creativity that is rewarded at age fifteen is not always enough to propel someone through life at age thirty; not everyone can sustain, in adulthood, what seemed so special in adolescence. Jules Jacobson, an aspiring comic actress, eventually resigns herself to a more practical occupation and lifestyle. Her friend Jonah, a gifted musician, stops playing the guitar and becomes an engineer. But Ethan and Ash, Jules's now-married best friends, become shockingly successful‚Äîtrue to their initial artistic dreams, with the wealth and access that allow those dreams to keep expanding. The friendships endure and even prosper, but also underscore the differences in their fates, in what their talents have become and the shapes their lives have taken. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wide in scope, ambitious, and populated by complex characters who come together and apart in a changing New York City, The Interestings explores the meaning of talent; the nature of envy; the roles of class, art, money, and power; and how all of it can shift and tilt precipitously over the course of a friendship and a life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In her eagerly awaited new novel, beloved &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Emily Giffin returns with an extraordinary story of love and loyalty‚Äîand an unconventional heroine struggling to reconcile both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thirty-three-year-old Shea Rigsby has spent her entire life in Walker, Texas‚Äîa small college town that lives and dies by football, a passion she unabashedly shares. Raised alongside her best friend, Lucy, the daughter of Walker‚Äôs legendary head coach, Clive Carr, Shea was too devoted to her hometown team to leave. Instead she stayed in Walker for college, even taking a job in the university athletic department after graduation, where she has remained for more than a decade.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when an unexpected tragedy strikes the tight-knit Walker community, Shea‚Äôs comfortable world is upended, and she begins to wonder if the life she‚Äôs chosen is really enough for her. As she finally gives up her safety net to set out on an unexpected path, Shea discovers unsettling truths about the people and things she has always trusted most‚Äîand is forced to confront her deepest desires, fears, and secrets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thoughtful, funny, and brilliantly observed, &lt;i&gt;The One &amp;amp; Only&lt;/i&gt; is a luminous novel about finding your passion, following your heart, and, most of all, believing in something bigger than yourself . . . the one and only thing that truly makes life worth living.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Navy SEAL's firsthand account of American heroism during a secret military operation in Afghanistan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inspiration for a major motion picture by Mark Wahlberg.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On a clear night in late June 2005, four U.S. Navy SEALs left their base in northern Afghanistan for the mountainous Pakistani border. Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks. In this rich , moving chronicle of courage, honor, and patriotism, Marcus Luttrell delivers one of the most powerful narratives ever written about modern warfare-and a tribute to his teammates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</description>

  <description>As America's Mercury Seven astronauts were launched on death-defying missions, television cameras focused on the brave smiles of their young wives. Overnight, these women were transformed from military spouses into American royalty. They had tea with Jackie Kennedy, appeared on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Life&lt;/i&gt; magazine, and quickly grew into fashion icons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Glenn, with her picture-perfect marriage, was the envy of the other wives; JFK made it clear that platinum-blonde Rene Carpenter was his favorite; and licensed pilot Trudy Cooper arrived with a secret that needed to stay hidden from NASA. Together with the other wives they formed the Astronaut Wives Club, providing one another with support and friendship, coffee and cocktails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their celebrity rose-and as divorce and tragedy began to touch their lives-the wives continued to rally together, forming bonds that would withstand the test of time, and they have stayed friends for over half a century. THE ASTRONAUT WIVES CLUB tells the story of the women who stood beside some of the biggest heroes in American history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the spirit of &lt;i&gt;Loving Frank&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Paris Wife,&lt;/i&gt; acclaimed novelist Melanie Benjamin pulls back the curtain on the marriage of one of America‚Äôs most extraordinary couples: Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Anne Morrow, a shy college senior with hidden literary aspirations, travels to Mexico City to spend Christmas with her family, she meets Colonel Charles Lindbergh, fresh off his celebrated 1927 solo flight across the Atlantic. Enthralled by Charles‚Äôs assurance and fame, Anne is certain the aviator has scarcely noticed her. But she is wrong. Charles sees in Anne a kindred spirit, a fellow adventurer, and her world will be changed forever. The two marry in a headline-making wedding. In the years that follow, Anne becomes the first licensed female glider pilot in the United States. But despite this and other major achievements, she is viewed merely as the aviator‚Äôs wife. The fairy-tale life she once longed for will bring heartbreak and hardships, ultimately pushing her to reconcile her need for love and her desire for independence, and to embrace, at last, life‚Äôs infinite possibilities for change and happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look for special features inside.

  <description>The First Phone Call from Heaven tells the story of a small town on Lake Michigan that gets worldwide attention when its citizens start receiving phone calls from the afterlife. Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father, is determined to find out. An allegory about the power of belief--and a page-turner that will touch your soul--Albom's masterful storytelling has never been so moving and unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of The Five People You Meet in Heaven will recognize the warmth and emotion so redolent of Albom's writing, and those who haven't yet enjoyed the power of his storytelling, will thrill at the discovery of one of the best-loved writers of our time.</description>

  <description>The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered - fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningliess. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.</description>

  <description>Madelaine Hillyard is a world-famous heart surgeon at the top of her game. Her personal life is far less successful. A loving but overworked single mom, she is constantly at odds with her teenage daughter. At sixteen, Lina is confused, angry, and fast becoming a stranger to her mother‚Äîa rebel desperate to find the father who walked away before she was born. Complicating matters for Madelaine are the vastly different DeMarco brothers: While priest Francis DeMarco is always ready to lend a helping hand, his brother, Angel, long ago took on the role of bad boy. Years earlier Angel abandoned Madelaine‚Äîand fatherhood‚Äîto go in search of fame and fortune. His departure left Madelaine devastated, but now he reappears and seeks help from the very people he betrayed‚Äîas a patient in dire need. With Home Again, New York Times bestselling author Kristin Hannah has written a moving, powerful novel about the fragile threads that bind together our lives and the astonishing possibility of second chances.</description>

  <description>Years ago, Nora Bridge walked out on her marriage and left her daughters behind. Now she is a famous talk show host. Her daughter Ruby is a struggling comedienne. The two haven‚Äôt spoken in more than a decade. Then a scandal from Nora‚Äôs past is exposed, and Ruby is offered a fortune to write a tell-all about her mother. Reluctantly, she returns to the family house on Summer Island, a home filled with frayed memories of joy and heartache. Confronting a past that includes a never-forgotten love, a sick best friend, and a mother who has harbored terrible family secrets, Ruby finally begins to understand the complex ties that bind a mother and daughter‚Äîand the healing that comes with forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Now, as the holiday approaches, she is at a crossroads in her life; recently divorced and alone, she can‚Äôt summon the old enthusiasm for celebrating. So without telling anyone, she buys a ticket and boards a plane bound for the beautiful Pacific Northwest. When an unexpected detour takes her deep into the woods of the Olympic rainforest, Joy makes a bold decision to leave her ordinary life behind‚Äîto just walk away‚Äîand thus begins an adventure unlike any she could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Rain Valley, six-year-old Bobby O‚ÄôShea is facing his first Christmas without a mother. Unable to handle the loss, Bobby has closed himself off from the world, talking only to his invisible best friend. His father Daniel is beside himself, desperate to help his son cope. Yet when the little boy meets Joy, these two unlikely souls form a deep and powerful bond. In helping Bobby and Daniel heal, Joy finds herself again.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everything is as it seems in quiet Rain Valley, and in an instant, Joy‚Äôs world is ripped apart, and her heart is broken. On a magical Christmas Eve, a night of impossible dreams and unexpected chances, Joy must find the courage to believe in a love‚Äîand a family‚Äîthat can‚Äôt possibly exist, and go in search of what she wants . . . and the new life only she can find.</description>

She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived‚Äìand famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who‚Äôve long forgotten her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for details‚Äìproof they hope may free Ben‚ÄìLibby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she‚Äôll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club . . . and maybe she‚Äôll admit her testimony wasn‚Äôt so solid after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Libby‚Äôs search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby‚Äôs doomed family members‚Äìincluding Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started‚Äìon the run from a killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Scott Hahn, the bestselling author of The Lamb's Supper and Reasons to Believe, celebrates the touchstones of the Catholic life, guiding readers to a deeper faith through the Church's rites, customs, and traditional prayers. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Signs of Life &lt;/i&gt;is beloved author Scott Hahn's clear and comprehensive guide to the Biblical doctrines and historical traditions that underlie Catholic beliefs and practices. Devoting single chapters to each topic, the author takes the reader on a journey that illuminates the roots and significance of all things Catholic, including: the Sign of the Cross, the Mass, the Sacraments, praying with the saints, guardian angels, sacred images and relics, the celebration of Easter, Christmas, and other holidays, daily prayers, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the appealing conversational tone that has won him millions of devoted readers, Hahn presents the basic tenets of Church teachings, clears up common misconceptions about specific rituals and traditions, and responds thoughtfully to the objections raised about them. Each chapter concludes with loving, good-natured, inspiring advice on applying the Church's wisdom to everyday life.</description>

  <description>"Jesus Shock is the second in a series of short works on seminal concerns of the impact that Jesus Christ made in the world. The first work, The Philosophy of Jesus, explored philosophy in light of Jesus, rather than the other way around. The present work investigates the reception Jesus received both in His lifetime and continuously to the present time, not only from His enemies, but from His friends, a reception of shock, astonishment, even disgust." Jesus-Shock shows the reasons why to this day the name of "Jesus" stirs up controversy, even revulsion, in polite society. In the true spirit of ecumenism, it also points the way toward a true rapprochement among His modern-day disciples.</description>

  <description>In a memoir hailed for its searing candor and wit, Alice Sebold reveals how her life was utterly transformed when, as an eighteen-year-old college freshman, she was brutally raped and beaten in a park near campus. What propels this chronicle of her recovery is Sebold's indomitable spirit - as she struggles for understanding ("After telling the hard facts to anyone, from lover to friend, I have changed in their eyes"); as her dazed family and friends sometimes bungle their efforts to provide comfort and support; and as, ultimately, she triumphs, managing through grit and coincidence to help secure her attacker's arrest and conviction. In a narrative by turns disturbing, thrilling, and inspiring, Alice Sebold illuminates the experience of trauma victims even as she imparts wisdom profoundly hard-won: "You save yourself or you remain unsaved."</description>

  <description>Ira Levinson is in trouble. At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together ‚Äì how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can‚Äôt possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior‚Äôs life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death ‚Äì loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he‚Äôs keeping doesn‚Äôt destroy it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.</description>

  <description>Dr. Julia Cates was one of the country's preeminent child psychiatrists until a shocking tragedy ruined her career.

  <description>The success stories speak for themselves in this book from money maestro Dave Ramsey. Instead of promising the normal dose of quick fixes, Ramsey offers a bold, no-nonsense approach to money matters, providing not only the how-to but also a grounded and uplifting hope for getting out of debt and achieving total financial health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramsey debunks the many myths of money (exposing the dangers of cash advance, rent-to-own, debt consolidation) and attacks the illusions and downright deceptions of the American dream, which encourages nothing but overspending and massive amounts of debt. "Don't even consider keeping up with the Joneses," Ramsey declares in his typically candid style. "They're broke!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Total Money Makeover isn't theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to the heart of the money problems: you.</description>

  <description>Miles Ryan's life seemed to end the day his wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. Missy had been his first love, and Miles fervently believes she will be his last. As a deputy in the North Carolina town of New Bern, Miles Ryan not only grieves for Missy, but also longs to bring the unknown driver to justice. Then Miles meets Sarah Andrews. The second grade teacher of his son, Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it's her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she first sees in Jonah's eyes, and then his father's. Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other. Soon they are both laughing for the first time in years . . . and falling in love. Neither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret -- one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in . . . and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Award-winning author William Landay has written the consummate novel of an embattled family in crisis - a suspenseful, character-driven mystery that is also a spellbinding tale of guilt, betrayal, and the terrifying speed at which our lives can spin out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Barber has been an assistant district attorney in his suburban Massachusetts county for more than twenty years. He is respected in his community, tenacious in the courtroom, and happy at home with his wife, Laurie, and son, Jacob. But when a shocking crime shatters their New England town, Andy is blindsided by what happens next: His fourteen-year-old son is charged with the murder of a fellow student.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once, a long time ago, I walked down a night-darkened road called Firefly Lane, all alone, on the worst night of my life, and I found a kindred spirit. That was our beginning. More than thirty years ago. TullyandKate. You and me against the world. Best friends forever. But stories end, don‚Äôt they? You lose the people you love and you have to find a way to go on. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tully Hart has always been larger than life, a woman fueled by big dreams and driven by memories of a painful past. She thinks she can overcome anything until her best friend, Kate Ryan, dies. Tully tries to fulfill her deathbed promise to Kate--to be there for Kate‚Äôs children -- but Tully knows nothing about family or motherhood or taking care of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Marah Ryan is devastated by her mother‚Äôs death. Her father, Johnny, strives to hold the family together, but even with his best efforts, Marah becomes unreachable in her grief. Nothing and no one seems to matter to her . . . until she falls in love with a young man who makes her smile again and leads her into his dangerous, shadowy world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Hart--the woman who once called herself Cloud--is at the center of Tully‚Äôs tragic past. She repeatedly abandoned her daughter, Tully, as a child, but now she comes back, drawn to her daughter‚Äôs side at a time when Tully is most alone. At long last, Dorothy must face her darkest fear: Only by revealing the ugly secrets of her past can she hope to become the mother her daughter needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single, tragic choice and a middle-of-the-night phone call will bring these women together and set them on a poignant, powerful journey of redemption. Each has lost her way, and they will need one another--and maybe a miracle--to transform their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An emotionally complex, heart-wrenching novel about love, motherhood, loss, and new beginnings, &lt;i&gt;Fly Away&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that where there is life, there is hope, and where there is love, there is forgiveness.</description>

When Lexi Baill enters their lives, no one is more supportive than Jude. A former foster child with a dark past, Lexi quickly becomes Mia‚Äôs best friend. Then Zach falls in love with Lexi and the three become inseparable. But senior year of high school brings unexpected dangers and one night, Jude‚Äôs worst fears are confirmed: there is an accident. In an instant, her idyllic life is shattered and her close-knit community is torn apart. People‚Äîand Jude‚Äîdemand justice, and when the finger of blame is pointed, it lands solely on eighteen-year-old Lexi Baill. In a heartbeat, their love for each other will be shattered, the family broken. Lexi gives up everything that matters to her‚Äîthe boy she loves, her place in the family, the best friend she ever had‚Äîwhile Jude loses even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lexi returns, older and wiser, she demands a reckoning.

She must decide whether to remain broken or try to forgive both Lexi‚Ä¶and herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night Road&lt;/i&gt; is a vivid, emotionally complex novel that raises profound questions about motherhood, loss, identity, and forgiveness. It is an exquisite, heartbreaking novel that speaks to women everywhere about the things that matter most.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt;, the stunning debut novel from Kimberly McCreight, Kate's in the middle of the biggest meeting of her career when she gets the telephone call from Grace Hall, her daughter‚Äôs exclusive private school in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Amelia has been suspended, effective immediately, and Kate must come get her daughter‚Äînow. But Kate‚Äôs stress over leaving work quickly turns to panic when she arrives at the school and finds it surrounded by police officers, fire trucks, and an ambulance. By then it‚Äôs already too late for Amelia. And for Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An academic overachiever despondent over getting caught cheating has jumped to her death. At least that‚Äôs the story Grace Hall tells Kate. And clouded as she is by her guilt and grief, it is the one she forces herself to believe. Until she gets an anonymous text: She didn‚Äôt jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt; is about secret first loves, old friendships, and an all-girls club steeped in tradition. But, most of all, it‚Äôs the story of how far a mother will go to vindicate the memory of a daughter whose life she couldn‚Äôt save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Gillian Flynn's &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; will find &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt; just as gripping and surprising.</description>

Doctors tell Liam not to expect a recovery, but he believes that love can accomplish what medical science cannot. Daily he sits at Mikaela‚Äôs bedside, telling her stories of the precious life they have built together, hoping against hope that she will wake up. But then he discovers evidence of his wife‚Äôs secret past: a hidden first marriage to movie star Julian True.&lt;br /&gt; ¬†&lt;br /&gt; Desperate to bring Mikaela back at any cost, Liam knows that he must turn to Julian for help.

      <![CDATA[very easy read and a page turner! Some other reviewers said they thought it was predictable, but I would disagree. Granted, this is the first Kristin Hannah book I have read, so I am not familiar with her style...so it may be predictable if you have read her other books-I don't know. I enjoyed it...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; The instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, now in paperback: a moving tribute to female friendships, with the inspiring story of eleven girls and the ten women they became, from the coauthor of the million-copy bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Last Lecture&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As children, they formed a special bond, growing up in the small town of Ames, Iowa. As young women, they moved to eighth different states, yet they managed to maintain an extraordinary friendship that would carry them through college and careers, marriage and motherhood, dating and divorce, the death of a child, and the mysterious death of the eleventh member of their group. Capturing their remarkable story, &lt;i&gt;The Girls from Ames&lt;/i&gt; is a testament to the enduring, deep bonds of women as they experience life's challenges, and the power of friendship to overcome even the most daunting odds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The girls, now in their forties, have a lifetime of memories in common, some evocative of their generation and some that will resonate with any woman who has ever had a friend. &lt;i&gt;The Girls from Ames&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates how close female relationships can shape every aspect of women's lives-their sense of themselves, their choice of men, their need for validation, their relationships with their mothers, their dreams for their daughters-and reveals how such friendships thrive, rewarding those who have committed to them. With both universal events and deeply personal moments, it's a book that every woman will relate to and be inspired by.</description>

  <description>Some stories live forever . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage Singer is a baker. She works through the night, preparing the day‚Äôs breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mother‚Äôs death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sage‚Äôs grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite their differences, they see in each other the hidden scars that others can‚Äôt, and they become companions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes on the day that Josef confesses a long-buried and shameful secret‚Äîone that nobody else in town would ever suspect‚Äîand asks Sage for an extraordinary favor. If she says yes, she faces not only moral repercussions, but potentially legal ones as well. With her own identity suddenly challenged, and the integrity of the closest friend she‚Äôs ever had clouded, Sage begins to question the assumptions and expectations she‚Äôs made about her life and her family. When does a moral choice become a moral imperative? And where does one draw the line between punishment and justice, forgiveness and mercy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this searingly honest novel, Jodi Picoult gracefully explores the lengths we will go in order to protect our families and to keep the past from dictating the future</description>

  <description>Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies‚Ä¶&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That‚Äôs what seventeen-year-old Sky realizes after she meets Dean Holder. A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she‚Äôs never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he‚Äôs nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn‚Äôt at all who he‚Äôs been claiming to be. When the secrets he‚Äôs been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky‚Äôs life will change forever.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;On Mystic Lake&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful novel of love, loss, and the magic of friendship. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the "coolest girl in the world" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer's end they've become &lt;i&gt;TullyandKate.&lt;/i&gt; Inseparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Kristin Hannah's magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, &lt;i&gt;Firefly Lane&lt;/i&gt; is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn't know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she'll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she'll envy her famous best friend. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they've survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Firefly Lane&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who ever drank Boone's Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it's the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It's about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. &lt;i&gt;Firefly Lane &lt;/i&gt;is a story you'll never forget . . . one you'll want to pass on to your best friend.</description>

  <description>Adrift after her sister Bailey's sudden death, Lennie finds herself torn between quiet, seductive Toby‚ÄîBailey's boyfriend who shares her grief‚Äîand Joe, the new boy in town who bursts with life and musical genius. Each offers Lennie something she desperately needs... though she knows if the two of them collide her whole world will explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Lennie on this heartbreaking and hilarious journey of profound sorrow and mad love, as she makes colossal mistakes and colossal discoveries, as she traipses through band rooms and forest bedrooms and ultimately right into your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much a celebration of love as a poignant portrait of loss, Lennie's struggle to sort her own melody out of the noise around her is always honest, often uproarious, and absolutely unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I'm telling you why we broke up, Ed. I'm writing it in this letter, the whole truth of why it happened.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min Green and Ed Slaterton are breaking up, so Min is writing Ed a letter and giving him a box. Inside the box is why they broke up. Two bottle caps, a movie ticket, a folded note, a box of matches, a protractor, books, a toy truck, a pair of ugly earrings, a comb from a motel room, and every other item collected over the course of a giddy, intimate, heartbreaking relationship. Item after item is illustrated and accounted for, and then the box, like a girlfriend, will be dumped.</description>

  <description>When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy, his family was overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how "really, really big" God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, "Heaven is for Real" offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, "Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Heaven is for Real" will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering you the chance to see, and believe, like a child.</description>

  <description>From the award-winning New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Still Alice&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Left Neglected&lt;/i&gt;, comes a heartfelt novel about an accidental friendship that gives a grieving mother a priceless gift: the ability to understand the thoughts of her eight-year-old autistic son and make sense of his brief life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two women, each cast adrift by unforseen events in their lives, meet by accident on a Nantucket beach and are drawn into a friendship.&lt;br /&gt;Olivia is a young mother whose eight-year-old severely autistic son has recently died. Her marriage badly frayed by years of stress, she comes to the island in a trial separation to try and make sense of the tragedy of her Anthony‚Äôs short life.&lt;br /&gt;Beth, a stay-at-home mother of three, is also recently separated after discovering her husband‚Äôs long-term infidelity. In an attempt to recapture a sense of her pre-married life, she rekindles her passion for writing, determined to find her own voice again. But surprisingly, as she does so, Beth also find herself channeling the voice of an unknown boy, exuberant in his perceptions of the world around him if autistic in his expression‚Äîa voice she can share with Olivia‚Äî(is it Anthony?)‚Äîthat brings comfort and meaning to them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this fable, the first man on earth to count the hours becomes Father Time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inventor of the world's first clock is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who come after him seeking more days, more years. Eventually, with his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He returns to our world - now dominated by the hour-counting he so innocently began - and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: one a teenage girl who is about to give up on life, the other a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever. To save himself, he must save them both. And stop the world to do so.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne‚Äôs fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick‚Äôs clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn‚Äôt doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife‚Äôs head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media‚Äîas well as Amy‚Äôs fiercely doting parents‚Äîthe town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he‚Äôs definitely bitter‚Äîbut is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;--gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>Oh, the joys of pregnancy! There's the gassiness, constipation, queasiness, and exhaustion, the forgetfulness, crankiness, and the constant worry. Of course, no woman is spared the discomforts and humiliations of pregnancy, but most are too polite to complain or too embarrassed to talk about them. Not Jenny McCarthy! In the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling &lt;i&gt;Belly Laughs&lt;/i&gt;, actress and new mother Jenny McCarthy reveals the naked truth about the tremendous joys, the excruciating pains, and the unseemly disfigurement that go along with pregnancy. Never shy, frequently crude, and always laugh-out-loud funny, McCarthy covers it all in the grittiest of girlfriend detail. From morning sickness and hormonal rage, to hemorrhoids, pregnant sex, and the torture and sweet relief that is delivery, &lt;i&gt;Belly Laughs&lt;/i&gt; is must-read comic relief for anyone who is pregnant, who has ever been pregnant, is trying to get pregnant, or, indeed, has ever been born!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Building on the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Little Bee&lt;/i&gt;, Chris Cleave again writes with elegance, humor, and passion about friendship, marriage, parenthood, tragedy, and redemption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you sacrifice for the people you love? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KATE AND ZOE met at nineteen when they both made the cut for the national training program in track cycling‚Äîa sport that demands intense focus, blinding exertion, and unwavering commitment. They are built to exploit the barest physical and psychological edge over equally skilled rivals, all of whom are fighting for the last one tenth of a second that separates triumph from despair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now at thirty-two, the women are facing their last and biggest race: the 2012 Olympics. Each wants desperately to win gold, and each has more than a medal to lose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate is the more naturally gifted, but the demands of her life have a tendency to slow her down. Her eight-year-old daughter Sophie dreams of the Death Star and of battling alongside the Rebels as evil white blood cells ravage her personal galaxy‚Äîshe is fighting a recurrence of the leukemia that nearly killed her three years ago. Sophie doesn‚Äôt want to stand in the way of her mum‚Äôs Olympic dreams, but each day the dark forces of the universe seem to be massing against her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted and self-sacrificing Kate knows her daughter is fragile, but at the height of her last frenzied months of training, might she be blind to the most terrible prognosis? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intense, aloof Zoe has always hovered on the periphery of real human companionship, and her compulsive need to win at any cost has more than once threatened her friendship with Kate‚Äîand her own sanity. Will she allow her obsession, and the advantage she has over a harried, anguished mother, to sever the bond they have shared for more than a decade? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Echoing the adrenaline-fueled rush of a race around the Velodrome track, &lt;i&gt;Gold &lt;/i&gt;is a triumph of superbly paced, heart-in-throat storytelling. With great humanity and glorious prose, Chris Cleave examines the values that lie at the heart of our most intimate relationships, and the choices we make when lives are at stake and everything is on the line.</description>

      <![CDATA[I thought this was a decent book. It was an easy read and held my interest-I wanted to keep going to see how the relationship was going to be. There were some typos/grammatical errors which surprised me, but nothing to make it impossible to figure out what was trying to be said.]]>

  <description>Marian Caldwell is a thirty-six year old television producer, living her dream in New York City. With a fulfilling career and satisfying relationship, she has convinced everyone, including herself, that her life is just as she wants it to be. But one night, Marian answers a knock on the door . . . only to find Kirby Rose, an eighteen-year-old girl with a key to a past that Marian thought she had sealed off forever. From the moment Kirby appears on her doorstep, Marian‚Äôs perfectly constructed world‚Äîand her very identity‚Äîwill be shaken to its core, resurrecting ghosts and memories of a passionate young love affair that threaten everything that has come to define her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the precocious and determined Kirby, the encounter will spur a process of discovery that ushers her across the threshold of adulthood, forcing her to re-evaluate her family and future in a wise and bittersweet light. As the two women embark on a journey to find the one thing missing in their lives, each will come to recognize that where we belong is often where we least expect to find ourselves‚Äîa place that we may have willed ourselves to forget, but that the heart remembers forever.</description>

  <description>One choice can transform you‚Äîor it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves‚Äîand herself‚Äîwhile grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable‚Äîand even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.</description>

  <description>Lina is just like any other fifteen-year-old Lithuanian girl in 1941. She paints, she draws, she gets crushes on boys. Until one night when Soviet officers barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they've known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin's orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lina finds solace in her art, meticulously--and at great risk--documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father's prison camp to let him know they are still alive. It is a long and harrowing journey, spanning years and covering 6,500 miles, but it is through incredible strength, love, and hope that Lina ultimately survives. &lt;i&gt;Between Shades of Gray&lt;/i&gt; is a novel that will steal your breath and capture your heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Sequel to the Beloved #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Friday Night Knitting Club&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sequel to the number-one &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Friday Night Knitting Club, KNIT TWO&lt;/i&gt; returns to Walker and Daughter, the Manhattan knitting store founded by Georgia Walker and her young daughter, Dakota. Dakota is now an eighteen-year-old freshman at NYU, running the little yarn shop part-time with help from the members of the Friday Night Knitting Club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Drawn together by the sense of family the club has created, the knitters rely on one another as they struggle with new challenges: for Catherine, finding love after divorce; for Darwin, the hope for a family; for Lucie, being both a single mom and a caregiver for her elderly mother; and for seventy something Anita, a proposal of marriage from her sweetheart, Marty, that provokes the objections of her grown children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the clubÔøΩs projectsÔøΩan afghan, baby booties, a wedding coatÔøΩare pieced together, so is their understanding of the patterns underlying the stresses and joys of being mother, wife, daughter, and friend. Because it isnÔøΩt the difficulty of the garment that makes you a great knitter: itÔøΩs the care and attention you bring to the craftÔøΩas well as how you adapt to surprises.</description>

  <description>Once a week, an eclectic group of women comes together at a New York City yarn shop to work on their latest projects - and share the stories of their lives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of Walker and Daughter is the shop's owner, Georgia, who is overwhelmed with juggling the store and single-handedly raising her teenage daughter. Happy to escape the demands of her life, she looks forward to her Friday Night Knitting Club, where she and her friends - Anita, Peri, Darwin, Lucie, and K.C. - exchange knitting tips, jokes, and their deepest secrets. But when the man who once broke Georgia's heart suddenly shows up, demanding a role in their daughter's life, her world is shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Georgia's friends are there for encouragement, sharing their own tales of intimacy, heartbreak, and miracle making. And when the unthinkable happens, these women will discover that what they've created isn't just a knitting club; its a sisterhood.</description>

  <description>Meghan McCain came to prominence as the straight-talking, progressive daughter of the 2008 Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain. And her profile has only risen since the election ended in favor of the other guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Meghan so appealing? As a new role model for young, creative, and vocal members of the GOP, she's unafraid to mix it up and speak her mind. In &lt;i&gt;Dirty Sexy Politics&lt;/i&gt; she takes a hard look at the future of her party. She doesn't shy away from serious issues and her raucous humor and down-to-earth style keep her positions accessible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this witty, candid, and boisterous book, Meghan takes us deep behind the scenes of the campaign trail. She steals campaign signs in New Hampshire, tastes the nightlife in Nashville, and has a strange encounter with Laura and Jenna Bush at the White House. Along the way, she falls in love with America‚Äîwhile seeing how far the Republican Party has veered from its core values of freedom, honesty, and individuality. In &lt;i&gt;Dirty Sexy Politics&lt;/i&gt;, Meghan McCain gives us a true insider's account of life on a campaign trail.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I didn't decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . ."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work‚Äîfirst as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn't enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows &lt;i&gt;Ally McBeal&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/i&gt;, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women's health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, &lt;i&gt;Unbearable Lightness&lt;/i&gt; is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.</description>

      <![CDATA[very interesting read overall. It was crazy to see what measures Portia took to achieve what she believed to be 'skinny and healthy'. I felt the epilogue was dragged out, but the rest of the book was moving at a quick pace. It just took a while for me to read because of other things going on. ]]>

  <description>There are many words to describe Michael J. Fox: Actor. Husband. Father. Activist. But readers of &lt;em&gt;Always Looking Up&lt;/em&gt; will soon add another to the list: Optimist. Michael writes about the hard-won perspective that helped him see challenges as opportunities. Instead of building walls around himself, he developed a personal policy of engagement and discovery: an emotional, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual outlook that has served him throughout his struggle with Parkinson's disease. Michael's exit from a very demanding, very public arena offered him the time-and the inspiration-to open up new doors leading to unexpected places. One door even led him to the center of his own family, the greatest destination of all. &lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The last ten years, which is really the stuff of this book, began with such a loss: my retirement from Spin City. I found myself struggling with a strange new dynamic: the shifting of public and private personas. I had been Mike the actor, then Mike the actor with PD. Now was I just Mike with PD Parkinson's had consumed my career and, in a sense, had become my career. But where did all of this leave Me? I had to build a new life when I was already pretty happy with the old one.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Always Looking Up&lt;/em&gt; is a memoir of this last decade, told through the critical themes of Michael's life: work, politics, faith, and family. The book is a journey of self-discovery and reinvention, and a testament to the consolations that protect him from the ravages of Parkinson's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the humor and wit that captivated fans of his first book, &lt;em&gt;Lucky Man&lt;/em&gt;, Michael describes how he became a happier, more satisfied person by recognizing the gifts of everyday life.</description>

As she takes on her mother's pattern, she learns from her family and friends that there was much more history in these stitches than she had anticipated, and that to build on her mother's legacy, Dakota must allow herself to become the woman she truly desires to be...</description>

  <description>The highly anticipated second book in the Matched trilogy! &lt;br /&gt;Chasing down an uncertain future, Cassia makes her way to the Outer Provinces in pursuit of Ky--taken by Society to his certain death--only to find that he has escaped into the majestic, but treacherous, canyons. On this wild frontier are glimmers of a different life . . . and the enthralling promise of rebellion. But even as Cassia sacrifices everything to reunite with Ky, ingenious surproses from Xander may change the game. On the edge of Society, nothing is as expected, and crosses and double crosses make Cassia's path more twisted than ever. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In the Society, officials decide. Who you love. Where you work. When you die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassia has always trusted their choices. It‚Äôs hardly any price to pay for a long life, the perfect job, the ideal mate. So when her best friend appears on the Matching screen, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is the one‚Ä¶until she sees another face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black. Now Cassia is faced with impossible choices: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she‚Äôs known and a path no one else has ever dared follow‚Äîbetween perfection and passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matched&lt;/i&gt; is a story for right now and storytelling with the resonance of a classic.</description>

  <description>Announcing a brand new, cover-to-cover revision of America's pregnancy bible. &lt;i&gt;What to Expect When You're Expecting&lt;/i&gt; is a perennial New York Times bestseller and one of USA Today's 25 most influential books of the past 25 years. It's read by more than 90% of pregnant women who read a pregnancy book‚Äîthe most iconic, must-have book for parents-to-be, with over 14.5 million copies in print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now comes the Fourth Edition, a new book for a new generation of expectant moms‚Äîfeaturing a new look, a fresh perspective, and a friendlier-than-ever voice. It's filled with the most up-to-date information reflecting not only what's new in pregnancy, but what's relevant to pregnant women. Heidi Murkoff has rewritten every section of the book, answering dozens of new questions and including loads of new asked-for material, such as a detailed week-by-week fetal development section in each of the monthly chapters, an expanded chapter on pre-conception, and a brand new one on carrying multiples. More comprehensive, reassuring, and empathetic than ever, the Fourth Edition incorporates the most recent developments in obstetrics and addresses the most current lifestyle trends (from tattooing and belly piercing to Botox and aromatherapy). There's more than ever on pregnancy matters practical (including an expanded section on workplace concerns), physical (with more symptoms, more solutions), emotional (more advice on riding the mood roller coaster), nutritional (from low-carb to vegan, from junk food‚Äìdependent to caffeine-addicted), and sexual (what's hot and what's not in pregnant lovemaking), as well as much more support for that very important partner in parenting, the dad-to-be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overflowing with tips, helpful hints, and humor (a pregnant woman's best friend), this new edition is more accessible and easier to use than ever before. It's everything parents-to-be have come to expect from What to Expect...only better?.</description>

  <description>From bestselling Printz Award-winning author Libba Bray, the story of a plane of beauty pageant contestants that crashes on a desert island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teen beauty queens. A Lost-like island. Mysteries and dangers. No access to e-mail. And the spirit of fierce, feral competition that lives underground in girls, a savage brutality that can only be revealed by a journey into the heart of non-exfoliated darkness. Oh, the horror, the horror! Only funnier. With evening gowns. And a body count.</description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian‚Äôs singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all‚Äîlove, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian‚Äôs opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana‚Äôs deepest fears turn to reality.</description>

  <description>Daunted by the singular sexual tastes and dark secrets of the beautiful, tormented young entrepreneur Christian Grey, Anastasia Steele has broken off their relationship to start a new career with a Seattle publishing house. But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, Anastasia cannot resist. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and Anastasia learns more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven, and demanding Fifty Shades. While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront her anger and envy of the women who came before her and make the most important decision of her life. Erotic, sparkling and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades Darker&lt;/i&gt; is the irresistibly addictive second part of the Fifty Shades trilogy.</description>

  <description>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana‚Äôs quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too‚Äîbut on his own terms.&lt;br /&gt;¬†&lt;br /&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey‚Äôs singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success‚Äîhis multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family‚ÄîGrey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey‚Äôs secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life ... as only a dog could tell it.</description>

  <description>Bestselling author Kristin Hannah explores the intimate landscape of a troubled marriage with this provocative and timely portrait of a husband and wife, in love and at war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a distance, Michael and Joleen Zarkades seem to have it all: a solid marriage, two exciting careers, and children they adore. But after twelve years together, the couple has lost their way; they are unhappy and edging toward divorce. Then the Iraq war starts. An unexpected deployment will tear their already fragile family apart, sending one of them deep into harm‚Äôs way and leaving the other at home, waiting for news. When the worst happens, each must face their darkest fear and fight for the future of their family. An intimate look at the inner landscape of a disintegrating marriage and a dramatic exploration of the price of war on a single American family, Home Front is a provocative and timely portrait of hope, honor, loss, forgiveness, and the elusive nature of love.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Something Blue,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Baby Proof&lt;/i&gt; delivers another captivating novel about women and the choices that define them. This is the story for anyone who has ever wondered: How can I truly love the one I'm with when I can't forget the one who got away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen and Andy's first year of marriage doesn't just seem perfect, it is perfect. There is no question how deep their devotion is, and how naturally they bring out the best in each other. But one fateful afternoon, Ellen runs into Leo for the first time in eight years. Leo, the one who brought out the worst in her. Leo, the one who left her heartbroken with no explanation. Leo, the one she could never quite forget. When his reappearance ignites long-dormant emotions, Ellen begins to question whether the life she's living is the one she's meant to live. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love the One You're With&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful story about one woman at the crossroads of true love and real life.</description>

  <description>Tessa Russo is the mother of two young children and the wife of a renowned pediatric surgeon. Despite her own mother's warnings, Tessa has recently given up her career to focus on her family and the pursuit of domestic happiness.¬†From the outside, she seems destined to live a charmed life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valerie Anderson is an attorney and single mother to six-year-old Charlie‚Äîa boy who has never known his father. After too many disappointments, she has given up on romance‚Äîand even to some degree, friendships‚Äîbelieving that it is always safer not to expect too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although both women live in the same Boston suburb, the two have relatively little in common aside from a fierce love for their children.¬† But one night, a tragic accident causes their lives to converge in ways no one could have imagined.¬† &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In alternating, pitch-perfect points of view, Emily Giffin creates a moving, luminous story of good people caught in untenable circumstances.¬†Each being tested in ways they never thought possible. Each questioning everything they once believed. And each ultimately discovering what truly matters most.</description>

  <description>From the author of the smash hits &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Something Blue&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel that explores the question: is there ever a deal-breaker when it comes to true love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes . . . a baby carriage? Isn't that what all women want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so for Claudia Parr. And just as she gives up on finding a man who feels the same way, she meets warm, wonderful Ben. Things seem too good to be true when they fall in love and agree to buck tradition with a satisfying, child-free marriage. Then the unexpected occurs: one of them has a change of heart. One of them wants children after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the witty, heartfelt story about what happens to the perfect couple when they suddenly want different things. It's about feeling that your life is set and then realizing that nothing is as you thought it was‚Äîand that there is no possible compromise. It's about deciding what is most important in life, and taking chances to get it. But most of all, it's about the things we will do‚Äîand won't do‚Äîfor love.</description>

  <description>Sarah Nickerson is like any other career-driven supermom in Welmont, the affluent Boston suburb where she leads a hectic but charmed life with her husband Bob, faithful nanny, and three children - Lucy, Charlie, and nine-month-old Linus. &lt;p&gt;Between recruiting the best and brightest minds as the vice president of human resources at Berkley Consulting; shuttling the kids to soccer, day care, and piano lessons; convincing her son‚Äôs teacher that he may not, in fact, have ADD; and making it home in time for dinner, it‚Äôs a wonder this over-scheduled, over-achieving Harvard graduate has time to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A self-confessed balloon about to burst, Sarah miraculously manages every minute of her life like an air traffic controller. Until one fateful day, while driving to work and trying to make a phone call, she looks away from the road for one second too long. In the blink of an eye, all the rapidly moving parts of her jam-packed life come to a screeching halt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A traumatic brain injury completely erases the left side of her world, and for once, Sarah relinquishes control to those around her, including her formerly absent mother. Without the ability to even floss her own teeth, she struggles to find answers about her past and her uncertain future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as she wills herself to regain her independence and heal, Sarah must learn that her real destiny - her new, true life - may in fact lie far from the world of conference calls and spreadsheets. And that a happiness and peace greater than all the success in the world is close within reach, if only she slows down long enough to notice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed this book, especially being a therapist. It shows the reality a patient experiences after having a traumatic brain injury. Most of the roles the occupational and physical therapists had in the book were true with a few exceptions. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? The 'dream sequence...]]>

A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was the Great Depression and for Jacob the circus was both his salvation and a living hell. There he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but brutal animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an untrainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this group of misfits was one of love and trust, and ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.&lt;br /&gt;--publisher's description</description>

  <description>Three ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't. &lt;br /&gt;(jacket flap)</description>

  <description>To five-year-old-Jack, Room is the world....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in the inventive, funny, and poignant voice of Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience‚Äîand a powerful story of a mother and son whose love lets them survive the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough ... not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Still Alice&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling debut novel about a 50-year-old woman's sudden descent into early onset Alzheimer's disease, written by first-time author Lisa Genova, who holds a Ph. D in neuroscience from Harvard University. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Howland, happily married with three grown children and a house on the Cape, is a celebrated Harvard professor at the height of her career when she notices a forgetfulness creeping into her life. As confusion starts to cloud her thinking and her memory begins to fail her, she receives a devastating diagnosis: early onset Alzheimer's disease. Fiercely independent, Alice struggles to maintain her lifestyle and live in the moment, even as her sense of self is being stripped away. In turns heartbreaking, inspiring and terrifying, Still Alice captures in remarkable detail what's it's like to literally lose your mind...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not my favorite out of the three in this series. I felt this one dragged on/wasn't as much as a page turner as the other two. I didn't like the ending either-didn't end how *I* wanted it to. However, I am anxious to see what they do on the big screen with these next two books.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue‚ÄîCandor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is‚Äîshe can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are‚Äîand where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debut author Veronica Roth bursts onto the literary scene with the first book in the Divergent series‚Äîdystopian thrillers filled with electrifying decisions, heartbreaking betrayals, stunning consequences, and unexpected romance.</description>

      <![CDATA[very easy read and a page turner! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there were a few 'story lines' I found predictable (see previous review). However, I would recommend this book to others. ]]>

  <description>As he is driving home from a minister's conference, Baptist minister Don Piper collides with a semi-truck that crosses into his lane. He is pronounced dead at the scene. For the next 90 minutes, Piper experiences heaven where he is greeted by those who had influenced him spiritually. He hears beautiful music and feels true peace. &lt;br /&gt;Back on earth, a passing minister who had also been at the conference is led to pray for Don even though he knows the man is dead. Piper miraculously comes back to life and the bliss of heaven is replaced by a long and painful recovery. &lt;br /&gt;For years Piper kept his heavenly experience to himself. Finally, however, friends and family convinced him to share his remarkable story.</description>

  <description>Mackenzie Allen Philips' youngest daughter, Missy, has been abducted during a family vacation, and evidence that she may have been brutally murdered is found in an abandoned shack deep in the Oregon wilderness. Four years later in the midst of his &lt;i&gt;"Great Sadness,"&lt;/i&gt; Mack receives a suspicious note, apparently from God, inviting him back to that shack for a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against his better judgment he arrives at the shack on a wintry afternoon and walks back into his darkest nightmare.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes &lt;i&gt;The Pillars of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17229203-the-pillars-of-the-earth" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alternate Cover Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Last year, Annabel was "the girl who has everything" ‚Äî at least that's the part she played in the television commercial for Kopf's Department Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, she's the girl who has nothing: no best friend because mean-but-exciting Sophie dropped her, no peace at home since her older sister became anorexic, and no one to sit with at lunch. Until she meets Owen Armstrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tall, dark, and music-obsessed, Owen is a reformed bad boy with a commitment to truth-telling. With Owen's help, maybe Annabel can face what happened the night she and Sophie stopped being friends.</description>

  <description>"Every family is a ghost story..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch Albom mesmerized readers around the world with his number one &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers, &lt;i&gt;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie&lt;/i&gt;. Now he returns with a beautiful, haunting novel about the family we love and the chances we miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For One More Day&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a mother and a son, and a relationship that covers a lifetime and beyond. It explores the question: What would you do if you could spend one more day with a lost loved one? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child, Charley "Chick" Benetto was told by his father, "You can be a mama's boy or a daddy's boy, but you can't be both." So he chooses his father, only to see the man disappear when Charley is on the verge of adolescence. &lt;br /&gt;Decades later, Charley is a broken man. His life has been crumbled by alcohol and regret. He loses his job. He leaves his family. He hits bottom after discovering his only daughter has shut him out of her wedding. And he decides to take his own life.&lt;br /&gt;He makes a midnight ride to his small hometown, with plans to do himself in. But upon failing even to do that, he staggers back to his old house, only to make an astonishing discovery. His mother, who died eight years earlier, is still living there, and welcomes him home as if nothing ever happened..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the one "ordinary" day so many of us yearn for, a chance to make good with a lost parent, to explain the family secrets, and to seek forgiveness. Somewhere between this life and the next, Charley learns the astonishing things he never knew about his mother and her sacrifices. And he tries, with her tender guidance, to put the crumbled pieces of his life back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Albom's inspiring characters and masterful storytelling, readers will newly appreciate those whom they love and may have thought they'd lost in their own lives. &lt;i&gt;For One More Day&lt;/i&gt; is a book for anyone in a family, and will be cherished by Albom's millions of fans worldwide.</description>

  <description>Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Have a Little Faith&lt;/i&gt;, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds--two men, two faiths, two communities--that will inspire readers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albom's first nonfiction book since &lt;i&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith&lt;/i&gt; begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have a Little Faith&lt;/i&gt; is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of the phenomenal #1 New York Times bestseller Tuesdays with Morrie, a novel that explores the unexpected connections of our lives, and the idea that heaven is more than a place; it's an answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim. Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part. To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>A lot of professors give talks titled 'The Last Lecture'. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.</description>

Now, having left her father behind in Chicago for dreams of art school and marriage to an ambitious young doctor, she finds herself with a child of her own. But her mother's absence and shameful memories of her past force her to doubt whether she could ever be capable of bringing joy and meaning into the life of her child, gifts her own mother never gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harvesting the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is written with astonishing clarity and evocative detail, convincing in its depiction of emotional pain, love, and vulnerability, and recalls the writing of Alice Hoffman and Kristin Hannah.

  <description>When odd, supernatural events plague the town of Comtosook, a ghost hunter is hired by the developer to help convince the residents that there's nothing spiritual about the property. An intricate tale of love, haunting memories, and renewal. (An interview about the book is included below the reading guide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Sometimes I wonder....Can a ghost find you, if she wants to?" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An intricate tale of love, haunting memories, and renewal, Second Glance begins in current-day Vermont, where an old man puts a piece of land up for sale and unintentionally raises protest from the local Abenaki Indian tribe, who insist it's a burial ground. When odd, supernatural events plague the town of Comtosook, a ghost hunter is hired by the developer to help convince the residents that there's nothing spiritual about the property. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Ross Wakeman, a suicidal drifter who has put himself in mortal danger time and again. He's driven his car off a bridge into a lake. He's been mugged in New York City and struck by lightning in a calm country field. Yet despite his best efforts, life clings to him and pulls him ever deeper into the empty existence he cannot bear since his fianc√©e's death in a car crash eight years ago. Ross now lives only for the moment he might once again encounter the woman he loves. But in Comtosook, the only discovery Ross can lay claim to is that of Lia Beaumont, a skittish, mysterious woman who, like Ross, is on a search for something beyond the boundary separating life and death. Thus begins Jodi Picoult's enthralling and ultimately astonishing story of love, fate, and a crime of passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailed by critics as a "master" storyteller (Washington Post), Picoult once again "pushes herself, and consequently the reader, to think about the unthinkable" (Denver Post). Second Glance, her eeriest and most engrossing work yet, delves into a virtually unknown chapter of American history -- Vermont's eugenics project of the 1920s and 30s -- to provide a compelling study of the things that come back to haunt us -- literally and figuratively. Do we love across time, or in spite of it?</description>

  <description>Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue. Addie, desperate for answers, must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jack St. Bride arrives by chance in the sleepy New England town of Salem Falls, he decides to reinvent himself. Tall, blond, and handsome, Jack was once a beloved teacher and soccer coach at a girls' prep school -- until a student's crush sparked a powder keg of accusation and robbed him of his reputation. Now, working for minimum wage washing dishes for Addie Peabody at the Do-Or-Diner, Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With ghosts of her own haunting her, Addie Peabody is as cautious around men as Jack St. Bride is around women. But as this unassuming stranger steps smoothly into the diner's daily routine, she finds him fitting just as comfortably inside her heart -- and slowly, a gentle, healing love takes hold between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet planting roots in Salem Falls may prove fateful for Jack. Amid the white-painted centuries-old churches, a quartet of bored, privileged teenage girls have formed a coven that is crossing the line between amusement and malicious intent. Quick to notice the attractive new employee at Addie's diner, the girls turn Jack's world upside down with a shattering allegation that causes history to repeat itself -- and forces Jack to proclaim his innocence once again. Suddenly nothing in Salem Falls is as it seems: a safe haven turns dangerous, an innocent girl meets evil face-to-face, a dishwasher with a Ph.D. is revealed to be an ex-con. As Jack's hidden past catches up with him, the seams of this tiny town begin to tear, and the emerging truth becomes a slippery concept written in shades of gray. Now Addie, desperate for answers, must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.</description>

  <description>When Willow is born with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, her parents are devastated--she will suffer hundreds of broken bones as she grows, a lifetime of pain. Every expectant parent will tell you that they don't want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O'Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they'd been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of "luckier" parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy? But it's all worth it because Willow is, funny as it seems, perfect. She's smart as a whip, on her way to being as pretty as her mother, kind, brave, and for a five-year-old an unexpectedly deep source of wisdom. Willow is Willow, in sickness and in health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything changes, though, after a series of events forces Charlotte and her husband to confront the most serious what-ifs of all. What if Charlotte had known earlier of Willow's illness? What if things could have been different? What if their beloved Willow had never been born? To do Willow justice, Charlotte must ask herself these questions and one more. What constitutes a valuable life?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When your son can't look you in the eye...does that mean he's guilty?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways. But he has a special focus on one subject - forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he's usually right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jacob's small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob's behaviors are hallmark Asperger's, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms: &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Did Jacob commit murder?&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>For eighteen years the Hartes and the Golds have lived next door to each other, sharing everything from Chinese food to chicken pox to carpool duty‚Äîthey've grown so close it seems they have always been a part of each other's lives. Parents and children alike have been best friends, so it's no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily's friendship blossoms into something more. They've been soul mates since they were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is ready for the appalling truth: Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head. There's a single unspent bullet in the gun that Chris took from his father's cabinet‚Äîa bullet that Chris tells police he intended for himself. But a local detective has doubts about the suicide pact that Chris has described.</description>

  <description>In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?</description>

  <description>THE BEST OF ME is the heart-rending story of two small-town former high school sweethearts from opposite sides of the tracks. Now middle-aged, they've taken wildly divergent paths, but neither has lived the life they imagined . . . and neither can forget the passionate first love that forever altered their world. When they are both called back to their hometown for the funeral of the mentor who once gave them shelter, they will be forced to confront the choices each has made, and ask whether love can truly rewrite the past.</description>

      <![CDATA[Oh Nicholas Sparks...you did it again!! I thought I had predicted how the story would end, but of course-several curve balls!!! I really like the last few Nicholas Sparks books. They aren't 100% romance...have some suspense thrown in! I would put this as one of my top 5 favorite Sparks Books!]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author comes a captivating love story filled with suspense and mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past. Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo's empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jeremy Marsh is the ultimate New Yorker: handsome, almost always dressed in black, and part of the media elite. An expert on debunking the supernatural with a regular column in &lt;i&gt;Scientific American,&lt;/i&gt; he's just made his first appearance on national TV. When he receives a letter from the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, about ghostly lights that appear in a legend-shrouded cemetery, he can't resist driving down to investigate. Here, in this tightly knit community, Lexie Darnell runs the town's library, just as her mother did before the accident that left Lexie an orphan. Disappointed by past relationships, including one that lured her away from home, she is sure of one thing: her future is in Boone Creek, close to her grandmother and all the other people she loves. Jeremy expects to spend a quick week in "the sticks" before speeding back to the city. But from the moment he sets eyes on Lexie, he is intrigued and attracted to this beautiful woman who speaks with a soft drawl and confounding honesty. And Lexie, while hesitating to trust this outsider, finds herself thinking of Jeremy more than she cares to admit. Now, if they are to be together, Jeremy Marsh must make a difficult choice: return to the life he knows, or do something he's never done before--take a giant leap of faith. A story about taking chances and following your heart, &lt;i&gt;True Believer&lt;/i&gt; will make you, too, believe in the miracle of love.</description>

  <description>There are a few things Jeremy Marsh was sure he‚Äôd never do: he‚Äôd never leave New York City; never give his heart away after barely surviving one failed marriage; and never become a parent. Now Jeremy is living in the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, engaged to Lexie Darnell, the love of his life, and anticipating the start of their family. But just as his life seems to be settling into a blissful pattern, a mysterious and disturbing e-mail sets off a chain of events that will change the course of this young couple‚Äôs relationship. How well do we really know the ones we love? How do we handle the inevitable doubts, fears concerning parenthood, and stumbling blocks that are sometimes placed in our way? Continuing the story of the young couple introduced in Sparks‚Äôs bestselling True Believer, this novel captures all the heartbreak, tension, romance and surprises of those who are newly wed. An astonishing tale about the love between a man and a woman and between a parent and a child, At First Sight is about endings that bring new beginnings . . . tragedies that lead to unexpected joy . . . and, most of all, the magic of everlasting love.</description>

  <description>When U.S. Marine Logan Thibault finds a photograph of a smiling young woman half-buried in the dirt during his third tour of duty in Iraq, his first instinct is to toss it aside. Instead, he brings it back to the base for someone to claim, but when no one does, he finds himself always carrying the photo in his pocket. Soon Thibault experiences a sudden streak of luck‚Äîwinning poker games and even surviving deadly combat that kills two of his closest buddies. Only his best friend, Victor, seems to have an explanation for his good fortune: the photograph‚Äîhis lucky charm.&lt;br /&gt;Back home in Colorado, Thibault can‚Äôt seem to get the photo‚Äîand the woman in it‚Äîout of his mind. Believing that she somehow holds the key to his destiny, he sets out on a journey across the country to find her, never expecting the strong but vulnerable woman he encounters in Hampton, North Carolina‚ÄîElizabeth, a divorced mother with a young son‚Äîto be the girl he‚Äôs been waiting his whole life to meet. Caught off guard by the attraction he feels, Thibault keeps the story of the photo, and his luck, a secret. As he and Elizabeth embark upon a passionate and all-consuming love affair, the secret he is keeping will soon threaten to tear them apart‚Äîdestroying not only their love, but also their lives.&lt;br /&gt;Filled with tender romance and terrific suspense, The Lucky One is Nicholas Sparks at his best‚Äîan unforgettable story about the surprising paths our lives often take and the power of fate to guide us to true and everlasting love.</description>

  <description>Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina. In full pursuit of the good life -- boating, swimming, and regular barbecues with his good-natured buddies -- he holds the vague conviction that a serious relationship with a woman would only cramp his style. That is, until Gabby Holland moves in next door. Despite his attempts to be neighborly, the appealing redhead seems to have a chip on her shoulder about him...and the presence of her longtime boyfriend doesn't help. Despite himself, Travis can't stop trying to ingratiate himself with his new neighbor, and his persistent efforts lead them both to the doorstep of a journey that neither could have foreseen. Spanning the eventful years of young love, marriage and family, The Choice ultimately confronts us with the most heartwrenching question of all: how far would you go to keep the hope of love alive?</description>

  <description>When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks; but there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BookPage calls Nicholas Sparks, "a modern master of fateful love stories," and his phenomenal bestsellers- The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember- have made him one of America's most beloved storytellers. Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rescue &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.</description>

  <description>Julie Barenson's young husband left her two unexpected gifts before he died: a Great Dane puppy named Singer and the promise that he would always be watching over her. Now, four years have passed. Still living in the small town of Swansboro, North Carolina, 29-year-old Julie is emotionally ready to make a commitment to someone again. But who? Should it be Richard Franklin, the handsome, sophisticated engineer who treats her like a queen? Or Mike Harris, the down-to-earth nice guy who was her husband's best friend? Choosing one of them should bring her more happiness than she's had in years. Instead, Julie is soon fighting for her life in a nightmare spawned by a chilling deception and jealousy so poisonous that it has become a murderous desire</description>

  <description>From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Nicholas Sparks comes a tender story of hope and joy; of sacrifice and forgiveness -- a moving reminder that love is possible at any age, at any time, and often comes when we least expect it. At forty-five, Adrienne Willis must rethink her entire life when her husband abandons her for a younger woman. Reeling with heartache and in search of a respite, she flees to the small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina to tend to a friend's inn for the weekend. But when a major storm starts moving in, it appears that Adrienne's perfect getaway will be ruined -- until a guest named Paul Flanner arrives. At fifty-four, Paul has just sold his medical practice and come to Rodanthe to escape his own shattered past. Now, with the storm closing in, two wounded people will turn to each other for comfort -- and in one weekend set in motion feelings that will resonate throughout the rest of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did You Know?---&lt;br /&gt;The main characters' names were Christmas presents to Nicholas's in-laws (Paul and Adrienne)?&lt;br /&gt;This was Nicholas's first book to debut at #1?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>After thirty years of marriage, Wilson Lewis, son-in-law of Allie and Noah Calhoun (of The Notebook), is forced to admit that the romance has gone out of his marriage. Desperate to win back his wife, Jane's, heart, he must figure out how to make her fall in love with him... again. Despite the shining example of Allie and Noah's marriage, Wilson is himself a man unable to easily express his emotions. A successful estate attorney, he has provided well for his family, but now, with his daughter's upcoming wedding, he is forced to face the fact that he and Jane have grown apart and he wonders if she even loves him anymore. Wilson is sure of one thing--his love for his wife has only deepened and intensified over the years. Now, with the memories of his in-laws' magnificent fifty-year love affair as his guide, Wilson struggles to find his way back into the heart of the woman he adores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did You Know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wedding is a follow-up to The Notebook?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wedding was inspired by a few unnamed couples that Nicholas knows well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel is set in the North Carolina town in which Nicholas now lives?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. An achingly tender story about the enduring power of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so begins one of the most poignant and compelling love stories you will ever read...The Notebook</description>
