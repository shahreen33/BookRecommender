  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The #1 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling coauthor of James Patterson’s Michael Bennett series, Michael Ledwidge, launches an adrenaline-fueled globe-trotting thriller series for fans of James Patterson, Lee Child and David Baldacci.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a Gulf Stream jet goes down in the Bahamas carrying a fortune in cash and ill-gotten diamonds, expat diving instructor Michael Gannon is the only person on the scene. Assuming himself the beneficiary of a drug deal gone bad, Gannon thinks he’s home free with the sudden windfall until he realizes he forgot to ask one simple question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who were the six dead men on the plane?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gannon soon learns the answer to that fateful question as he is thrust into an increasingly complex and deadly game of cat and mouse with a group of the world’s most powerful and dangerous men who will stop at nothing to catch him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the walls close in, Gannon reveals a few secrets of his own. Before he retired to the islands, Gannon had another life, one with a lethal set of skills that he must now call back to the surface if he wants to make it out alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a decade-long James Patterson writing partner, Michael Ledwidge is a pro at writing pacey, in-the-moment prose; tightly choreographed action set pieces; and plot twists that drop at exactly the right moment. With this novel, he kicks off an unstoppable, gripping new thriller series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I will probably be clutching &lt;i&gt;Flowers in the Attic &lt;/i&gt;in my gnarled hands on my deathbed.” —GILLIAN FLYNN, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The twisted, beloved Dollanganger legend began two generations before Corrine Foxworth locked away her children in &lt;i&gt;Flowers in the Attic&lt;/i&gt;. The second book in a new prequel story arc, &lt;i&gt;Out of the Attic &lt;/i&gt;explores the Dollanganger family saga by traveling back decades to when the clan’s wicked destiny first took root.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Married to the handsome, wealthy Garland Foxworth following a wildfire romance, and an unexpected pregnancy, young Corrine Dixon finds her life very different from how she imagined it. Often alone in the mansion of Foxworth Hall, she can practically feel the ancestors’ judgment of her as insufficient—as &lt;i&gt;not a Foxworth&lt;/i&gt;. Stern portraits glare at her from the walls, and the servants treat her strangely. Nothing in the vast place is truly hers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even her son, Malcolm Foxworth, born in the luxe Swan Room and instantly whisked away to a wet nurse, feels alien to her. With a husband alternately absent and possessively close, Corrine doesn’t yet realize that she’s barely scratched the surface of what lies beneath Foxworth Hall’s dark facade and the family that guards its legacies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the fortieth anniversary celebration of &lt;i&gt;Flowers in the Attic&lt;/i&gt;, and ten new Lifetime movies in the past five years, there has never been a better time to experience the forbidden world of V.C. Andrews.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Mitch Albom returns to nonfiction for the first time in more than a decade in this poignant memoir that celebrates Chika, a young Haitian orphan whose short life would forever change his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika’s arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, “No one in Haiti can help you with.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika’s boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. &lt;em&gt;Finding Chika&lt;/em&gt; is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed—a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Prince himself comes the brilliant coming-of-age-and-into-superstardom story of one of the greatest artists of all time—featuring never-before-seen photos, original scrapbooks and lyric sheets, and the exquisite memoir he began writing before his tragic death.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince was a musical genius, one of the most talented, beloved, accomplished, popular, and acclaimed musicians in history. He was also a startlingly original visionary with an imagination deep enough to whip up whole worlds, from the sexy, gritty funk paradise of “Uptown” to the mythical landscape of Purple Rain to the psychedelia of “Paisley Park.” But his most ambitious creative act was turning Prince Rogers Nelson, born in Minnesota, into Prince, the greatest pop star of his era. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Beautiful Ones&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how Prince became Prince—a first-person account of a kid absorbing the world around him and then creating a persona, an artistic vision, and a life, before the hits and fame that would come to define him. The book is told in four parts. The first is composed of the memoir he was writing before his tragic death, pages that brings us into Prince’s childhood world through his own lyrical prose. The second part takes us into Prince’s early years as a musician, before his first album released, through a scrapbook of Prince’s writing and photos. The third section shows us Prince’s evolution through candid images that take us up to the cusp of his greatest achievement, which we see in the book’s fourth section: his original handwritten treatment for Purple Rain—the final stage in Prince’s self-creation, as he retells the autobiography we’ve seen in the first three parts as a heroic journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is framed by editor Dan Piepenbring’s riveting and moving introduction about his short but profound collaboration with Prince in his final months—a time when Prince was thinking deeply about how to reveal more of himself and his ideas to the world, while retaining the mystery and mystique he’d so carefully cultivated—and annotations that provide context to each of the book’s images. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This work is not just a tribute to Prince, but an original and energizing literary work, full of Prince’s ideas and vision, his voice and image, his undying gift to the world.</description>

  <description>After finally taking down Torres, her mother’s merciless killer, Reagan and Luke have two targets on their backs and are forced into hiding. With new names, looks, and cover stories, they’re living quiet, “safe” lives, but revenge comes at a steep price. Reagan’s actions continue to haunt the pair and put the people they love in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Reagan discovers her best friend Harper is on the verge of being kidnapped, she and Luke defy Black Angel orders and risk blowing their cover to save their friend. After the rescue attempt goes wrong, the three friends must go on the run with an army of assassins hot on their trail and the list of trust-worthy Black Angels getting smaller and smaller. Will they make it out alive? And at what cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-paced and suspenseful, this is the explosive finale of Kristen Orlando's &lt;i&gt;Black Angel Chronicles &lt;/i&gt;series.</description>

  <description>Time doesn’t heal all wounds. Sometimes they just scab over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Haunted by memories of a failed marriage, trauma surgeon Barbie Anderson escapes to her hometown for a fresh start. But the quaint community of Pumpkin Rest has memories and failures of its own that should stay buried. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Barbie runs into ex-con biker Jake Chambers, he stirs up anger and resentment in her that she doesn’t want to face. He reminds her of the one man she’s never gotten over and dredges up decades-old heartache. With his rugged criminal exterior and gentlemanly demeanor, the silver fox may have the other women in Pumpkin Rest falling at his feet, but not Barbie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She refuses to let her guard down and have her heart broken again. When a series of revelations come tumbling forth, Barbie is forced to confront her past and trust Pumpkin Rest’s most sought-after bachelor where she’ll soon learn that love wears many faces. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will secrets from the past destroy their future or will old wounds finally heal, allowing her to love again?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Dyson's incisive analysis of JAY-Z's brilliance not only offers a brief history of hip-hop's critical place in American culture but also hints at how we can best move forward." —Questlove&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JAY-Z: Made in America is the fruit of Michael Eric Dyson’s decade of teaching the work of one of the greatest poets this nation has produced, as gifted a wordsmith as Walt Whitman, Robert Frost and Rita Dove. But as a rapper, he’s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he’s been for so long. &lt;br /&gt;This book wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z's career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he’s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z’s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. In many ways, this is JAY-Z’s America as much as it’s Pelosi’s America, or Trump’s America, or Martin Luther King’s America. JAY-Z has given this country a language to think with and words to live by.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eff This Meditation&lt;/i&gt; is a Shamata (mindfulness-awareness) practice rooted in radical compassion for self presented in 108 tips, tricks, and ideas. They are all centered on the idea that, as humans, we might not be "finished"; but we are complete. Everything you need to attain enlightenment is already contained within you—and you can use meditation to connect with it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes, yes. You already know that you should meditate, and that meditation will make you happier and healthier. But you're tired and irritated and every time you try to meditate, your mind races and you can't stop thinking about that jerk at work. You've tried meditating, but are pretty sure that you're bad at it. If this describes you, then this might be just what you need. This is not a joke—this is &lt;b&gt;real meditation, for real life&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Using &lt;b&gt;humor, love, and a deep respect for the foundational teachings of Buddhism&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eff This Meditation&lt;/i&gt; is a practice designed to get you out of that storm swirling around in your head, and into your throne (if even for a moment). Learn to&lt;b&gt; celebrate the small victories&lt;/b&gt; in life with a "To Done" list. &lt;b&gt;Release yourself from phone addiction&lt;/b&gt; with a digital detox plan. &lt;b&gt;Get your body out of stress mode&lt;/b&gt; by practicing diaphragmatic breathing. Be transported and &lt;b&gt;open your heart&lt;/b&gt; with a pick-me-up playlist. These are just a few of the &lt;b&gt;simple strategies that will help you find your center&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Take any path into the practice that works for you. &lt;b&gt;Choose your meditations by considering:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amount of time it will take&lt;/b&gt;: one minute, an hour, or much longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How you're feeling&lt;/b&gt;: stressed out, anxious, overwhelmed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How you're coping&lt;/b&gt;: food, scrolling, bingeing on TV or movies&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of overall ways you can dive into the book:&lt;br /&gt;Read it all the way through&lt;br /&gt;Flip through and mark what seems interesting&lt;br /&gt;Try all of the techniques, one by one&lt;br /&gt;Grab the book in a panic and thumb through until something sticks out&lt;br /&gt;Open the book to a random page and do that thing&lt;br /&gt;However the eff you want; it’s your book now</description>

  <description>A deeply personal collection of essays exploring Nigerian-American author Bassey Ikpi’s experiences navigating Bipolar II and anxiety throughout the course of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bassey Ikpi was born in Nigeria in 1976. Four years later, she and her mother joined her father in Stillwater, Oklahoma —a move that would be anxiety ridden for any child, but especially for Bassey. Her early years in America would come to be defined by tension: an assimilation further complicated by bipolar II and anxiety that would go undiagnosed for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time she was in her early twenties, Bassey was a spoken word artist and traveling with HBO's Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam, channeling her experiences into art. But something wasn’t right—beneath the façade of the confident performer, Bassey’s mental health was in a precipitous decline, culminating in a breakdown that resulted in hospitalization and a diagnosis of Bipolar II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to learn from her experiences—and share them with others—Bassey became a mental health advocate and has spent the fourteen years since her diagnosis examining the ways mental health is inextricably intertwined with every facet of ourselves and our lives. Viscerally raw and honest, the result is an exploration of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of who we are—and the ways, as honest as we try to be, each of these stories can also be a lie.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Mitch Albom returns to nonfiction for the first time in more than a decade in this poignant memoir that celebrates Chika, a young Haitian orphan whose short life would forever change his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika’s arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, “No one in Haiti can help you with.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika’s boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. &lt;em&gt;Chika&lt;/em&gt; is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed—a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In this game, even winning can be deadly...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it--teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy's sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it's naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way--a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they're alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn't give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she's going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect herself and her family and save the life she's built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can't beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson's trademark humor, &lt;em&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/em&gt; explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I am a girl but most days I feel like a question mark.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeda June Kirkland is eleven years old, adopted, and black. Her parents and big sister are white, and even though she loves her family very much, Makeda often feels left out. When Makeda's family moves from Maryland to New Mexico, she leaves behind her best friend, Lena―the only other adopted black girl she knows―for a new life. In New Mexico, everything is different. At home, Makeda’s sister is too cool to hang out with her anymore and at school, she can’t seem to find one real friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through it all, Makeda can’t help but wonder: &lt;i&gt;What would it feel like to grow up with a family that looks like me?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through singing, dreaming, and writing secret messages back and forth with Lena, Makeda might just carve a small place for herself in the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Diane Chamberlain comes an irresistible new novel. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina, 2018: Morgan Christopher's life has been derailed. Taking the fall for a crime she did not commit, she finds herself serving a three-year stint in the North Carolina Women's Correctional Center. Her dream of a career in art is put on hold—until a mysterious visitor makes her an offer that will see her released immediately. Her assignment: restore an old post office mural in a sleepy southern town. Morgan knows nothing about art restoration, but desperate to leave prison, she accepts. What she finds under the layers of grime is a painting that tells the story of madness, violence, and a conspiracy of small town secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina, 1940: Anna Dale, an artist from New Jersey, wins a national contest to paint a mural for the post office in Edenton, North Carolina. Alone in the world and desperate for work, she accepts. But what she doesn't expect is to find herself immersed in a town where prejudices run deep, where people are hiding secrets behind closed doors, and where the price of being different might just end in murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to Anna Dale? Are the clues hidden in the decrepit mural? Can Morgan overcome her own demons to discover what exists beneath the layers of lies?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the beloved author of &lt;i&gt;Memoirs of an Imaginary Friend &lt;/i&gt;comes a wonderful new novel about a struggling man, written entirely in lists. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Daniel Mayrock loves his wife Jill…more than anything. &lt;br /&gt;2. Dan quit his job and opened a bookshop.&lt;br /&gt;3. Jill is ready to have a baby. &lt;br /&gt;4. Dan is scared; the bookshop isn’t doing well. Financial crisis is imminent. &lt;br /&gt;5. Dan hasn’t told Jill about their financial trouble. He’s ashamed. &lt;br /&gt;6. Then Jill gets pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heartfelt story is about the lengths one man will go to and the risks he will take to save his family. But Dan doesn’t just want to save his failing bookstore and his family’s finances—he wants to become someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dan wants to do something special. &lt;br /&gt;2. He’s a man who is tired of feeling ordinary. &lt;br /&gt;3. He’s sick of feeling like a failure. &lt;br /&gt;4. Of living in the shadow of his wife’s deceased first husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan is also an obsessive list maker, and his story unfolds entirely in his lists, which are brimming with Dan’s hilarious sense of humor, unique world-view, and deeply personal thoughts. When read in full, his lists paint a picture of a man struggling to be a man, a man who has reached a point where he’s willing to anything for the love (and soon-to-be new love) of his life.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;What happens when your worst fear comes true?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her only daughter has just gone away to college, and Maggie O'Farrell knows she's turning into one of those helicopter parents she used to mock. Worrying constantly, texting more than she should, even occasionally dropping by the campus "just to say hi." But Maggie can't shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen to Emma. And then, just as Maggie starts to relax, her daughter disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clues are disturbing. An empty dorm room where Emma was supposedly living. A mysterious boy described as Future Husband in her phone. Dormmates who seem more sinister than friendly. As Maggie combs over the campus looking for signs of her daughter, she learns more about Emma's life than she ever thought possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Simmons delivers another gripping novel in &lt;em&gt;Where She Went&lt;/em&gt;, an unforgettable story of letting go and the secrets that surface when the person keeping them is gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A viral video reveals a teen’s dark family history, leaving him to reckon with his heritage, legacy, and identity in this fiery, conversation-starting novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eran Sharon knows nothing of his father except that he left when Eran was a baby. Now a senior in high school and living with his protective but tight-lipped mother, Eran is a passionate young man deeply interested in social justice and equality. When he learns that the Houston police have launched a program to increase traffic stops, Eran organizes a peaceful protest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a heated moment at the protest goes viral, and a reporter connects the Sharon family to a tragedy fifteen years earlier — and asks if Eran is anything like his father, a supposed terrorist. Soon enough, Eran is wondering the same thing, especially when the people he’s gone to school and temple with for years start to look at him differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timely, powerful, and full of nuance, Rafi Mittlefehldt’s sophomore novel confronts the prejudices, fears, and strengths of family and community, striking right to the heart of what makes us who we are.</description>

  <description>Kim and Christopher Jenkins are getting on each other’s nerves. They love their daughter and their hometown of Ivyhurst but their family vision is a little off track. Kim wants a home like the ones she sees on cable DIY shows. Chris wants to work more than be at home with his family. And despite the fact that they both hold down jobs, they can’t seem to make ends meet. &lt;br /&gt;Now their hometown of Ivyhurst is showing signs of stress, too. Which begs the question, what does a loving marriage look like when the realities of life set in? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Living Love is the prequel and introduction to the Ivyhurst Series of novellas which takes readers into the love, happiness, and angst of the erstwhile Ivyhurst residents. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Ivyhurst Series &lt;br /&gt;The novellas in The Ivyhurst Series are standalone, sweet romances as much about the love of the community as love between the couples. While each story is complete, they are much more enjoyable—and make more sense—when read in order. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of a legendary designer who pioneered high-end streetwear, from a storefront in Harlem to the red carpet in Hollywood, dressing everyone from Salt-N-Pepa and Eric B. &amp;amp; Rakim to Beyoncé and Jay-Z along the way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his now-legendary store on 125th Street in Harlem, Dapper Dan pioneered high-end streetwear in the early 1980s, remixing classic luxury-brand logos into his own flamboyant designs. But before reinventing fashion, he was a hungry boy with holes in his shoes, a teen who daringly gambled drug dealers out of their money, a young man in a prison cell who found nourishment in books, and, finally, a designer who broke barriers to outfit a whos-who of music, sport, and crime world celebrities in looks that went on to define an era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns playful, poignant, and inspiring, and featuring two incredible eight-page color photo inserts, including the only existing, never-before-seen images of the notorious Mike Tyson-Mitch Green street fight, Dapper Dan's memoir is a high-stakes coming-of-age story, spanning more than seventy years and set against the backdrop of an ever-evolving America.</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When 16-year-old poetry blogger Tessa Dickinson is involved in a car accident and loses her eyesight for 100 days, she feels like her whole world has been turned upside-down. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrified that her vision might never return, Tessa feels like she has nothing left to be happy about. But when her grandparents place an ad in the local newspaper looking for a typist to help Tessa continue writing and blogging, an unlikely answer knocks at their door: Weston Ludovico, a boy her age with bright eyes, an optimistic smile…and no legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how angry and afraid Tessa is feeling, Weston thinks he can help her. But he has one condition — no one can tell Tessa about his disability. And because she can’t see him, she treats him with contempt: screaming at him to get out of her house and never come back. But for Weston, it’s the most amazing feeling: to be treated like a normal person, not just a sob story. So he comes back. Again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa spurns Weston’s “obnoxious optimism”, convinced that he has no idea what she’s going through. But Weston knows exactly how she feels and reaches into her darkness to show her that there is more than one way to experience the world. As Tessa grows closer to Weston, she finds it harder and harder to imagine life without him — and Weston can’t imagine life without her. But he still hasn’t told her the truth, and when Tessa’s sight returns he’ll have to make the hardest decision of his life: vanish from Tessa’s world…or overcome his fear of being seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;100 Days of Sunlight&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant and heartfelt novel by author Abbie Emmons. If you like sweet contemporary romance and strong family themes then you’ll love this touching story of hope, healing, and getting back up when life knocks you down.</description>

  <description>A clash between Cherokee Indians and their former African slaves comes to a head in the tribal town of Feather Falls. On the same day Sput Louie McClendon is evicted by reviled town tycoon Goliah Lynch, her husband mysteriously vanishes. Has he fallen prey to bushwhackers or timber thieves? Or is Lynch behind his disappearance? Alone and desperate, Sput Louie turns to town elder Two Bird for help, but with a rift developing between Indians and Negroes, are his intentions pure? As Sput Louie's frantic search for her husband intensifies, she stumbles onto a dark twisted family secret—one that could not only have devastating implications for her, but the entire town of Feather Falls. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Vincent, Jules, Sylvie, and Sam are ruthlessly ambitious high-flyers working in the lucrative world of Wall Street finance where deception and intimidation thrive. Getting rich is all that matters, and they'll do anything to reach the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they are ordered to participate in a corporate team-building exercise that requires them to escape from a locked elevator, dark secrets of their team begin to be laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest mystery to solve in this lethal game: What happened to Sara Hall? Once a young shining star—”now gone but not forgotten”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no longer a game. &lt;br /&gt;They’re fighting for their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;One of “The 17 Best Summer Reads of 2019” by &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the summer of 1968, a provocative and devastating novel of individual lives caught in the grips of violent history—a timely and poignant story that reverberates with the power of Alice Walker’s &lt;em&gt;Meridian&lt;/em&gt; and Ntozake Shange’s &lt;em&gt;Betsey Browne.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of a sweltering summer shaped by the tragic assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Bobby Kennedy, race riots, political protests, and the birth of Black power, three coeds from New York City—Zelda Livingston, Veronica Cook, and Daphne Brooks—pack into Veronica’s new Ford Fairlane convertible, bound for Atlanta and their last year at Spelman College. It is the beginning a journey that will change their lives irrevocably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlikely friends from vastly different backgrounds, the trio has been inseparable since freshman year. Zelda, serious and unyielding, the heir of rebellious slaves and freedom riders, sees the world in black versus white. Veronica, the privileged daughter of a refined, wealthy family, strongly believes in integration and racial uplift. Daphne lives with a legacy of loss—when she was five years old, her black mother committed suicide and her white father abandoned her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because they will be going their separate ways after graduation, Zelda, Veronica, and Daphne intend to make lasting memories on this special trip. Though they are young and carefree, they aren’t foolish. Joined by Veronica’s family friend Daniel, they rely on the &lt;em&gt;Motorist Green Book&lt;/em&gt; to find racially friendly locations for gas, rest, and food. Still, with the sun on their cheeks, the wind in their hair, and Motown on the radio, the girls revel in their freedom. Yet as the miles fly by, taking them closer to the Mason-Dixon line, tension begins to rise and the conversation turns serious when Daphne shares a horrifying secret about her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they hit Washington, D.C., the joyous trip turns dark. In Virginia they barely escape a desperate situation when prison guards mistake Daniel for an escapee. Further south they barely make it through a sundown town. When the car breaks down in Georgia they are caught up in a racially hostile situation that leaves a white person dead and one of the girls holding the gun.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Teagan Frost, sh*t just got real.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teagan Frost is having a hard time keeping it together. Sure, she's got telekinetic powers—a skill that the government is all too happy to make use of, sending her on secret break-in missions that no ordinary human could carry out. But all she really wants to do is kick back, have a beer, and pretend she's normal for once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then a body turns up at the site of her last job—murdered in a way that only someone like Teagan could have pulled off. She's got 24 hours to clear her name—and it's not just her life at stake. If she can't unravel the conspiracy in time, her hometown of Los Angeles will be in the crosshairs of an underground battle that's on the brink of exploding...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Full of imagination, wit and random sh*t flying through the air, this insane adventure from an irreverent new voice will blow your tiny mind.&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Lily’s gone.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Someone took her.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Unless she was she never there…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little girl has gone missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily was last seen being tucked into bed by her adoring mother, Nova. But the next morning, the bed is empty except for a creepy toy rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has Nova’s abusive ex stolen his “little bunny” back for good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Officer Ellie James assumes this is a clear custody battle. Until she discovers that there are no pictures of the girl and her drawers are full of unused toys and brand new clothes that have never been worn…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Ellie searching for a missing child who doesn’t actually exist?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Reluctant Royals series returns with a good girl searching for the life that’s not too big, and not too small, and the bad boy prince who might be just right for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya Jerami fled Thesolo for the glitz and glamour of NYC but discovered that her Prince Charming only exists in her virtual dating games. When Nya returns home for a royal wedding, she accidentally finds herself up close and personal—in bed—with the real-life celebrity prince who she loves to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Johan von Braustein, the red-headed step-prince of Liechtienbourg, acting as paparazzi bait is a ruse that protects his brother—the heir to the throne—and his own heart. When a royal referendum threatens his brother’s future, a fake engagement is the perfect way to keep the cameras on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya and Johan both have good reasons to avoid love, but as desires are laid bare behind palace doors, they must decide if their fake romance will lead to a happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Memory makes reality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what New York City cop Barry Sutton is learning as he investigates the devastating phenomenon the media has dubbed False Memory Syndrome—a mysterious affliction that drives its victims mad with memories of a life they never lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what neuroscientist Helena Smith believes. It’s why she’s dedicated her life to creating a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Barry searches for the truth, he comes face-to-face with an opponent more terrifying than any disease—a force that attacks not just our minds but the very fabric of the past. And as its effects begin to unmake the world as we know it, only he and Helena, working together, will stand a chance at defeating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can they make a stand when reality itself is shifting and crumbling all around them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of &lt;i&gt;The Twelve Tribes of Hattie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Turner House&lt;/i&gt;, an intimately told story about a woman living by her own rules and the rural community that struggles to understand her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azalea “Knot” Centre is determined to live life as she pleases. Let the people of West Mills say what they will; the neighbors’ gossip won’t keep Knot from what she loves best: cheap moonshine, nineteenth-century literature, and the company of men. And yet, Knot is starting to learn that her freedom comes at a high price. Alone in her one-room shack, ostracized from her relatives and cut off from her hometown, Knot turns to her neighbor, Otis Lee Loving, in search of some semblance of family and home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otis Lee is eager to help. A lifelong fixer, Otis Lee is determined to steer his friends and family away from decisions that will cause them heartache and ridicule. After his failed attempt as a teenager to help his older sister, Otis Lee discovers a possible path to redemption in the chaos Knot brings to his doorstep. But while he’s busy trying to fix Knot’s life, Otis Lee finds himself powerless to repair the many troubles within his own family, as the long-buried secrets of his troubled past begin to come to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in an African American community in rural North Carolina from 1941 to 1987, &lt;i&gt;In West Mills&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent, big-hearted small-town story about family, friendship, storytelling, and the redemptive power of love.</description>

  <description>She's the seduction expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women contact her to take over their love lives. She steps in when they're lost, she's supposed to succeed where they failed. She handles their single status, their relationships, their breakups, and very often their partners' affairs. Her job is a life priority, she spends most of her time at the office or between two flights in business class and the fact of having a sports car that can reach one hundred kilometers in less than six seconds often make her feel like a superheroine in service to women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, take her card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll see, it's much better than spending holidays in St Barts.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A gripping journey.”—&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The highly anticipated memoir from hip-hop icon Rick Ross chronicles his coming of age amid Miami’s crack epidemic, his star-studded controversies and his unstoppable rise to fame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Ross is an indomitable presence in the music industry, but few people know his full story. Now, for the first time, Ross offers a vivid, dramatic and unexpectedly candid account of his early childhood, his tumultuous adolescence and his dramatic ascendancy in the world of hip-hop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born William Leonard Roberts II, Ross grew up “across the bridge,” in a Miami at odds with the glitzy beaches, nightclubs and yachts of South Beach. In the aftermath of the 1980 race riots and the Mariel boatlift, Ross came of age at the height of the city’s crack epidemic, when home invasions and execution-style killings were commonplace. Still, in the midst of the chaos and danger that surrounded him, Ross flourished, first as a standout high school football player and then as a dope boy in Carol City’s notorious Matchbox housing projects. All the while he honed his musical talent, overcoming setback after setback until a song called “Hustlin’” changed his life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the making of “Hustlin’” to his first major label deal with Def Jam, to the controversy surrounding his past as a correctional officer and the numerous health scares, arrests and feuds he had to transcend along the way, &lt;em&gt;Hurricanes&lt;/em&gt; is a revealing portrait of one of the biggest stars in the rap game, and an intimate look at the birth of an artist.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Beverly Jenkins' compelling new series follows a Northern woman south in the chaotic aftermath of the Civil War...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valinda Lacey's mission in the steamy heart of New Orleans is to help the newly emancipated community survive and flourish. But soon she discovers that here, freedom can also mean danger. When thugs destroy the school she has set up and then target her, Valinda runs for her life—and straight into the arms of Captain Drake LeVeq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an architect from an old New Orleans family, Drake has a deeply personal interest in rebuilding the city. Raised by strong women, he recognizes Valinda's determination. And he can't stop admiring—or wanting—her. But when Valinda's father demands she return home to marry a man she doesn't love, her daring rebellion draws Drake into an irresistible intrigue.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A cheerful manifesto on removing obstacles between yourself and the income of your dreams.” —&lt;i&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt;, a life-changing guide to making the kind of money you’ve only ever dreamed of&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass at Making Money&lt;/i&gt; will launch you past the fears and stumbling blocks that have kept financial success beyond your reach. Drawing on her own transformation—over just a few years—from a woman living in a converted garage with tumbleweeds blowing through her bank account to a woman who travels the world in style, Jen Sincero channels the inimitable sass and practicality that made &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt; an indomitable bestseller. She combines hilarious personal essays with bite-size, aha concepts that unlock earning potential and get real results.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learn to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • Uncover what's holding you back from making money&lt;br /&gt; • Give your doubts, fears, and excuses the heave-ho&lt;br /&gt; • Relate to money in a new (and lucrative) way&lt;br /&gt; • Shake up the cocktail of creation &lt;br /&gt; • Tap into your natural ability to grow rich&lt;br /&gt; • Shape your reality—stop playing victim to circumstance&lt;br /&gt; • Get as wealthy as you wanna be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This book truly crystallizes the concept that financial abundance is an inside job—in that it all begins with your mindset—and Sincero gets serious (in the funniest ways possible) about helping you identify your particular limiting beliefs surrounding money.” —&lt;i&gt;PopSugar&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When 16-year-old poetry blogger Tessa Dickinson is involved in a car accident and loses her eyesight for 100 days, she feels like her whole world has been turned upside-down. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrified that her vision might never return, Tessa feels like she has nothing left to be happy about. But when her grandparents place an ad in the local newspaper looking for a typist to help Tessa continue writing and blogging, an unlikely answer knocks at their door: Weston Ludovico, a boy her age with bright eyes, an optimistic smile…and no legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how angry and afraid Tessa is feeling, Weston thinks he can help her. But he has one condition — no one can tell Tessa about his disability. And because she can’t see him, she treats him with contempt: screaming at him to get out of her house and never come back. But for Weston, it’s the most amazing feeling: to be treated like a normal person, not just a sob story. So he comes back. Again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa spurns Weston’s “obnoxious optimism”, convinced that he has no idea what she’s going through. But Weston knows exactly how she feels and reaches into her darkness to show her that there is more than one way to experience the world. As Tessa grows closer to Weston, she finds it harder and harder to imagine life without him — and Weston can’t imagine life without her. But he still hasn’t told her the truth, and when Tessa’s sight returns he’ll have to make the hardest decision of his life: vanish from Tessa’s world…or overcome his fear of being seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;100 Days of Sunlight&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant and heartfelt novel by author Abbie Emmons. If you like sweet contemporary romance and strong family themes then you’ll love this touching story of hope, healing, and getting back up when life knocks you down.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Dream&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is twenty, beautiful, dirt-poor, and hoping for a better life for her infant daughter when LuAnn Tyler is offered the gift of a lifetime, a $100 million lottery jackpot. All she has to do is change her identity and leave the U.S. forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Killer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's an offer she dares to refuse...until violence forces her hand and thrusts her into a harrowing game of high-stakes, big-money subterfuge. It's a price she won't fully pay...until she does the unthinkable and breaks the promise that made her rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Winner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For if LuAnn Tyler comes home, she will be pitted against the deadliest contestant of all: the chameleonlike financial mastermind who changed her life. And who can take it away at will...</description>

  <description>She’s cold, narcissistic, conceited and she has no redeeming qualities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t care, she’s gifted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t care, she's the seduction expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women contact her to take over their love lives. She steps in when they're lost, she's supposed to succeed where they failed. She handles their single status, their relationships, their breakups, and very often their partners' affairs. Her job is a life priority, she spends most of her time at the office or between two flights in business class and the fact of having a sports car that can reach one hundred kilometers in less than six seconds often make her feel like a superheroine in service to women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, take her card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll see, it's much better than spending holidays in St Barts.</description>

  <description>Everyone has a purpose. And, according to Oprah Winfrey, “Your real job in life is to figure out as soon as possible what that is, who you are meant to be, and begin to honor your calling in the best way possible.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That journey starts right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her latest audiobook, &lt;i&gt;The Path Made Clear, &lt;/i&gt;Oprah shares what she sees as a guide for activating your deepest vision of yourself, offering the framework for creating not just a life of success, but one of significance. The audiobook’s ten chapters are organized to help you recognize the important milestones along the road to self-discovery, laying out what you really need in order to achieve personal contentment, and what life’s detours are there to teach us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oprah opens each chapter by sharing her own key lessons and the personal stories that helped set the course for her best life. She then brings together wisdom and insights from luminaries in a wide array of fields, inspiring listeners to consider what they’re meant to do in the world and how to pursue it with passion and focus. These renowned figures share the greatest lessons from their own journeys toward a life filled with purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Path Made Clear &lt;/i&gt;provides listeners with a valuable resource for achieving a life lived in service of your calling – whatever it may be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This gripping conclusion to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Crank trilogy features a refreshed look and a trade paperback trim size.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter, Autumn, and Summer—three of Kristina Snow’s five children—live in different homes, with different guardians and different last names. They share only a predisposition for addiction and a host of troubled feelings toward the mother who barely knows them, a mother who has been riding with the monster, crank, for twenty years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter is nineteen, angry, getting by in college with a job at a radio station, a girlfriend he loves in the only way he knows how, and the occasional party. He's struggling to understand why his mother left him, when he unexpectedly meets his rapist father, and things get even more complicated. Autumn lives with her single aunt and alcoholic grandfather. When her aunt gets married, and the only family she’s ever known crumbles, Autumn’s compulsive habits lead her to drink. And the consequences of her decisions suggest that there’s more of Kristina in her than she’d like to believe. Summer doesn’t know about Hunter, Autumn, or their two youngest brothers, Donald and David. To her, family is only abuse at the hands of her father’s girlfriends and a slew of foster parents. Doubt and loneliness overwhelm her, and she, too, teeters on the edge of her mother’s notorious legacy. As each searches for real love and true family, they find themselves pulled toward the one person who links them together—Kristina, Bree, mother, addict. But it is in each other, and in themselves, that they find the trust, the courage, the hope to break the cycle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in three voices and punctuated by news articles chronicling the family’s story, FALLOUT is the stunning conclusion to the trilogy begun by CRANK and GLASS, and a testament to the harsh reality that addiction is never just one person’s problem.</description>

  <description>Crank. Glass. Ice. Crystal. Whatever you call it, it's all the same: a monster. And once it's got hold of you, this monster will never let you go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Kristina thinks she can control it. Now with a baby to care for, she's determined to be the one deciding when and how much, the one calling the shots. But the monster is too strong, and before she knows it, Kristina is back in its grips. She needs the monster to keep going, to face the pressures of day-to-day life. She needs it to feel alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Once again the monster takes over Kristina's life and she will do anything for it, including giving up the one person who gives her the unconditional love she craves -- her baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The sequel to &lt;i&gt;Crank&lt;/i&gt;, this is the continuing story of Kristina and her descent back to hell. Told in verse, it's a harrowing and disturbing look at addiction and the damage that it inflicts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Giving up murder for Lent won’t be easy . . . &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With the Lenten season fast approaching, Sister Louise “Lou” LaSalle looks forward to a final day of indulgence before giving up her favorite sweets. But one Briar Coast resident won’t get the chance to repent. Opal Lorrie, the mayor’s director of finance, was just found in the parking lot of the Board of Ed--with a broken neck. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The sheriff’s deputies are calling the apparent slip-and-fall a freak accident. But Opal was driving her boss’s car and wearing her boss’s red wool coat. Mayor Heather Stanley has been receiving threatening letters and is clearly the real target. Offering her sanctuary could put the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Hermione of Ephesus at risk, but how can Sister Lou turn her back on a neighbor in need? Aided by her loyal sleuthing partners—her well-connected nephew Chris and reporter Shari Henson—Sister Lou must confront the mayor’s myriad detractors during this critical election year. And as the first day of April nears, it’s up to her to unmask an unrepentant killer who has everyone fooled.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How do you solve a problem like Marianna?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This year's Advent retreat has been booked for the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Hermione of Ephesus at the pastoral Briar Coast Cabin Resorts in New York. But when the combative Sister Marianna practically loses her religion arguing over minor details with resort co-owner Autumn Tassler, Sister Louise “Lou” LaSalle blessedly steps in as peacemaker. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Only days later, Autumn is found strangled in her office, and hot-headed Sister Marianna becomes the sheriff’s deputies’ prime suspect. They believe her missing scarf may be the murder weapon, but Sister Lou believes Sister Marianna’s being framed. If she has a prayer of keeping Sister Marianna out of prison, she’ll need to once again put her faith in her nephew Chris LaSalle and reporter Shari Henson to help her solve the case. As the trio tries to cross suspects off the list, Sister Lou has no choice but to stick her neck out—if she’s going to unveil who was desperate enough to resort to murder . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A viral video reveals a teen’s dark family history, leaving him to reckon with his heritage, legacy, and identity in this fiery, conversation-starting novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eran Sharon knows nothing of his father except that he left when Eran was a baby. Now a senior in high school and living with his protective but tight-lipped mother, Eran is a passionate young man deeply interested in social justice and equality. When he learns that the Houston police have launched a program to increase traffic stops, Eran organizes a peaceful protest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a heated moment at the protest goes viral, and a reporter connects the Sharon family to a tragedy fifteen years earlier — and asks if Eran is anything like his father, a supposed terrorist. Soon enough, Eran is wondering the same thing, especially when the people he’s gone to school and temple with for years start to look at him differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timely, powerful, and full of nuance, Rafi Mittlefehldt’s sophomore novel confronts the prejudices, fears, and strengths of family and community, striking right to the heart of what makes us who we are.</description>

  <description>Moving forward and backward in time, Jacqueline Woodson's taut and powerful new novel uncovers the role that history and community have played in the experiences, decisions, and relationships of these families, and in the life of the new child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the book opens in 2001, it is the evening of sixteen-year-old Melody's coming of age ceremony in her grandparents' Brooklyn brownstone. Watched lovingly by her relatives and friends, making her entrance to the music of Prince, she wears a special custom-made dress. But the event is not without poignancy. Sixteen years earlier, that very dress was measured and sewn for a different wearer: Melody's mother, for her own ceremony-- a celebration that ultimately never took place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfurling the history of Melody's parents and grandparents to show how they all arrived at this moment, Woodson considers not just their ambitions and successes but also the costs, the tolls they've paid for striving to overcome expectations and escape the pull of history. As it explores sexual desire and identity, ambition, gentrification, education, class and status, and the life-altering facts of parenthood, &lt;i&gt;Red at the Bone&lt;/i&gt; most strikingly looks at the ways in which young people must so often make long-lasting decisions about their lives--even before they have begun to figure out who they are and what they want to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Los Angeles transplant, Sister Louise "Lou" LaSalle feels right at home in Briar Coast, New York. After all, her beloved nephew, Chris, works at the college founded by her congregation. But while Sister Lou has always played by the rules, she's about to have her faith in herself tested--by murder . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sister Lou expects some pushback when she invites her friend, Maurice Jordan, to be the guest speaker for the St. Hermione of Ephesus Feast Day presentation. The theology professor is known far and wide for his controversial views. What she's not prepared for is finding him dead in his hotel room, bashed over the head. &lt;br /&gt; When the local deputies focus on the members of her congregation as suspects, Sister Lou takes matters into her own hands. Against Chris's wishes, she teams up with a cynical local reporter to delve into Maurice's life. The unlikely partners in crime-fighting uncover a litany of both devotees and detractors. And though it might take a miracle to find the killer, Sister Lou vows to carry on until justice prevails . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if you had a second chance at first love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;She feels lost in social situations, saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way. She just can't read people. She prefers the quiet solitude of books or playing chess to being around others. Apart from Jonathan. She liked being around him, but she hasn't seen him for ten years. Until now that is. And she's not sure he'll want to see her again after what happened all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;Except that, actually, she doesn't like being alone at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Girl He Used to Know&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting novel full of surprising revelations that keep you turning the page. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Jojo Moyes, Gail Honeyman, Jill Santopolo and &lt;i&gt;Sliding Doors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Eric Jerome Dickey reveals how one chance meeting can change everything in this engrossing, sexy tale of star-crossed lust.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the love of money is the root of all evil, but for Ken Swift, it's the love of a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken is twenty-one, hurting people for cash to try to pay his way through college, when he lays eyes on Jimi Lee, the woman who will change the course of his entire life. What's meant to be a one-night stand with the Harvard-bound beauty turns into an explosion of sexual chemistry that neither can quit. And when Jimi Lee becomes pregnant, their two very different worlds collide in ways they never could have anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion, infidelity, and raw emotion combine in Eric Jerome Dickey's poignant, erotic portrait of a relationship: the rise, the fall, and the scars--and desire--that never fade.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The films, the stars, the filmmakers-all get their due in &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt;, a sweeping overview of blacks in film from the silent era through &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt;, with striking photos and an engrossing history by award-winning author Donald Bogle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story opens in the silent film era, when white actors in blackface often played black characters, but also saw the rise of independent African American filmmakers, including the remarkable Oscar Micheaux. It follows the changes in the film industry with the arrival of sound motion pictures and the Great Depression, when black performers such as Stepin Fetchit and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson began finding a place in Hollywood. More often than not, they were saddled with rigidly stereotyped roles, but some gifted performers, most notably Hattie McDaniel in &lt;i&gt;Gone With the Wind&lt;/i&gt; (1939), were able to turn in significant performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the coming decades, more black talents would light up the screen. Dorothy Dandridge became the first African American to earn a Best Actress Oscar nomination for &lt;i&gt;Carmen Jones &lt;/i&gt;(1954), and Sidney Poitier broke ground in films like &lt;i&gt;The Defiant Ones&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;1963's &lt;i&gt;Lilies of the Field&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt; reveals the changes in images that came about with the evolving social and political atmosphere of the US, from the Civil Rights era to the Black Power movement. The story takes readers through &lt;i&gt;Blaxploitation&lt;/i&gt;, with movies like &lt;i&gt;Shaft&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Super Fly&lt;/i&gt;, to the emergence of such stars as Cicely Tyson, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Whoopi Goldberg, and of directors Spike Lee and John Singleton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The history comes into the new millennium with filmmakers Barry Jenkins (&lt;i&gt;Moonlight&lt;/i&gt;), Ava Du Vernay (&lt;i&gt;Selma&lt;/i&gt;),&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and Ryan Coogler (&lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt;); megastars such as Denzel Washington, Will Smith, and Morgan Freeman; as well as Halle Berry, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis, and a glorious gallery of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with evocative photographs and stories of stars and filmmakers on set and off, &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black &lt;/i&gt;tells an underappreciated history as it's never before been told.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They say I must be put to death for what happened to Madame, and they want me to confess. But how can I confess what I don't believe I've done?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1826, and all of London is in a frenzy. Crowds gather at the gates of the Old Bailey to watch as Frannie Langton, maid to Mr and Mrs Benham, goes on trial for their murder. The testimonies against her are damning - slave, whore, seductress. And they may be the truth. But they are not the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time Frannie must tell her story. It begins with a girl learning to read on a plantation in Jamaica, and it ends in a grand house in London, where a beautiful woman waits to be freed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But through her fevered confessions, one burning question haunts Frannie Langton: could she have murdered the only person she ever loved?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Teagan Frost, sh*t just got real.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teagan Frost is having a hard time keeping it together. Sure, she's got telekinetic powers—a skill that the government is all too happy to make use of, sending her on secret break-in missions that no ordinary human could carry out. But all she really wants to do is kick back, have a beer, and pretend she's normal for once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then a body turns up at the site of her last job—murdered in a way that only someone like Teagan could have pulled off. She's got 24 hours to clear her name—and it's not just her life at stake. If she can't unravel the conspiracy in time, her hometown of Los Angeles will be in the crosshairs of an underground battle that's on the brink of exploding...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Full of imagination, wit and random sh*t flying through the air, this insane adventure from an irreverent new voice will blow your tiny mind.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>‘A compelling, passionate and captivating must read!...&lt;b&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading this beautiful book&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Dash Fan Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Would you tell the truth, if it meant losing your one true love?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soma&lt;/b&gt; is a shy young woman adrift in a strange new country. After moving from Sri Lanka to Yorkshire to become a nanny to baby Louis, Soma tries to settle into life in the U.K., even if every day presents her with a new challenge, from trying new food or getting to grips with the language. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the one thing Soma never counted on was falling in love. When she meets &lt;b&gt;Sahan&lt;/b&gt;, a Sri Lankan student at the local university, the two feel an instant attraction. Meeting in secret so that Sahan can teach Soma English, their friendship quickly blooms into something more. But their differing backgrounds – Soma is from poverty, while Sahan is the son of a wealthy family and cousin to Soma’s employer – means they have to hide their love from the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While they bare their souls to each other, Sahan has no idea that Soma is hiding a huge secret from him – but as her lies come crashing down, Soma is faced with an impossible choice. Should she tell the truth – even if means losing Sahan? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A moving, unique and utterly engrossing love story about how well we really know the person we fall in love with – fans of Amanda Prowse, Jojo Moyes and Diane Chamberlain will be captivated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers are loving &lt;i&gt;This Stolen Life&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;This Stolen Life&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;b&gt;a journey that is not to be missed&lt;/b&gt;…this story moved me beyond measure…&lt;b&gt;I just know it will be one book that will stay with me&lt;/b&gt; in the coming months.’ &lt;i&gt;Stacy is Reading&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I loved this book... Jeevani Charika has created such soulful characters that they make &lt;b&gt;reading this book an absolute pleasure&lt;/b&gt;… This is a heart-warming 5 star read.’ (5 stars) &lt;i&gt;Jan’s Book Buzz&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'truly engaging characters that are believable and a story that is applicable the world over. I found myself not wanting to put the book down.' &lt;i&gt;Jen Med’s Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;filled with emotional turmoil and love&lt;/b&gt;, this is a story that took me completely by surprise. A &lt;b&gt;gorgeous and memorable gem of a book&lt;/b&gt; with well written and likeable characters who &lt;b&gt;will stay with me for some time to come&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Cal Turner Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘The story is &lt;b&gt;gripping, emotional and really unique&lt;/b&gt;… I loved it and &lt;b&gt;I heartily recommend it&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;From the very first few pages I was hooked&lt;/b&gt;… This was just beautiful in many ways. Perfect for a holiday read.’ (5 stars) Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘It was a simple story with &lt;b&gt;plenty of twists to keep a reader hooked&lt;/b&gt;, and the added dash of culture that may be unfamiliar to some, but gives it the spice to make you savour it.’ (5 stars) Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed reading about these two women, Soma and Yamuna…The &lt;b&gt;opening was tense and exciting, and there was a definite pageturner aspect&lt;/b&gt; to the story as I waited for Soma's past to catch up with her.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;What a captivating story&lt;/b&gt;…it pulled me instantly with its heart wrenching emotion’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘The story was not complex, it wa</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of &lt;i&gt;The Twelve Tribes of Hattie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Turner House&lt;/i&gt;, an intimately told story about a woman living by her own rules and the rural community that struggles to understand her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azalea “Knot” Centre is determined to live life as she pleases. Let the people of West Mills say what they will; the neighbors’ gossip won’t keep Knot from what she loves best: cheap moonshine, nineteenth-century literature, and the company of men. And yet, Knot is starting to learn that her freedom comes at a high price. Alone in her one-room shack, ostracized from her relatives and cut off from her hometown, Knot turns to her neighbor, Otis Lee Loving, in search of some semblance of family and home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otis Lee is eager to help. A lifelong fixer, Otis Lee is determined to steer his friends and family away from decisions that will cause them heartache and ridicule. After his failed attempt as a teenager to help his older sister, Otis Lee discovers a possible path to redemption in the chaos Knot brings to his doorstep. But while he’s busy trying to fix Knot’s life, Otis Lee finds himself powerless to repair the many troubles within his own family, as the long-buried secrets of his troubled past begin to come to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in an African American community in rural North Carolina from 1941 to 1987, &lt;i&gt;In West Mills&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent, big-hearted small-town story about family, friendship, storytelling, and the redemptive power of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Mahalia's Sweet Tea boasts the most flavorful soul food in all of Prince George's County, Maryland. But as events at the beauty industry's leading trade show turn&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;ugly, owner Halia Watkins needs to bite into an unsavory new item on the menu--murder! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the chicest hair convention of the year gets cooking in town, so does business at Mahalia's Sweet Tea. Halia can barely handle the influx of customers looking to satisfy their appetites after spending the day surrounded by outrageous runway styles. As buzz builds around beauty mogul and pop culture icon Monique Dupree, collard greens start moving out of the kitchen faster than models strutting down the catwalk . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the glitz fades the moment Monique is found shot to death. Turns out, the glamorous entrepreneur's vanity empire was stained by bitter rivalries, explosive affairs, and backstabbers scheming for fame and fortune. With more suspects than ingredients listed on a bottle of deep conditioner, Halia and her cousin Wavonne rush to discover who pulled the trigger--before the conniving culprit dishes another deadly surprise . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A perfect family is shattered in RUN AWAY, the new thriller from the master of domestic suspense, Harlan Coben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've lost your daughter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's addicted to drugs and to an abusive boyfriend. And she's made it clear that she doesn't want to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, by chance, you see her playing guitar in Central Park. But she's not the girl you remember. This woman is living on the edge, frightened, and clearly in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't stop to think. You approach her, beg her to come home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She runs. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you do the only thing a parent can do: you follow her into a dark and dangerous world you never knew existed. Before you know it, both your family and your life are on the line. And in order to protect your daughter from the evils of that world, you must face them head on.</description>

  <description>You just dropped off your child at the bus stop. A panicked stranger calls your phone. Your child has been kidnapped, and the stranger explains that their child has also been kidnapped, by a completely different stranger. The only way to get your child back is to kidnap another child within 24 hours. Your child will be released only when the next victim's parents kidnap yet another child, and most importantly, the stranger explains, if you don't kidnap a child, or if the next parents don't kidnap a child, your child will be murdered. You are now part of The Chain.</description>

  <description>The Reluctant Royals series returns with a good girl searching for the life that’s not too big, and not too small, and the bad boy prince who might be just right for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya Jerami fled Thesolo for the glitz and glamour of NYC but discovered that her Prince Charming only exists in her virtual dating games. When Nya returns home for a royal wedding, she accidentally finds herself up close and personal—in bed—with the real-life celebrity prince who she loves to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Johan von Braustein, the red-headed step-prince of Liechtienbourg, acting as paparazzi bait is a ruse that protects his brother—the heir to the throne—and his own heart. When a royal referendum threatens his brother’s future, a fake engagement is the perfect way to keep the cameras on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya and Johan both have good reasons to avoid love, but as desires are laid bare behind palace doors, they must decide if their fake romance will lead to a happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>Aphra Behn, first female professional writer. Sojourner Truth, activist and abolitionist. Ada Lovelace, first computer programmer. Marie Curie, first woman to win the Nobel Prize. Joan Jett, godmother of punk. The 100 revolutionary women highlighted in this gorgeously illustrated book were bad in the best sense of the word: they challenged the status quo and changed the rules for all who followed. From pirates to artists, warriors, daredevils, scientists, activists, and spies, the accomplishments of these incredible women vary as much as the eras and places in which they effected change. Featuring bold watercolor portraits and illuminating essays by Ann Shen, &lt;em&gt;Bad Girls Throughout History&lt;/em&gt; is a distinctive, gift-worthy tribute.</description>

  <description>What if you could find the love of your life just by reading between the lines? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single mom Fordham Price is juggling her job at a small publisher, her precocious ten-year-old daughter, and her feisty mother. She wants to find time for men, but after a series of dating disasters, her relationship status is still stuck at single. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As if her macchiato lite wasn’t already overflowing, a co-worker gets pregnant, and Fordham is expected to step in and deliver the company’s latest reality read from the Flowers from the Heart series. She must now supplement her own romantic misadventures with tales of cynical cat-ladies, identical-twin husbands, spunky monks, and countless other web-crawlers. &lt;br /&gt;As she wades through the submissions, she finds one from a widower whose story gives her tingles in all the places she forgot existed. His words draw her in until she finds herself daydreaming about him more than she’d care to admit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Could she have a love like that, or will her romantic fate be forever bound to her philandering ex-husband? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Award-winning author Brad Parks delivers a deliciously tense novel of thrills, twists, and deceit that will keep readers riveted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling stage actor Tommy Jump knows he has to stop chasing applause and start chasing greenbacks. But then he's offered the role of a lifetime: $150,000 for a six-month acting gig. With a newly pregnant fiancee depending on him, it's an opportunity he can't refuse, even though the offer comes from the strangest employer imaginable: the FBI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feds won a small victory when they arrested Mitchell Dupree, a banker who has spent the past four years laundering money for New Colima, one of the deadliest cartels in Mexico and a major supplier of crystal meth in the US. But Dupree has documents that could lead to arrests of high-ranking members of New Colima, including their fearsome leader, El Vio . . . if only he'd tell the FBI where they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a false name and backstory, Tommy will enter Dupree's low-security prison as a felon and get close to the banker in the hopes that he'll reveal the documents' whereabouts. But when Tommy arrives, he quickly realizes that he's underestimated the enormity of his task and the terrifying reach of the cartel. Because the FBI isn't the only one looking for the documents, and if Tommy doesn't play his role to perfection, it just may be his last act.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Mothers&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;An American Marriage&lt;/i&gt; in this dazzling debut novel about mothers and daughters, identity and family, and how the relationships that sustain you can also be the ones that consume you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butler family has had their share of trials—as sisters Althea, Viola, and Lillian can attest—but nothing prepared them for the literal trial that will upend their lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Althea, the eldest sister and substitute matriarch, is a force to be reckoned with and her younger sisters have alternately appreciated and chafed at her strong will. They are as stunned as the rest of the small community when she and her husband Proctor are arrested, and in a heartbeat the family goes from one of the most respected in town to utter disgrace. The worst part is, not even her sisters are sure exactly what happened.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Althea awaits her fate, Lillian and Viola must come together in the house they grew up in to care for their sister’s teenage daughters. What unfolds is a stunning portrait of the heart and core of an American family in a story that is as page-turning as it is important.</description>

  <description>&lt;u&gt;From the ARC's back cover:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"My son has been erased." Those are the last words the woman tells Barry Sutton before she leaps from the Manhattan rooftop.&lt;br /&gt;Deeply unnerved, Barry begins to investigate her death, only to learn that this wasn't an isolated case. All across the country, people are waking up to lives different from the ones they fell asleep to. Are they suffering from False Memory Syndrome, a mysterious new disease that afflicts people with vivid memories of a life they never lived? Or is something far more sinister behind the fracturing of reality all around him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles away, neuroscientist Helena Smith is developing a technology that allows us to preserve our most intense memories and relive them. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to reexperience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barry's search for the truth leads him on an impossible, astonishing journey as he discovers that Helena's work has yielded a terrifying gift—the ability not just to preserve memories but to remake them . . . at the risk of destroying what it means to be human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a relentless thriller and an intricate science fiction puzzle box, &lt;i&gt;Recursion&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply felt exploration of the flashbulb moments that define us—and who we are without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blurbs:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A fantastic read. It's not often I plow through a book in two days. But Blake Crouch's action-packed, brilliantly unique &lt;i&gt;Recursion&lt;/i&gt; had me up late and shirking responsibilities until I had devoured the last page." --Andy Weir&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Blake Crouch has invented his own brand of page-turner—fearlessly genre-bending, consistently surprising, and determined to explode the boundaries of what a thriller can be." --Karin Slaughter</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Sophie Kinsella, an irresistible story of love and empowerment about a young woman with a complicated family, a handsome man who might be “the one,” and an IOU that changes everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixie Farr has always lived by her father’s motto: “Family first.” But since her dad passed away, leaving his charming housewares store in the hands of his wife and children, Fixie spends all her time picking up the slack from her siblings instead of striking out on her own. The way Fixie sees it, if she doesn’t take care of her father’s legacy, who will? It’s simply not in her nature to say no to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a handsome stranger in a coffee shop asks her to watch his laptop for a moment, Fixie not only agrees—she ends up saving it from certain disaster. Turns out the computer’s owner is an investment manager. To thank Fixie for her quick thinking, Sebastian scribbles an IOU on a coffee sleeve and attaches his business card. But Fixie laughs it off—she’d never actually claim an IOU from a stranger. Would she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Fixie’s childhood crush, Ryan, comes back into her life and his lack of a profession pushes all of Fixie’s buttons. She wants nothing for herself—but she’d love Seb to give Ryan a job. And Seb agrees, until the tables are turned once more and a new series of IOUs between Seb and Fixie—from small favors to life-changing moments—ensues. Soon Fixie, Ms. Fixit for everyone else, is torn between her family and the life she really wants. Does she have the courage to take a stand? Will she finally grab the life, and love, she really wants?</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; and Amazon Charts bestseller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A page-turning debut of suspense about a young couple desperate to have a child of their own—and the unsettling consequences of getting what they always wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher and Hannah are a happily married surgeon and nurse with picture-perfect lives. All that’s missing is a child. When Janie, an abandoned six-year-old, turns up at their hospital, Christopher forms an instant connection with her, and he convinces Hannah they should take her home as their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Janie is no ordinary child, and her damaged psyche proves to be more than her new parents were expecting. Janie is fiercely devoted to Christopher, but she acts out in increasingly disturbing ways, directing all her rage at Hannah. Unable to bond with Janie, Hannah is drowning under the pressure, and Christopher refuses to see Janie’s true nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah knows that Janie is manipulating Christopher and isolating him from her, despite Hannah’s attempts to bring them all together. But as Janie’s behavior threatens to tear Christopher and Hannah apart, the truth behind Janie’s past may be enough to push them all over the edge.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set against the backdrop of Detroit in the 1960's and 1970's, the story of the life of a one-of-a-kind matriarch whose business in the Numbers made her daughter's dreams come true.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The World According to Fannie Davis is Bridgett Davis's unforgettable coming of age in a family with a secret. The upper middle class splendor in which she and her siblings so happily lived was made possible by her mother's business in the Numbers, the informal lottery that powered African American communities across the United States. A poignant and revealing examination of how one family lifted itself out of poverty and into a completely different life, for good and bad, The World According to Fannie Davis introduces us to an unforgettable matriarch, and her daughter, whose ways of understanding still resonate today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offering a daughter's perspective on her larger-than-life mother, Bridgett Davis traces her family's story as part of the Great Migration, showing how her mother and father arrived in Detroit from Tennessee carrying with them not just their own hopes but also those of their families. A child gifted with extraordinary powers of perception and understanding, Davis breaks the code of secrecy around her mother's business and in so doing reveals both her mothers' extraordinary sacrifices as well as her seemingly endless generosity. We come to understand just how keenly Fannie Davis believed in the power of money, and family, to make the world right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving, suspenseful and emotionally rewarding, The World According to Fannie Davis will change the way you understand the lengths a mother will go to provide for her family, and the way those sacrifices resonate over time, offering not just a moving portrait of one American family, but also a new way of understanding Detroit.</description>

You can’t put it down!” —Jenna Bush Hager, &lt;i&gt;Today&lt;/i&gt; Show Book Club Pick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Powerful . . . A twisting tale of love, loss, and dark family secrets.” —Paula Hawkins, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poignant and suspenseful drama that untangles the complicated ties binding three women—two sisters and their mother—in one Chinese immigrant family and explores what happens when the eldest daughter disappears, and a series of family secrets emerge, from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Girl in Translation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with a mystery. Sylvie, the beautiful, brilliant, successful older daughter of the Lee family, flies to the Netherlands for one final visit with her dying grandmother—and then vanishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy, the sheltered baby of the Lee family, is too young to remember a time when her parents were newly immigrated and too poor to keep Sylvie. Seven years older, Sylvie was raised by a distant relative in a faraway, foreign place, and didn’t rejoin her family in America until age nine. Timid and shy, Amy has always looked up to her sister, the fierce and fearless protector who showered her with unconditional love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happened to Sylvie? Amy and her parents are distraught and desperate for answers. Sylvie has always looked out for them. Now, it’s Amy’s turn to help. Terrified yet determined, Amy retraces her sister’s movements, flying to the last place Sylvie was seen. But instead of simple answers, she discovers something much more valuable: the truth. Sylvie, the golden girl, kept painful secrets . . . secrets that will reveal more about Amy’s complicated family—and herself—than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply moving story of family, secrets, identity, and longing, &lt;i&gt;Searching for Sylvie Lee&lt;/i&gt; is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive portrait of an immigrant family. It is a profound exploration of the many ways culture and language can divide us and the impossibility of ever truly knowing someone—especially those we love.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;From international bestselling author Brad Parks comes a gripping story and prequel to his new thriller,&lt;i&gt; The Last Act&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a career rising through the ranks, Mitchell Dupree has finally landed his dream job: compliance director for the Latin American division at Union South Bank. It's a comfortable place to work, with a family-like atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this family has secrets. Mitch quickly notices a string of suspicious transactions that he worries may be coming from a notorious Mexican drug cartel, the brutal and fast-growing New Colima syndicate. As he probes deeper into the bank's dealings, Mitch must play a dangerous and complicated game, figuring out who to trust . . . and how safe his job--and his life--really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes an exclusive sneak preview of Brad Parks's next novel, &lt;i&gt;The Last Act&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They say I must be put to death for what happened to Madame, and they want me to confess. But how can I confess what I don't believe I've done?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1826, and all of London is in a frenzy. Crowds gather at the gates of the Old Bailey to watch as Frannie Langton, maid to Mr and Mrs Benham, goes on trial for their murder. The testimonies against her are damning - slave, whore, seductress. And they may be the truth. But they are not the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time Frannie must tell her story. It begins with a girl learning to read on a plantation in Jamaica, and it ends in a grand house in London, where a beautiful woman waits to be freed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But through her fevered confessions, one burning question haunts Frannie Langton: could she have murdered the only person she ever loved?</description>

  &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; with a modern twist &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AYESHA SHAMSI has &lt;em&gt;a lot &lt;/em&gt;going on.  Her dreams of being a poet have been set aside for a teaching job so she can pay off her debts to her wealthy uncle. She lives with her boisterous Muslim family and is always being reminded that her flighty younger cousin, Hafsa, is close to rejecting her one hundredth marriage proposal. Though Ayesha is lonely, she doesn’t want an arranged marriage. Then she meets Khalid who is just as smart and handsome as he is conservative and judgmental. She is irritatingly attracted to someone who looks down on her choices and dresses like he belongs in the seventh century. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a surprise engagement between Khalid and Hafsa is announced, Ayesha is torn between how she feels about the straightforward Khalid and his family; and the truth she realizes about herself. But Khalid is also wrestling with what he believes and what he wants. And he just can’t get this beautiful, outspoken woman out of his mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of a legendary designer who pioneered high-end streetwear, from a storefront in Harlem to the red carpet in Hollywood, dressing everyone from Salt-N-Pepa and Eric B. &amp;amp; Rakim to Beyoncé and Jay-Z along the way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his now-legendary store on 125th Street in Harlem, Dapper Dan pioneered high-end streetwear in the early 1980s, remixing classic luxury-brand logos into his own flamboyant designs. But before reinventing fashion, he was a hungry boy with holes in his shoes, a teen who daringly gambled drug dealers out of their money, a young man in a prison cell who found nourishment in books, and, finally, a designer who broke barriers to outfit a whos-who of music, sport, and crime world celebrities in looks that went on to define an era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns playful, poignant, and inspiring, and featuring two incredible eight-page color photo inserts, including the only existing, never-before-seen images of the notorious Mike Tyson-Mitch Green street fight, Dapper Dan's memoir is a high-stakes coming-of-age story, spanning more than seventy years and set against the backdrop of an ever-evolving America.</description>

  <description>Jane McKeene was born two days before the dead began to walk the battlefields of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville—derailing the War Between the States and changing America forever. In this new nation, safety for all depends on the work of a few, and laws like the Native and Negro Reeducation Act require certain children attend combat schools to learn to put down the dead. But there are also opportunities—and Jane is studying to become an Attendant, trained in both weaponry and etiquette to protect the well-to-do. It’s a chance for a better life for Negro girls like Jane. After all, not even being the daughter of a wealthy white Southern woman could save her from society’s expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s not a life Jane wants. Almost finished with her education at Miss Preston’s School of Combat in Baltimore, Jane is set on returning to her Kentucky home and doesn’t pay much mind to the politics of the eastern cities, with their talk of returning America to the glory of its days before the dead rose. But when families around Baltimore County begin to go missing, Jane is caught in the middle of a conspiracy, one that finds her in a desperate fight for her life against some powerful enemies. And the restless dead, it would seem, are the least of her problems.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;With race and the police once more burning issues, this classic work from one of America’s giants of black radicalism has lost none of its prescience or power&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial of Angela Davis is remembered as one of America’s most historic political trials, and no one can tell the story better than Davis herself. Opening with a letter from James Baldwin to Angela, and including contributions from numerous radicals and commentators such as Black Panthers George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale and Erica Huggins, this book is not only an account of Davis’s incarceration and the struggles surrounding it, but also perhaps the most comprehensive and thorough analysis of the prison system of the United States and the figure embodied in Davis’s arrest and imprisonment—the political prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the book was written, the carceral system in the US has grown from strength to strength, with more of its black population behind bars than ever before. The scathing analysis of the role of prison and the policing of black populations offered by Davis and her comrades in this astonishing volume remains as relevant today as the day it was published.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It had been six years since my world was turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;He exposed me to the darker side of life and I could never go back to the person I was.&lt;br /&gt;I had been through more things the average person couldn’t even relate to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had the chance to go back and do things differently though?&lt;br /&gt;Not a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d pick him a thousand times. A million times. For eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess not much has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Alexa Ballentine, and I am still in love with my stalker.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The new novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;Upstate&lt;/i&gt;, one of five books selected by the National Book Foundation for the inaugural Literature for Justice Program: a literary thriller about one woman's desperate search for her missing twin sister, a multi-layered mystery set against the neighborhoods of Harlem.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cold December evening, Autumn Spencer's twin sister Summer walks to the roof of their shared Harlem brownstone and is never seen again--the door to the roof is locked, and no footsteps are found. Faced with authorities indifferent to another missing woman, Autumn must pursue answers on her own, all while grieving her mother's recent death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her friends and neighbors, Autumn pretends to hold up through the crisis. She falls into an affair with Summer's boyfriend to cope with the disappearance of a woman they both loved. But the loss becomes too great, the mystery too inexplicable, and Autumn starts to unravel, all the while becoming obsessed with murdered women and the men who kill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Speaking of Summer&lt;/i&gt;, critically acclaimed author Kalisha Buckhanon has created a postmodern, fast-paced story of urban peril and victim invisibility, and the fight to discover truth at any cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A bittersweet inheritance reunites three estranged sisters in a novel of family, trust, and forgiveness from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Carolyn Brown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they were growing up, Dana, Harper, and Tawny thought of themselves as “sometimes sisters.” They connected only during the summer month they’d all spend at their grandmother’s rustic lakeside resort in north Texas. But secrets started building, and ten years have passed since they’ve all been together—in fact, they’ve rarely spoken, and it broke their grandmother’s heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s gone, leaving Annie’s Place to her granddaughters—twelve cabins, a small house, a café, a convenience store, and a lot of family memories. It’s where Dana, Harper, and Tawny once shared so many good times. They’ve returned, sharing only hidden regrets, a guarded mistrust, and haunting guilt. But now, in this healing summer place, the secrets that once drove them apart could bring them back together—especially when they discover that their grandmother may have been hiding something, too…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To overcome the past and find future happiness, these “sometimes sisters” have one more chance to realize they are always family.</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The films, the stars, the filmmakers -- the struggles, the triumphs: all get their due in &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt;, a sweeping overview of blacks in film, covering more than a century of cinema with striking photos and an engrossing history by award-winning author Donald Bogle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt; opens in the silent film era, when white actors in blackface often played black characters and D. W. Griffith premiered his shocking, controversial &lt;i&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/i&gt;. Sound motion pictures were ushered in by Al Jolson in blackface in &lt;i&gt;The Jazz Singer&lt;/i&gt;, but in this new era of filmmaking, black performers like Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Louise Beavers, Paul Robeson, and Butterfly McQueen began finding a place in Hollywood. More often than not, they were saddled with rigidly stereotyped roles, but still, some gifted performers were able to turn in significant performances. &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt; will spotlight such talents, notably Hattie McDaniel, the first African American to win an Academy Award, for her work in &lt;i&gt;Gone With the Wind&lt;/i&gt; (1939).&lt;br /&gt;In the coming decades, more black talents would light up the screen. Dorothy Dandridge became the first African American actress to earn a Best Actress Oscar nomination for &lt;i&gt;Carmen J&lt;/i&gt;ones in 1954, and Sidney Poitier would be the first black actor to win a Best Actor Oscar in 1963's &lt;i&gt;Lilies of the Field&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt; reveals the changes in images that came about with the evolving social and political atmosphere of the country, from the Civil Rights era to the Black Power movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black&lt;/i&gt; will follow through the Blaxploitation era with movies like &lt;i&gt;Shaft&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Super Fly&lt;/i&gt; and the arrival of such directors as Gordon Parks and Melvin Van Peebles; to the emergence in the late 1970s and '80s of such stars as Diana Ross, Whoopi Goldberg, Richard Pryor, and Eddie Murphy; and of directors Spike Lee, John Singleton, and the Hughes brothers. The book comes up to the present with filmmakers such as Steve McQueen (&lt;i&gt;Twelve Years A Slave&lt;/i&gt;), Gina Prince Bythewood (&lt;i&gt;The Secret Life of Bees&lt;/i&gt;),&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Lee Daniels (&lt;i&gt;Precious&lt;/i&gt;),&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;F. Gary Grant (&lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton&lt;/i&gt;), Nate Parker (who directed his own version of &lt;i&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/i&gt;) -- and such megastars as Denzel Washington; Will Smith; Halle Berry; Viola Davis, and a glorious gallery of others. &lt;br /&gt;With photographs and stories of stars and filmmakers on set and off, &lt;i&gt;Hollywood Black &lt;/i&gt;tells an enthralling, underappreciated history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Award-winning author Brad Parks delivers a deliciously tense novel of thrills, twists, and deceit that will keep readers riveted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling stage actor Tommy Jump knows he has to stop chasing applause and start chasing greenbacks. But then he's offered the role of a lifetime: $150,000 for a six-month acting gig. With a newly pregnant fiancee depending on him, it's an opportunity he can't refuse, even though the offer comes from the strangest employer imaginable: the FBI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feds won a small victory when they arrested Mitchell Dupree, a banker who has spent the past four years laundering money for New Colima, one of the deadliest cartels in Mexico and a major supplier of crystal meth in the US. But Dupree has documents that could lead to arrests of high-ranking members of New Colima, including their fearsome leader, El Vio . . . if only he'd tell the FBI where they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a false name and backstory, Tommy will enter Dupree's low-security prison as a felon and get close to the banker in the hopes that he'll reveal the documents' whereabouts. But when Tommy arrives, he quickly realizes that he's underestimated the enormity of his task and the terrifying reach of the cartel. Because the FBI isn't the only one looking for the documents, and if Tommy doesn't play his role to perfection, it just may be his last act.</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>"Black girls must die exhausted" is something that 33-year-old Tabitha Walker has heard her grandmother say before. Of course, her grandmother (who happens to be white) was referring to the 1950's and what she observed in the nascent times of civil rights. With a coveted position as a local news reporter, Marc-- a "paper-perfect" boyfriend, and a standing Saturday morning appointment with a reliable hairstylist, Tabitha never imagined how this phrase could apply to her as a black girl in contemporary times - until everything changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected doctor's diagnosis awakens Tabitha to an unperceived culprit, threatening the one thing that has always mattered most - having a family of her own. With the help of her best friends, the irreverent and headstrong Laila and Alexis, the former "Sexy Lexi," Tabitha must explore the reaches of modern medicine and test the limits of her relationships to beat the ticking clock on her dreams of becoming a wife &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She must leverage the power of laughter, love, and courageous self-care to bring a healing stronger than she ever imagined - before the phrase "black girls must die exhausted" takes on a new and unwanted meaning in her own life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Sister, the Serial Killer &lt;/i&gt;is a blackly comic novel about how blood is thicker - and more difficult to get out of the carpet - than water...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Korede's dinner is interrupted one night by a distress call from her sister, Ayoola, she knows what's expected of her: bleach, rubber gloves, nerves of steel and a strong stomach. This'll be the third boyfriend Ayoola's dispatched in, quote, self-defence and the third mess that her lethal little sibling has left Korede to clear away. She should probably go to the police for the good of the menfolk of Nigeria, but she loves her sister and, as they say, family always comes first. Until, that is, Ayoola starts dating the doctor where Korede works as a nurse. Korede's long been in love with him, and isn't prepared to see him wind up with a knife in his back: but to save one would mean sacrificing the other...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Mahalia’s Sweet Tea boasts the most flavorful soul food in all of Prince George’s County, Maryland. But as events at the beauty industry’s leading trade show turn&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;ugly, owner Halia Watkins needs to bite into an unsavory new item on the menu—murder!   &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; When the chicest hair convention of the year gets cooking in town, so does business at Mahalia’s Sweet Tea. Halia can barely handle the influx of customers looking to satisfy their appetites after spending the day surrounded by outrageous runway styles. As buzz builds around beauty mogul and pop culture icon Monique Dupree, collard greens start moving out of the kitchen faster than models strutting down the catwalk . . . &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But the glitz fades the moment Monique is found shot to death. Turns out, the glamorous entrepreneur’s vanity empire was stained by bitter rivalries, explosive affairs, and backstabbers scheming for fame and fortune. With more suspects than ingredients listed on a bottle of deep conditioner, Halia and her cousin Wavonne rush to discover who pulled the trigger—before the conniving culprit dishes another deadly surprise . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Megan Goldin's unforgettable debut, The Escape Room, four young Wall Street rising stars discover the price of ambition when an escape room challenge turns into a lethal game of revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the escape room. Your goal is simple. Get out alive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the lucrative world of finance, Vincent, Jules, Sylvie, and Sam are at the top of their game. They’ve mastered the art of the deal and celebrate their success in style—but a life of extreme luxury always comes at a cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invited to participate in an escape room as a team-building exercise, the ferociously competitive co-workers crowd into the elevator of a high rise building, eager to prove themselves. But when the lights go off and the doors stay shut, it quickly becomes clear that this is no ordinary competition: they’re caught in a dangerous game of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in the dark, the colleagues must put aside their bitter rivalries and work together to solve cryptic clues to break free. But as the game begins to reveal the team’s darkest secrets, they realize there’s a price to be paid for the terrible deeds they committed in their ruthless climb up the corporate ladder. As tempers fray, and the clues turn deadly, they must solve one final chilling puzzle: which one of them will kill in order to survive?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;*Named a Best Book of 2018 by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly, &lt;/i&gt;NPR, &lt;i&gt;Broadly&lt;/i&gt;, Buzzfeed (Nonfiction), The Undefeated, &lt;i&gt;Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;(Biography/Memoirs), &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;(Nonfiction), &lt;i&gt;Southern Living &lt;/i&gt;(Southern), &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Critics&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;In this powerful, provocative, and universally lauded memoir—winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal and finalist for the Kirkus Prize—genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon “provocatively meditates on his trauma growing up as a black man, and in turn crafts an essential polemic against American moral rot” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt;, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to time in New York as a college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt; is a “gorgeous, gutting…generous” (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) memoir that combines personal stories with piercing intellect to reflect both on the strife of American society and on Laymon’s experiences with abuse. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, he asks us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A book for people who appreciated Roxane Gay’s memoir &lt;i&gt;Hunger&lt;/i&gt;” (&lt;i&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Heavy &lt;/i&gt;is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family through years of haunting implosions and long reverberations. “You won’t be able to put [this memoir] down…It is packed with reminders of how black dreams get skewed and deferred, yet are also pregnant with the possibility that a kind of redemption may lie in intimate grappling with black realities” (&lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>Jack Reacher plans to follow the autumn sun on an epic road trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn't get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been - the town where his father was born. He thinks, what's one extra day? He takes the detour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very same moment, close by, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians are trying to get to New York City to sell a treasure. They are stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. It's a strange place ... but it's all there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning in the city clerk's office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He's told no one named Reacher ever lived in that town. He knows his father never went back. Now he wonders, was he ever there in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins another nail-biting, adrenaline-fuelled adventure for Reacher. The present can be tense, but the past can be worse. That's for damn sure.</description>

  <description>In this enchanting sequel to the number one bestseller The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Mitch Albom tells the story of Eddie’s heavenly reunion with Annie—the little girl he saved on earth—in an unforgettable novel of how our lives and losses intersect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years ago, in Mitch Albom’s beloved novel, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the world fell in love with Eddie, a grizzled war veteran- turned-amusement park mechanic who died saving the life of a young girl named Annie. Eddie’s journey to heaven taught him that every life matters. Now, in this magical sequel, Mitch Albom reveals Annie’s story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accident that killed Eddie left an indelible mark on Annie. It took her left hand, which needed to be surgically reattached. Injured, scarred, and unable to remember why, Annie’s life is forever changed by a guilt-ravaged mother who whisks her away from the world she knew. Bullied by her peers and haunted by something she cannot recall, Annie struggles to find acceptance as she grows. When, as a young woman, she reconnects with Paulo, her childhood love, she believes she has finally found happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel opens, Annie is marrying Paulo. But when her wedding night day ends in an unimaginable accident, Annie finds herself on her own heavenly journey—and an inevitable reunion with Eddie, one of the five people who will show her how her life mattered in ways she could not have fathomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant and beautiful, filled with unexpected twists, The Next Person You Meet in Heaven reminds us that not only does every life matter, but that every ending is also a beginning—we only need to open our eyes to see it.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, college student Quincy Carpenter went on vacation with five friends and came back alone, the only survivor of a horror movie-scale massacre. In an instant, she became a member of a club no one wants to belong to—a group of similar survivors known in the press as the Final Girls. Lisa, who lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout's knife; Sam, who went up against the Sack Man during her shift at the Nightlight Inn; and now Quincy, who ran bleeding through the woods to escape Pine Cottage and the man she refers to only as Him. The three girls are all attempting to put their nightmares behind them, and, with that, one another. Despite the media's attempts, they never meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Quincy is doing well—maybe even great, thanks to her Xanax prescription. She has a caring almost-fiancé, Jeff; a popular baking blog; a beautiful apartment; and a therapeutic presence in Coop, the police officer who saved her life all those years ago. Her memory won’t even allow her to recall the events of that night; the past is in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, until Lisa, the first Final Girl, is found dead in her bathtub, wrists slit, and Sam, the second, appears on Quincy's doorstep. Blowing through Quincy's life like a whirlwind, Sam seems intent on making Quincy relive the past, with increasingly dire consequences, all of which makes Quincy question why Sam is really seeking her out. And when new details about Lisa's death come to light, Quincy's life becomes a race against time as she tries to unravel Sam's truths from her lies, evade the police and hungry reporters, and, most crucially, remember what really happened at Pine Cottage, before what was started ten years ago is finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;*From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Jack Reacher likes to head south for the winter, to stay warm: so just before Christmas he arrives in a small town in Southern California. But the weather there is not warm and dry, as it’s supposed to be: he arrives in a freak blizzard. Reacher finds refuge in a snowed-in roadhouse with four other strangers stranded by the storm. Two of them are British military police, separated by the weather from the VIP they are detailed to protect. Can Reacher help them find their guy, or will an undercover assassin find him first?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s a friendly voice on the phone. But can you trust her?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who call End of the Line need hope. They need reassurance that life is worth living. But some are unlucky enough to get through to Laura. Laura doesn’t want them to hope. She wants them to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura hasn’t had it easy: she’s survived sickness and a difficult marriage only to find herself heading for forty, unsettled and angry. She doesn’t love talking to people worse off than she is. She &lt;i&gt;craves&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now someone’s on to her—Ryan, whose world falls apart when his pregnant wife ends her life, hand in hand with a stranger. Who was this man, and why did they choose to die together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sinister truth is within Ryan’s grasp, but he has no idea of the desperate lengths Laura will go to…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the best thing about being a Good Samaritan is that you can get away with murder.</description>

  <description>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The repercussions of an illicit affair unfold in this short story by bestselling author Taylor Jenkins Reid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear stranger…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A desperate young woman in Southern California sits down to write a letter to a man she’s never met—a choice that will forever change both their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My heart goes out to you, David. Even though I do not know you…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correspondence between Carrie Allsop and David Mayer reveals, piece by piece, the painful details of a devastating affair between their spouses. With each commiserating scratch of the pen, they confess their fears and bare their souls. They share the bewilderment over how things went so wrong and come to wonder where to go from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told entirely through the letters of two comforting strangers and those of two illicit lovers, &lt;i&gt;Evidence of the Affair&lt;/i&gt; explores the complex nature of the heart. And ultimately, for one woman, how liberating it can be when it’s broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A modern retelling of a classic Indian legend, &lt;i&gt;96 Words for Love&lt;/i&gt; is a coming-of-age story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since her acceptance to UCLA, 17-year-old Raya Liston has been quietly freaking out. She feels simultaneously lost and trapped by a future already mapped out for her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then her beloved grandmother dies, and Raya jumps at the chance to spend her last free summer at the ashram in India where her grandmother met and fell in love with her grandfather. Raya hopes to find her center and her true path. But she didn't expect to fall in love... with a country of beautiful contradictions, her fiercely loyal cousin, a local girl with a passion for reading, and a boy who teaches her that in Sanskrit, there are 96 different ways to say the word "love."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A modern retelling of the classic Indian legend of Shakuntala and Dushyanta.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Diane Chamberlain comes an irresistible new novel. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Caroline Sears receives the news that her unborn baby girl has a heart defect, she is devastated. It is 1970 and there seems to be little that can be done. But her brother-in-law, a physicist, tells her that perhaps there is. Hunter appeared in their lives just a few years before—and his appearance was as mysterious as his past. With no family, no friends, and a background shrouded in secrets, Hunter embraced the Sears family and never looked back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Hunter is telling her that something can be done about her baby's heart. Something that will shatter every preconceived notion that Caroline has. Something that will require a kind of strength and courage that Caroline never knew existed. Something that will mean a mind-bending leap of faith on Caroline's part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all for the love of her unborn child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rich, genre-spanning, breathtaking novel about one mother's quest to save her child, unite her family, and believe in the unbelievable. Diane Chamberlain pushes the boundaries of faith and science to deliver a novel that you will never forget.</description>

She's desperate to protect her son and to claim authority over her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she wasn't expecting both Phillip's ex-wife and new girlfriend to get tangled up in her plans.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Date &lt;/i&gt;serves up a novel about what happens when a public proposal doesn't turn into a happy ending, thanks to a woman who knows exactly how to make one on her own...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When someone asks you to spend your life with him, it shouldn't come as a surprise--or happen in front of 45,000 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game with her actor boyfriend, his man bun, and his bros, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: This is the updated cover for ISBN 9780316474122&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;Ruby Bozarth, a newcomer to Rosedale, Mississippi, is also fresh to the Mississippi Bar--and to the docket of Circuit Judge Baylor, who taps Ruby as defense counsel in a racially charged felony.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;The murder of a woman from one of the town's oldest families has Rosedale's upper crust howling for blood, and the prosecutor is counting on Ruby's inexperience to help him deliver a swift conviction. Ruby's client is a college football star who has returned home after a career-ending injury, and she is determined to build a defense that will stick. She finds help in unexpected quarters from Suzanne, a hard-charging attorney armed to the teeth, and Shorty, a diner cook who knows more than he lets on.&lt;p&gt;Ruby never belonged to the country-club set, but once she nearly married into it. As news breaks of a second murder, Ruby's ex-fiancé, Lee Greene, shows up on her doorstep--a Southern gentleman in need of a savior. As lurid, intertwining investigations unfold, no one in Rosedale can be trusted, especially the twelve men and women impaneled on the jury. They may be hiding the most incendiary secret of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Sophie Kinsella, an irresistible story of love and empowerment about a young woman with a complicated family, a handsome man who might be “the one,” and an IOU that changes everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixie Farr has always lived by her father’s motto: “Family first.” But since her dad passed away, leaving his charming housewares store in the hands of his wife and children, Fixie spends all her time picking up the slack from her siblings instead of striking out on her own. The way Fixie sees it, if she doesn’t take care of her father’s legacy, who will? It’s simply not in her nature to say no to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a handsome stranger in a coffee shop asks her to watch his laptop for a moment, Fixie not only agrees—she ends up saving it from certain disaster. Turns out the computer’s owner is an investment manager. To thank Fixie for her quick thinking, Sebastian scribbles an IOU on a coffee sleeve and attaches his business card. But Fixie laughs it off—she’d never actually claim an IOU from a stranger. Would she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Fixie’s childhood crush, Ryan, comes back into her life and his lack of a profession pushes all of Fixie’s buttons. She wants nothing for herself—but she’d love Seb to give Ryan a job. And Seb agrees, until the tables are turned once more and a new series of IOUs between Seb and Fixie—from small favors to life-changing moments—ensues. Soon Fixie, Ms. Fixit for everyone else, is torn between her family and the life she really wants. Does she have the courage to take a stand? Will she finally grab the life, and love, she really wants?</description>

  <description>In the style of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers &lt;i&gt;You Can’t Touch My Hair&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;I’m Judging You&lt;/i&gt;, a timely collection of alternately hysterical and soul‑searching essays about what it is like to grow up as a creative, sensitive black man in a world that constantly tries to deride and diminish your humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn’t been easy being Michael Arceneaux.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Equality for LGBT people has come a long way and all, but voices of persons of color within the community are still often silenced, and being black in America is…well, have you watched the news?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With the characteristic wit and candor that have made him one of today’s boldest writers on social issues, &lt;i&gt;I Can’t Date Jesus&lt;/i&gt; is Michael Arceneaux’s impassioned, forthright, and refreshing look at minority life in today’s America. Leaving no bigoted or ignorant stone unturned, he describes his journey in learning to embrace his identity when the world told him to do the opposite.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He eloquently writes about coming out to his mother; growing up in Houston, Texas; that time his father asked if he was “funny” while shaking his hand; his obstacles in embracing intimacy; and the persistent challenges of young people who feel marginalized and denied the chance to pursue their dreams.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Perfect for fans of David Sedaris and Phoebe Robinson, &lt;i&gt;I Can’t Date Jesus&lt;/i&gt; tells us—without apologies—what it’s like to be outspoken and brave in a divisive world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set against the backdrop of Detroit in the 1960's and 1970's, the story of the life of a one-of-a-kind matriarch whose business in the Numbers made her daughter's dreams come true.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The World According to Fannie Davis is Bridgett Davis's unforgettable coming of age in a family with a secret. The upper middle class splendor in which she and her siblings so happily lived was made possible by her mother's business in the Numbers, the informal lottery that powered African American communities across the United States. A poignant and revealing examination of how one family lifted itself out of poverty and into a completely different life, for good and bad, The World According to Fannie Davis introduces us to an unforgettable matriarch, and her daughter, whose ways of understanding still resonate today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offering a daughter's perspective on her larger-than-life mother, Bridgett Davis traces her family's story as part of the Great Migration, showing how her mother and father arrived in Detroit from Tennessee carrying with them not just their own hopes but also those of their families. A child gifted with extraordinary powers of perception and understanding, Davis breaks the code of secrecy around her mother's business and in so doing reveals both her mothers' extraordinary sacrifices as well as her seemingly endless generosity. We come to understand just how keenly Fannie Davis believed in the power of money, and family, to make the world right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving, suspenseful and emotionally rewarding, The World According to Fannie Davis will change the way you understand the lengths a mother will go to provide for her family, and the way those sacrifices resonate over time, offering not just a moving portrait of one American family, but also a new way of understanding Detroit.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Mothers&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;An American Marriage&lt;/i&gt; in this dazzling debut novel about mothers and daughters, identity and family, and how the relationships that sustain you can also be the ones that consume you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butler family has had their share of trials—as sisters Althea, Viola, and Lillian can attest—but nothing prepared them for the literal trial that will upend their lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Althea, the eldest sister and substitute matriarch, is a force to be reckoned with and her younger sisters have alternately appreciated and chafed at her strong will. They are as stunned as the rest of the small community when she and her husband Proctor are arrested, and in a heartbeat the family goes from one of the most respected in town to utter disgrace. The worst part is, not even her sisters are sure exactly what happened.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Althea awaits her fate, Lillian and Viola must come together in the house they grew up in to care for their sister’s teenage daughters. What unfolds is a stunning portrait of the heart and core of an American family in a story that is as page-turning as it is important.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A wickedly dark debut thriller about three women who've all been involved with the same man and realize the one thing they have in common is that they all want revenge against him...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divorces are often messy, and Imogen's is no exception. Phillip Rochester is controlling, abusive, and determined to make things as difficult as possible. When he shows up without warning demanding that Imogen move out of their house by the end of the month or he'll sue for sole custody of their young son, Imogen is ready to snap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a moment of madness, Imogen does something unthinkable--something that puts her in control for the first time in years. She's desperate to protect her son and to claim authority over her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she wasn't expecting both Phillip's ex-wife and new girlfriend to get tangled up in her plans. These three very different women--and unlikely allies--reluctantly team up to take revenge against a man who has wronged them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;In his bid for justice, a courageous law-man aims dead center when he is called home to settle deadly scores.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Across the ranchlands and cities of his home state, Rory Yates's discipline and law-enforcement skills have carried him far-from local highway patrolman to the honorable rank of Texas Ranger. A tough case in Waco has jeopardized Yates's chances at promotion, and he decides to take time off to recharge with his family in their small-town hometown, Redbud. He arrives and finds a horrifying crime scene-and a scathing accusation: He is named a suspect in the murder of his ex-wife, Anne, a devoted teacher whose only controversial act ever was deciding to end her marriage to a Ranger.&lt;p&gt;At Anne's funeral, Yates moves the congregation to tears with a beloved hymn. Anne's new husband, Calvin Richards, is there, and Yates has questions that no one else seems to be asking. The investigation is out of his jurisdiction-plus he is a chief suspect-but Rory's drive to learn what happened isn't about self-preservation. For himself, for Anne, his hunt for justice transcends all boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the killer strikes again, Rory's urgent search bursts across state borders onto the national scene. He risks his badge, his pride, his reputation among everyone he loves, and even the trust of the woman he's recently begun seeing, to pursue the only thing that matters. Yates follows the Ranger creed-never to surrender-into the inferno of the most twisted and violent minds he's ever encountered. That code just might bring him out alive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Eric Jerome Dickey reveals how one chance meeting can change everything in this engrossing, sexy prequel of star-crossed lust.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the love of money is the root of all evil, but for Ken Swift, it's the love of a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken is twenty-one, hurting people for cash to try to pay his way through college, when he lays eyes on Jimi Lee, the woman who will change the course of his entire life. What's meant to be a one-night stand with the Harvard-bound beauty turns into an explosion of sexual chemistry that neither can quit. And when Jimi Lee becomes pregnant, their two very different worlds collide in ways they never could have anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion, infidelity, and raw emotion combine in Eric Jerome Dickey's poignant, erotic portrait of a relationship: the rise, the fall, and the scars--and desire--that never fade.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in the French countryside on an idyllic summer vacation, a delicious, tender novel about finding joy and love even in the most unexpected places. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess and her ten-year-old son William set off to spend the summer at Château de Roussignol, deep in the rich, sunlit hills of the Dordogne. There, Jess’s ex-boyfriend—and William’s father—Adam, runs a beautiful hotel in a restored castle. Lush gardens, a gorgeous pool, delectable French food, and a seemingly never-ending wine list—what’s not to like? Jess is bowled over by what Adam has accomplished, but she’s in France for a much more urgent reason: to make Adam fall in love with his own son. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Adam has other ideas, and another girlfriend—and he doesn’t seem inclined to change the habits of a lifetime just because Jess and William have appeared on the scene. Jess isn’t surprised, but William—who has quickly come to idolize his father—wants nothing more than to spend time with him. But Jess can’t allow Adam to let their son down—because she is tormented by a secret of her own, one that nobody—especially William—must discover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns heartwrenching and hopeful, You Me Everything is a novel about one woman's fierce determination to grab hold of the family she has and never let go, and a romantic story as heady as a crisp Sancerre on a summer day.</description>

  <description>Laura and Casey were once inseparable: as they floated on their backs in the sunlit lake, as they dreamed about the future under starry skies, and as they teamed up for the wild scavenger hunts in their small California lakeside town. Until one summer night, when a shocking betrayal sent Laura running through the pines, down the dock, and into a new life, leaving Casey and a first love in her wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the past is impossible to escape, and now, after seventeen years away, Laura is pulled home and into a reunion with Casey she can’t resist—one last scavenger hunt. With a twist: this time, the list of clues leads to the settings of their most cherished summer memories. From glistening Jade Cove to the vintage skating rink, each step they take becomes a bittersweet reminder of the friendship they once shared. But just as the game brings Laura and Casey back together, the clues unravel a stunning secret that threatens to tear them apart…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a lovely debut by Doan, exploring themes of motherhood, daughterhood, and first love with tenderness and humor. The writing is fresh and charming, a perfect read for anyone who spent her teenage years reading the racy bits of cheap paperbacks out loud to their best friends.”&lt;br /&gt;-Booklist, STARRED* review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Doan’s characters leap off the page…[An] accomplished debut novel…Will please readers who grew up with the novels of Judy Blume.”&lt;br /&gt;-Publishers Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“With a vivid sense of place and characters as real as your high school besties, this debut novel is sure to please fans of Kristin Hannah and Elin Hilderbrand.”&lt;br /&gt;-Library Journal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A poignant tale of mothers and daughters finding their ways home to each other.”&lt;br /&gt;-Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Summer Reads: Coolest Books of the Season”&lt;br /&gt;-Globe and Mail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Best New Books to Put in Your Beach Bag”&lt;br /&gt;-PopSugar &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Best Books of Summer 2018”&lt;br /&gt;-Family Circle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Best New Books for Summer 2018”&lt;br /&gt;-Coastal Living&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A trip down memory lane becomes a hunt for long-buried secrets in Amy Mason Doan’s gripping and poignant debut. An evocative tale of family, first love, and the unique and lasting gift of a friendship formed in girlhood.”&lt;br /&gt;-Meg Donohue, USA Today bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There is not a word or a plot line out of place in The Summer List, Amy Mason Doan’s fabulous debut.

  <description>Listening length: 8 hours, 58 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Date &lt;/i&gt;serves up a novel about what happens when a public proposal doesn't turn into a happy ending, thanks to a woman who knows exactly how to make one on her own...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When someone asks you to spend your life with him, it shouldn't come as a surprise--or happen in front of 45,000 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game with her actor boyfriend, his man bun, and his bros, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you could make one simple choice that would change your life forever, would you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin is a documentary filmmaker on the brink of a professional breakthrough, Mark a handsome investment banker with big plans. Passionately in love, they embark on a dream honeymoon to the tropical island of Bora Bora, where they enjoy the sun, the sand, and each other. Then, while scuba diving in the crystal blue sea, they find something in the water. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could the life of your dreams be the stuff of nightmares?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the newlyweds must make a dangerous choice: to speak out or to protect their secret. After all, if no one else knows, who would be hurt? Their decision will trigger a devastating chain of events. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you ever wondered how long it takes to dig a grave?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder no longer. Catherine Steadman's enthralling voice shines throughout this spellbinding debut novel. With piercing insight and fascinating twists, &lt;i&gt;Something in the Water&lt;/i&gt; challenges the reader to confront the hopes we desperately cling to, the ideals we're tempted to abandon, and the perfect lies we tell ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Family secrets come back to haunt Jack Reacher in this electrifying thriller from #1 &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;bestselling author Lee Child, "a superb craftsman of suspense" &lt;br /&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Reacher hits the pavement and sticks out his thumb. He plans to follow the sun on an epic trip across America, from Maine to California. He doesn’t get far. On a country road deep in the New England woods, he sees a sign to a place he has never been: the town where his father was born. He thinks, What’s one extra day? He takes the detour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same moment, in the same isolated area, a car breaks down. Two young Canadians had been on their way to New York City to sell a treasure. Now they’re stranded at a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. The owners seem almost too friendly. It’s a strange place, but it’s all there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, in the city clerk’s office, Reacher asks about the old family home. He’s told no one named Reacher ever lived in town. He’s always known his father left and never returned, but now Reacher wonders, Was he ever there in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Reacher explores his father’s life, and as the Canadians face lethal dangers, strands of different stories begin to merge. Then Reacher makes a shocking discovery: The present can be tough, but the past can be tense . . . and deadly.</description>

  <description>Presented in both English and Spanish, Alice Walker shares a timely collection of nearly seventy works of passionate and powerful poetry that bears witness to our troubled times, while also chronicling a life well-lived. From poems of painful self-inquiry, to celebrating the simple beauty of baking frittatas, Walker offers us a window into her magical, at times difficult, and liberating world of activism, love, hope and, above all, gratitude. Whether she’s urging us to preserve an urban paradise or behold the delicate necessity of beauty to the spirit, Walker encourages us to honor the divine that lives inside all of us and brings her legendary free verse to the page once again, demonstrating that she remains a revolutionary poet and an inspiration to generations of fans.</description>

  <description>Laura and Casey were once inseparable: as they floated on their backs in the sunlit lake, as they dreamed about the future under starry skies, and as they teamed up for the wild scavenger hunts in their small California lakeside town. Until one summer night, when a shocking betrayal sent Laura running through the pines, down the dock, and into a new life, leaving Casey and a first love in her wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the past is impossible to escape, and now, after seventeen years away, Laura is pulled home and into a reunion with Casey she can’t resist—one last scavenger hunt. With a twist: this time, the list of clues leads to the settings of their most cherished summer memories. From glistening Jade Cove to the vintage skating rink, each step they take becomes a bittersweet reminder of the friendship they once shared. But just as the game brings Laura and Casey back together, the clues unravel a stunning secret that threatens to tear them apart…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a lovely debut by Doan, exploring themes of motherhood, daughterhood, and first love with tenderness and humor. The writing is fresh and charming, a perfect read for anyone who spent her teenage years reading the racy bits of cheap paperbacks out loud to their best friends.”&lt;br /&gt;-Booklist, STARRED* review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Doan’s characters leap off the page…[An] accomplished debut novel…Will please readers who grew up with the novels of Judy Blume.”&lt;br /&gt;-Publishers Weekly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“With a vivid sense of place and characters as real as your high school besties, this debut novel is sure to please fans of Kristin Hannah and Elin Hilderbrand.”&lt;br /&gt;-Library Journal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A poignant tale of mothers and daughters finding their ways home to each other.”&lt;br /&gt;-Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Summer Reads: Coolest Books of the Season”&lt;br /&gt;-Globe and Mail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Best New Books to Put in Your Beach Bag”&lt;br /&gt;-PopSugar &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Best Books of Summer 2018”&lt;br /&gt;-Family Circle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Best New Books for Summer 2018”&lt;br /&gt;-Coastal Living&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A trip down memory lane becomes a hunt for long-buried secrets in Amy Mason Doan’s gripping and poignant debut.

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>My family has secrets. I’m always the good girl, doing what’s necessary to keep my loved ones safe. I've kept the darkest secrets from everyone I know. As painful as it is to hold them all inside where they live and gnaw away at me, that’s where they must stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't seen my closest childhood friend, Christian Bear, since I was a teenager—he hasn't changed a bit. He’s still temperamental and plays by his own rules with the law following two steps behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian remembers me. But he doesn’t know the first thing about me anymore. I should've shared my feelings with him the day before I moved away with my family, promising him I'd stay in touch. It broke my heart when he didn't keep his end of the bargain. As a consequence, we haven't spoken in years. Even though Christian and I have always had undeniable chemistry, I won't let him shatter my heart a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian has shown up in my life again with secrets of his own, and demanding answers. That doesn't mean I'm willing to give them. He'll know my secrets when I’m ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our secrets, the risks we’re taking, and the danger he imposes make it impossible to know what our future holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either our tethered souls will bind back together, or our secrets will separate us forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sharp, funny, and incredibly timely collection of personal essays, veteran video blogger and star of MTV's &lt;i&gt;Decoded&lt;/i&gt; Franchesca Ramsey explores race, identity, online activism, and the downfall of real communication in the age of social media rants, trolls, and call-out wars. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franchesca Ramsey didn't set out to be an activist. Or a comedian. Or a commentator on identity, race, and culture, really. But then her YouTube video "What White Girls Say. . . to Black Girls" went viral. Twelve million views viral. Faced with an avalanche of media requests, fan letters, and hate mail, she had two choices: Jump in and make her voice heard or step back and let others frame the conversation. After a crash course in social justice and more than a few foot-in-mouth moments, she realized she had a unique talent and passion for breaking down injustice in America in ways that could make people listen and engage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her first book, Ramsey uses her own experiences as an accidental activist to explore the many ways we communicate with each other—from the highs of bridging gaps and making connections to the many pitfalls that accompany talking about race, power, sexuality, and gender in an unpredictable public space...the internet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, That Escalated Quickly&lt;/em&gt; includes Ramsey's advice on dealing with internet trolls and low-key racists, confessions about being a former online hater herself, and her personal hits and misses in activist debates with everyone from bigoted Facebook friends and misguided relatives to mainstream celebrities and YouTube influencers. With sharp humor and her trademark candor, Ramsey shows readers we can have tough conversations that move the dialogue forward, rather than backward, if we just approach them in the right way.</description>

  <description>In this gripping follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Love Lies Beneath,&lt;/i&gt; #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Ellen Hopkins’s “fabulous, sex-filled masterpiece of mystery and romance” (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal, &lt;/i&gt;starred review), beautiful, wealthy Tara Lattimore's story continues when her sinful past threatens to derail her current marriage—and her sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara thought she was finally settling down when she married the handsome Dr. Cavin Lattimore. Just as she was willing to overlook his gambling habits, she discovers his secret meetings with Sophia, his gorgeous ex-girlfriend and his son Eli’s occasional girlfriend. Life gets even more complicated when Tara’s niece, Kayla, starts hooking up with Eli. In a matter of weeks, Tara has reluctantly gone from rich, single San Francisco professional to Lake Tahoe housewife managing her niece’s whiplash moods, while resisting her stepson’s tantalizing sexual advances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the family drama is her younger sister, Melody, who’s having a serious marital breakdown, which means she might know something about her husband Graham and Tara’s brief dalliance years ago. As Tara’s fragile trust in her family teeters, timed with the arrival of certain people from her past, she also can’t shake the feeling that someone’s watching her. Baiting her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara has always considered herself a tough, self-made woman after surviving a childhood defined by poverty, abuse, and neglect. For years, she suffered from the sins of others. She committed a few of her own. Now she wonders if the misdeeds of her past are about to catch up with her—and if she can ever outrun them.</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;National Book Club Conference ‘Book of the Year’ Award Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her more than three hundred appearances for film and television, stage and cabaret, performing comedy or drama, as an unforgettable lead or a scene stealing supporting character, Jenifer Lewis has established herself as one of the most respected, admired, talented, and versatile entertainers working today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This “Mega Diva” and costar of the hit sitcom black-ish bares her soul in this touching and poignant—and at times side-splittingly hilarious—memoir of a Midwestern girl with a dream, whose journey took her from poverty to the big screen, and along the way earned her many accolades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With candor and warmth, Jenifer Lewis reveals the heart of a woman who lives life to the fullest. This multitalented “force of nature” landed her first Broadway role within eleven days of her graduation from college and later earned the title “Reigning Queen of High-Camp Cabaret.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the audaciously honest voice that her fans adore, Jenifer describes her transition to Hollywood, with guest roles on hits like &lt;em&gt;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt;. Her movie &lt;em&gt;Jackie’s Back!&lt;/em&gt; became a cult favorite, and as the “Mama” to characters portrayed by Whitney Houston, Tupac Shakur, Taraji P. Henson, and many more, Jenifer cemented her status as the “Mother of Black Hollywood.”         &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an undiagnosed menatl illness stymies Jenifer’s career, culminating in a breakdown while filming &lt;em&gt;The Temptations&lt;/em&gt;, her quest for wholeness becomes a harrowing and inspiring tale, including revelations of bipolar disorder and sex addiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with no-holds-barred honesty and illustrated with more than forty color photographs, this gripping memoir is filled with insights gained through a unique life that offers a universal message: “Love yourself so that love will not be a stranger when it comes.”</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Foreword by Steve Harvey and afterword by David Foster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grammy-winning founder of the legendary pop/R&amp;amp;B/soul/funk/disco group tells his story and charts the rise of his legendary band in this sincere memoir that captures the heart and soul of an artist whose groundbreaking sound continues to influence music today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its dynamic horns, contrasting vocals, and vivid stage shows, Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire was one of the most popular acts of the late twentieth century—the band “that changed the sound of black pop” (&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;)—and its music continues to inspire modern artists including Usher, Jay-Z, Cee-Lo Green, and Outkast. At last, the band’s founder, Maurice White, shares the story of his success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in his seventies, White reflects on the great blessings music has brought to his life and the struggles he’s endured: his mother leaving him behind in Memphis when he was four; learning to play the drums with Booker T. Jones; moving to Chicago at eighteen and later Los Angeles after leaving the Ramsey Lewis Trio; forming EWF, only to have the original group fall apart; working with Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond; his diagnosis of Parkinson’s; and his final public performance with the group at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Through it all, White credits his faith for his amazing success and guidance in overcoming his many challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep Your Head to the Sky&lt;/em&gt; is an intimate, moving, and beautiful memoir from a man whose creativity and determination carried him to great success, and whose faith enabled him to savor every moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé&lt;/em&gt; uses political and pop-cultural references as a framework to explore 21st century black American womanhood and its complexities: performance, depression, isolation, exoticism, racism, femininity, and politics. The poems weave between personal narrative and pop-cultural criticism, examining and confronting modern media, consumption, feminism, and Blackness. This collection explores femininity and race in the contemporary American political climate, folding in references from jazz standards, visual art, personal family history, and Hip Hop. The voice of this book is a multifarious one: writing and rewriting bodies, stories, and histories of the past, as well as uttering and bearing witness to the truth of the present, and actively probing toward a new self, an actualized self. This is a book at the intersections of mythology and sorrow, of vulnerability and posturing, of desire and disgust, of tragedy and excellence.</description>

  <description>In this intricate and enthralling domestic drama the author of the “gossipy page-turner” (&lt;i&gt;Glamour&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Neighbors&lt;/i&gt; goes deep into a marriage in crisis, peeling back layers of secrets to discover where the relationship veered off course—and whether it is worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie and Frank Moore are happy… at least Josie thinks they are. As parents of two young girls in the Chicago suburbs, their days can be both busy and monotonous, and sometimes Josie wonders how she became a harried fortysomething mother rather than the driven career woman she once was. But Frank is a phenomenal father, he’s handsome and charismatic, and he still looks at his wife like she’s the beautiful woman he married more than a decade ago. Josie isn’t just happy—she’s lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one Saturday morning when Josie borrows her husband’s phone to make a quick call—and sees nine words that shatter her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Josie feels as if she is standing at the edge of a sharp precipice. As she looks back at pivotal moments in the relationship she believed would last forever, she is also plunging ahead, surprising everyone (especially herself) with how far she will go to uncover the extent of her husband’s devastating secret.</description>

  <description>As the mother of hip-hop superstar Kanye West, Donda West has watched her son grow from a brilliant baby boy with all the intimations of fame and fortune to one of the hottest rappers on the music scene. And she has every right to be proud: she raised her son with strong moral values, teaching him right from wrong and helping him become the man he is today. In &lt;i&gt;Raising Kanye&lt;/i&gt;, Donda not only pays homage to her famous son but reflects on all the things she learned about being his mother along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Featuring never-before-seen photos and compelling personal anecdotes, Donda's powerful and inspiring memoir reveals everything from the difficulties she faced as a single mother in the African-American community to her later experiences as Kanye's manager as he rose to superstardom. Speaking frankly about her son's reputation as a "Mama's Boy," and his memorable public outbursts about gay rights and President George W. Bush, Donda supports her son without exception, and here she shares the invaluable wisdom she has taken away from each experience -- passion, tolerance, patience, and above all, always telling the truth. Ultimately, she not only expresses what her famously talented son has meant to her but what he has meant to music and an entire generation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in contemporary Louisville, Leesa Cross-Smith’s mesmerizing first novel surrounding the death of a police officer is a requiem for marriage, friendship and family.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evi—a classically-trained ballerina—was nine months pregnant when her husband Eamon was killed in the line of duty on a steamy morning in July. Now, it is winter, and Eamon's adopted brother Dalton has moved in to help her raise six-month-old Noah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whiskey &amp;amp; Ribbons&lt;/em&gt; is told in three intertwining, melodic voices: Evi in present day, as she’s snowed in with Dalton during a freak blizzard; Eamon before his murder, as he prepares for impending fatherhood and grapples with the danger of his profession; and Dalton, as he struggles to make sense of his life next to Eamon’s, and as he decides to track down the biological father he’s never known.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the vein of Jojo Moyes’ After You, Whiskey &amp;amp; Ribbons explores the life that continues beyond loss, with a complicated brotherly dynamic reminiscent of Elizabeth Strout’s The Burgess Boys. It’s a meditation on grief, hope, motherhood, brotherhood and surrogate fatherhood. Above all, it’s a novel about what it means—and whether it’s possible—to heal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the riveting new novel from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of First Comes Love and Something Borrowed, three very different people must choose between their family and their values.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Browning is living the good life after marrying into Nashville’s elite. More recently, her husband made a fortune selling his tech business, and their adored son has been accepted to Princeton. Yet sometimes the middle-class small-town girl in Nina wonders if she’s strayed from the person she once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Volpe is a single dad working multiple jobs while struggling to raise his headstrong daughter, Lyla. His road has been lonely, long, and hard, but he finally starts to relax after Lyla earns a scholarship to Windsor Academy, Nashville’s most prestigious private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid so much wealth and privilege, Lyla doesn’t always fit in—and her overprotective father doesn’t help—but in most ways, she’s a typical teenaged girl, happy and thriving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one photograph, snapped in a drunken moment at a party, changes everything. As the image spreads like wildfire, the Windsor community is instantly polarized, buzzing with controversy and assigning blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the lies and scandal, Tom, Nina, and Lyla are forced together—all questioning their closest relationships, asking themselves who they really are, and searching for the courage to live a life of true meaning.</description>

  <description>In this honest and stunning novel, James Baldwin has given America a moving story of love in the face of injustice. Told through the eyes of Tish, a nineteen-year-old girl, in love with Fonny, a young sculptor who is the father of her child, Baldwin's story mixes the sweet and the sad. Tish and Fonny have pledged to get married, but Fonny is falsely accused of a terrible crime and imprisoned. Their families set out to clear his name, and as they face an uncertain future, the young lovers experience a kaleidoscope of emotions-affection, despair, and hope. In a love story that evokes the blues, where passion and sadness are inevitably intertwined, Baldwin has created two characters so alive and profoundly realized that they are unforgettably ingrained in the American psyche.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Affairs of the heart can be lethal in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Eric Jerome Dickey's latest sensual novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a low-level enforcer in Los Angeles, Ken Swift knows danger, but nowhere does he feel it more than in his tangled romances. Divorced from one woman, in love with another, and wrestling with a strong desire to get to know a third, his life is far from perfect, and it becomes all the more complicated when his troubled daughter resurfaces. Marguax is pregnant, and when she demands $50,000 for her shotgun wedding, the tension-filled father/daughter reunion escalates into a clashing of wills and desires that spread far beyond their family. As raw emotions surface, they ignite revenge, love, longing, desperation, and despair . . . and the flames just might be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the strong characters, heart-pounding action, and intense passion he is known for, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Eric Jerome Dickey lays bare a tale of lust and angst that will leave readers breathless.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TARGET: HEAD OF STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A leader has fallen, and the procession route from Capitol Hill to the White House is lined with hundreds of thousands of mourners. None feel the loss of a President more keenly than Alex Cross, who has devoted his life to the public good. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TARGET: UNITED STATES CABINET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sniper's bullet strikes a target in the heart of DC. Alex Cross's wife, Bree Stone, newly elevated chief of DC detectives, faces an ultimatum: solve the case, or lose the position for which she's worked her entire career. The Secret Service and the FBI deploy as well in the race to find the shooter. Alex is tasked by the new President to take a personal role with the FBI, leading an investigation unprecedented in scale and scope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TARGET: ALEX CROSS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex has a horrible premonition: is the sniper's strike only the beginning of a larger attack on the nation? It isn't long before his fears explode into life, and the nation plunges into a full-blown Constitutional crisis. His ingenuity, his training, and his capacity for battle are tested beyond limits in the most far-reaching and urgently consequential case of his life. As the rule of law is shattered by chaos, and Alex fights to isolate a suspect, Alex's loyalty may be the biggest danger of all.</description>

  <description>Only Detective Michael Bennett stands in the way of two cartels fighting for New York City's multimillion-dollar opioid trade. And they know where Bennett--and his family--lives. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; An anonymous tip about a crime in Upper Manhattan proves to be a setup. An officer is taken down--and, despite the attackers' efforts, it's not Michael Bennett. New York's top cop is not the only one at risk. One of Bennett's children sustains a mysterious injury. And a series of murders follows, each with a distinct signature, alerting Bennett to the presence of a professional killer with a flair for disguise.  Bennett taps his best investigators and sources, and they fan out across the five boroughs. But the leads they're chasing turn out to be phantoms. The assassin takes advantage of the chaos, enticing an officer into compromising Bennett, then luring another member of Bennett's family into even graver danger. Michael Bennett can't tell what's driving the assassin. But he can tell it's personal, and that it's part of something huge. Through twist after twist, he fights to understand exactly how he fits into the killer's plan, before he becomes the ultimate victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>An addictive psychological thriller about a group of women whose lives become unexpectedly connected when one of their newborns goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call themselves the May Mothers—a collection of new moms who gave birth in the same month. Twice a week, with strollers in tow, they get together in Prospect Park, seeking refuge from the isolation of new motherhood; sharing the fears, joys, and anxieties of their new child-centered lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the group’s members agree to meet for drinks at a hip local bar, they have in mind a casual evening of fun, a brief break from their daily routine. But on this sultry Fourth of July night during the hottest summer in Brooklyn’s history, something goes terrifyingly wrong: one of the babies is abducted from his crib. Winnie, a single mom, was reluctant to leave six-week-old Midas with a babysitter, but the May Mothers insisted that everything would be fine. Now Midas is missing, the police are asking disturbing questions, and Winnie’s very private life has become fodder for a ravenous media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though none of the other members in the group are close to the reserved Winnie, three of them will go to increasingly risky lengths to help her find her son. And as the police bungle the investigation and the media begin to scrutinize the mothers in the days that follow, damaging secrets are exposed, marriages are tested, and friendships are formed and fractured.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE STUNNING CONCLUSION TO THE BESTSELLING CURTIS BLACK SERIES &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The past never stays where it belongs...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curtis Black is no stranger to scandal. Throughout the decades, he has done much in the public eye, both good and evil. But what most people don't realize is that Curtis has been hiding a horrific childhood that has affected him in countless, unspeakable ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His buried past returns in an unwelcome visit when his estranged sister becomes alarmingly ill and his youngest child, twelve-year-old Curtina, becomes the kind of problem daughter that he never imagined she could be. This is only the beginning. The horror of Curtis's childhood secrets, as well as Curtina's wild and rebellious behavior, takes a critical toll on Curtis and the entire Black family. All the public scandals they've experienced over the years now seem like child's play compared to the turmoil they are facing in private. Who could have known that the deepest wounds would come from within?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The searing, unforgettable story of a young girl's resilience, by the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Prayers for the Stolen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearl's mother took her away from her family just weeks after she was born, and drove off to central Florida determined to begin a new life for herself and her daughter--in the parking lot next to a trailer park. Pearl grew up in the front seat of their '94 Mercury, while her mother lived in the back. Despite their hardships, mother and daughter both adjusted to life, making friends with the residents of the trailers and creating a deep connection to each other. All around them, Florida is populated with gun owners--those hunting alligators for sport, those who want to protect their families, and those who create a sense of danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in a gorgeous lyric all its own, &lt;i&gt;Gun Love&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a tough but optimistic young woman growing up in contemporary America, in the midst of its harrowing love affair with firearms.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Brad Parks delivers another riveting, emotionally powerful stand-alone domestic suspense thriller perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Couple Next Door&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What She Knew&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disaster,&lt;/i&gt; Melanie Barrick was once told, &lt;i&gt;is always closer than you know.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a lesson she learned the hard way growing up in the constant upheaval of foster care. But now that she's survived into adulthood--with a loving husband, a steady job, and a beautiful baby boy named Alex--she thought that turmoil was behind her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one Monday evening when she goes to pick up Alex from childcare only to discover he's been removed by Social Services. And no one will say why. It's a terrifying scenario for any parent, but doubly so for Melanie, who knows the unintended horrors of what everyone coldly calls "the system." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her nightmare mushrooms when she arrives home to learn her house has been raided by sheriff's deputies, who have found enough cocaine to send Melanie to prison for years. The evidence against her is overwhelming, and if Melanie can't prove her innocence, she'll lose Alex forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, assistant commonwealth's attorney Amy Kaye--who has been assigned Melanie's case--has her own troubles. She's been dogged by a cold case no one wants her to pursue: a serial rapist who has avoided detection by wearing a mask and whispering his commands. Over the years, he has victimized dozens of women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including Melanie. Yet now her attacker might be the key to her salvation . . . or her undoing.</description>

  <description>The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a web-design drone, and serendipity, sheer curiosity and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey have landed him a new gig working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore. But Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than its name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything. Instead they “check out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he has embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behaviour and roped his friends into helping him figure out just what’s going on. But once they take their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the secrets extend far beyond the walls of the bookstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evoking both the fairy-tale charm of Haruki Murakami and the enthusiastic novel-of-ideas wizardry of Neal Stephenson or Umberto Eco, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore&lt;/em&gt; is exactly what it sounds like—an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave.</description>

  <description>A hilarious and affecting essay collection about race, gender, and pop culture from celebrated stand-up comedian and WNYC podcaster Phoebe Robinson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe Robinson is a stand-up comic, which means that, often, her everyday experiences become points of comedic fodder. And as a black woman in America, she maintains, sometimes you need to have a sense of humor to deal with the absurdity you are handed on the daily. Robinson has experienced her fair share over the years: she's been unceremoniously relegated to the role of "the black friend," as if she is somehow the authority on all things racial; she's been questioned about her love of U2 and Billy Joel ("isn t that . . . white people music?"); she's been called "uppity" for having an opinion in the workplace; she's been followed around stores by security guards; and yes, people do ask her whether they can touch her hair all. the. time. Now, she's ready to take these topics to the page and she s going to make you laugh as she s doing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using her trademark wit alongside pop-culture references galore, Robinson explores everything from why Lisa Bonet is "Queen. Bae. Jesus," to breaking down the terrible nature of casting calls, to giving her less-than-traditional advice to the future female president, and demanding that the NFL clean up its act, all told in the same conversational voice that launched her podcast, "2 Dope Queens," to the top spot on iTunes. As personal as it is political, "You Can't Touch My Hair" examines our cultural climate and skewers our biases with humor and heart, announcing Robinson as a writer on the rise."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of &lt;i&gt;Room&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girls&lt;/i&gt;, a dazzling, tenderhearted debut about healing, family, and the exquisite wisdom of children, narrated by a seven-year-old boy who reminds us that sometimes the littlest bodies hold the biggest hearts and the quietest voices speak the loudest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squeezed into a coat closet with his classmates and teacher, first grader Zach Taylor can hear gunshots ringing through the halls of his school. A gunman has entered the building, taking nineteen lives and irrevocably changing the very fabric of this close-knit community. While Zach's mother pursues a quest for justice against the shooter's parents, holding them responsible for their son's actions, Zach retreats into his super-secret hideout and loses himself in a world of books and art. Armed with his newfound understanding, and with the optimism and stubbornness only a child could have, Zach sets out on a captivating journey towards healing and forgiveness, determined to help the adults in his life rediscover the universal truths of love and compassion needed to pull them through their darkest hours.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Diane Chamberlain delivers a thrilling, mind-bending novel about one mother's journey to save her child.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Carly Sears, a young woman widowed by the Vietnam war, receives the news that her unborn baby girl has a heart defect, she is devastated. It is 1970, and she is told that nothing can be done to help her child. But her brother-in-law, a physicist with a mysterious past, tells her that perhaps there is a way to save her baby. What he suggests is something that will shatter every preconceived notion that Carly has. Something that will require a kind of strength and courage she never knew existed. Something that will mean an unimaginable leap of faith on Carly's part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all for the love of her unborn child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dream Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a rich, genre-spanning, breathtaking novel about one mother's quest to save her child, unite her family, and believe in the unbelievable. Diane Chamberlain pushes the boundaries of faith and science to deliver a novel that you will never forget.</description>

  <description>NAACP nominee and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Beverly Jenkins continues her beloved Blessings series with a new heartwarming novel set in Henry Adams, Kansas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malachi “Mal” July has run into trouble in the past. With a reputation as a player, he’s now a recovering alcoholic and has made progress in redeeming himself in the eyes of his family and the citizens of Henry Adams, Kansas. He’s not only turned his diner into a profitable business, but also mentors the town’s foster kids. And he’s even staying true to one woman—Bernadine Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all it takes is a moment of pride to blind Mal to his blessings—a moment that makes him betray his friends and family, and lose Bernadine’s trust and love. Will he ever be able to win her forgiveness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Homecoming Weekend is fast approaching, and store owner Gary Clark is reunited with his high school sweetheart. All it takes is a few minutes for them to realize the spark is still there, but is it too late for second chances?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little help from the good people of Henry Adams may give both Mal and Gary the best second chance at the happiness they missed the first time around…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>After being together for ten years, Sylvie and Dan have all the trimmings of a happy life and marriage; they have a comfortable home, fulfilling jobs, beautiful twin girls, and communicate so seamlessly, they finish each other’s sentences. However, a trip to the doctor reveals they could live another 68 years together… and panic sets in. They never expected ‘until death do us part’ to mean seven decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of marriage survival, they quickly concoct a plan to keep their relationship fresh and exciting: they will create little surprises for each other so that their (extended) years together will never become boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in their pursuit to execute Project Surprise Me, mishaps arise and secrets are uncovered that start to threaten the very foundation of their unshakeable bond. When a scandal from the past is revealed that questions some important untold truths, they begin to wonder if they ever really knew each other after all…</description>

  <description>Detroiters need to get to know their neighbors better. Wait — maybe that should be, Detroiters should get to know their neighborhoods better. It seems like everybody thinks they know the neighborhoods here, but because there are so many, the definitions become too broad, the characteristics become muddled, the stories become lost. Edited by Aaron Foley, &lt;i&gt;The Detroit Neighborhood Guidebook&lt;/i&gt; contains essays by Zoe Villegas, Drew Philip, Hakeem Weatherspoon, Marsha Music, Ian Thibodeau, and dozens of others.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Voss family is anything but normal. They live in a repurposed church, newly baptized Dollar Voss. The once cancer-stricken mother lives in the basement, the father is married to the mother’s former nurse, the little half-brother isn’t allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there’s Merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn’t earned and secrets her family forces her to keep. While browsing the local antiques shop for her next trophy, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her—until she discovers that he’s completely unavailable. Merit retreats deeper into herself, watching her family from the sidelines when she learns a secret that no trophy in the world can fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up with the lies, Merit decides to shatter the happy family illusion that she’s never been a part of before leaving them behind for good. When her escape plan fails, Merit is forced to deal with the staggering consequences of telling the truth and losing the one boy she loves.</description>

  <description>Two Chinese-American sisters—Miranda, the older, responsible one, always her younger sister’s protector; Lucia, the headstrong, unpredictable one, whose impulses are huge and, often, life changing. When Lucia starts hearing voices, it is Miranda who must find a way to reach her sister. Lucia impetuously plows ahead, but the bitter constant is that she is, in fact, mentally ill. Lucia lives life on a grand scale, until, inevitably, she crashes to earth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Miranda leaves her own self-contained life in Switzerland to rescue her sister again—but only Lucia can decide whether she wants to be saved. The bonds of sisterly devotion stretch across oceans—but what does it take to break them?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Here Is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; is, at its heart, an immigrant story, and a young woman’s quest to find fulfillment and a life unconstrained by her illness. But it’s also an unforgettable, gut-wrenching story of the sacrifices we make to truly love someone—and when loyalty to one’s self must prevail over all.</description>

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</description>

  <description>For more than eight centuries, Persian mystic poet and Sufi master Jalaloddin Mohammed Balkhi Rumi—commonly referred to as simply Rumi—has enchanted and enthralled readers from every faith and background with his universal themes of love, friendship, and spirituality, which he seamlessly wove into evanescent poetry. Translated by renown Rumi expert Nader Khalili, over 120 poems—including twenty-one previously unpublished—have been carefully collected and curated in this beautifully illustrated edition. The verses herein perfectly express the spiritual quest and desire for a deeper understanding of not only ourselves, but also of our collective oneness as humankind.</description>

  <description>In this intricate and enthralling domestic drama, perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Affair&lt;/i&gt;, the internationally bestselling author of the “gossipy page-turner” (&lt;i&gt;Glamour&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Neighbors&lt;/i&gt; goes deep into a marriage in crisis, peeling back layers of secrets to discover where the relationship veered off course—and whether it is worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie and Frank Moore are happy…at least Josie thinks they are. As parents of two young girls in the Chicago suburbs, their days can be both busy and monotonous, and sometimes Josie wonders how she became a harried fortysomething mother rather than the driven career woman she once was. But Frank is a phenomenal father, he’s handsome and charismatic, and he still looks at his wife like she’s the beautiful woman he married more than a decade ago. Josie isn’t just happy—she’s lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one Saturday morning when Josie borrows her husband’s phone to make a quick call—and sees nine words that shatter her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Josie feels as if she is standing at the edge of a sharp precipice. As she looks back at pivotal moments in the relationship she believed would last forever, she is also plunging ahead, surprising everyone (especially herself) with how far she will go to uncover the extent of her husband’s devastating secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her “conversational writing style and a knack for making readers care about her characters” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;) bestselling author Sarah Pekkanen paints a vivid, kaleidoscopic portrait of a marriage before and during a crisis—and of a woman who fears that the biggest secret of all may be the one she’s hiding from herself.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;In partnership with We Need Diverse Books, thirteen of the most recognizable, diverse authors come together in this remarkable YA anthology featuring ten short stories, a graphic short story, and a one-act play from Walter Dean Myers never before in-print.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful--you are holding fresh ink. And not hot-off-the-press, still-drying-in-your-hands ink. Instead, you are holding twelve stories with endings that are still being written--whose next chapters are up to you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these stories are meant to be read. And shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen of the most accomplished YA authors deliver a label-defying anthology that includes ten short stories, a graphic novel, and a one-act play. This collection will inspire you to break conventions, bend the rules, and color outside the lines. All you need is fresh ink.</description>

  <description>Aaron Hernandez was a college All-American who became the youngest player in the NFL and later reached the Super Bowl. His every move as a tight end with the New England Patriots played out the headlines, yet he led a secret life--one that ended in a maximum-security prison. What drove him to go so wrong, so fast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the summers of 2012 and 2013, not long after Hernandez made his first Pro Bowl, he was linked to a series of violent incidents culminating in the death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All-American Murder&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to investigate Aaron Hernandez's first-degree murder conviction and the mystery of his own shocking and untimely death.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A major literary event: a newly published work from the author of the American classic &lt;em&gt;Their Eyes Were Watching God, &lt;/em&gt;with a foreword from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker, brilliantly illuminates the horror and injustices of slavery as it tells the true story of one of the last-known survivors of the Atlantic slave trade—abducted from Africa on the last "Black Cargo" ship to arrive in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1927, Zora Neale Hurston went to Plateau, Alabama, just outside Mobile, to interview eighty-six-year-old Cudjo Lewis. Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation’s history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo’s firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo’s past—memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the &lt;em&gt;Clotilda&lt;/em&gt;, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from Hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, &lt;em&gt;Barracoon&lt;/em&gt; masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.</description>

  <description>There's nothing tiny about murder! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Watch Tiny House on HGTV? Well, some of those miniature abodes are built on the Carter Ranch in Collierville, Tennessee, or so Nixie Culpepper has just been told, and she thinks they are just the cutest things! But her excitement is short lived when, not long after she lands at the ranch, she gets embroiled in a murder! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nixie, a polyglot and black belt martial artist, is also addicted to designer wear. And while she can protect herself, and her little furry mixed-breed, Alfie, from danger, her credit cards are always being assaulted. She's got a Japanese paternal grandmother who wants to be a YouTube star, and a Yugoslavian maternal grandfather who not only thinks he's royalty, but loves Elvis, has an arsenal of corny jokes, and corresponds with Nixie regularly on FaceTime. But the murder of Big Willie Carter puts a halt to everything, and it's up to Nixie to find out whodunit if she wants to leave Collierville and get back home to Connors Grove, New York with her brand new tiny house. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A fun new cozy series with Nixie Culpepper traveling the country with her dog and tiny house in tow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coming Soon: &lt;br /&gt;A Merry Branson Murder &lt;br /&gt;A Cherry Paonia Murder &lt;br /&gt;A Bright Star Lake Murder</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the riveting new novel from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;First Comes Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed&lt;/i&gt;, three very different people must choose between their family and their values.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Browning is living the good life after marrying into Nashville’s elite. More recently, her husband made a fortune selling his tech business, and their adored son has been accepted to Princeton. Yet sometimes the middle-class small-town girl in Nina wonders if she’s strayed from the person she once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Volpe is a single dad working multiple jobs while struggling to raise his headstrong daughter, Lyla. His road has been lonely, long, and hard, but he finally starts to relax after Lyla earns a scholarship to Windsor Academy, Nashville’s most prestigious private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid so much wealth and privilege, Lyla doesn’t always fit in—and her overprotective father doesn’t help—but in most ways, she’s a typical teenage girl, happy and thriving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one photograph, snapped in a drunken moment at a party, changes everything. As the image spreads like wildfire, the Windsor community is instantly polarized, buzzing with controversy and assigning blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the lies and scandal, Tom, Nina, and Lyla are forced together—all questioning their closest relationships, asking themselves who they really are, and searching for the courage to live a life of true meaning.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From stand-up comedian, actress, and breakout star of &lt;i&gt;Girls Trip&lt;/i&gt;, Tiffany Haddish, comes&lt;i&gt; The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt;, a sidesplitting, hysterical, edgy, and unflinching collection of (extremely) personal essays, as fearless as the author herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she’s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.</description>

  <description>Vanessa Jackson is just trying to get divorced, not pick up a new man; and certainly not her divorce attorney. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gibson Kincaid is trying to do right by his new client, but in all honestly, he wants to get Vanessa divorced... so he can have her to himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanessa's not-soon-enough-to-be ex-husband, Warren, isn't ready to let go of the young, naive woman he 'rescued' from a different life ten years ago. Though she and her girls are barely making it, life would be so much easier if she could divorce the sonofab#tch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gibson, the youngest of four Kincaid men, all attorneys at Kincaid Family law is the rebel. He's never going to do what Mother Sylvia "The Silver Shark" wants him to do. Instead of catering to high profile wealthy clients, Gibson chooses to serve the 'down on their luck' sector, earning him the nickname Community Lawyer. His career might implode before he has the chance to open his dream law firm, but come hell or high water, he's going to get his newest client divorced so she can start a new life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanessa swears she's ready to move on, to be rid of Warren Jackson, but she's holding on to a piece of her past that she doesn't want Gibson to know. When he finds out, it could change everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the sensational #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jojo Moyes, a new book featuring her iconic heroine of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;After You&lt;/i&gt;, Louisa Clark.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisa Clark arrives in New York ready to start a new life, confident that she can embrace this new adventure and keep her relationship with Ambulance Sam alive across several thousand miles. She is thrown into the world of the superrich Gopniks: Leonard and his much younger second wife, Agnes, and a never-ending array of household staff and hangers-on. Lou is determined to get the most out of the experience and throws herself into her job and New York life within this privileged world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before she knows what's happening, Lou is mixing in New York high society, where she meets Joshua Ryan, a man who brings with him a whisper of her past. In &lt;i&gt;Still Me&lt;/i&gt;, as Lou tries to keep the two sides of her world together, she finds herself carrying secrets--not all her own--that cause a catastrophic change in her circumstances. And when matters come to a head, she has to ask herself Who is Louisa Clark? And how do you reconcile a heart that lives in two places?</description>

  <description>Bakersfield, Georgia, 1958: Thirteen-year-old Tangy Mae Quinn is the sixth of ten fatherless siblings. She is the darkest-skinned among them and therefore the ugliest in her mother, Rozelle's, estimation, but she's also the brightest. Rozelle--beautiful, charismatic, and light-skinned--exercises a violent hold over her children. Fearing abandonment, she pulls them from school at the age of twelve and sends them to earn their keep for the household, whether in domestic service, in the fields, or at "the farmhouse" on the edge of town, where Rozelle beds local men for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Tangy Mae has been selected to be part of the first integrated class at a nearby white high school. She has a chance to change her life, but can she break from Rozelle's grasp without ruinous--even fatal--consequences?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful new statement about feminism today--written as a letter to a friend. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele &lt;/i&gt;is Adichie's letter of response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions--compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive--for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can "allow" women to have full careers, &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele&lt;/i&gt; goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The searing, unforgettable story of a young girl's resilience, by the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Prayers for the Stolen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pearl's mother took her away from her family just weeks after she was born, and drove off to central Florida determined to begin a new life for herself and her daughter--in the parking lot next to a trailer park. Pearl grew up in the front seat of their '94 Mercury, while her mother lived in the back. Despite their hardships, mother and daughter both adjusted to life, making friends with the residents of the trailers and creating a deep connection to each other. All around them, Florida is populated with gun owners--those hunting alligators for sport, those who want to protect their families, and those who create a sense of danger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     Written in a gorgeous lyric all its own, &lt;i&gt;Gun Love&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a tough but optimistic young woman growing up in contemporary America, in the midst of its harrowing love affair with firearms.</description>

  <description>Warned as a girl to keep her kisses to herself, Greer Galloway disobeys twice--once on her sixteenth birthday as she's kneeling in a pool of broken glass, and another time after a charming stranger named Embry Moore whisks her into the dazzling Chicago night. Both times she falls in love, and both times her heart is broken beyond repair. And so as an adult, she vows never to kiss--or to love again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's until the Vice President of the United States shows up at the university where she teaches, and asks for one thing: for her to meet with the hero-turned-President Maxen Colchester. Maxen, the soldier who was her first kiss in that pool of broken glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the other complication? The Vice President is none other than charming Embry Moore himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Greer finds herself caught between past and present, pleasure and pain--and two men who long for each other as much as they long for her. And as war and betrayal press ever closer, they tumble headlong into a passionate love affair that will change the world...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Priest&lt;/i&gt; comes a contemporary reimagining of the legend of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot--elegant, carnal, and unforgettable. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the perfect marriage has its dark side… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris and Will's marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris's happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</description>

  <description>A series of shootings exposes San Francisco to a methodical yet unpredictable killer, and a reluctant woman decides to put her trust in Sergeant Lindsay Boxer. The confidential informant’s tip leads Lindsay to disturbing conclusions, including that something has gone horribly wrong inside the police department itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hunt for the killer lures Lindsay out of her jurisdiction, and gets inside Lindsay in dangerous ways. Her friends and confidantes in the Women’s Murder Club warn Lindsay against taking the crimes too much to heart. With lives at stake, the detective can’t help but follow the case into ever more terrifying terrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decorated officer, loving wife, devoted mother, and loyal friend, Lindsay’s unwavering integrity has never failed her. But now she is confronting a killer who is determined to undermine it all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groomsman and his last-minute guest are about to discover if a fake date can go the distance in a fun and flirty debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to go to a wedding with a guy she gets stuck with in an elevator is something Alexa Monroe wouldn't normally do. But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff.
