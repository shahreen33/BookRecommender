  <description>The sixth book in the bestselling series of hauntingly true Canadian stories — back, and scarier than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her skin was peeling off her skull. Holes covered her nose and cheeks, revealing bone and teeth. Her flesh was rotten and grey. But worst of all were the thing’s eyes. Staring down at him with venom were two deep pools of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You heard me when I cried, pleaded and screamed for help,” she hissed, “but you and your kind ignored my pleas. Because of you and your superstitious ways, I died a horrible death in that swamp. Now I have come back to avenge my own death!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These terrifying true stories from across Canada will keep you up at night. A supernatural sea hag haunts an eerie marsh, a used book conjures up a ghostly figure, phantom hands terrorize children in a school playground . . . Prepare to be haunted!</description>

  <description>Don’t turn out the lights! Joel Sutherland returns for the frightful fifth installment of the Haunted Canada series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Nunavut, stories are passed down from generation to generation about the tarriassuit, shadow people who are sometimes felt or heard — but never seen except out of the corner of your eye . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organ at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Quebec City plays by itself, and Queen Elizabeth II reportedly saw a mysterious figure on the balcony during her visit in 1964 . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late at night, after Vancouver’s Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant has closed, a shadowy man in uniform is seen boarding the decommissioned trolley car that sits in the middle of the dining room . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than 25 terrifying new tales of ghostly encounters and mysterious phenomena, Haunted Canada 5 is guaranteed to keep kids across the country awake and screaming!</description>

  <description>The popular series of Canadian ghost stories is back and scarier than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An abandoned asylum in Victoria, the most filmed site in Canada, is alive with inexplicable sights and sounds. Multiple men are found decapitated in the woods near the Northwest Territories' Nahanni National Park Reserve . . . over a 50 year period. Guests at the Bytown Museum in Ottawa have heard cries coming from the doll exhibit, and report seeing the dolls move and wink. A mysterious figure stands at the edge of the rocky shores of Peggy's Cove, looking as if she is about to jump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ghoulishly good fourth book in the Haunted Canada series is full of more than 25 sinister, unsettling, and absolutely true ghost stories from across the country. Settle in for an evening of hair-raising thrills and chills in this brand-new volume of haunting encounters and unexplained incidents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bram Stoker Award-nominee Joel A. Sutherland brings a fresh approach to this favourite scary series.</description>

  <description>Named for the twelfth night after Christmas, the end of the Christmas season, &lt;i&gt;Twelfth Night&lt;/i&gt; plays with love and power. The Countess Olivia, a woman with her own household, attracts Duke (or Count) Orsino. Two other would-be suitors are her pretentious steward, Malvolio, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto this scene arrive the twins Viola and Sebastian; caught in a shipwreck, each thinks the other has drowned. Viola disguises herself as a male page and enters Orsino’s service. Orsino sends her as his envoy to Olivia—only to have Olivia fall in love with the messenger. The play complicates, then wonderfully untangles, these relationships.</description>

  <description>When two sisters fall into an abandoned mine, they're led to safety by their grandfather, who then suddenly disappears. When the girls return home, they learn that their grandfather had died hours before their rescue. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boy's parents buy an antique desk and put it in his bedroom. But the boy soon discovers that the desk is haunted, and he plunges into a night of sheer terror. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can fully explain these events. But in this spine-tingling book, you'll encounter these and many more &lt;u&gt;true&lt;/u&gt; ghost stories that have happened to &lt;u&gt;real&lt;/u&gt; kids.</description>

  <description>Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, share the stories of the gutsy women who have inspired them—women with the courage to stand up to the status quo, ask hard questions, and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She couldn’t have been more than seven or eight years old. “Go ahead, ask your question,” her father urged, nudging her forward. She smiled shyly and said, “You’re my hero. Who’s yours?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people—especially girls—have asked us that same question over the years. It’s one of our favorite topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HILLARY: Growing up, I knew hardly any women who worked outside the home. So I looked to my mother, my teachers, and the pages of Life magazine for inspiration. After learning that Amelia Earhart kept a scrapbook with newspaper articles about successful women in male-dominated jobs, I started a scrapbook of my own. Long after I stopped clipping articles, I continued to seek out stories of women who seemed to be redefining what was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHELSEA: This book is the continuation of a conversation the two of us have been having since I was little. For me, too, my mom was a hero; so were my grandmothers. My early teachers were also women. But I grew up in a world very different from theirs. My pediatrician was a woman, and so was the first mayor of Little Rock who I remember from my childhood. Most of my close friends’ moms worked outside the home as nurses, doctors, teachers, professors, and in business. And women were going into space and breaking records here on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensuring the rights and opportunities of women and girls remains a big piece of the unfinished business of the twenty-first century. While there’s a lot of work to do, we know that throughout history and around the globe women have overcome the toughest resistance imaginable to win victories that have made progress possible for all of us. That is the achievement of each of the women in this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did they do it? The answers are as unique as the women themselves. Civil rights activist Dorothy Height, LGBTQ trailblazer Edie Windsor, and swimmer Diana Nyad kept pushing forward, no matter what. Writers like Rachel Carson and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie named something no one had dared talk about before. Historian Mary Beard used wit to open doors that were once closed, and Wangari Maathai, who sparked a movement to plant trees, understood the power of role modeling. Harriet Tubman and Malala Yousafzai looked fear in the face and persevered. Nearly every single one of these women was fiercely optimistic—they had faith that their actions could make a difference. And they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To us, they are all gutsy women—leaders with the courage to stand up to the status quo, ask hard questions, and get the job done. So in the moments when the long haul seems awfully long, we hope you will draw strength from these stories. We do. Because if history shows one thing, it’s that the world needs gutsy women.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning founder of JUMP Math&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Things Being Equal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; is a proven guide to succeeding in math, and a passionate argument for why this success can and must be available to the majority instead of the privileged few. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, John Mighton has developed strategies for fostering intellectual potential in all children through learning math. Math, Mighton says, provides us with mental tools of incredible power. When we learn math we learn to see patterns, to think logically and systematically, to draw analogies, to perceive risk, to understand cause and effect--among many other critical skills. Yet we tolerate and in fact expect a vast performance gap in math among students, and live in a world where many adults aren't equipped with these crucial tools. This learning gap is unnecessary, dangerous and tragic, he cautions, and it has led us to a problem of intellectual poverty which is apparent everywhere--in fake news, political turmoil, floundering economies, even in erroneous medical diagnoses. &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;All Things Being Equal&lt;/i&gt;, Mighton argues that math study is an ideal starting point to break down social inequality and empower individuals to build a smarter, kinder, more equitable world. Bringing together the latest cognitive research and incremental learning strategies, Mighton goes deep into the classroom and beyond to offer a hopeful--and urgent--vision for a numerate society.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, KG, KT, OM, GBE has been at the forefront of British public life since he married Princess Elizabeth in 1947. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the seventy years since, his wit (and the occasional ‘gaffe’) has continued to endear him to the nation, as he travelled the world taking his unique and charmingly British sense of humour to its far-flung corners. Hailed as a god by a tribe in Vanuatu, the Prince has had his fair share of brickbats from the media nearer home, but his outspokenness never fails to raise laughs – and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From notorious one-liners to less newsworthy witticisms and from plain speaking to blunt indifference, the Prince does what we all wish we could do now and again – forgets polite conversation and says what he thinks. In the year in which the Prince has stepped down from his royal duties, this joyous and timely book celebrates his wry humour and supremely wicked wit.</description>

  <description>Errol the adventurous little mouse takes to the sky when he meets a young girl, Natasha, playing with a toy airplane. Later, when Errol is left alone, he decides to fly Natasha's toy plane and begins a magical journey that takes him back in time to one night in 1940. He meets up with Dan, a radio operator on a full-sized Hudson bomber, and gets to accompany the crew on their late night, top-secret flight across the Atlantic. When an enemy plane appears over Ireland and threatens the safety of crew and craft, only Errol can save them from disaster.</description>

  <description>Tudor-era England, the deeply rural county of Suffolk, to be specific. Queen Elizabeth I is on the Throne. In the small village of Bungay, life sits in an undisturbed status quo; Peasants labour over backbreaking work tilling the fields by hand, the Merchant Class preside over looms and textile traders and Bungay Castle lays peacefully dormant as it has for the centuries passed since Hugh Bigod was pulled from it by Royal Guard to face execution after a failed rebellion against King Henry II...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but one fateful early August night in 1577, peace is disturbed in this unassuming village, when a Beast tears through the Church doors; inside, the Beast is said to have feasted upon four unsuspecting worshippers, before vanishing and reappearing in nearby Blythburgh where the Beast's white hot, scorched-in Claw marks can still be seen on the Doors of The Holy Trinity Church to this very day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say the Beast is a big Demon Dog, eight-feet tall when on all-fours with fur as black as tar. Others say its Eyes burn with the white hot flames of Hell itself. Rumours abound and before you know it perhaps the most legendary of all British mythical beasts is born: &lt;i&gt;Black Shuck&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party—Jagmeet Singh—comes a personal and heartfelt story about family and overcoming adversity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October 2017, Jagmeet Singh was elected as the first visible minority to lead a major federal political party in Canada. The historic milestone was celebrated across the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month earlier, in the lead up to his election, Jagmeet held community meet-and-greets across Canada. At one such event, a disruptive heckler in the crowd hurled accusations at him. Jagmeet responded by calmly calling for all Canadians to act with “love and courage” in the face of hate. That response immediately went viral, and people across the country began asking, “Who is Jagmeet Singh? And why ‘love and courage’?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This personal and heartfelt memoir is Jagmeet’s answer to that question. In it, we are invited to walk with him through childhood to adulthood as he learns powerful, moving, and sometimes traumatic lessons about hardship, addiction, and the impact of not belonging. We meet his strong family, including his mother, who teaches him that “we are all one; we are all connected,” a valuable lesson that has shaped who he is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story is not a political memoir. This is a story of family, love, and courage, and how strengthening the connection between us all is the way to building a better world.</description>

  <description>Zane Obispo's new life on a beautiful secluded tropical island, complete with his family and closest friends, should be perfect. But he can't control his newfound fire skills yet (inherited from his father, the Maya god Hurakan); there's a painful rift between him and his dog ever since she became a hell hound; and he doesn't know what to do with his feelings for Brooks. One day he discovers that by writing the book about his misadventures with the Maya gods, he unintentionally put other godborn children at risk. Unless Zane can find the godborns before the gods do, they will be killed. To make matters worse, Zane learns that Hurakan is scheduled to be executed. Zane knows he must rescue him, no matter the cost. Can he accomplish both tasks without the gods detecting him, or will he end up a permanent resident of the underworld?&lt;br /&gt;In this cleverly plotted sequel to The Storm Runner, the gang is back together again with spirited new characters, sneaky gods, unlikely alliances, and secrets darker than Zane could ever have imagined. Secrets that will change him forever.</description>

  <description>Newfoundland and Labrador has been the site of hundreds of shipwrecks throughout the last two centuries. The area has had many more shipwrecks than Sable Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipwrecks on these treacherous coasts were frequent. Every year steamers and other types of vessels mistook their positions and went to their doom on the rocks. Many of the accidents happened during the summer and fall, when the weather is foggy but comparatively mild. The strong currents that drove vessels miles off their course and the lack of foghorns and lighthouses were all major contributing factors to the loss of shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marine Disasters and Shipwrecks of Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/i&gt; was originally published in 1986. Meanwhile, so many new photographs and stories have since surfaced that it was decided to split the work into two separate volumes in chronological order, one from 1822 to 1938 and the second from 1939 to 1989. These two volumes are being reprinted in 2004 with additional stories and photographs, this time from 1822 to 1945, and from 1945 to 1998. &lt;i&gt;Marine Disasters and Shipwrecks Volume I&amp;lt;,i&amp;gt; is the first of these two volumes.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fans of RaeAnne Thayne and Debbie Macomber will love this &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author's latest holiday romance about enemies-to-lovers who fall for each other in a small Massachusetts coastal town. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evangeline Christmas will do anything to save her year-round Christmas store, Holiday House, when high-powered real-estate developer Caine Elliot uses his money and influence to push through his competing property next door. When her last desperate attempt to stop him fails, she gambles everything on a proposition she prays the handsome, blue-eyed player can't refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caine agrees to Evie's bargain because how hard can it be to fulfill three wishes on the Angel Tree at Holiday House? The wishes have him reliving the Christmases of his past and taking part in the holiday festivities of Christmas present. But just when he begins to believe Evie might be his Christmas future, dark secrets from his past are revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the last wish on the Angel Tree be enough to give Caine and Evie the happy ending they deserve?</description>

  <description>The Shroud of Prophecy tests fate to discover what happens when the path of good and right, the triumph of light over darkness, the only path to salvation… fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves Mathias. So naturally, when he discovers it’s his destiny to save the world, he dives in head first, pulling his best friend Aaslo along for the ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathias is thrilled for the adventure! There’s nothing better than a road beneath his feet and adventure in the air. Aaslo, on the other hand, has never cared for the world beyond the borders of his sleepy village and would be much happier alone and in the woods. But, someone has to keep the Chosen One’s head on his shoulders and his feet on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out saving the world isn’t as easy, or exciting, as it sounds in the stories. Mathias is more than willing to place his life on the line, but Aaslo would love nothing more than to forget about all the talk of arcane bloodlines and magical fae creatures. When the going gets rough, folks start to believe their only chance for survival is to surrender to the forces of evil, which isn’t how the stories go. At all. To make matters worse Aaslo is beginning to fear that he may have lost his mind…</description>

  <description>In July 2015, a young black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over for a minor traffic violation in rural Texas. Minutes later she was arrested and jailed. Three days later, she committed suicide in her cell. What went wrong? &lt;i&gt;Talking to Strangers&lt;/i&gt; is all about what happens when we encounter people we don't know, why it often goes awry, and what it says about us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we make sense of the unfamiliar? Why are we so bad at judging someone, reading a face, or detecting a lie? Why do we so often fail to 'get' other people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through a series of puzzles, encounters and misunderstandings, from little-known stories to infamous legal cases, Gladwell takes us on a journey through the unexpected. You will read about the spy who spent years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon, the man who saw through the fraudster Bernie Madoff, the suicide of the poet Sylvia Plath and the false conviction of Amanda Knox. You will discover that strangers are never simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one shows us who we are like Malcolm Gladwell. Here he sets out to understand why we act the way we do, and how we all might know a little more about those we don't.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Aidan Cassie, the creator of &lt;i&gt;Sterling, Best Dog Ever&lt;/i&gt;, employs her pitch-perfect humor and heartwarming illustrations here again to help little ones love themselves at any size in &lt;i&gt;Little Juniper Makes It BIG&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Juniper lacks in size, she makes up for in heart. And her heart is dead-set on growing up and getting taller. She's tired of having to reach for the cookie jar or use a stepping stool for the toilet. Everything in Juniper's world seems to be made for adults. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juniper is industrious, however, and builds several silly contraptions to help reach her goals. But it isn't until she makes a fun new friend at school, Clove, who is even smaller than Juniper, that she is able to see her world from a new perspective--and appreciate all sizes, big or small.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Blythes Are Quoted&lt;/i&gt; is the last work of fiction by the internationally celebrated author of &lt;i&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/i&gt;. Intended by L.M. Montgomery to be the ninth volume in her bestselling series featuring her beloved heroine Anne – and delivered to her publisher on the very day she died – it has never before been published in its entirety.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This rediscovered volume marks the final word of a writer whose work continues to fascinate readers all over the world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Adultery, illegitimacy, revenge, murder, and death – these are not the first terms we associate with L.M. Montgomery. But in &lt;i&gt;The Blythes Are Quoted&lt;/i&gt;, completed at the end of her life,the author brings topics such as these to the fore.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Intended by Montgomery to be the ninth volume in her bestselling series featuring Anne Shirley Blythe, &lt;i&gt;The Blythes Are Quoted&lt;/i&gt; takes Anne and her family a full two decades beyond anything else she published about them, and some of its subject matter is darker than we might expect.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Divided into two sections, one set before and one after the Great War of 1914–1918, it contains fifteen short stories set in and around the Blythes’ Prince Edward Island community of Glen St. Mary. Binding these stories are sketches featuring Anne and Gilbert Blythe discussing poems by Anne and their middle son, Walter, who dies as a soldier in the war. By blending together poetry, prose, and dialogue in this way, Montgomery was at the end of her career experimenting with storytelling methods in an entirely new manner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This publication of Montgomery's rediscovered original work – previously published only in severely abridged form as &lt;i&gt;The Road to Yesterday&lt;/i&gt; – invites readers to return to her earlier books with a renewed appreciation and perspective &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A therapist creates moving portraits of five of her most memorable patients, men and women she considers psychological heroes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Gildiner is a bestselling memoirist, a novelist, and a psychologist in private practice for twenty-five years. In &lt;i&gt;Good Morning, Monster&lt;/i&gt;, she focuses on five patients who overcame enormous trauma--people she considers heroes. With a novelist's storytelling gift, Gildiner recounts the details of their struggles, their paths to recovery, and her own tale of growth as a therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five cases include a successful but lonely musician suffering sexual dysfunction; a young woman whose father abandoned her and her siblings in a rural cottage; an Indigenous man who'd endured great trauma at a residential school; a young woman whose abuse at the hands of her father led to a severe personality disorder; and a glamorous workaholic whose negligent mother had greeted her each morning with "Good morning, Monster."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each patient presents a mystery, one that will only be unpacked over years. They seek Gildiner's help to overcome an immediate challenge in their lives, but discover that the source of their suffering has been long buried. It will take courage to face those realities, and creativity and resourcefulness from their therapist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each patient embodies self-reflection, stoicism, perseverance, and forgiveness as they work unflinchingly to face the truth. Gildiner's account of her journeys with them is moving, insightful, and sometimes humorous. It offers a behind-the-scenes look into the therapist's office and explains how the process can heal even the most unimaginable wounds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With interest in the royal couple at a new peak thanks to the hit TV series &lt;i&gt;The Crown&lt;/i&gt;, Ingrid Seward reveals the real story of the marriage of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When a young Princess Elizabeth met and fell in love with the dashing Naval Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, it wasn't without its problems. The romance between the sailor prince and the young princess brought a splash of colour to a nation still in the grip of post-war austerity. When they married in Westminster Abbey in November 1947, there were 3000 guests, including six kings and seven queens. Within five years, as Queen Elizabeth II, she would ascend to the throne and later be crowned in front of millions watching through the new medium of television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Throughout her &lt;b&gt;record-breaking reign&lt;/b&gt;, she relied on the formidable partnership she had made with her consort. Now, after &lt;b&gt;70 years of their marriage&lt;/b&gt;, acclaimed royal biographer Ingrid Seward sheds new light on their relationship and its impact on their family and on the nation.&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;My Husband and I&lt;/i&gt;, we discover the challenges faced by Prince Philip as he has had to learn to play second fiddle to the Queen in all their public engagements, but we also get a revealing insight into how their relationship operates &lt;b&gt;behind closed doors&lt;/b&gt;. As the years have gone by, there have been rumours of marital troubles, fierce debates over how to bring up their children, and they have had to deal with family traumas - from scandalous divorces to shocking deaths - in the full glare of the public eye. But somehow, their relationship has endured and provided a model of constancy to inspire all around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is not only a vivid portrait of a hugely important marriage, it is a celebration of the power of love. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>An anthology of stories and poetry written by Canadian LGBTQ2 authors who are immigrants, refugees, or Canada-born. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What does it mean to be LGBTQ2 in Canada? The only possible answer to that question is one given in many voices. That is exactly what this book offers. There is struggle in these stories and poems, but there is also strength and resilience, compassion and determination. Woven together these voices leave me with a sense of hopefulness: a belief that the creativity and fierce commitment of our community will carry us forward as we work to create a Canada that lives up to the dream of freedom and safety it represents to so many people around the world.” — Robin Stevenson, author of Pride: Celebrating Diversity and Community&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: &lt;br /&gt;The anthology pieces are diverse with authors who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and 2-Spirited. It also includes stunning artwork by LGBTQ artists and allies. — Rainbow Refugee Society &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors &amp;amp; Artists: &lt;br /&gt;Authors in this anthology include Teryl Berg, Kyle Chen, Wendy Judith Cutler, Corrie Hope Furst, Kevin Henry, Anne Hofland, Chantal Hughes, Masaki Kidokoro, Dale Lee Kwong, Austin Lee, JL Lori, Eka Nasution (narrator), Adam Nixon, Rainer Oktovianus (narrator), Gail Marlene Schwartz, Caelan Sinclair, LS Stone, Sosania Tomlinson, E.T. Turner, and Hayley Zacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artwork by Joni Danielson, Wokie Clark Fraser, Austin Lee, Trinity Lindenau, and Rainer Oktovianus.</description>

  <description>Nearly two decades ago, Jean-Luc Picard took command of the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise™&lt;/i&gt; NCC-1701-D. The captain knew it was an honor without equal. His new command bore the name of &lt;i&gt;Enterprise.&lt;/i&gt; The people who had commanded other like-named starships had gone down in Starfleet's annals. Some officers would be intimidated, but they would not have been given command of &lt;i&gt;Enterprise.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On her first mission, the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; was sent to Farpoint Station. A simple, straightforward investigation. Perfect for a crew that had never served together. Then there was Q. An omnipotent lifeform that seemed bent on placing obstacle after obstacle in the ship's -- and in particular in Picard's -- way. And it hadn't ended with that first mission. When he was least expected, Q would appear. Pushing, prodding, testing. At times needling captain and crew with seemingly silly, pointless, and maddening trifles. Then it would turn all too serious, and the survival of Picard's crew was in Q's hands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Why was it today that Picard was remembering the day he took command of the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;-D? Now he commanded a new ship, the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;-E. His crew was different. There was nothing about Gorsach that in the least resembled Farpoint. But Picard couldn't shake the feeling that something all too familiar was going on. All too awful. All too Q.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A vibrant, compelling memoir from a remarkable young woman that bravely reveals the real-life havoc wrought by depression and the urgent search for solutions. Illuminating, completely engaging—it's essential reading for all since we all know someone whose life, family or friends are touched by the disease that directly afflicts a fifth of Canadians.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her early twenties, while outwardly thriving in her dream job and enjoying warm familial support and a strong social network, award-winning journalist Anna Mehler Paperny found herself trapped by feelings of failure and despair. Her first suicide attempt—ingesting a deadly mix of sleeping pills and antifreeze—landed her in the ICU, followed by weeks of enforced detention that ran the gamut of horrifying, boring, hilarious, and absurd. This was Anna's entry into the labyrinthine psychiatric care system responsible for providing care to millions of Canadians.&lt;br /&gt; As she struggled to survive the psych ward and as an outpatient—enduring the "survivor's" shame of facing concerned family, friends, and co-workers; finding (or not) the right therapist, the right meds; staying healthy, insured, and employed—Anna could not help but turn her demanding journalist's eye on her condition and on the system in which she found herself. She set off on a quest to "know her enemy," interviewing leading practitioners in the field across Canada and the US—from psychiatrists to neurological experts, brain-mapping pioneers to heroic family practitioners, and others dabbling in novel hypotheses. She reveals in courageously frank detail her own experiences with the pharmacological pitfalls and side effects of long-term treatment, and offers moving case studies of conversations with others, opening wide a window into how we treat (and fail to treat) the disease that accounts for more years swallowed up by disability than any other in the world.</description>

      <![CDATA[A great comic that, while lacking in action, does a fairly good job of trying to teach a life lesson. True heroism isn't about doing great deeds for recognition; it's about the impact on at least one person and changing at least their world for the better.]]>

  <description>Before the FBI, before the X-Files, they were just two teenagers in search of the truth. On Martha's Vineyard, a young Fox Mulder investigates something strange happening on the island, while in San Diego, 13-year-old Dana Scully looks into the shocking murder of her teacher. Two kids, two mysteries, one conspiracy that threatens the future of humanity.</description>

      <![CDATA[Artwork: excellent, dialogue: on point, overall enjoyability: top-notch. As this is a prequel to the first Captain America film I think that any MCU fan would appreciate getting this comic (and the series that follows which I plan on doing when I have the opportunity). It is worth reading.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the international mega-bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck comes a counterintuitive guide to the problems of hope. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published &lt;i&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck&lt;/i&gt;, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;Everthing Is F*cked&lt;/i&gt;, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.</description>

While it's dense and may not be fairly groundbreaking, it does do a good job of mashing together different philosophies and explaining them in relatively plain language.

  <description>Fascinated by our pervasive fear of dead bodies, mortician Caitlin Doughty embarks on a global expedition to discover how other cultures care for the dead. From Zoroastrian sky burials to wish-granting Bolivian skulls, she investigates the world’s funerary customs and expands our sense of what it means to treat the dead with dignity. Her account questions the rituals of the American funeral industry—especially chemical embalming—and suggests that the most effective traditions are those that allow mourners to personally attend to the body of the deceased. Exquisitely illustrated by artist Landis Blair, &lt;em&gt;From Here to Eternity&lt;/em&gt; is an adventure into the morbid unknown, a fascinating tour through the unique ways people everywhere confront mortality.</description>

  <description>Chicken Soup for the Soul: Life Lessons from the Cat: 101 Tales of Family, Friendship and Fun&lt;br /&gt;by Amy Newmark (Goodreads Author)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can’t help but be changed when you have a cat. They teach us about devotion, loyalty, and the value of living in the moment. They show us how to appreciate every day, and somehow, in those deep eyes, we learn about ourselves as well, becoming better humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our feline friends teach us many lessons, from their days as a kitten to their quiet senior years. Along the way they keep us company, provide unconditional love, and share in the ups and downs of our lives. These 101 real-life stories will delight cat lovers of all kinds. You’ll laugh a lot, tear up at times, and nod your head in recognition as you read these tales about the wonderful experience of sharing life with a cat. Part of the proceeds go to support the work of American Humane, providing a better life for cats everywhere.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;*NOW AN INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Witty and entertaining."--Sarah Knight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Laugh-out-loud."--Steve Brusatte&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AN EXHILARATING JOURNEY THROUGH THE MOST CREATIVE AND CATASTROPHIC F*CK-UPS OF HUMAN HISTORY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Modern humans have come a long way in the seventy thousand years they've walked the earth. Art, science, culture, trade--on the evolutionary food chain, we're true winners. But it hasn't always been smooth sailing, and sometimes--just occasionally--we've managed to truly f*ck things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together history, science, politics and pop culture, &lt;em&gt;Humans&lt;/em&gt; offers a panoramic exploration of humankind in all its glory, or lack thereof. From Lucy, our first ancestor, who fell out of a tree and died, to General Zhou Shou of China, who stored gunpowder in his palace before a lantern festival, to the Austrian army attacking itself one drunken night, to the most spectacular fails of the present day, &lt;em&gt;Humans&lt;/em&gt; reveals how even the most mundane mistakes can shift the course of civilization as we know it. Lively, wry and brimming with brilliant insight, this unique compendium offers a fresh take on world history and is one of the most entertaining reads of the year.</description>

  <description>Lucien and Natasa might have slipped toward love, if her past in Sarajevo hadn't caught up with her. Natasa finds work modeling for a painter in Toronto, but he is murdered. Natasa disappears that night, running for her life. Her vanishing is connected to the discovery of a video, secretly filmed in a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war. Butterfly is a novel that charts a controlled descent through the dark legacy of war and the underbelly of the global art scene ... into a world ruled by a desperate hope for impossible redemption.</description>

  <description>"A sweet and sexy romp that will leave you smiling from ear to ear..." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;—RT Book Reviews, TOP PICK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Overnight Billionaire...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Carson Frost inherits a confectionary that rakes in billions but is too cash-strapped to last another sixty days, he agrees to take a loan from his late father's rival. There are two catches: Carson has to sign over a permanent stake in the company and marry the man's daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concocts a Fake Bride...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks before the wedding, he gets cold feet and claims he's in love with someone else. The investor says he'll still hand over the cash if Carson takes a stroll down the aisle—with the woman who owns his heart. Since he isn't even dating anyone, Carson panics. Where is he going to find a bride willing to jilt him at the altar on such short notice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Whips Up a Little Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Hope is an actress happy for any paying gig, but jilting a hottie in public isn't what she had in mind. Still, she needs rent, and he's in a bind. How hard can it be? While playing at matrimony, suddenly their intimacy isn't so fake. Ella can't help but fantasize that Carson is her groom and they will live happily ever after. But once his company is safe, will he want her anymore?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;Misadventures is a romantic series of spicy standalone novels, each written or co-written by some of the best names in romance. The stories are scandalous, refreshing, and, of course, incredibly sexy. They’re the perfect bedside read, a ‘quick blush’ for the reader who loves a page-turning romance.</description>

  <description>Hotel clerk Abby Medford has always enjoyed the quiet solitude of the night shift. The long, boring hours allow her time to study her law books. But when bad-boy-rocker Lucas Ford checks into the penthouse suite one night and demands Abby personally deliver his room service request, her formerly quiet nights are quickly filled with Lucas's erotic games. &lt;br /&gt; But as Abby soon learns, if she thinks she can indulge her innermost desires with Lucas without giving him her heart, she's dead wrong.&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;Misadventures is a romantic series of spicy standalone novels, each written or co-written by some of the best names in romance. The stories are scandalous, refreshing, and, of course, incredibly sexy. They’re the perfect bedside read, a ‘quick blush’ for the reader who loves a page-turning romance.</description>

  <description>Sam O’Donovan is bored with his stale life in Montana. When his brother-in-law offers him a great job and a cut of the McCray business in Colorado, he’s ecstatic. This is the change he needs. As for beautiful Sydney Buchanan resurfacing? That’s icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney’s back for one reason and one reason only. She needs to win as many purses as she can to help her parents run their struggling ranch in Nevada. She doesn’t bank on running into Sam O’Donovan. All the sparks they shared five years earlier are still there, but so much else has changed. If only Sam could understand the decisions she made during their time apart…and trust her.</description>

  <description>"An inventive treat, with humour, heart, and a hint of magic." Kirkus review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Russian girl adopts a very large, very unusual “puppy” in Maroney’s debut middle-grade novel. Although 9-year-old Natasha loves her grandfather, Deda, she doesn’t like having to leave her little Russian village to stay with him in the impoverished, crime-ridden town of Horridgrad while her father is away on an engineering job. The town is a scary place, under the thumb of crime boss Ivan the Horrid and a corrupt mayor. So Natasha is delighted when Deda buys her a playful, snow-white puppy in the marketplace. She names him Mishka, and the animal grows at such an astonishing rate that some in town even wonder if he’s a dog at all...When Mishka helps to rescue children from an icy pond, stops a robbery, and keeps Ivan’s thugs away, he makes the town’s residents feel safer, and they begin to join together to improve their community. Irate Ivan, losing his grip on the town, schemes with the flunky mayor to get rid of Mishka. Maroney sets this delightful story in the present day, but gives it the unforced charm of an old-world folk tale, with moments of real hilarity, subtle suggestions of mystery and magic, and an inventive take on the theme of good triumphing over evil." - Kirkus review.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28550610-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-s-stone" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The landmark publishing event of 2015 -- a full-colour illustrated edition of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with breathtaking illustrations by Jim Kay, winner of the Kate Greenaway medal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, J.K. Rowling's beloved Harry Potter books will be presented in lavishly illustrated full-color editions. Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay's dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation's favourite children's book -- Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Jim Kay has created over 100 stunning illustrations, making this deluxe format a perfect gift as much for a child being introduced to the series, as for the dedicated fan. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling's timeless classic, Jim Kay's glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous -- or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</description>

  <description>Organizational culture isn't just a hot topic-it's an untapped asset and potential liability for all businesses. And yet, for all its potential to make or break, few know how to manage cultures with proficiency. Culture Your Culture: Innovating Experiences @Work provides the much-needed "how-to" with Design of Work Experience (DOWE). Tapping into human-centered design, interdisciplinary innovation concepts, and other research, this leading edge approach partners employees and their employers in unprecedented ways to co-create solutions and differentiating experiences that are customized, relevant, and profoundly impactful to the organizations for which they are intended-all while building employee engagement, learning agility, and capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be open to changing mindsets, for this is not your typical business book. Part-business case, part-instructional, and part-commentary, the guidance offered here puts your organization--not some detached case studies-at the center to envision how DOWE can help you design solutions and experiences unique to your context. Culture will no longer be esoteric or intangible, but overt, meaningful, fully leveraged, and truly experienced. No more hacking through trial and error to a culture that lacks sustainability. We can practice the management of culture and organizational change through lived experiences, with intention, rigor, and discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaders, managers, teams, and employees alike will benefit from understanding the need for this approach, how it's defined, why it works, and what to do to successfully tackle business challenges and positively influence lives with this innovative model-if you are willing to do the work to get there.</description>

      <![CDATA[Good book, even if the information in it is, for the most part out of date. Still, in all, it can be used as a starting point if only to look up points to see whether they've upgraded the information of having subsequently discounted it as inaccurate.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of the Canada Reads–nominated &lt;i&gt;The Bone Cage&lt;/i&gt; tackles the ups and downs of amateur hockey, from a mother’s point of view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 570,000 people are registered in Hockey Canada and over 600,000 in Hockey USA. It’s a national obsession. But what does that really mean when your child wants to play on a team? As a former varsity athlete and university instructor teaching sport literature, novelist Angie Abdou is no stranger to sports obsession, but she finds herself conflicted when faced with the reality of the struggles, joys, and strains of having a child in amateur hockey. In &lt;i&gt;Home Ice&lt;/i&gt;, Abdou charts a full season of life as an Atom-level hockey mom, from summer hockey camp to end-of-season tournaments. With equal parts humour and anguish, she offers a nuanced portrait of today’s hockey parent. Her revealing stories and careful research of an often troubling sport culture offer a compellingly honest and complex insider’s view of parenting today’s young athlete in a competitive and high-pressure culture.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this book. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a view differing from the vast majority of the paranormal shows on television these days. The fact that it sits you down and will explain ghost properly to the reader is something that can really be enjoyed.]]>

  <description>How did a raw chicken get inside Yasmany's locker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sal Vidon meets Gabi Real for the first time, it isn't under the best of circumstances. Sal is in the principal's office for the third time in three days, and it's still the first week of school. Gabi, student council president and editor of the school paper, is there to support her friend Yasmany, who just picked a fight with Sal. She is determined to prove that somehow, Sal planted a raw chicken in Yasmany's locker, even though nobody saw him do it and the bloody poultry has since mysteriously disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sal prides himself on being an excellent magician, but for this sleight of hand, he relied on a talent no one would guess . . . except maybe Gabi, whose sharp eyes never miss a trick. When Gabi learns that he's capable of conjuring things much bigger than a chicken--including his dead mother--and she takes it all in stride, Sal knows that she is someone he can work with. There's only one slight problem: their manipulation of time and space could put the entire universe at risk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sassy entropy sweeper, a documentary about wedgies, a principal who wears a Venetian bauta mask, and heaping platefuls of Cuban food are just some of the delights that await in this mind-blowing novel gift-wrapped in love and laughter.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jasmine Pritchett needs a job. A pathway to financial independence. When Transform, the local gym, initiates an expansion to offer fitness classes, she sees her opportunity. Armed with several instructor certifications and even more persistence, she finds herself interviewing for the job in front of two of the sexiest men she’s ever laid eyes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddox Gibson craves control. He’s been trying to regain his zest for life since being discharged from the army, and with the help of his best friend, Wilder Vaughn, he’s worked his way from rock bottom to find happiness as a successful gym co-owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilder lives life like his name implies—wildly—and without Maddox’s rigid temperament to keep him grounded, his lighthearted impulsiveness could very well get him into trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these two beefy best buds invite Jasmine into their friendship, sparks fly quickly, and Jasmine tries to convince them she can be so much more. To both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Jaz, Mad, and Wild figure out how to navigate a polyamorous relationship without destroying their friendship…and their hearts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;Misadventures is a romantic series of spicy standalone novels, each written or co-written by some of the best names in romance. The stories are scandalous, refreshing, and, of course, incredibly sexy. They're the perfect bedside read, a 'quick blush' for the reader who loves a page-turning romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Candice Fox delivers a compulsive new crime thriller in &lt;i&gt;Redemption Point. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When former police detective Ted Conkaffey was wrongly accused of abducting Claire Bingley, he hoped the Queensland rainforest town of Crimson Lake would be a good place to disappear. But nowhere is safe from Claire's devastated father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dale Bingley has a brutal revenge plan all worked out - and if Ted doesn't help find the real abductor, he'll be its first casualty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in a dark roadside hovel called the Barking Frog Inn, the bodies of two young bartenders lie on the beer-sodden floor. It's Detective Inspector Pip Sweeney's first homicide investigation - complicated by the arrival of private detective Amanda Pharrell to 'assist' on the case. Amanda's conviction for murder a decade ago has left her with some odd behavioural traits, top-to-toe tatts - and a keen eye for killers . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Ted and Amanda, the hunt for the truth will draw them into a violent dance with evil. Redemption is certainly on the cards - but it may well cost them their lives . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Gruesome murders, a northern secret, and a buried past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While working one afternoon on the Northern Divide, a young tree-marker makes a grisly discovery: in a squatter’s cabin near an old mill town, a family has been murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An army vet coming off a successful turn leading a task force that took down infamous biker criminals, Detective Frank Yakabuski arrives in Ragged Lake, a nearly abandoned village, to solve the family’s murder. But no one is willing to talk. With a winter storm coming, Yakabuski sequesters the locals in a fishing lodge as he investigates the area with his two junior officers. Before long, he is fighting not only to solve the crime but also to stay alive and protect the few innocents left living in the desolate woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A richly atmospheric mystery with sweeping backdrops, explosive action, and memorable villains, &lt;i&gt;Ragged Lake&lt;/i&gt; will keep you guessing — about the violent crime, the nature of family, and secret deeds done long ago on abandoned frontiers.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a decent book. It had a good mystery and good characters. It's not often I get the chance to read a Canada-based mystery as most of the ones that I wind up finding are based in America or somewhere else in the world. Anyone interested might enjoy it, though I'm not sure it's for everyone...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Freedom’s Detective&lt;/i&gt; reveals the untold story of the Reconstruction-era United States Secret Service and their battle against the Ku Klux Klan, through the career of its controversial chief, Hiram C. Whitle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the years following the Civil War, a new battle began. Newly freed African American men had gained their voting rights and would soon have a chance to transform Southern politics. Former Confederates and other white supremacists mobilized to stop them. Thus, the KKK was born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first political assassination carried out by the Klan, Washington power brokers looked for help in breaking the growing movement. They found it in Hiram C. Whitley. He became head of the Secret Service, which had previously focused on catching counterfeiters and was at the time the government’s only intelligence organization. Whitley and his agents led the covert war against the nascent KKK and were the first to use undercover work in mass crime—what we now call terrorism—investigations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many spymasters before and since, Whitley also had a dark side. His penchant for skulduggery and dirty tricks ultimately led to his involvement in a conspiracy that would bring an end to his career and transform the Secret Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Populated by intriguing historical characters—from President Grant to brave Southerners, both black and white, who stood up to the Klan—and told in a brisk narrative style, &lt;i&gt;Freedom’s Detective&lt;/i&gt; reveals the story of this complex hero and his central role in a long-lost chapter of American history.</description>

Secrets and suspicion are spreading through the wizarding world, and Hogwarts itself is not safe. Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: there is a Death Eater amongst them. Harry will need powerful magic and true friends as he explores Voldemort’s darkest secrets, and Dumbledore prepares him to face his destiny ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: harrypotter.bloomsbury.com</description>

  <description>Unlike a novel, this is a parable, a long parable. Both are stories, but a novel is confined to the rational. Even in science fiction, a narrative must stay within credibly logical boundaries. Not so a parable. For example, a parable may feature a slave owing $50,000,000.00 to a king who expects repayment. Clearly absurd! No king would loan so vast an amount to a slave he owns, much less expect to be repaid, but that misses the point. The point is what happens next.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1950’s west Texas, while exploring a mesquite-dotted desert, best friends Tim and Hect come upon an abandoned auto junkyard. Rabbit hunting loses its entertainment appeal for a game of “War” with their .22 caliber semiautomatic rifles, but the boys’ world suddenly cartwheels out of control because of a prank that goes ghastly awry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hect has the idea to set fire to an old shack in the junkyard for a final thrill of the day. Tim readily agrees, although he thinks his friend's objective is a wasp nest under a mesquite bush. They fill an empty bottle with gas from a nearby wrecked truck and hurl the Molotov cocktail at the shed as the sun-dried wood erupts into a fireball. Shocked by his friend’s target, Tim gapes in horror as a blazing figure appears within the shack's fiery window. Whether a wino sleeping it off or a wandering hobo, he and the human torch gaze at each other a long terrifying moment. The un-erasable memory tattoos itself on the boy's brain. At the sound of sirens coming from the direction of town, and believing their prank may land them a hot seat on “Sparky,” Gatesville's electric chair, the boys decide their only choice is to become fugitives from the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with dogged determination and a forehead-slapping sense of naiveté, the boys flee into the harsh West Texas desert. Because of their pampered lifestyles, the two could not be less prepared to face hunger, thirst, life on the road, homelessness, and a world of poverty and slums, plus the mean streets of Juarez, Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their travels through unforgiving wilderness and city ghettos, Tim and Hect stumble upon adventures and troubles beyond their wildest imagination. From scam artists to madmen to escaped convicts to mercenaries, the two friends flee through West Texas, New Mexico, and deep into Old Mexico. In a tongue-in-cheek romp, they encounter such characters as Fast-One, an El Paso slum lord who ought to be in prison for the practical jokes she pulls on her tenants; a conman trucker named T.J. and his beautiful-but-deceitful daughter, Becca, who run a scam called the "Poison Log Routine;" a heartless cowboy, Eli, and his wife, Snowball, who run a diner and allow Tim as dishwasher to eat table scraps for a wage; and others equally as oddball.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Canada's pre-eminent satirical commentator brings down the curtain on his hugely successful show in this instant #1 national bestseller.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick Mercer can always be relied on to provoke a strong reaction--but what he said one fall day in 2017 truly shocked the nation. In a rant posted on social media, the great Canadian satirist announced loud and clear that the current, 15th season of the &lt;i&gt;Rick Mercer Report&lt;/i&gt;--the nation's best-watched and best-loved comedy show--would be the last. After more than 250 episodes, 250 rants and countless miles spent travelling the length and breadth of Canada to do everything from bungee jumping with Rick Hansen to whale watching with Measha Brueggergosman, it was time to move on. What he will do next is still unknown, and Canada eagerly awaits future developments. But meanwhile, we have this book to keep us going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This volume brings together never-before-published rants from the last five seasons of the show, plus a selection of the very best rants from earlier years. And throughout the book, in a series of brilliant new essays, Rick shares his hilarious, moving and at times hair-raising memories from the past fifteen years. Remember when he and Jann Arden travelled by helicopter to a terrifying bat cave in a mountain? No--because that trip went so horribly wrong it never made it to the screen. Pierre Berton--what was really in that joint he rolled? (It wasn't oregano.) What catastrophe took place in Norman Jewison's bathroom? And can the show still go on when your director in charge is delirious from an allergic reaction? (Yes.) All this and more is revealed by Rick in some of his sharpest and funniest writing yet.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a fast read (maybe too fast) but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Rick Mercer Report (I was so sad to see it end) and enjoys Rick Mercer's brand of satirical humour.]]>

  <description>Adèle appears to have the perfect life: She is a successful journalist in Paris who lives in a beautiful apartment with her surgeon husband and their young son. But underneath the surface, she is bored--and consumed by an insatiable need for sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven less by pleasure than compulsion, Adèle organizes her day around her extramarital affairs, arriving late to work and lying to her husband about where she's been, until she becomes ensnared in a trap of her own making. Suspenseful, erotic, and electrically charged, Adèle is a captivating exploration of addiction, sexuality, and one woman's quest to feel alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Tudors&lt;/i&gt; in Hannah Capin’s &lt;i&gt;The Dead Queens Club&lt;/i&gt;, a clever contemporary YA retelling of Henry VIII and his wives (or, in this case, his high school girlfriends). Told from the perspective of Annie Marck (“Cleves”), a 17-year-old aspiring journalist from Cleveland who meets Henry at summer camp, &lt;i&gt;The Dead Queens Club&lt;/i&gt; is a fun, snarky read that provides great historical detail in an accessible way for teens while giving the infamous tale of Henry VIII its own unique spin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do a future ambassador, an overly ambitious Francophile, a hospital-volunteering Girl Scout, the new girl from Cleveland, the junior cheer captain, and the vice president of the debate club have in common? It sounds like the ridiculously long lead-up to an astoundingly absurd punchline, right? Except it’s not. Well, unless my life is the joke, which is kind of starting to look like a possibility given how beyond soap opera it’s been since I moved to Lancaster. But anyway, here’s your answer: we’ve all had the questionable privilege of going out with Lancaster High School’s de facto king. Otherwise known as my best friend. Otherwise known as the reason I’ve already helped steal a car, a jet ski, and one hundred spray-painted water bottles when it’s not even Christmas break yet. Otherwise known as Henry. Jersey number 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Cleves. Girlfriend number four and the narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Dead Queens Club&lt;/i&gt;, a young adult retelling of Henry VIII and his six wives. Cleves is the only girlfriend to come out of her relationship with Henry unscathed—but most breakups are messy, right? And sometimes tragic accidents happen…twice…</description>

  <description>At the end of &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&lt;/em&gt;, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured in New York with the help of Newt Scamander. But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escapes custody and sets about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore enlists Newt, his former Hogwarts student, who agrees to help once again, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This second original screenplay from J.K. Rowling, illustrated with stunning line art from MinaLima, expands on earlier events that helped shaped the wizarding world, with some surprising nods to the Harry Potter stories that will delight fans of both the books and films.</description>

  <description>He’s baaaack! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Grandpa Pike’s Outhouse Reader&lt;/i&gt; is back with a whole slew of new tales, rants, annoyances, and opinions—delivered with his unique brand of humour. Many readers have asked, “Will Grandpa do his Number Two?” He has. Here it is. You’ll want to read and reread this book. It’s funny, inspirational, and often thought-provoking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa Pike is a natural-born storyteller who can make the seemingly mundane magical and meaningful. Few writers can reach way down and pull so much up out of their own experiences and make you &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; them. Take this book home. Take it to heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Grandpa Pike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Grandpa Pike’s Outhouse Reader&lt;/i&gt; is a good read—any time." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moncton Times &amp;amp; Transcript&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Somewhere in France&lt;/em&gt; comes an enthralling historical novel about one of the most famous wedding dresses of the twentieth century—Queen Elizabeth’s wedding gown—and the fascinating women who made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Millions will welcome this joyous event as a flash of color on the long road we have to travel.”&lt;/em&gt;—Sir Winston Churchill on the news of Princess Elizabeth’s forthcoming wedding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London, 1947: Besieged by the harshest winter in living memory, burdened by onerous shortages and rationing, the people of postwar Britain are enduring lives of quiet desperation despite their nation’s recent victory. Among them are Ann Hughes and Miriam Dassin, embroiderers at the famed Mayfair fashion house of Norman Hartnell. Together they forge an unlikely friendship, but their nascent hopes for a brighter future are tested when they are chosen for a once-in-a-lifetime honor: taking part in the creation of Princess Elizabeth’s wedding gown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toronto, 2016: More than half a century later, Heather Mackenzie seeks to unravel the mystery of a set of embroidered flowers, a legacy from her late grandmother. How did her beloved Nan, a woman who never spoke of her old life in Britain, come to possess the priceless embroideries that so closely resemble the motifs on the stunning gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at her wedding almost seventy years before? And what was her Nan’s connection to the celebrated textile artist and holocaust survivor Miriam Dassin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With The Gown&lt;/em&gt;, Jennifer Robson takes us inside the workrooms where one of the most famous wedding gowns in history was created. Balancing behind-the-scenes details with a sweeping portrait of a society left reeling by the calamitous costs of victory, she introduces readers to three unforgettable heroines, their points of view alternating and intersecting throughout its pages, whose lives are woven together by the pain of survival, the bonds of friendship, and the redemptive power of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;New Brunswickers saw their first live Santa, as played by Fredericton confectioner Charles A. Sampson, in December 1872. When Sampson died in 1929 in his ninetieth year, he was described by the local newspaper as "a grand old man." In the 1880s, the author writes, a tree in a store window would be enough to draw a large crowd, and sometimes special trains were provided to take passengers from one town to the other to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Christmas in Atlantic Canada&lt;/i&gt;, prolific folklorist David Goss traces the history of the holiday in our region, from its earliest celebration, quite possibly in 1604, to modern times. Using historical records, diaries, and old newspapers, he documents the fascinating narrative of how the occasion has been marked. This book will appeal to history buffs and lovers of all things holiday. Includes 25 images. Features a foreword by Gerry Bowler, author of &lt;i&gt;Santa Claus, A Biography&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The World Encyclopedia of Christmas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark times have come to Hogwarts.

But they are growing stronger by the day and Harry is running out of time...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted for the 2019 Taste Canada Awards &lt;br /&gt;Get set for holiday season success, with more than 100 savoury and sweet recipes from celebrity baker and chef Anna Olson.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When does the festive season begin for you? For Anna, it's with the first pumpkin pie of the year. Pumpkin pie isn't something she bakes on any old evening, so it signifies something very special when she does: the start of the holidays! In Anna's house, the holidays are a time for coming together with family and friends, celebrating traditions, and making some new ones, too. In this festive cookbook, Anna shares the recipes she most loves to make during the holiday season--for occasions like a festive brunch, entertaining a crowd, a cozy supper, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, an elegant New Year's evening--and sensational sweets such as holiday cookies, celebratory centerpiece cakes, festive pies and tarts, fancy bars and slices, and much more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every recipe is a spoonful of practical and supportive advice, including menu planning, make-ahead preparation, and hundreds of other hints and tips. &lt;i&gt;Set for the Holidays&lt;/i&gt; will help add sparkle and take away stress from your holidays, so you can navigate the season with confidence!</description>

  <description>Is it too much to ask that a managed care facility refund a year’s advance payment when your grandfather dies before he can move in? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Johnson doesn’t think so, which is why the thirty-three-year-old now lives in a nursing home, locked in a chess match feud with management that doesn’t occupy nearly enough of his time. When foster kid Elroy is thrust into his life, Frank decides to turn this forced relationship to his advantage – launching a string of absurd decisions, inappropriate behaviors and unexpected glimpses of tenderness that ultimately turn a New Jersey suburb upside down. A laugh-out-loud celebration of bad choices for good causes, Managed Care is an offbeat story about three misfits on the social fringes of suburbia and their ridiculous campaign to introduce an unfiltered version of intimacy to their stale, impersonal community. Because, according to Frank, it’s probably what Jesus would have wanted.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“Kelly Rimmer has outdone herself. I thought that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Before I Let You Go&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; was one of the best novels I had ever read…If you only have time to read one book this year &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Things We Cannot Say&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; should be that book. Keep tissues handy.”—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Fresh Fiction&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Fans of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; will adore &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Things We Cannot Say&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.” —Pam Jenoff, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1942, Europe remains in the relentless grip of war. Just beyond the tents of the Russian refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It’s a decision that will alter her destiny…and it’s a lie that will remain buried until the next century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now fifteen and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina’s tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents’ farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Things We Cannot Say&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced…and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was relatively okay. There were sections were I didn't find the story engaging at all; like it was just too drawn out. I also felt that the use of alcohol could have been reduced. By the end, I felt like the characters were using it as a kind of a crutch in a sense and that it really sh...]]>

  <description>A heartfelt and outrageously funny memoir about Newfoundland, family, and being the weirdest kid in school&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could be better than growing up in the 1980s? How about growing up in 1980s Newfoundland, which as Mark Critch will tell you, was more like the 1960s. Critch takes us to where it all began in this tremendously funny and warm look back on his formative years. A "recovering Catholic," he recalls his many misadventures growing up on the outskirts of a small town. And when your radio-star dad is the talk of the town, and your mom can't stop talking at all, life at home is always entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best known as the "roving reporter" for CBC's This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Mark Critch has photo-bombed Justin Trudeau, interviewed Great Big Sea's Alan Doyle (while impersonating Alan Doyle), offered Pamela Anderson a million dollars to stop acting, and crashed White House briefings. But in this hilarious debut, we learn that Critch has been causing trouble his whole life. &lt;i&gt;Son of a Critch&lt;/i&gt; will have you longing for life in Canada's most unique province--even if you've never been there--and marvelling at how one person's childhood could be so ridiculously funny.</description>

  <description>The Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard trilogy may have concluded, but we haven't heard the last of our favorite peeps from the Nine Worlds. Join Hearthstone, Blitzen, Samirah, Alex, Jack, T.J., Mallory, Halfborn, and more on a hilarious and unforgettable journey through Rick Riordan's unique take on Norse mythology. While Magnus is off visiting his cousin, Annabeth, his friends find themselves in some sticky, hairy, and smelly situations as they try to outwit moronic giants, murderous creatures, and meddlesome gods. Can they stave off Ragnarok at least until Magnus gets back?</description>

  <description>The #1 bestselling series returns with a thrilling new story arc set in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vintage photographs reveal the never-before-seen world of peculiar America with a stunning addition—full-color images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having defeated the monstrous threat that nearly destroyed the peculiar world, Jacob Portman is back where his story began, in Florida. Except now Miss Peregrine, Emma, and their peculiar friends are with him, and doing their best to blend in. But carefree days of beach visits and normalling lessons are soon interrupted by a discovery—a subterranean bunker that belonged to Jacob’s grandfather, Abe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clues to Abe’s double-life as a peculiar operative start to emerge, secrets long hidden in plain sight. And Jacob begins to learn about the dangerous legacy he has inherited—truths that were part of him long before he walked into Miss Peregrine’s time loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the stakes are higher than ever as Jacob and his friends are thrust into the untamed landscape of American peculiardom—a world with few ymbrynes, or rules—that none of them understand. New wonders, and dangers, await in this brilliant next chapter for Miss Peregrine’s peculiar children. Their story is again illustrated throughout by haunting vintage photographs, but with a striking addition for this all-new, multi-era American adventure—full color.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Victory comes at a price.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mare Barrow learned this all too well when Cal’s betrayal nearly destroyed her. Now determined to protect her heart—and secure freedom for Reds and newbloods like her—Mare resolves to overthrow the kingdom of Norta once and for all… starting with the crown on Maven’s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no battle is won alone, and before the Reds may rise as one, Mare must side with the boy who broke her heart in order to defeat the boy who almost broke her. Cal’s powerful Silver allies, alongside Mare and the Scarlet Guard, prove a formidable force. But Maven is driven by an obsession so deep, he will stop at nothing to have Mare as his own again, even if it means demolishing everything—and everyone—in his path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is coming, and all Mare has fought for hangs in the balance. Will victory be enough to topple the Silver kingdoms? Or will the little lightning girl be forever silenced?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the epic conclusion to Victoria Aveyard’s stunning series, Mare must embrace her fate and summon all her power… for all will be tested, but not all will survive.</description>

  <description>An extraordinarily different story by Robert Munsch is a gentle affirmation of the love a parent feels for their child--forever. Sheila McGraw's soft and colorful pastels perfectly complement the sentiment of the book--one that will be read repeatedly for years.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN: 9780440238133I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, &lt;i&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/i&gt;, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal dæmon, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had dæmons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her dæmon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey dæmon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/i&gt;, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, The Subtle Knife, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. --Alix Wilber</description>

  <description>Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school . . . again. And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus's master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus's stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deluxe gift edition of the internationally best-selling first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, lavishly illustrated by series artist John Rocco, is a must-have for Riordan fans.</description>

  <description>An original novel based upon the explosive new&lt;i&gt; Star Trek &lt;/i&gt;TV series on CBS All Access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Saru is a Kelpien, a member of a prey species born on a world overrun by monstrous predators...and a being who very intimately understands the nature of fear. Challenged on all sides, he is determined to surpass his origins and succeed as a Starfleet officer aboard the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Shenzhou&lt;/i&gt;. But when Saru breaks protocol in order to prove himself to his crewmates, what begins as a vital rescue mission to save a vessel in distress soon escalates out of control. Forced into a command role he may not be ready for, Saru is caught between his duty and the conflicting agendas of two antagonistic alien races. To survive, he will need to seek a path of peace against all odds, and risk compromising the very ideals he has sworn to uphold....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;North America's leading dermatologist offers a ground-breaking, informative, and incredibly practical book that reveals the harmful effects of our modern skincare habits and how &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can eliminate common skin conditions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin is one of the most buzzed-about topics in dermatology today. It can be painful, debilitating, and inconvenient. Astonishingly, many of the women and men who suffer from problem skin are unknowingly causing it by washing too frequently and using too many skincare and beauty products. Often, we slather ourselves in creams and balms that can actually damage the skin. The miracle products we buy at department stores, specialty shops, and pharmacies have the potential to make us less attractive and prematurely age our skin.&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Soap&lt;/i&gt;, leading dermatologist Dr. Skotnicki explains that the best state for skin is the natural state. On its own, the skin is better equipped to fight wrinkles, stave off aging and act as armor that protects the body from infection. Every time we slather, spread, hydrate, or soften the skin, we nudge the skin away from its healthiest natural condition. Skotnicki demystifies the claims of commonly used beauty products and offers a common-sense approach to cleansing the body along with her &lt;i&gt;product-elimination diet&lt;/i&gt; that has helped thousands of patients suffering from a wide array of skin conditions, and a skincare regime that will help you maintain skin health, fight aging, and keep your skin reaction-free forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his penultimate adventure, a devastated but determined Apollo travels to Camp Jupiter, where he must learn what it is to be a hero, or die trying.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not easy being Apollo, especially when you've been turned into a human and banished from Olympus. On his path to restoring five ancient oracles and reclaiming his godly powers, Apollo (aka Lester Papadopoulos) has faced both triumphs and tragedies. Now his journey takes him to Camp Jupiter in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Roman demigods are preparing for a desperate last stand against the evil Triumvirate of Roman emperors. Hazel, Reyna, Frank, Tyson, Ella, and many other old friends will need Apollo's aid to survive the onslaught. Unfortunately, the answer to their salvation lies in the forgotten tomb of a Roman ruler . . . someone even worse than the emperors Apollo has already faced.</description>

  <description>Greetings, initiate! Carter Kane, here. Congratulations on reaching Brooklyn House in one piece. This accomplishment signals that you're descended from Ancient Egyptian royalty, and you have magic powers. But what good is power without knowing how to use it? That's where this training manual comes in. Packed with quizzes, stories, and insights about Ancient Egyptian deities, creatures (the friendly and the deadly), the mysterious Duat, and more, this primer will prime those with the blood of the pharaohs to take their first steps down the path of the gods. You'll hear from me, other magicians (including my sister, Sadie), and even a few of the gods themselves. But beware of tricks and surprises: anything can happen in the world of Egyptian magic.</description>

  <description>Seventh-grader Tristan Strong feels anything but strong ever since he failed to save his best friend when they were in a bus accident together. All he has left of Eddie is the journal his friend wrote stories in. Tristan is dreading the month he’s going to spend on his grandparents’ farm in Alabama, where he’s being sent to heal from the tragedy. But on his first night there, a sticky creature shows up in his bedroom and steals Eddie’s journal. Tristan chases after it-–is that a doll?-–and a tug-of-war ensues between them underneath a Bottle Tree. In a last attempt to wrestle the journal out of the creature’s hands, Tristan punches the tree, accidentally ripping open a chasm into the MidPass, a volatile place with a burning sea, haunted bone ships, and iron monsters that are hunting the inhabitants of this world. Tristan finds himself in the middle of a battle that has left black American gods John Henry and Brer Rabbit exhausted. In order to get back home, Tristan and these new allies will need to entice the god Anansi, the Weaver, to come out of hiding and seal the hole in the sky. But bartering with the trickster Anansi always comes at a price. Can Tristan save this world before he loses more of the things he loves?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD MIN&lt;/b&gt; comes from a long line of fox spirits. But you'd never know it by looking at her. To keep the family safe, Min’s mother insists that none of them use any fox-magic, such as Charm or shape-shifting. They must appear human at all times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min feels hemmed in by the household rules and resents the endless chores, the cousins who crowd her, and the aunties who judge her. She would like nothing more than to escape Jinju, her neglected, dust-ridden, and impoverished planet. She’s counting the days until she can follow her older brother, Jun, into the Space Forces and see more of the Thousand Worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When word arrives that Jun is suspected of leaving his post to go in search of the Dragon Pearl, Min knows that something is wrong. Jun would never desert his battle cruiser, even for a mystical object rumored to have tremendous power. She decides to run away to find him and clear his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min’s quest will have her meeting gamblers, pirates, and vengeful ghosts. It will involve deception, lies, and sabotage. She will be forced to use more fox-magic than ever before, and to rely on all of her cleverness and bravery. The outcome may not be what she had hoped, but it has the potential to exceed her wildest dreams.</description>

      <![CDATA[I found this book to be more enjoyable than I expected. I've never really been interested in anything that's been described (by some) as space opera, but this really ended up grabbing my interest and holding onto it long enough for me to get through slow bits with ease.

  <description>Zane has always enjoyed exploring the dormant volcano near his home in New Mexico, even though hiking it is challenging. He'd much rather hang out there with his dog, Rosie, than go to middle school, where kids call him Sir Limps a Lot, McGimpster, or Uno — for his one good leg. What Zane doesn't know is that the volcano is a gateway to another world and he is at the center of a powerful prophecy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new girl at school, Brooks, informs him that he's destined to release an evil god from the ancient Maya relic he is imprisoned in — unless she can find and remove it first. Together they return to the volcano, where all kinds of crazy happens. Brooks turns into a hawk, a demon attacks them in a cave, and Rosie gives her all while trying to protect Zane. When Zane decides to save his dog no matter the cost, he is thrust into an adventure full of surprising discoveries, dangerous secrets, and an all-out war between the gods, one of whom happens to be his father. To survive, Zane will have to become the Storm Runner. But how can he run when he can't even walk well without a cane?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feisty heroes, tricky gods, murderous demons, and spirited giants are just some of the pleasures that await in this fresh and funny take on Maya mythology, as rich and delicious as a mug of authentic hot chocolate.</description>

  <description>Aru is only just getting the hang of this whole Pandava thing when the Otherworld goes into full panic mode. The god of love's bow and arrow have gone missing, and the thief isn't playing Cupid. Instead, they're turning people into heartless fighting-machine zombies. If that weren't bad enough, somehow Aru gets framed as the thief. If she doesn't find the arrow by the next full moon, she'll be kicked out of the Otherworld. For good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for better or worse, she won't be going it alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with her soul-sister, Mini, Aru will team up with Brynne, an ultra-strong girl who knows more than she lets on, and Aiden, the boy who lives across the street and is also hiding plenty of secrets. Together they'll battle demons, travel through a glittering and dangerous serpent realm, and discover that their enemy isn't at all who they expected.</description>

  <description>** Now updated to cover Harry and Meghan Markle’s engagement. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Henry of Wales has emerged as the unexpected jewel in the crown of the modern British monarchy. Despite his unruly antics, for which he’s made headlines all over the world, Harry has won the nation’s admiration and respect through his commitment to helping injured servicemen and women with the Invictus Games and his spearheading of mental health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With updated chapters on Harry’s flourishing relationship with American actress Meghan Markle, Duncan Larcombe’s insightful and highly entertaining biography is the inside story of how a young prince has grown and matured into a respected soldier, charitable fundraiser and national figurehead who still retains his reputation as a heart-throb and lovable rogue.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new moving novel of three men, each searching for something they have lost, from the award-winning and Man Booker nominated author Donal Ryan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Farouk, family is all. He has protected his wife and daughter as best he can from the war and hatred that has torn Syria apart. If they stay, they will lose their freedom, will become lesser persons. If they flee, they will lose all they have known of home, for some intangible dream of refuge in some faraway land across the merciless sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lampy is distracted; he has too much going on in his small town life in Ireland. He has the city girl for a bit of fun, but she's not Chloe, and Chloe took his heart away when she left him. There's the secret his mother will never tell him. His granddad's little sniping jokes are getting on his wick. And on top of all that, he has a bus to drive; those old folks from the home can't wait all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game was always the lifeblood coursing through John's veins: manipulating people for his enjoyment, or his enrichment, or his spite. But it was never enough. The ghost of his beloved brother, and the bitter disappointment of his father, have shadowed him all his life. But now that lifeblood is slowing down, and he's not sure if God will listen to his pleas for forgiveness. Three men, searching for some version of home, their lives moving inexorably towards a reckoning that will draw them all together.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The second novel from GG finalist and international award winner Kenneth Bonert, who brought Jewish Johannesburg to explosive life in his 2013 debut, &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Lion Seeker&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the 1980s draw to a close, apartheid is in its death throes and South Africa is a maelstrom of political violence. Young Martin Helger has problems of his own. Out of place at an elite private school, he is the son of a rough-handed scrap dealer and lives in the shadow of his enigmatic brother, a neighbourhood legend. When an irresistable young American boards at the Helger home, a transfixed Martin soon finds himself wrenched out of the isolated bubble of his white privilege and thrust into the raw heart of South Africa's racial struggle. At the same time, secrets from the past begin to emerge and old sins long-buried return in terrifying new ways, tearing at the Helgers, a second-generation Jewish family, even as the larger forces of history and politics tear apart the country.&lt;br /&gt; Migration, terrorism, revolution, identity and memory--these are just some of the bold themes brilliantly and honestly explored in this powerful novel. At once a riveting literary thriller, a moving coming-of-age tale, and an unforgettable journey through a fascinating world&lt;i&gt;, The Mandela Plot&lt;/i&gt; entertains and terrifies in equal measure, and resonates profoundly in light of current affairs.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old Aru Shah has a tendency to stretch the truth in order to fit in at school. While her classmates are jetting off to family vacations in exotic locales, she'll be spending her autumn break at home, in the Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture, waiting for her mom to return from her latest archeological trip. Is it any wonder that Aru makes up stories about being royalty, traveling to Paris, and having a chauffeur?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, three schoolmates show up at Aru's doorstep to catch her in a lie. They don't believe her claim that the museum's Lamp of Bharata is cursed, and they dare Aru to prove it. &lt;i&gt;Just a quick light,&lt;/i&gt; Aru thinks. Then she can get herself out of this mess and &lt;i&gt;never ever&lt;/i&gt; fib again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lighting the lamp has dire consequences. She unwittingly frees the Sleeper, an ancient demon whose duty it is to awaken the God of Destruction. Her classmates and beloved mother are frozen in time, and it's up to Aru to save them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to stop the demon is to find the reincarnations of the five legendary Pandava brothers, protagonists of the Hindu epic poem, the &lt;i&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/i&gt;, and journey through the Kingdom of Death. But how is one girl in Spider-Man pajamas supposed to do all &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;?</description>

  <description>Cows can love, play games, bond and form strong, life-long friendships. They can sulk, hold grudges, and they have preferences and can be vain. All these characteristics and more have been observed, documented, interpreted and retold by Rosamund Young based on her experiences looking after the family farm's herd on Kite's Nest Farm in Worcestershire, England. Here the cows, sheep, hens and pigs all roam free. There is no forced weaning, no separation of young from siblings or mother. They seek and are given help when they request it and supplement their own diets by browsing and nibbling leaves, shoots, flowers and herbs. Rosamund Young provides a fascinating insight into a secret world - secret because many modern farming practices leave no room for displays of natural behavior yet, ironically, a happy herd produces better quality beef and milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foreword by Alan Bennett</description>

  <description>Humorous, inspiring, and sometimes thought-provoking stories&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject of outhouses must be handled delicately. So we will tiptoe around it, moving from foot to foot, like you would—and you do—when you need to “go” and there is no suitable facility nearby. A novel is too long for one sitting. However, a book like this contains short reads, and you can simply fold down the corner of the page when you are done. Upon your next visit, you might choose a story at random, the length of which you’ll determine by estimating the time required to complete the job. You’ll figure it out, and we hope some of these pieces will take your mind off the more mundane tasks of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grandpa Pike’s Outhouse Reader&lt;/i&gt; is not about outhouses, though. It’s about history, rural living, family, religion, places that are gone, ordinary people who have done extraordinary things . . . and much more! Laugh, cry, or groan . . . these stories are guaranteed to &lt;i&gt;move&lt;/i&gt; you!</description>

  <description>A bold, heartfelt tale of life at Green Gables . . . before Anne: A marvelously entertaining and moving historical novel, set in rural Prince Edward Island in the nineteenth century, that imagines the young life of spinster Marilla Cuthbert, and the choices that will open her life to the possibility of heartbreak—and unimaginable greatness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plucky and ambitious, Marilla Cuthbert is thirteen years old when her world is turned upside down. Her beloved mother has dies in childbirth, and Marilla suddenly must bear the responsibilities of a farm wife: cooking, sewing, keeping house, and overseeing the day-to-day life of Green Gables with her brother, Matthew and father, Hugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Avonlea—a small, tight-knit farming town on a remote island—life holds few options for farm girls. Her one connection to the wider world is Aunt Elizabeth “Izzy” Johnson, her mother’s sister, who managed to escape from Avonlea to the bustling city of St. Catharines. An opinionated spinster, Aunt Izzy’s talent as a seamstress has allowed her to build a thriving business and make her own way in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emboldened by her aunt, Marilla dares to venture beyond the safety of Green Gables and discovers new friends and new opportunities. Joining the Ladies Aid Society, she raises funds for an orphanage run by the Sisters of Charity in nearby Nova Scotia that secretly serves as a way station for runaway slaves from America. Her budding romance with John Blythe, the charming son of a neighbor, offers her a possibility of future happiness—Marilla is in no rush to trade one farm life for another. She soon finds herself caught up in the dangerous work of politics, and abolition—jeopardizing all she cherishes, including her bond with her dearest John Blythe. Now Marilla must face a reckoning between her dreams of making a difference in the wider world and the small-town reality of life at Green Gables.</description>

  <description>100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.</description>

  <description>The #1 international bestseller about the enduring bond between three women and the castle they will never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Their lives were mapped out ahead of them. But love and war will change everything...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the early 1900s and Castle Deverill stands staunchly untouched by time, hidden away in the rolling Irish hills. Within the castle walls, three friends have formed a close bond: affluent, flame-haired Kitty Deverill; Bridie Doyle, Kitty’s best friend and daughter of the castle’s cook; and Celia Deverill, Kitty’s flamboyant English cousin. They’ve grown up together, always sheltered from the conflict embroiling the rest of the country. But when Bridie learns of a secret Kitty has been keeping, their idyllic world is forever torn apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, the three women scatter to different parts of the globe. Kitty must salvage what she can before Castle Deverill and everything she has ever known is reduced to ash. &lt;i&gt;Songs of Love and War&lt;/i&gt; is an epic generational saga about the lasting bonds of true friendship and the powerful ties we all have to the place we call home.</description>

  <description>When widowed mule breeder Cy Bellman reads in the newspaper that colossal ancient bones have been discovered in the salty Kentucky mud, he sets out from his small Pennsylvania farm to see for himself if the rumors are true: that the giant monsters are still alive and roam the uncharted wilderness beyond the Mississippi River. Promising to write and to return in two years, he leaves behind his only daughter, Bess, to the tender mercies of his taciturn sister and heads west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only a barnyard full of miserable animals and her dead mother’s gold ring to call her own, Bess, unprotected and approaching womanhood, fills lonely days tracing her father’s route on maps at the subscription library and waiting for his letters to arrive. Bellman, meanwhile, wanders farther and farther from home, across harsh and alien landscapes, in reckless pursuit of the unknown.</description>

And, fairly or unfairly, sons judge fathers when they take to drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Bill Gaston and his father could always fish together. When they were shoulder-to-shoulder, joined in rapt fascination with the world under their hull, they had what all fathers and sons wish for. Even if it was temporary, even if much of it would be forgotten along with the empties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the past in his old fishing boat, revisiting the remote marina where they lived on board and learned to mooch for salmon, Bill unravels his father's relationship with &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; father, it too a story marked by heavy drinking, though one that took a much darker turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning family secrets his father took to the grave, Gaston comes to understand his own story anew, realizing that the man his younger self had been so eager to judge was in fact someone both nobler and more vulnerable than he had guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm, insightful, and often funny, &lt;i&gt;Just Let Me Look at You&lt;/i&gt; captures every father's inexpressible tenderness, and the ways in which the words for love often come too late for all of us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A fresh new novel from a Canadian literary legend--this time with an extraordinary and unforgettable woman protagonist who is sure to become one of the great characters in our literature.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary Cyr&lt;/i&gt; opens in Mexico, just as a disaster strikes a small town: a coal-mine has collapsed, with thirteen men trapped inside. Less than forty-eight hours later, the authorities summarily decide to abandon all hope of finding survivors and seal up the mine entrance--willfully oblivious to the half-dozen souls still breathing below ground. Shortly after that, a thirteen-year-old Mexican boy, Victor, is discovered dead in the hotel room of a Canadian visitor--a 45-year-old woman, and heiress to a vast fortune, who goes by the name Mary Cyr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins this shocking, brilliant and compelling novel--a late-career tour de force by one of our most unique and powerful writers. In his last couple of novels, David Adams Richards has widened the scope of his vision and his world, taking us into far-flung countries and lives even as his beloved territory of New Brunswick's Miramichi remains his touchstone, the spot to which all his stories return. In &lt;i&gt;Mary Cyr&lt;/i&gt;, the unwinding tale will take us from a harsh jail cell in Mexico, where Mary Cyr is imprisoned, deep into Canadian police officer John Delano's past, and even further into the murky depths of a wealthy New Brunswick family whose ties to mining, newspapers and a host of other interests lead to the highest corridors of power. At the heart of this maelstrom lies a woman who is compromised and confused, but also poignant, wounded and well-intentioned: the beautiful and tragic Mary Cyr.</description>

  <description>In this collection of hilarious essays, Edward Riche stretches his satiric muscles to lambaste just about anything that crosses his field of vision. &lt;br /&gt; Newfoundland writes a heartfelt letter to Canada, offering to console mainland frustrations over a pint. The Canadian government brainstorms&lt;br /&gt; to find which national symbol it can ruin next. And a concerned citizen writes a scathing critique of The Muskrat Falls Festival of the Arts, now hundreds of dollars over budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Bag of Hammers Riche reminds us just how enlivening and enlightening satire can be, and how much we need it right now.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A beautiful collection celebrating the Queen’s humour, with amusing quotations and stories about royal life&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When thinking of the Queen, our first image is one of dignity and authority. She is the very definition of majesty: the British monarch, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and the head of the Commonwealth. But as anyone who knows her will tell you, in person she has a&lt;b&gt; wicked sense of humour&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Occasionally &lt;b&gt;unintentiona&lt;/b&gt;l (when meeting guitar legend Eric Clapton she enquired 'Have you been playing a long time?')&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sometimes &lt;b&gt;cannily astute&lt;/b&gt; ('I have to be seen to be believed')&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* At times &lt;b&gt;downright silly&lt;/b&gt; (nicely demonstrated when staff at Balmoral discovered the Queen jumping up and down with glee exclaiming 'I've won, I've won!' after hearing that England had beaten Australia in the cricket)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… the Queen’s &lt;b&gt;sense of humour is like no other&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revealing a side of the Queen's personality that the public rarely see, this joyous book is a timely &lt;b&gt;celebration of royal humour &lt;/b&gt;as Elizabeth II succeeds Victoria as Britain's longest-serving monarch.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With humor and the biting insight of a native, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;/i&gt; explores the history, culture, and politics of Texas, while holding the stereotypes up for rigorous scrutiny.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;God Save Texas&lt;/i&gt; is a journey through the most controversial state in America. It is a red state in the heart of Trumpland that hasn't elected a Democrat to a statewide office in more than twenty years; but it is also a state in which minorities already form a majority (including the largest number of Muslims). The cities are blue and among the most diverse in the nation. Oil is still king but Texas now leads California in technology exports. The Texas economic model of low taxes and minimal regulation has produced extraordinary growth but also striking income disparities. Texas looks a lot like the America that Donald Trump wants to create. And Wright's profound portrait of the state not only reflects our country back as it is, but as it was and as it might be.</description>

  <description>A moving and compulsively readable look into the lives, loves, relationships, and rivalries among the three women at the heart of the British royal family today: Queen Elizabeth II, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and Kate Middleton—from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Good Son&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;These Few Precious Days&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Day Diana Died&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One has been famous longer than anyone on the planet—a dutiful daughter, a frustrated mother, a doting grandmother, a steel-willed taskmaster, a wily stateswoman, an enduring symbol of an institution that has lasted a thousand years, and a global icon who has not only been an eyewitness to history but a part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One is the great-granddaughter of a King’s mistress and one of the most famous “other women” of the modern age—a woman who somehow survived a firestorm of scorn to ultimately marry the love of her life, and in the process replace her arch rival, one of the most beloved figures of the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One is a beautiful commoner, the university-educated daughter of a flight attendant-turned-millionaire entrepreneur, a fashion scion the equal of her adored mother-in-law, and the first woman since King George V’s wife, Queen Mary, to lay claim to being the daughter-in-law of one future king, the wife another, and the mother of yet another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Game of Crowns&lt;/i&gt; is an in-depth and exquisitely researched exploration of the lives of these three remarkable women and the striking and sometimes subtle ways in which their lives intersect and intertwine. Examining their surprising similarities and stark differences, Andersen travels beyond the royal palace walls to illustrate who these three women really are today—and how they will directly reshape the landscape of the monarchy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intensely personal expose of what happens when family and politics collide during the collapse of the Hungarian Communist regime--for fans of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lives of Others&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending fact and fiction, &lt;i&gt;No Live Files Remain&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how, almost thirty years after the fall of communism in Hungary, Andras Forgach found out that his mother, whom he loved deeply, had been an informant for the Kadar regime and had informed not only on acquaintances, but also on family, friends, and even her children. In a work of heartbreaking intensity and nuance, Forgach must confront the truth about the woman who was simultaneously an informant as well as a tender and loveable mother, a victim and a perpetrator, someone to be both pitied and scorned. It pulls back the shroud of secrecy on her complex relationship with her husband, her continuous homesickness and desire to return to her homeland, Palestine, and her devotion to communism and the anti-Zionist feelings that it provoked in her. Forgach dares to give a voice to his deceased mother, hold her responsible for her deeds--and, as her son, defend cherished memories of her as his mother.&lt;br /&gt;A work of secrets and lies, &lt;i&gt;No Live Files Remain&lt;/i&gt; sheds light on socialist Hungary in the seventies and eighties; it is simultaneously a vivid description of a claustrophobic era, an evisceration of bureaucratic stupidity, and a heartbreakingly sharp-yet-loving portrait of the author's relationship with his parents.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In BAYSIDE PASSIONS...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emery Andrews's best friend, Desiree, moves away, falls in love, and opens a an inn all in one summer, she feels her absence like a missing limb. Until she visits over the holidays and meets sinfully hot Dean Masters, who's as easy on the eyes as he is to talk to. After returning home, what starts as a flurry of late-night flirtations quickly turns into a deep connection and unexpected friendship. Now, months later, Desiree offers Emery a job teaching yoga at the inn. Adventurous Emery jumps at the chance and heads for Wellfleet, Massachusetts, to reunite with her BFF and her new close friend, Dean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of sharing their lives, and their secrets, over video chats and phone calls, Dean's ready to move things to the next level. The fact that Emery seems oblivious to the sparks between them and has recently put her foot down about dating friends just means he'll have to bide his time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emery finds a naked man in her kitchen the first morning she's there, Dean doesn't hesitate to move her into his guest room. Maybe now Emery will see what's right before her eyes--although that guy she's got a date with might be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All BAYSIDE SUMMERS books can be read as standalone novels or as part of the series: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bayside Desires&lt;br /&gt; Bayside Passions &lt;br /&gt; Bayside Heat &lt;br /&gt; Bayside Escape &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster&lt;/strong&gt;.

  <description>An exploration of domestic derangement, as sinister as Daphne Du Maurier’s classic &lt;i&gt;Rebecca&lt;/i&gt;, that plumbs the depths of sibling rivalry with wit and menace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, to be a Beloved—one of those lucky people for whom nothing ever goes wrong. Everything falls into their laps without effort: happiness, beauty, good fortune, allure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Betty Stash is not a Beloved—but her little sister, the delightful Gloria, is. She’s the one with the golden curls and sunny disposition and captivating smile, the one whose best friend used to be Betty’s, the one whose husband &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; have been Betty’s. And then, to everyone’s surprise, Gloria inherits the family manse—a vast, gorgeous pile of ancient stone, imposing timbers, and lush gardens—that was never meant to be hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Losing what Betty considers her rightful inheritance is the final indignity. As she single-mindedly pursues her plan to see the estate returned to her in all its glory, her determined and increasingly unhinged behavior—aided by poisonous mushrooms, talking walls, and a phantom dog—escalates to the point of no return&lt;i&gt;. The Beloveds&lt;/i&gt; will have you wondering if there’s a length to which an envious sister won’t go.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was good. For the most part the writing was incredible, but t the end I felt a bit let down. I feel like there should have been more resolution than there was.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Olen Steinhauer's next sweeping espionage novel traces the rise and fall of a domestic left-wing terrorist group. Told from the individual perspectives of an FBI agent, an undercover agent within the group, a convert to the terrorist organization, and a writer on the edges of the whole affair, this is another tightly wound thriller, and an intimate exploration of the people behind the politics, from a master of suspense.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the F-word can have more than one meaning….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cassandra Davis, the F-word is fraternity—specifically Delta Tau Chi, a house on probation and on the verge of being banned from campus. Accused of offensive, sexist behavior, they have one year to clean up their act. For the DTC brothers, the F-word is feminist—the type of person who writes articles in the school paper about why they should lose their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one shot at a scholarship to attend the university of her dreams, Cassie pitches a research project: to pledge Delta Tau Chi and provide proof of their misogynistic behavior. They’re frat boys. She knows exactly what to expect once she gets there. Exposing them should be a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the boys of Delta Tau Chi have their own agenda, and fellow pledge Jordan Louis is certainly more than the tank top wearing “bro” Cassie expected to find. With her heart and her future tangled in the web of her own making, Cassie is forced to realize that the F-word might not be as simple as she thought after all.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is a good tool to use as a conversation starter. Is it the best? No. The characters could definitely be better written to come off as less one-dimensional and more thought out. Can it be a good story regardless? Yes.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;The Circle, &lt;/i&gt;the true story of a young Yemeni-American man, raised in San Francisco, who dreams of resurrecting the ancient art of Yemeni coffee but finds himself trapped in Sana'a by civil war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mokhtar Alkhanshali grew up in San Francisco, one of seven siblings brought up by Yemeni immigrants in a tiny apartment. At age twenty-four, unable to pay for college, he works as a doorman, until a chance encounter awakens his interest in coffee and its rich history in Yemen. Reinventing himself, he sets out to learn about coffee cultivation, roasting and importing. He travels to Yemen and visits farms in every corner of the country, collecting samples, eager to improve cultivation methods and help Yemeni farmers bring their coffee back to its former glory. And he is on the verge of success when civil war engulfs Yemen in 2015. The U.S. embassy closes, Saudi bombs begin to rain down on the country and Mokhtar is trapped in Yemen. This is a heart-pounding true story that weaves together the history of coffee, the struggles of everyday Yemenis living through civil war and the courageous journey of a young man--a Muslim and a U.S. citizen--following the most American of dreams.</description>

  <description>Bev and Carol are back and looking for a new adventure! This time, they fly off to the Seychelles to teach students of the National Youth Service. They are provided with a beautiful house on Mahe and commute to work on the tiny island of Ste. Anne in a World War II landing craft. Lush, sunny and colourful, the Seychelles is the perfect setting for two girls on the lookout for inspiration and fresh experiences, so why not join them? See the sights, find out about life in the Indian Ocean, and enjoy the madness. Fuelled by fish, rice and South African rum, Bev and Carol tour the islands on an ancient motorbike in their free time, discovering paradise and what lies beyond. There are giant spiders, heart-stopping bus rides and a tangled expatriate community, against a volatile political backdrop. Put your feet up and dive into Bev and Carol's chaotic world, where common sense and spontaneity are often at odds. You'll see what makes them tick and probably have a lot of laughs along the way. 'Stranded in the Seychelles' - could it be this much fun?"</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;One remarkable woman--caught in the tumult of an extraordinary century in Ethiopia's history. Told by her granddaughter, Canadian journalist Aida Edemariam, Yetemegn's story is of courage, struggle and survival. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Wife's Tale &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;has the sweep and lyrical power that captivated readers of Abraham Verghese's &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Cutting for Stone&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, and of Michael Ondaatje's &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Running in the Family&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in the northern Ethiopian city of Gondar in about 1916, and a child bride at eight years old, Aida Edemariam's grandmother once stood, shaking, as fascists searched her home for guns she knew were there; in the late 1930s and early 1940s she fled both Italian and Allied bombardment. When her husband was imprisoned, in the 1950s, Yetemegn--a woman who had hardly left her own compound for three decades--managed to gain audiences with Emperor Haile Selassie I in Addis Ababa, to argue for justice, for revenge, and for the futures of her seven children.&lt;br /&gt; Widowed, she fought for thirteen years through courts unaccustomed to a woman determined to defend her assets. A feudal landlord herself, she felt the first tremors of the coming revolution, then, in the early 1970s, watched it burst into flower: night after night she listened, praying desperately, to the firing squads of the Red Terror doing their work next door, and endured yet more soldiers tramping through her home. In her sixties she learned to read, and eventually made a longed-for pilgrimage to Jerusalem. &lt;br /&gt; Told from Yetemegn's own point of view, &lt;i&gt;The Wife's Tale&lt;/i&gt; features a rich cast of characters--emperors and empresses, archbishops and slaves, priests and scholars, monks and nuns, Marxist revolutionaries and wartime double agents. But above all, there is Yetemegn herself, grand and haughty and sometimes difficult but also vulnerable and incredibly generous and who, despite everything--the toil, the deaths, the cruelties and the many, many tears--retains an infectious sense of mischief and joy.</description>

  <description>When Loving You Is Hurting Me examines various forms of domestic violence such as family violence; intimate partner, child, and elder abuse; teen dating violence; and men being abused by women. Readers are enlightened about its effect on the victims and those who love and care about the maltreated person. The author deals with the subject from a biblical and spiritual perspective. The title of the book gives a foreshadowing of the subject and the dynamics between victims and perpetrators: the individual who cares immensely for the very individual who exploits and takes advantage of that endearment by mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually annihilating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kimberly D. Shamberger uses scriptural and clinical references to encourage and demonstrate that God does not desire his children to endure maltreatment. It is the author's desire by the completion of this book that all perpetrators will be edified and all victims will have gained knowledge, self-assurance of the love of God, and encouragement to safely change the title to "I'm Leaving You For Me" (Con Funk Shun).</description>

  <description>Where are you going? Where have you been? What are you doing about it NOW? As you think through these questions, I encourage you to make your move and reclaim the life you’ve always dreamed about. It’s yours if you really want it. You need a burning desire and a foundation of core values. Values like confidence, faith, courage and hard work are key to living life on your terms. Know this my friend—it’s not only about the end goal. It’s the journey you take to get there. The Value of You is a journey into the core values that define our human experience. Each chapter has a story to tell, as well as the core features of the value, obstacles to living the value and a personal game plan to make the value your own. Start your journey today! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Schumer calls it, “the book of a generation.”</description>

  <description>How often in life are we confronted with situations that cause distress and indecision, sometimes even dejection and depression? Where, we wonder, can we find hope and promise? Sometimes the love we extend to another individual does not induce love in return. Unrequited love often leads to heartache, even heartbreak. Where, we ask, can we find the love we seek and need? And what of life hereafter? Can one seek and find peace and promise in the great beyond? The poetry found in this book attempts to address some of these concerns that so often beset and perplex us. Hopefully, in reading these works, readers will find a measure of fulfillment, a path to hope, peace, and promise.</description>

  <description>Every family seems to know at least one person with Parkinson’s, an ancient and complex disease that confounds treatments beyond vigorous exercise, challenging memory games and powerful medications. Here’s what happened to Joyce Saunders, the protagonist of this story. She became a genius for denial right after her family doctor told her that she probably had Parkinson’s. Disguising her symptoms, Joyce managed to avoid everyone around her. Attempting to salvage their marriage, Joyce and Martin took March Break in the Caribbean where they discovered more than they expected and barely made it home in one piece. This is a passionate, larger-than-life novel, one that tweaks your conscience and helps you address the challenges of Parkinson’s Disease in your life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;They are the infamous lords, unrepentant rogues whose bad behavior makes for good gossip among the&lt;/i&gt; ton. &lt;i&gt;But every scoundrel has his secrets, and it takes a special touch to reveal the true hearts behind their devilish disguises.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Known as a brazen philanderer, Hayden Milton, Earl of Westfield, is almost done in by a vengeful mistress who aims a gun at a rather essential part of his anatomy—but ends up wounding his thigh instead. Recuperating in his London town house, Hayden is confronted by his new medical attendant. Sophia Camden intrigues him, for behind her starched uniform is an enticing beauty better suited for bedding than dispensing salves and changing bandages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unshaken by his arrogance, not to mention impropriety, Sophia offers Hayden a dare: allow her ten days to prove her competency. If she resigns in exasperation like her two predecessors, she will be beholden to this wicked seducer. As a battle of wills begins, Sophia finds herself distracted by the Earl's muscular physique . . . and discovers that the man within longs only for a second chance to love.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was okay. As far as romances go, it could have been better. The banter between the (jerkish) hero and the heroine started off good but slowly fell flat for me. I also kept getting hung up on the various forms of "deuce" that kept popping up in the story. It just sounded really strange t...]]>

  <description>The “exciting conclusion” (Entertainment Weekly) in the New York Times bestselling Red Sparrow Trilogy has Russian counterintelligence chief Dominika Egorova and her lover, CIA agent Nate Nash, on the hunt for a Russian agent working in the US government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a plot ripped from tomorrow’s headlines, Jason Matthews is “one of America’s most readable spy novelists” (The Washington Post Book World), and his high-powered, seductive third novel not only continues the dangerous entanglements of Dominika and Nate but reveals with chilling authenticity how Russian espionage can place agents in the most sensitive positions of power. The Kremlin’s Candidate opens with Russian president Vladimir Putin planning the covert assassination of a high-ranking US official with the intention of replacing him with a mole whom Russian intelligence has cultivated for more than fifteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catching wind of this plot, Dominika, Nate, and their CIA colleagues must unmask the traitor before he or she is able to reveal that Dominika has been spying for years on behalf of the CIA. Any leak, any misstep, will expose her as a CIA asset and result in a one-way trip to a Moscow execution cellar. Ultimately, the lines of danger converge on the spectacular billion-dollar presidential palace on the Black Sea during a power weekend with Putin’s inner circle. Does Nate sacrifice himself to save Dominika? Does Dominika forfeit herself to protect Nate? Do they go down together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dazzling finale to Jason Matthews’s New York Times bestselling Red Sparrow Trilogy “delivers a wallop on all fronts, from adrenaline-charged action to dark political intrigue to gripping emotional stakes…Readers will finish the book, but their memories of Matthews’s brilliant and fearless heroine will linger well past the final page” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review). The Kremlin’s Candidate is “a stellar conclusion…racing to a heart-pounding and unexpected resolution” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).</description>

      <![CDATA[(rated 3.5 stars) This book proved to be better than I originally thought it was going to be. I was fairly intrigued through the novel, though it could use a touch more editing to cut unneeded prose and to trim scenes that do nothing for the story. Having never read anything by this author before...]]>

  <description>Cardassia Prime is home to a prideful people who, for centuries, forged alliances with those they believed would strengthen them and their place in the Alpha Quadrant, and expanded their empire at great cost to other worlds. For generations, dissenting voices were silenced by either fear or an early grave. When their wartime ally, the Dominion, suddenly turned on them, seeking to transform Cardassia into a tomb for every last member of their race, their old adversary—the United Federation of Planets— put an end to the carnage, and even now works to help rebuild Cardassia Prime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate this alliance, the Castellan of the Cardassian Union is to welcome the Federation president to Cardassia Prime. As a symbol of this deepening friendship, the &lt;i&gt;U.S.S. Enterprise-&lt;/i&gt;E is tasked to carry the Cardassian ambassador to the Federation back home. For his part, Ambassador Elim Garak is working with Captain Jean-Luc Picard to oversee the diplomatic reception that will commemorate the last of Starfleet’s personnel finally leaving the homeworld. However, there are malevolent forces at work, who even now strive to “restore Cardassia to its proper place and glory,” and are willing to do anything to achieve their goal....</description>

      <![CDATA[I you are a Trek fan who loves the character of Garak, then I think you will really enjoy this book as it takes place on Cardassia and Garak is one of the central characters. The strength of this novel makes me want to go read the other books in the series that I've ended up missing!]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Thanksgiving has a way of thawing the frostiest hearts in Lake Eden. But that won’t be happening for newlywed Hannah Swensen Barton—not after her husband suddenly disappears . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Hannah has felt as bitter as November in Minnesota since Ross vanished without a trace and left their marriage in limbo. Still, she throws herself into a baking frenzy for the sake of pumpkin pie and Thanksgiving-themed treats while endless holiday orders pour into The Cookie Jar. Hannah even introduces a raspberry Danish pastry to the menu, and P.K., her husband’s assistant at KCOW-TV, will be one of the first to sample it. But instead of taking a bite, P.K., who is driving Ross’s car and using his desk at work, is murdered. Was someone plotting against P.K. all along or did Ross dodge a deadly dose of sweet revenge? Hannah will have to quickly sift through a cornucopia of clues and suspects to stop a killer from bringing another murder to the table . . .</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a book I remember reading in class in middle school. It was one I really enjoyed. Personally, I think it's a good story for tweens/young teens. They'd really enjoy reading about a young girl, obsessd with British royalty, learning to navigate her own life at the time she is living in.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A story about one woman's search for self-love, experienced through food and travel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, Jackie Kai Ellis's life was the one that every woman--herself included--wanted: she was in her late twenties and married to a handsome man, she had a successful career as a designer, a home that she shared with her husband. But instead of feeling fulfilled, happy, and loved, each morning she'd wake up dreading the day ahead, searching for a way out. Depression clouded each moment, the feelings of inadequacy that had begun in childhood now consumed her, and her marriage was slowly transforming into one between two strangers: unfamiliar, childless, and empty. In this darkness, she could only find one source of light: the kitchen. Inspired by the great 20th century female food writer M.F.K. Fisher's works, it was the place Jackie escaped into herself, finding life, peace, comfort, and acceptance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of how, armed with nothing but a love of food and the words of M.F.K. Fisher, one woman begins a journey--from France to Italy, then the Congo and back again--to find herself. Along the way, she goes to pastry school in Paris, eats the most perfect apricots over the Tuscan hills, watches a family of gorillas grazing deep in the Congolese brush, has her heart broken one last time on a bridge in Lyon, and, ultimately, finds a path to joy. Told with insight and intimacy, and radiating with warmth and humour, &lt;i&gt;The Measure of My Powers&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable experience of the senses.</description>

  <description>Tabitha Sorenson is missing. The bright but unstable student disappeared in the aftermath of a scandal involving millions of dollars in college funds. Professor Dana Essex doesn't think the missing money and the missing student are connected, but she hires Vancouver PI David Wakeland to find Tabitha, with whom she is in obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wakeland discovers Tabitha has in fact stolen the money and is hiding out with her lover and reports back to his client, Essex is crushed to learn that Tabitha is in love with someone else. The next morning, Tabitha has been murdered and Essex has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Wakeland has his own problems. His former girlfriend, police officer Sonia Drego, believes her partner is corrupt. With her job--and possibly her life--on the line, Wakeland may be her best hope of uncovering the conspiracy in the department before it brings her down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hounded by Tabitha's friends, the police, the press, and his own troubled conscience, Wakeland tries desperately to find Essex and make sense of what happened. Could it all have been a ruse from the start, and is Wakeland just another in a long line of suckers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While searching for Essex and investigating Sonia's partner, Wakeland encounters criminals, anarchists, and crooked authority figures--all of them desperate people who will stop at nothing to guard their secrets.</description>

  <description>Noah Marshall has known a privileged and comfortable life thanks to his mother, the highly decorated chief of the Austin Police Department. But all that changes the night she reveals a skeleton that's been rattling in her closet for years, and succumbs to the guilt of destroying an innocent family's life. Reeling with grief, Noah is forced to carry the burden of this shocking secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gracie Richards wasn't born in a trailer park, but after fourteen years of learning how to survive in The Hollow, it's all she knows anymore. At least here people don't care that her dad was a corrupt Austin cop, murdered in a drug deal gone wrong. Here, she and her mother are just another family struggling to survive...until a man who clearly doesn't belong shows up on her doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their differences, Noah and Gracie are searching for answers to the same questions, and together, they set out to uncover the truth about the Austin Police Department's dark and messy past. But the scandal that emerges is bigger than they bargained for, and goes far higher up than they ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complex, gritty, and thrilling, Keep Her Safe solidifies K.A. Tucker's reputation as one of today's most talented new voices in suspense.</description>

It's also more mystery than romance (something I really enjoy at the moment) and the romance elements aren't at the forefront.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of Cheryl Strayed’s &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt; comes this funny and gritty debut memoir in which Jan Redford grows from a nomadic rock climber to a mother who fights to win back her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Compassionate and courageous, &lt;i&gt;End of the Rope&lt;/i&gt; shows us that there are many types of bravery required, not just in the wilderness, but in surviving day to day life." —Tanis Rideout, author of &lt;i&gt;Above All Things&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After the love of her life is killed in an avalanche, a grieving Jan finds comfort in the arms of his climbing buddy, an extreme alpinist. But their marriage soon falters. While her husband logs forests and dreams of distant peaks, Jan has children, and takes on a wife’s traditional role. Over the following years, however, she pursues her own dream, one that pits her against her husband—attending university, and ultimately, gaining independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;End of the Rope&lt;/i&gt; is Jan's telling of heart-stopping adventures, from a harrowing rescue off El Capitan to leading a group of bumbling cadets across a glacier. It is her laughter-filled memoir of learning to climb, and of friendships with women in that masculine world. Most moving, this is her story of claiming freedom from a crushing marriage, an act of bravery equal to climbing mountains.</description>

  <description>Johannes Cabal, a necromancer of some little infamy, has come into possession of a vital clue that may lead him to his ultimate goal: a cure for death. The path is vague, however, and certainly treacherous as it takes him into strange territories that, quite literally, no one has ever seen before. The task is too dangerous to venture upon alone, so he must seek assistance, comrades for the coming travails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So assisted--ably and otherwise--by his vampiric brother, Horst, and by the kindly accompaniment of a criminologist and a devil, he will encounter ruins and diableries, mystery and murder, the depths of the lowest pit and a city of horrors. London, to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet even though Cabal has risked such peril believing he understands the dangers he faces, he is still underestimating them. He is walking into a trap of such arcane complexity that even the one who drew him there has no idea of its true terrors. As the snare closes slowly and subtly around them, it may be that there will be no survivors at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fall of the House of Cabal &lt;/i&gt;is the fifth book in Jonathan L. Howard's acclaimed Johannes Cabal series.</description>

  <description>Writers Edit Engel and Alan McBrearty help Santa tell a new story this year in their book Where Elves Come From. Within the pages of this new classic, readers will see that this is no ordinary fairy tale. This children’s book is based on real-life events mixed with the magic of the unknown and centers on a family whose child is stricken with cancer. Their faith is tested, but they learn the importance of love, happiness, gratitude, and strong family bonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We wrote this book as a dedication to children with cancer and to create a legend for Santa’s elves,” the authors explain. “Although intended as a bedtime storybook, it is a very educational book where each of the sixteen chapters contains a fundamental good moral to learn from, and most episodes have one of our favorite bedtime prayers to enjoy before going to sleep.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Edit Engel and Alan McBrearty come from single-parent family homes with parents who always encouraged them to go after their dreams, which was instrumental in their lives. They are currently working on their second self-improvement book, which will be out by January 1, 2018 and will be titled Mini-Habits and Mini-Steps: An Incremental Guide to the Ultimate Mindset and Getting What You Want.</description>

  <description>When Casey Duncan first arrived at Rockton, the off-the-grid, isolated community built as a haven for people running from their pasts, she had no idea what to expect. There are no cell phones, no internet, no mail, and no way of getting in or out without the town council's approval. She certainly didn't expect to become the town homicide detective. But, the very last thing she expected was for the council to drop a dangerous criminal into their midst without a plan to keep him imprisoned. And she never thought that she'd have to be responsible for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer Oliver Brady stays in town, the more people seem to die around him. When evidence begins piling up that someone inside Rockton is working as his accomplice, Casey races to figure out who exactly Brady is and what crimes he's truly responsible for committing.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was okay but it seemed to be more about hunting than crime solving. I was hoping for more character interactions and a deeper connection to the town than what I ended up getting. I guess I was hoping I would get more than what I got in this story.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poems that form an eloquent, searching contemplation of "the warp and weft of being and nonbeing."&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the Names Between&lt;/i&gt; is Nova Scotia poet Julia McCarthy's meditative and crackling-with-dark-energy third collection. From her observation of "long-horned beetles... rearranging the landscape" to an apperception of "part of me /...seeded by dust / of meteors and asteroids," McCarthy makes palpable, in richly layered imagery and with attentiveness that unfolds stillness, the "Singing Emptiness" that informs and quickens the crow's flight, the stones' weight, and our own being as we move in "the defined world both elegant / and maimed." Concerned with both the inadequacy and the necessity of word to convey world, the poems move through a shifting landscape of seasons and creatures, of the remembered dead, and of scattered stones reading the Akashic field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grounded in the experience of presence, where the external and internal meet, a crossroads of consciousness where "a language without a name / remembers us" and the poem is a votive act, &lt;i&gt;All the Names Between&lt;/i&gt; reflects the shadow-light of being, of what is and what isn't, the seen and the unseen, the forgotten and the remembered where&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; every elegy has an ode at its centre&lt;br /&gt;every ode has an elegy around its edges.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(from "Ode with an Elegy around its Edges")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;All the Names Between&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It is Julia McCarthy's incomparable eloquence as a poet to, as an experienced photographer might, wield darkness as an ever more powerful lens to reveal the intricate beauty of the world as she finds it. And it is with this extraordinary vision, that McCarthy ushers us into her newest collection, &lt;i&gt;All the Names Between&lt;/i&gt;, 'where the dead gather like trees in their white coats' and bats hover overhead, 'lucifugal as ashes from invisible fires.' These are poems scintillate with vision and stunningly intimate--showing us page after page the full, and exquisite measure of 'night's worth.'" --Clarise Foster, Editor, &lt;i&gt;Contemporary Verse 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Here is a book of meditations for even those immune to poetry, a poetry with no comfort zones. McCarthy takes readers to a world where the marriage between solitude and nature gives birth to memorable, haunting lines, where the mystery of poetry lies just between the words. I have no doubt readers will embrace this book as their own." --Goran Simi?, author of &lt;i&gt;Immigrant Blues&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;From Sarajevo, with Sorrow&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; From The Book of Revelation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Opening of The Second Seal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 6: 3 - 4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the Lamb opened the second seal, John heard the second living creature saying, "Come and see." &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; Here is how the words are written in the Book of Revelation: &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a lot of things that are written in the Book of Revelation that's supposed to be happening in the last days were also happening since the beginning of creation. However, the meaning to these things were sealed, but after Jesus had opened all of the seven seals, one at a time, each seal reveal their own meaning and though the seals were all sealed, they were written in codes, wherefore, most of the human race do not have the understanding; of the symbols, for these things are kept as secrets from their mind. Anyway, I Clive Richards will give you the meaning to most of these things, as they've been revealed to me. Most of what is written in the Book of Revelation are symbols and are shorthand written. Therefore, just as a stenographer type spoken words in a shorthand way within the courtroom as the words are spoken, or a stenotype machine has been use for other purposes as shorthand, so is the Book of Revelation is shorthand written. Likewise, a stenotype machine have the letter of the words shorten and coded where's only the stenographer understand it, while a regular keyboard will type out all the words for you to understand them. Therefore, that is how the words are written in the Book of Revelation, shorthanded and coded. Furthermore, in the Book of Revelation, each statement is written in different phrases and each phrase has their own coding. And, the things that are written are striking more and causing more trouble in the last days of time, but it is not the final ending as yet. Book available in print and on all devices.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nothing is forbidden to this elite corps of shifter bodyguards and private investigators...except falling in love.&lt;/b&gt; Good dragons? Bad dragons? Twenty-four hours ago, private chef Tessa Byrne didn't know about the terrifying world of shifters. Now she knows too much, like the fact that a ruthless dragon lord is determined to claim her - forever. Tessa flees to Maui, where sunny skies, swaying palms, and a handsome stranger conspire to play tricks with her heart. Can she truly trust Kai Llewellyn and his band of battle-hardened shapeshifters to save her from a gruesome fate? &lt;i&gt;Don't trust a human, and never, ever fall in love with one.&lt;/i&gt; Those are lessons Kai learned the hard way. But Tessa is different. Her emerald eyes mirror the mysterious pendant she wears, and her flaming red hair makes his heart race. Is his inner dragon just greedy for a new kind of treasure, or is Tessa his destined mate? &lt;b&gt;ALOHA SHIFTERS: JEWELS of the HEART is a thrilling new series set on the tropical shores of Maui. Each story is a page-turner packed with action, emotion, and romance! If you like &lt;i&gt;Magnum, PI&lt;/i&gt; and smoldering hot, alpha shapeshifters, you'll love these books!&lt;/b&gt; * No cliff hangers. Each story is a standalone paranormal romance with adult content. The perfect read for fans of strong heroines, alpha heroes, werewolves and shapeshifters, billionaires, military romance, paranormal suspense, action-adventure romance, fantasy romance, and exotic, tropical locales! *</description>

  <description>The Snow Rose is the gripping story of a woman on the run from her past by Lulu Taylor, author of &lt;i&gt;The Winter Folly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose Rory and I will divorce at some point, when I've got the time to think about it and the strength to tackle the dreary admin it will involve. The house. The division of money and belongings. What will happen to Heather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's not taking her away from me. It's what he wants. It's what they all want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they think I'm not fit to look after her. My mother thinks it. That's why I won't see her either, or my sister. They're in cahoots with Rory, all of them scheming how to get her away from me. That's why I have to escape them while I can, while I still have the opportunity . . . &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate is on the run with her daughter, her identity hidden and her destination unknown to her husband and family. She's found a place where she and Heather can be alone and safe, a huge old house full of empty rooms. But it turns out she's not alone. There are the strange old ladies in the cottage next door, Matty and her blind sister Sissy. How long can Kate hide Heather's presence from them? And then the newcomers arrive, the band of eccentrics led by the charming and charismatic Archer. Kate begins to realize that she is involved in something strange and dangerous, and the past she's so desperate to escape is about to find her . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of Cormac McCarthy, Russell Banks, and Annie Proulx, the much-anticipated new novel by the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Red Dog, Red Dog&lt;/i&gt; is set over the course of 48 hours in a remote sawmill community where violence, complicity, and inaction run deep.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World War Two vet Art Kenning is the alcoholic first-aid man in an isolated sawmill village in the interior of B.C., where he dreads the sound of the five whistles that summon him to the mill floor whenever a worker is hurt. Traumatized by an incident in Holland, when he stood by while members of his unit committed a horrific act, he loses himself in drink, and in memories of the love affair he had with a woman in wartime Paris. But the sad comfort of his self-imposed detachment is shattered when one of the most powerful men at the mill arrives at his door late one evening to ask for his help. What unfolds over the course of that night and following day will force Art to confront acts of evil, both in the present and the past, as well as the tragic consequences of his own inaction. &lt;br /&gt;.Alternating with Art's story are the stories of Joel, a teenaged runaway who owes his life to Art, Wang Po, the mill's cook and a survivor of the Rape of Nanjing, Alice, a young Indigenous girl sold from a residential school, and, Cliff, a Metis man with a hidden past. These lives, and more, intertwine to reveal a complex, morally ambiguous community where the undercurrents of violence and complicity are never far from the surface.&lt;br /&gt; Writing with exquisite precision and emotional force, Patrick Lane gives us a novel whose darkness is fractured by moments of light. &lt;i&gt;Deep River Night&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting story about the burden of bearing witness to a terrible crime</description>

  <description>In the near future, the world stands on the brink of another worldwide economic and social crisis. People look for understanding through occult practices, so that mediums and fortunetellers have become wildly successful in helping them escape reality. There are no more churches, and established religion is a thing of the past. Christians must now gather in secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fragile era emerges Josh Heartley, a young boy with astounding prophetic abilities. Though Josh had a heart transplant in his early years, it doesn't slow him down. He is a light for everyone around him, and he can often tell future events with supernatural clarity. &lt;br /&gt;During an accident, Josh has a Near Death Experience and finds himself in the middle of a spiritual battle that goes back more than two thousand years. Dr Julie Bond, conducting a research study involving Josh, hopes to unlock the secret behind NDEs and their ties to the human soul. She soon suspects the key lies within this very special boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Paul Thomas's thrilling novel is based on shocking real-world events of a thousand-years-long demonic occupation told through exciting storylines, unexpected twists, and many historical examples.</description>

  <description>Eve is a garden designer and antique buyer whose husband has left her after several miserable years of marriage. Her latest antique find is an old violin, beautiful but broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On meeting Micajah, 20 years younger than her, she feels a spark between them – a sexual spark she hasn't felt in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their affair escalates, Micajah shows her how to embrace her sexuality and take charge of it. A musician, he also helps her repair the violin to be even more beautiful than she could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve goes on a journey of discovery, and the story ends in Venice where she and Micajah set each other free in the world, allowing Eve to take charge of her own happiness at last.</description>

  <description>An astonishingly incisive and suspenseful novel about a scandal amongst Britain’s privileged elite and the women caught up in its wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie’s husband James is a loving father, a handsome man, a charismatic and successful public figure. And yet he stands accused of a terrible crime. Sophie is convinced he is innocent and desperate to protect her precious family from the lies that threaten to rip them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kate is the lawyer hired to prosecute the case: an experienced professional who knows that the law is all about winning the argument. And yet Kate seeks the truth at all times. She is certain James is guilty and is determined he will pay for his crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Who is right about James? Sophie or Kate? And is either of them informed by anything more than instinct and personal experience? Despite her privileged upbringing, Sophie is well aware that her beautiful life is not inviolable. She has known it since she and James were first lovers, at Oxford, and she witnessed how easily pleasure could tip into tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Most people would prefer not to try to understand what passes between a man and a woman when they are alone: alone in bed, alone in an embrace, alone in an elevator… Or alone in the moonlit courtyard of an Oxford college, where a girl once stood before a boy, heart pounding with excitement, then fear. Sophie never understood why her tutorial partner Holly left Oxford so abruptly. What would she think, if she knew the truth?</description>

  <description>A class one medical emergency summons the "EnterpriseTM to the Federation outpost Tanis. There, a grisly surprise awaits them. Two of the lab's three researchers are dead, their bodies almost entirely drained of blood. There are no clues, no records of their research, no remnants of their work. There is only the outpost's sole survivor, Dr. Jeffrey Adams, who holds the secret of what happened at Tanis, and might now happen aboard the "Enterprise.</description>

  <description>Can a red-haired woman from Chicago single-handedly force Joseph Stalin to back down? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China, 1927. Thirty-three-year-old Rayna Prohme, accompanying her left-wing journalist husband, becomes the political confidante and lover of Mikhail Borodin, the Russian commander sent to prop up a failing Chinese revolution. In a bid to continue their love affair, Rayna hatches a plan to accompany Mme. Sun, the widow of the Chinese revolution’s founder, to Moscow. But Moscow doesn’t welcome the women. Borodin shuns them. Rayna’s stipend and her housing arrangements are cancelled. “Go home,” she is told. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rayna does not want to go home to an ordinary life, to her husband and Chicago. Instead she applies to a Soviet-espionage school that soon demands she spy on Mme. Sun. The Chinese widow is, by now, in grave danger as her exit visa is blocked. Rayna must make a choice — Borodin and Russia or Mme. Sun and China.</description>

Acting on their feelings, they are pulled deeper into an affair, but Melissa is hiding, hoping to escape her cruel maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't take long before the shifters uncover her secret. Still, Derek is determined to confront the Old One and reclaim her mortality--even at the risk of losing his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A STANDALONE PARANORMAL ROMANCE with an HEA based on characters from the One to Hold series.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Chaos of Longing&lt;/i&gt; is a brutally honest exploration of desire—physical, emotional, and spiritual. This revised and expanded edition contains over 50 pages of all-new material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organized in four sections – Inception, Longing, Chaos, and Epiphany – K.Y. Robinson's debut poetry collection explores what it is to &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; in spite of trauma, shame, injustice, and mental illness. It is one survivor's powerful testimony, and a love letter "to those who lie awake burning." </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;March 4, 1861: On the day of Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration, the air is charged with hope and apprehension. The last thing anyone wants is any sort of hitch in the proceedings—let alone murder! Fortunately the president has young Adam Quinn by his side . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the inaugural ball, Lincoln’s trusted entourage is on their guard. Allan Pinkerton, head of the president’s security team, is wary of potential assassins. And Lincoln’s oldest friend, Joshua Speed, is by his side, along with Speed’s nephew, Adam Quinn—called back from the Kansas frontier to serve as the president’s assistant and jack-of-all-trades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the tight security, trouble comes nonetheless. A man is found stabbed to death in a nearby room, only yards from the president. Not wishing to cause alarm, Lincoln dispatches young Quinn—instead of the high-profile Pinkerton—to discreetly investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could the proximity of the murder possibly be a coincidence? Or is the crime directly related to Lincoln himself—possibly a political act? Quinn’s observation skills as a frontier scout are invaluable as he examines the victim and begins a complex investigation. Though he is new to Washington, DC, he must navigate through high society, political personages, and a city preparing for war in order to solve the crime. He finds unexpected allies in a determined female journalist named Sophie Gates, and Dr. Hilton, a free man of color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn—with assistance from Sophie and Dr. Hilton—must make haste to solve the murder if he is to protect the president he’s pledged to serve. With the shadow of war looming on the horizon, there’s no margin for error, as no less than the fate of the nation is at stake . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRAISE FOR THE PREVIOUS WORKS OF C. M. GLEASON:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Exhilarating . . . Sure to please.” —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Sunday Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Wonderfully witty . . . deliciously dark and delightfully entertaining.” —&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sophisticated, sexy, surprising . . . This book grabs you and holds you tight till the very last page!” —#1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J. R. Ward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Gleason’s novel is a well-oiled machine . . . the authentic historical framework . . . the compelling personalities.” —&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Witty, intriguing, and addictive.” —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Phenomenal storytelling.” —&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Gretchen Carlson made the decision to "walk off the set" and speak up about sexual harassment in the workplace, she jumped off a cliff by herself, but it led to a new calling: empowering women to reclaim their power against any injustice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After the former Miss America, mother of two, and star news anchor stood up, and spoke out, women all over the world joined the movement and began to take back their lives, careers, and dignity. Gretchen became the voice for the voiceless. BE FIERCE shares Gretchen's experience and powerful stories from the thousands of women who have reached out to her who refuse to submit to intimidation of any kind. Gretchen will also share the wisdom and research of lawyers, psychologists, and other experts helping to confront this problem and advance what has become an international conversation about women refusing to shut up and sit down.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Marc Levy, the most-read French author alive today, comes a modern-day love story between a famous actress hiding in Paris and a bestselling writer lying to himself. They knew their friendship was going to be complicated, but love—and the City of Lights—just might find a way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the big screen, Mia plays a woman in love. But in real life, she’s an actress in need of a break from her real-life philandering husband—the megastar who plays her romantic interest in the movies. So she heads across the English Channel to hide in Paris behind a new haircut, fake eyeglasses, and a waitressing job at her best friend’s restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul is an American author hoping to recapture the fame of his first novel. When his best friend surreptitiously sets him up with Mia through a dating website, Paul and Mia’s relationship status is “complicated.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though everything about Paris seems to be nudging them together, the two lonely ex-pats resist, concocting increasingly far-fetched strategies to stay “just friends.” A feat easier said than done, as fate has other plans in store. Is true love waiting for them in a postscript?</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was okay, if sluggish in places. There are also sections which seem a little unbelievable to me, such as one of the characters being asked for their autograph only a couple of times and freaks out because their "famous" and can't handle it. Otherwise, this book is relatively okay. Maybe...]]>

  <description>Monsters are real.&lt;br /&gt;But so are heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks are champions of weird science. Boasting capes and costumes and amazing super-powers that only make sense if you don't think about them too hard, they fight an eternal battle for truth and justice . . . mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darklings are creatures of myth and magic: ghosts, vampires, were-beasts, and the like. Their very presence warps reality. Doors creak at their approach. Cobwebs gather where they linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Lam is an ordinary college student until a freak scientific accident (what else?) transforms Kim and three housemates into Sparks--and drafts them into the never-ending war between the Light and Dark. They struggle to master their new abilities--and (of course) to design cool costumes and come up with great hero-names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that "accident" was just the first salvo in a Mad Genius's latest diabolical scheme. Now it's up to four newbie heroes to save the day, before they even have a chance to figure out what their team's name should be!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The eagerly awaited English translation of Kaddour’s award-winning novel of clashing cultures during the French colonial years&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gather together French colonialists, young nationalists eager for independence, and local Maghreb leaders in a small North African city of the 1920s. Bring a collection of brash American filmmakers and celebrities into the picture. Dangerous cultural collisions are the inevitable result in Hédi Kaddour’s best-selling novel of French colonial rule and its persisting legacy of human chaos and cultural tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In this commanding novel, the author plumbs the contradictions of colonialism and the impact on individual lives. With insight, humor, and a profound sense of irony he introduces &lt;i&gt;Les Prépondérants&lt;/i&gt;—“The Preponderants,” an unofficial group of peddlers of influence who operate at every level of colonial society. American “Hollywood” values, Islamic and secular politics, French manners—none of them escapes Kaddour’s skewering wit. Filled with rich irony and wonderful characters, this is a novel that grapples forcefully with colonial relations in the Arabic, North African, and French worlds, while also journeying into the simmering Europe and United States of the Roaring Twenties.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From award-winning &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Betina Krahn comes a beguiling new romance brimming with her signature wit, timeless sensuality, and thrilling romance—as desire proves to be a great equalizer...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Bumgarten isn't thrilled to be trying to catch a duke's attention while dressed like a flower pot caught in a swarm of butterflies. But, after all, when in Rome (or in this case London society)... Since her decidedly disastrous debut among New York's privileged set, the sassy Nevada spitfire's last chance to "marry well" lies across the pond, here in England. If she must restrain her free spirit, not to mention her rib cage, so be it. She knows she owes it to her three younger sisters to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, under a countess's tutelage, Daisy appears the perfect duchess-in-training...Until notorious ladies' man Lord Ashton Graham, a distraction of the most dangerous kind, glimpses her mischievous smile and feisty nature—and attempts to unmask her motives. Daisy has encountered snakes on the range, but one dressed to the nines in an English drawing room is positively unnerving—and maddeningly seductive. When a veiled plot emerges to show up Daisy as unworthy of the aristocracy, will Ashton be her worst detractor? Or the nobleman she needs most of all?</description>

  <description>Against overwhelming odds, can she save her legacy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the bustling vibrancy of Auckland’s Karangahape Road Gwenna Price is troubled. For all her youth, she is now the master confectioner in the family business since her father died. She promised to fulfil her Pa’s dreams and open a shop, but with her domineering and incompetent stepbrother Elias in charge, the operation is on the brink of collapse. &lt;br /&gt;In an era when women were expected to stay at home, Gwenna is a plucky young woman with uncommon ambition. She is determined to save her legacy. Despite the obstacles put in her way, and throughout the twists and turns of love and tragedy, Gwenna is irrepressible. She refuses to relinquish her dreams and lets nothing stand in her way. Blind to anything that distracts her, Gwenna risks losing the one person who matters most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of a IndieBRAG and a Chill with a Book Readers' Award plus &lt;br /&gt;a BGS Gold Quality Mark</description>

The story of Boba the skyte and Aiden the young Tarthun boy is retold for you so that you may know to look for the Moon Dragon each night, and understand where he has gone when the moon goes dark.</description>

  <description>Kate is a survivor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years after her breakdown, Kate has built a successful career as a family mediator, specializing in couple's reconciliation. In fact, she's about to receive a prestigious award for her accomplishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her latest mediation brings together a young couple on the brink of divorce, and only Kate's expertise and sensitivity can save them. It also, unexpectedly, reconnects her with former lover Simon Sharpe, who represents the high and the low points of her life, uncomfortably forcing her to revisit her difficult and painful past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still haunted by her unrequited love, Simon's reemergence in Kate's life exhumes memories of trauma and heartbreak, along with unwanted feelings of insecurity and self-doubt she believed were long resolved. As Simon and Kate steer their feuding, secretive clients towards reconciliation and navigate their confusing past, their own relationship reignites and takes them on an unexpected path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Kate trust Simon? And can she trust herself?</description>

  <description>Ghost stories are found in every corner of Newfoundland and Labrador, and no one knows them better than storyteller and folklorist Dale Jarvis. In this collection of ghostly tales, Jarvis introduces you to old legends, including spectral Viking longships, encounters with ghostly ferrymen, and strange voices on the trapline, while exploring classic elements of local folklore such as tokens and premonitions, bad weather lights, and the Old Hag herself. In addition to historical tales, you will also come face to face with some of the province’s eeriest urban legends, from the mysterious Red Eyes of Glovertown, to the chilling west coast Webber, to the Phantom Drummer of Conception Bay North.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With leaping witches, dancing devils, phantom locomotives, and even a ghostly kitten or two, there is no mistaking that you are exploring truly haunted ground. Welcome to Newfoundland and Labrador—a place so steeped in history and tradition that some inhabitants never, ever, want to leave.</description>

  <description>Now a formidable Sorceress, Eliza Tok at sixteen is a world away from the unknowing child she once was. But unlike the previous Shang Sorceresses, Eliza will always act out of love, for those she loves, above all else. Above even the greater good of the worlds Tian Di and Tian Xia? The Mancers, and her enemy the Xia Sorceress, think so. And Eliza, when she unhesitatingly uses her tremendous abilities to save her best friend Charlie from a terrible attack, is inclined to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Eliza, Charlie, Nell and the ever-loyal Mancer teacher Foss embark on a quest to protect Charlie's life from an unrelenting enemy, Eliza is brought to the very edge of what she can withstand, both as a Sorceress and as a human girl. Forced to trust her enemies, face up to devastating truths and gather the greatest and most ancient power her world has ever known, she must confront and question her most profoundly held beliefs. Is Eliza powerful enough to shape her destiny, or will she let it shape her?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The much-anticipated eighth novel in Ann Cleeves' bestselling Vera Stanhope series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A visit to her local prison brings DI Vera Stanhope face to face with an old enemy: former detective superintendent, and now inmate, John Brace. Brace was convicted of corruption and involvement in the death of a gamekeeper - and Vera played a part in his downfall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brace promises Vera information about the disappearance of Robbie Marshall, a notorious wheeler-dealer, if she will look out for his daughter and grandchildren. He tells her that Marshall is dead, his body is buried close to St Mary's Island in Whitley Bay. However, when a search team investigates, officers find not one skeleton, but two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cold case case takes Vera back in time, and very close to home, as Brace and Marshall, along with a mysterious stranger known only as ‘the Prof', were close friends of Hector, her father. Together, they were ‘the Gang of Four', and Hector had been one of the last people to see Marshall alive. Vera must confront her prejudices and unwanted memories to dig out the truth, as the past begins to collide dangerously with the present… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Seagull&lt;/i&gt; is Ann Cleeves' searing new novel, about corruption deep in the heart of a community, and about fragile, and fracturing, family relationships.</description>

  <description>As one of the first female umpires in the minors, Margie puts up with insults and worse from people who think women don’t belong in baseball. Forget making history—Margie just wants to do her job and be part of the game she loves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s ready for the rude comments. The lousy pay. The endless traveling. But when she suspects a big-name slugger of cheating, she has to choose: let the dirty player get away with it, or blow the whistle and risk her career…and maybe her twin brother’s major-league prospects, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it’s up to Margie to make the call.</description>

  <description>For ten years, something has gnawed at Isaiah Quintabe's gut and kept him up nights, boiling with anger and thoughts of revenge. Ten years ago, when Isaiah was just a boy, his brother was killed by an unknown assailant. The search for the killer sent Isaiah plunging into despair and nearly destroyed his life. Even with a flourishing career, a new dog, and near-iconic status as a PI in his hometown, East Long Beach, he has to begin the hunt again—or lose his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A case takes him and his volatile, dubious sidekick, Dodson, to Vegas, where Chinese gangsters and a terrifying seven-foot loan shark are stalking a DJ and her screwball boyfriend. If Isaiah doesn't find the two first, they'll be murdered. Awaiting the outcome is the love of IQ's life: fail, and he'll lose her. Isaiah's quest is fraught with treachery, menace, and startling twists, and it will lead him to the mastermind behind his brother's death.</description>

  <description>Fast-paced, full of wit and humor, and sure to delight fans of authors like Carl Hiassen and Nick Hornby, "Valley of Time: The Greatest Journey Ever Taken" is a truly original novel from one of contemporary fiction’s most thrilling new voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mal Thomas only escaped with his life through a mixture of good fortune and divine intervention, after he and his eclectic team of cynical mad men and women were charged with promoting the alleged second coming of the Messiah, by Alfredo Baptiste, the world’s most powerful industrialist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having subsequently become famous as a best-selling author—as well as an unlikely spiritual leader—after having written and promoted a book about those experiences, Mal is now approached by another enigmatic billionaire with an equally incredible proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huw Hudson, the man often described as a modern-day Howard Hughes, wants to position his company, Space Rider, as the leader in commercial space tourism. He tries to enlist Mal and his team to help promote it, with one extraordinary twist: Hudson has evidence of an alleged UFO encounter, which he thinks could damage his business plans, and he asks Mal to investigate and manage the breaking news story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mal discovers a deeper purpose at work, as he crisscrosses Brazil, Miami, London, and Dubai in furtherance of Hudson’s audacious ambition, while being forced to keep an unbelievable secret from the FBI and even his closest friends. In confronting his deepest fears, Mal takes us on a journey that challenges the very core of our beliefs about space and time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a fast-moving and often sardonic narrative, author Jeremy Holden will have you fascinated by the extraordinary nature of the challenges that Mal and his team find themselves confronted with, as they launch a massive global campaign to promote one of the most seismic events in human history.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Valley of Time" provides a window into the modern world of digital and social media-driven mass persuasion, while posing this pivotal question: What if you could go back to the pivotal moment in time that shaped your life. Would you try to alter your fate?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Valley of Time" is the second book in Jeremy D. Holden’s Mal Thomas Mystery Series.</description>

  <description>Have you ever wondered about how life would have been "if"? Have you ever wondered about what would have happened "if" you had done something different? Did you think that what was in your imagination never matched your reality? Have you known children that seemed to have been in tune with you before you could speak? Is there anyway for you to understand the far-reaching consequences of one small choice? This book provides a way to see how choices from centuries ago affect family dynamics in the present, and how they influence children for their futures.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mystery-solving criminal lawyer Crang returns to investigate the disappearance of two rare books.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mason Davis is a Toronto antiquarian book dealer, internationally respected in the business. One night, someone blows the safe in his office and makes off with the contents, which include reputed first editions of Jane Austen s &lt;i&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Emma&lt;/i&gt;. Davis, who was still in the process of verifying the stolen books, doesn't even know whether they were the real thing or clever forgeries. But rather than summon the cops to investigate the theft, he turns to his pal Crang, the nervy criminal lawyer, hoping he can retrieve the books before their owner gets wind of the crime. The owner who, by the way, happens to be the richest woman in Canada and a tough cookie who can ruin Davis s career. &lt;br /&gt; Crang gets on the hunt, learning much about the trade in musty books and the lucrative business it makes for forgers. Just as he seems to be getting close to answers, a shocking development makes things much more complicated and much more dangerous."</description>

  <description>“&lt;i&gt;HowYaGettin’On&lt;/i&gt;?” is how downtown St. John’s, Newfoundland, corner boy Snook says hello. He’s been hanging around, telling yarns, and having a laugh for over thirty years now, and this is his welcome for you to read all about some of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Known as a fast talker and funny laugher, Snook finally jotted down some of his musings on . . . stuff—all sorts of stuff. Some of it’s actually half-decent, as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So have a sit (wherever you please, or need to), relax your literary standards, and see what goes on in one of the most suspect minds and imaginations in this province.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Culled from weekly columns written for the &lt;i&gt;Newfoundland Herald&lt;/i&gt;, this collection is not half bad. Enjoy! And rrrright on!</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author and Hall of Famer Ken Dryden, this is the story of NHLer Steve Montador—who was diagnosed with CTE after his death in 2015—the remarkable evolution of hockey itself, and a passionate prescriptive to counter its greatest risk in the future: head injuries.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ken Dryden’s The Game is acknowledged as the best book about hockey, and one of the best books about sports ever written. Then came Home Game (with Roy MacGregor), also a major TV-series, in which he explored hockey’s significance and what it means to Canada and Canadians. Now, in his most powerful and important book yet, Game Change, Ken Dryden tells the riveting story of one player’s life, examines the intersection between science and sport, and expertly documents the progression of the game of hockey—where it began, how it got to where it is, where it can go from here and, just as exciting to play and watch, how it can get there.</description>

  <description>Victor Simone, head of a hit man organization, murdered Belle McBain's corrupt father. Following in her dad's career footsteps, Belle becomes an attorney, but she can't seem to move beyond the whispers of her crooked father's corruption or his failures to his family. Instead of building a career in law, she escapes to a life of drugs and lives off her trust fund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to cope, Belle attempts suicide and is soon admitted into a rehab clinic where she tries to heal. However, her wounds run deep, so the healing takes time. Once released and three years sober, Belle begins a new life as a private investigator in Jersey City with the help of a friend in law enforcement. Sixteen years have passed ... until everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Victor Simone's cronies is in FBI custody and makes a deal. He says he'll tell where the fugitive Simone is hiding if Belle agrees to meet with him. When she does, she begins to wonder if her father was ever a dirty attorney at all. As she searches for answers, Belle discovers more than she bargained for, including something more unbelievable than she could have imagined.</description>

  <description>From a breathtakingly mature new voice in Canadian fiction comes an exquisite debut novel of family secrets, divided loyalties, and what we’re willing to do to save ourselves, set against the seductive world of 1960s Rio de Janeiro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in 1963 Rio, Brazil, this mesmerizing first novel follows a glamorous and long-privileged family as they prepare to leave the seeming paradise of Brazil for Canada in the wake of the mysterious disappearance—and presumed drowning—of their eldest daughter a year earlier. As the novel moves back and forth between the members of the Maurer family, we are not only immersed in a unique time and place, but also gradually taken into the heart of a family whose beauty and charm belie a more troubled reality. We meet the family’s brilliant and charismatic father, whose bipolar extremes are becoming increasingly disturbing; his long-suffering wife, who once had a brief affair that proves to have shattering consequences for the family she swore to protect; their two remaining daughters, both on the brink of understanding the darker currents that run in their once-proud family; and the lost daughter herself, a beautiful young woman undone by her own grand delusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With settings ranging from the golden beaches of Rio to the squalor of its fishing villages, from the glamour of the legendary Copacabana Club to the austerity of a remote convent, this revelatory novel takes us into the soul of a family already living in the shadow of loss and now poised to leave behind everything they’ve ever known, if only they could make peace with the past.</description>
