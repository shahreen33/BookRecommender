  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;Girl Friends &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Strawberry Panic! &lt;/i&gt;comes the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;yuri&lt;/i&gt; series--now with an anime adaptation!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuzuko Aihara, a high school girl whose main interests are fashion, friends, and having fun, is about to get a reality check. Due to her mom’s remarriage, Yuzu has transferred to a new, all-girls school that is extremely strict. Her real education is about to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From day one, happy-go-lucky Yuzu makes enemies, namely the beautiful yet stern Student Council President Mei. So what happens when a dejected Yuzu returns home and discovers the shock of her life: that Mei is actually her new step-sister who has come to live with her? Even more surprising, when Mei catches Yuzu off guard and kisses her out of the blue, what does it all mean?</description>

  <description>At the café atop the hill, newcomer Hime looks up to her elegant coworker, Mitsuki, but their work partnership leaves much to be desired! Hime tries to maintain her perfect-girl façade, but after causing so many mishaps-- complete with spilled drinks and online rumors--Mitsuki finally sits her down for some real talk. Much to Hime's horror, it turns out that the two share a deep history, and this reality shakes Hime to her core. Now she can't seem to keep her head straight at work! Can she ever gain Mitsuki's trust...and is it all even worth it?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The new, hilarious yuri comedy! Hime gets roped into working at a weird café where the waitresses pretend to be students at an all-girl boarding school. She's strangely taken with her partner Mitsuki, who's so kind to her in front of the customers. There's just one problem... Mitsuki really can't stand her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MAIDEN AWAKENS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hime is a picture-perfect high school princess--she's admired by all and never trips up! So when she accidentally injures a café manager named Mai, she's willing to cover some shifts to keep her façade intact. To Hime's surprise, the café is themed after a private school where the all-female staff always puts on their best act for their loyal customers. However, under the guidance of the most graceful girl there, she can't help but blush and blunder! Beneath all the frills and laughter, Hime feels tension brewing as she finds out more about her new job and her budding feelings...</description>

  <description>The first production of Oscar Wilde's Salome in 1918 touched off a firestorm in London when the play's lead, exotic dancer Maud Allan, was denounced as belonging to the Cult of the Clitoris -- a feminine variation on the Cult of Wilde, the mark of degeneracy and perversion. The ensuing libel trial, brought to life in this authoritative, spellbinding book, raised the specters of hysteria, homophobia, and paranoia that, like Wilde himself, have haunted our century.</description>

I bought it in June 1999, tried reading it several times over the decades, and finally finished it from beginning to end after being determined to do so. Even then it still took me four months. Why?

  <description>Yellow for gratitude. Pink for respect. Violet for apology. Red...for that someone special...This is the language of ribbons wrapped around flowers. What does it mean, though, when the person giving Izumi a flower wrapped in red is handing them out to multiple people? Is it okay for Izumi to keep it, even though Chiharu is the only one for her? While Izumi grapples with this question, Chiharu has to decide what's important to her when the one who broke her heart, Hoshino-senpai, pays a visit... p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Calibri; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} span.s1 {font-kerning: none}</description>

  <description>In this rare insider's view into contemporary North Korea, a high-ranking counterintelligence agent describes his life as a former poet laureate to Kim Jong-il and his breathtaking escape to freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The General will now enter the room."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone turns to stone. Not moving my head, I direct my eyes to a point halfway up the archway where Kim Jong-il's face will soon appear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As North Korea's State Poet Laureate, Jang Jin-sung led a charmed life. With food provisions (even as the country suffered through its great famine), a travel pass, access to strictly censored information, and audiences with Kim Jong-il himself, his life in Pyongyang seemed safe and secure. But this privileged existence was about to be shattered. When a strictly forbidden magazine he lent to a friend goes missing, Jang Jin-sung must flee for his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before has a member of the elite described the inner workings of this totalitarian state and its propaganda machine. An astonishing expose told through the heart-stopping story of Jang Jin-sung's escape to South Korea, &lt;i&gt;Dear Leader&lt;/i&gt; is a rare and unprecedented insight into the world's most secretive and repressive regime.</description>

(It doesn't help that the event that drives their drama is the incredibly quotidian classroom activity of staging a Student Council play.)

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.</description>

  <description>Most people want out of North Korea. Wendy Simmons wanted in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Holiday in North Korea: The Funniest/Worst Place on Earth&lt;/i&gt;, Wendy shares a glimpse of North Korea as it’s never been seen before. Even though it’s the scariest place on Earth, somehow Wendy forgot to check her sense of humor at the border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Wendy’s initial amusement and bewilderment soon turned to frustration and growing paranoia. Before long, she learned the essential conundrum of “tourism” in North Korea: Travel is truly a love affair. But, just like love, it’s a two-way street. And North Korea deprives you of all this. They want you to fall in love with the singular vision of the country they’re willing to show you and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through poignant, laugh-out-loud essays and 92 color photographs of North Korea rarely published, Wendy chronicles one of the strangest vacations ever. Along the way, she bares all while undergoing an inner journey as convoluted as the country itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Accusation&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply moving and eye-opening work of fiction that paints a powerful portrait of life under the North Korean regime. Set during the period of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il’s leadership, the seven stories that make up &lt;i&gt;The Accusation&lt;/i&gt; give voice to people living under this most bizarre and horrifying of dictatorships. The characters of these compelling stories come from a wide variety of backgrounds, from a young mother living among the elite in Pyongyang whose son misbehaves during a political rally, to a former Communist war hero who is deeply disillusioned with the intrusion of the Party into everything he holds dear, to a husband and father who is denied a travel permit and sneaks onto a train in order to visit his critically ill mother. Written with deep emotion and writing talent, &lt;i&gt;The Accusation&lt;/i&gt; is a vivid depiction of life in a closed-off one-party state, and also a hopeful testament to the humanity and rich internal life that persists even in such inhumane conditions.</description>

      <![CDATA[If there's a problem with Morinaga's books, it's not that they're formulaic (indeed, she even provides a basic overview of her formula in the Author's Note), it's that they often end a little too suddenly. This may not be her fault, since I believe these stories run as serials in magazines in Jap...]]>

  <description>The Grisly Valley horror-themed amusement park has been deserted since the nearby nuclear meltdown made it a contamination zone. But Rosie Sinclair is headed to Grisly anyway, following an elusive trail to rescue her kidnapped family. As she crosses the country, she dreads that Dean Berg is holding her family hostage and once again manipulating her every move to increase her fear, priming her for a final, lethal dream-mining procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she struggles to outmaneuver Berg, Rosie can’t ignore the growing restlessness in the back of her own mind. The turmoil she feels is more than worry over Burnham’s unnerving generosity, the camera in Linus’s eye, or Thea’s fragile health. Faced with unspeakable suffering and otherworldly beauty, Rosie must discover how to trust her mind, her friends, and reality itself.</description>

  <description>At the remote, exclusive Chimera Centre, families of coma patients come from all over the world seeking miracles. When Althea Flores wakes up from a six-month coma, her recovery defies the limits of hope and science—except she can’t remember anything about her own life. Instead, she has all the memories of Rosie Sinclair, the missing &lt;i&gt;Forge Show&lt;/i&gt; star, and she’s pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from the Chimera Centre, in a secret vault, the sleeping body of Rosie Sinclair is captive to the doctors who mine her dreams. Heavily sedated, Rosie struggles to awaken and manipulate her keeper for a chance to escape. She knows what she’ll do once she’s free—wreak vengeance on Dean Berg, the man who stole her dreams and turned her life into a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating points of view between the girl who has Rosie’s consciousness in a new, pregnant body, and the girl whose shattered subconscious rules Rosie’s old body, the second installment of The Vault of Dreamers trilogy is an intricate, psychologically thrilling novel about layers of identity, what lies in the mirror, and the link between body and soul.</description>

      <![CDATA[It took me a lot longer to read this than the first book, because it just didn't seem as compelling. The first story was strange and different from the usual dystopian fare, somehow--the fact I couldn't put my finger on how, or why, is a big reason why I liked the book.<br /><br />This one though...]]>

      <![CDATA[At the end of the last book, the author promised to make things "even more dramatic" and "messier," and I worried it was just going to go down a path of invented drama for drama's sake. Somehow, that didn't happen. Even though there are some contrived situations, it all works as a vehicle for sho...]]>

  <description>"Living on the moon . . . Whatever were we thinking? . . . It seems so silly now."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lunar colony is slowly winding down, like a small town circumvented by a new super highway. As our hero, the Mooncop, makes his daily rounds, his beat grows ever smaller, the population dwindles. A young girl runs away, a dog breaks off his leash, an automaton wanders off from the Museum of the Moon.</description>

It could have been a metaphor or reflection on the back-side of grand and once-futurist ideas, and how everything comes to pass; but it's really not, it's just a quiet slice-of-life for those still living in a town that people...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Pachinko&lt;/i&gt; follows one Korean family through the generations, beginning in early 1900s Korea with Sunja, the prized daughter of a poor yet proud family, whose unplanned pregnancy threatens to shame them all. Deserted by her lover, Sunja is saved when a young tubercular minister offers to marry and bring her to Japan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a sweeping saga of an exceptional family in exile from its homeland and caught in the indifferent arc of history. Through desperate struggles and hard-won triumphs, its members are bound together by deep roots as they face enduring questions of faith, family, and identity.</description>

  <description>Two girls, a new school, and the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&lt;br /&gt; In middle school, Ayaka Shiramine was the perfect student: hard-working, with excellent grades and a great personality to match.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Not your garden variety &lt;i&gt;yuri&lt;/i&gt; love story!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yamada may be shy and rather clumsy, but the flower gardens at her school have always brought her happiness. Suddenly, a different sort of beauty catches her eye -- the vivacious track star, Kase-san. Although the two girls don't seem to have much in common, they soon start a romance where each must learn an important lesson in tending their budding relationship. Can the two girls, so different from each other, learn how to make their first love blossom?</description>

  <description>An eye-opening account of life inside North Korea--a closed world of increasing global importance--hailed as a "tour de force of meticulous reporting" (&lt;i&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST - NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD FINALIST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this landmark addition to the literature of totalitarianism, award-winning journalist Barbara Demick follows the lives of six North Korean citizens over fifteen years--a chaotic period that saw the death of Kim Il-sung, the rise to power of his son Kim Jong-il (the father of Kim Jong-un), and a devastating famine that killed one-fifth of the population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive regime today--an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, where displays of affection are punished, informants are rewarded, and an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. She takes us deep inside the country, beyond the reach of government censors, and through meticulous and sensitive reporting we see her subjects fall in love, raise families, nurture ambitions, and struggle for survival. One by one, we witness their profound, life-altering disillusionment with the government and their realization that, rather than providing them with lives of abundance, their country has betrayed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Nothing to Envy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Provocative . . . offers extensive evidence of the author's deep knowledge of this country while keeping its sights firmly on individual stories and human details."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Deeply moving . . . The personal stories are related with novelistic detail."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A tour de force of meticulous reporting."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Excellent . . . humanizes a downtrodden, long-suffering people whose individual lives, hopes and dreams are so little known abroad."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The narrow boundaries of our knowledge have expanded radically with the publication of Nothing to Envy. . . . Elegantly structured and written, [it] is a groundbreaking work of literary nonfiction."&lt;b&gt;--John Delury, &lt;i&gt;Slate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"At times a page-turner, at others an intimate study in totalitarian psychology."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From the outside looking in, Jennifer Pan seemed like a model daughter living a perfect life. The ideal child, the one her immigrant parents saw, was studying to become a pharmacist at the University of Toronto. But there was a dark, deceptive side to the angelic young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, Jennifer spent her days in the arms of her high school sweetheart, Daniel. In an attempt to lead the life she dreamed of, she would do almost anything: lie about her whereabouts, forge school documents, and invent fake jobs and a fictitious apartment. For many years she led this double life. But when her father discovered her web of lies, his ultimatum was severe. And so, too, was her revenge: a plan that culminated in cold-blooded murder. And it almost worked, except for one bad shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Jennifer Pan is one of all-consuming love and devious betrayal that led to a cold-hearted plan hatched by a group of youths who thought they could pull off the perfect crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;2017 Arthur Ellis Award, Best Nonfiction Book — Winner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sinister plot by a young woman left her mother dead and her father riddled with bullets.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In this stunning true crime thriller of Facebook, catfishing, and jealousy, a double-murder begins with the click of a button. &lt;br /&gt; When Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth began their romance, they unknowingly set in motion a diabolical plot that would end with them murdered in their own home, Hayworth holding their mercifully unharmed infant. &lt;br /&gt; Chris was a CIA agent who was concerned about Jenelle. Seeing the cyberbullying she had endured, and worried for her safety, Chris got in touch with Jenelle s protective parents, and her devoted boyfriend, warning them that Payne and Hayworth were a danger to Jenelle. He got especially close with Jenelle s mother, Barbara, who thought of Chris like a son, though she had never met him. Chris claimed that surveillance of Payne and Hayworth revealed that the two of them were planning on harming Jenelle, that it was imminent, and that something needed to be done immediately. Chris promised that he would have their back if they were to act to protect Jenelle. &lt;br /&gt; And so they did. Jenelle s father, Buddy, and her boyfriend, Jamie, broke into the home of Payne and Hayworth and murdered them in their own home. &lt;br /&gt; What the police investigation turned up, though, made this crime all the more terrifying. Jenelle had been Chris the entire time, catfishing her family and her boyfriend to act in vengeance on her behalf. Using forensic linguistics and diving through the brambles that Jenelle laid to cover her tracks, police were able to put together a chilling portrait of a sociopath, made all the more ruthless by the anonymity of her online life. &lt;br /&gt; Bizarre and unforgettable, Dennis Brooks examines the crime and trial from all angles, bringing his expertise as the lead prosecutor in the strange and disturbing case."</description>

The entire case is laid out from the author's point of view, as the chief prosecutor. As such, it's a little myopic. It's basica...]]>

  <description>Yuma and Hotaru have been friends since childhood. It is only natural that when Yuma is nervous about her new boyfriend, she asks Hotaru and her boyfriend along for a double date. But when Hotaru offers herself to Yuma as “practice”, both girls realize that they’re more interested in each other than they are in their own boyfriends. With boyfriends in the foreground but a secret, passionate tryst in the background, will Yuma and Hotaru try to forget what happened between them or have they fallen into a trap of true love and betrayal?</description>

  <description>To Loyalists, Michael Stone is an idol and an icon. His name and face are painted on walls across Belfast, and his desire to remove Adams and McGuinness from the political spectrum has turned him into a local super-hero. A meticulous killing machine, he executed six men, whose deaths were claimed under different Loyalist groupings, and when justice finally caught up with him he was sentenced to 800 years in prison. Twelve years later, he left a free man, renounced terrorism, apologized for the suffering he had caused and said the fledgling peace process was the only way forward. This is his own true story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/i&gt;, the #1 French best-seller, tells the unforgettable story of Riad Sattouf's childhood, spent in the shadows of 3 dictators—Muammar Gaddafi, Hafez al-Assad, and his father&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In striking, virtuoso graphic style that captures both the immediacy of childhood and the fervor of political idealism, Riad Sattouf recounts his nomadic childhood growing up in rural France, Gaddafi's Libya, and Assad's Syria--but always under the roof of his father, a Syrian Pan-Arabist who drags his family along in his pursuit of grandiose dreams for the Arab nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riad, delicate and wide-eyed, follows in the trail of his mismatched parents; his mother, a bookish French student, is as modest as his father is flamboyant. Venturing first to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab State and then joining the family tribe in Homs, Syria, they hold fast to the vision of the paradise that always lies just around the corner. And hold they do, though food is scarce, children kill dogs for sport, and with locks banned, the Sattoufs come home one day to discover another family occupying their apartment. The ultimate outsider, Riad, with his flowing blond hair, is called the ultimate insult… Jewish. And in no time at all, his father has come up with yet another grand plan, moving from building a new people to building his own great palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with life and dark humor, &lt;i&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/i&gt; reveals the truth and texture of one eccentric family in an absurd Middle East, and also introduces a master cartoonist in a work destined to stand alongside &lt;i&gt;Maus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Persepolis&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Melissa Broder always struggled with anxiety. In the fall of 2012, she went through a harrowing cycle of panic attacks and dread that wouldn't abate for months. So she began @sosadtoday, an anonymous Twitter feed that allowed her to express her darkest feelings, and which quickly gained a dedicated following. In &lt;i&gt;So Sad Today&lt;/i&gt;, Broder delves deeper into the existential themes she explores on Twitter, grappling with sex, death, love, low self-esteem, addiction, and the drama of waiting for the universe to text you back. With insights as sharp as her humor, Broder explores—in prose that is both gutsy and beautiful, aggressively colloquial and achingly poetic—questions most of us are afraid to even acknowledge, let alone answer, in order to discover what it really means to be a person in this modern world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kevin Kwan, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/i&gt;, is back with a wickedly funny new novel of social climbing, secret e-mails, art-world scandal, lovesick billionaires, and the outrageous story of what happens when Rachel Chu, engaged to marry Asia's most eligible bachelor, discovers her birthfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the eve of her wedding to Nicholas Young, heir to one of the greatest fortunes in Asia, Rachel should be over the moon. She has a flawless Asscher-cut diamond from JAR, a wedding dress she loves more than anything found in the salons of Paris, and a fiance willing to sacrifice his entire inheritance in order to marry her. But Rachel still mourns the fact that her birthfather, a man she never knew, won't be able to walk her down the aisle. Until: a shocking revelation draws Rachel into a world of Shanghai splendor beyond anything she has ever imagined. Here we meet Carlton, a Ferrari-crashing bad boy known for Prince Harry-like antics; Colette, a celebrity girlfriend chased by fevered paparazzi; and the man Rachel has spent her entire life waiting to meet: her father. Meanwhile, Singapore's It Girl, Astrid Leong, is shocked to discover that there is a downside to having a newly minted tech billionaire husband. A romp through Asia's most exclusive clubs, auction houses, and estates, &lt;i&gt;China Rich Girlfriend&lt;/i&gt; brings us into the elite circles of Mainland China, introducing a captivating cast of characters, and offering an inside glimpse at what it's like to be gloriously, crazily, China-rich.</description>

  <description>STOP! IN THE NAME OF LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she was a child, Aoba has had only one dream: to fight evil and protect the weak. To achieve this dream, Aoba became a polizi, a teenaged undercover cop stationed at all-girls Hanagaki High. While Aoba will go to any length to solve a crime, her no-nonsense, by-the-book partner Midori constantly tries to reign her in. Just as this odd couple is starting to get along, Midori's former partner, Akari, shows up. Akari seems to have her own agenda at the school, and even worse, is determined to steal Midori away! Will this mysterious newcomer break up their partnership before Aoba gets the chance to tell Midori how she really feels?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Gakuen Polizi &lt;/i&gt;is the newest manga series by yuri icon Milk Morinaga, author and artist of &lt;i&gt;Girl Friends&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; Kisses, Sighs, and Cherry Blossom Pink&lt;/i&gt;. This ongoing manga series is illustrated in a delightful shoujo art style that features a color insert in each volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child, Sasami Aoba fantasized about becoming a defender of justice, like the magical girls and "Sentai Rangers" she admired on TV. Years have passed and now Sasami has become a police officer herself. Her first assignment is to infiltrate Hanagaki All-Girls High School and ferret out any trouble she may find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her first day posing as a student, Sasami is shocked to discover that an apparent book thief at school is actually another undercover police officer, Sakuraba Midori. What's more, Midori insists that she herself is the officer in charge of the school, not Sasami. Will the two girls become rivals, partners...or something more?</description>

  <description>What’s the first thing many women do when they go home? Make a dash for the white wine in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Her Best-Kept Secret, journalist Gabrielle Glaser uncovers this hidden-in-plain-sight drinking epidemic—but doesn’t cause you to recoil in alarm. She is the first to document that American women are drinking more often than ever and in ever larger quantities. And she is the first to show that contrary to the impression fostered by reality shows and Gossip Girl, young women alone are not driving these statistics—their moms and grandmothers are, too. But Glaser doesn’t wag a finger. Instead, in a funny and tender voice, Glaser looks at the roots of the problem, explores the strange history of women and alcohol in America, drills into the emerging and counterintuitive science about that relationship, and asks: Are women really getting the help they need? Is it possible to come back from beyond the sipping point and develop a healthy relationship with the bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glaser reveals that, for many women, joining Alcoholics Anonymous is not the answer—it is part of the problem. She shows that as scientists and health professionals learn more about women’s particular reactions to alcohol, they are coming up with new and more effective approaches to excessive drinking. In that sense, Glaser offers modern solutions to a very modern problem.</description>

  <description>True Confessions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since their first kiss, Yuzu can't stop thinking about Mei, her stern sexy step-sister. Now Mei seems to have done a total one-eighty, ignoring Yuzu at every turn and giving her the cold shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuzu can't understand why Mei is acting so distant but she decides to try and patch things up with her step-sis while on a school trip to Kyoto. However, she's not the only one who has her eye on Mei. Sara, a vivacious girl with boundless energy, happens to bump into Mei and falls in love with her at first sight. To make matters worse, Sara's twin sister, Nina, is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that Sara gets what she wants. Can Yuzu fix things between herself and Mei, or will the twins break up their bond for good?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;alternate cover edition for ISBN 0544416694&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you really need?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One by one, the teens in Nottawa, Wisconsin, join the newest, hottest networking site and answer one question: What do you need? A new iPhone? Backstage passes to a concert? In exchange for a seemingly minor task, the NEED site will fulfill your request. Everyone is doing it. So why shouldn’t you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaylee Dunham knows what she needs—a kidney for her sick brother. She doesn’t believe a social networking site can help, but it couldn’t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or could it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making her request, Kaylee starts to realize the price that will have to be paid for her need to be met. The demands the site makes on users in exchange for their desires are escalating, and so is the body count. Will Kaylee be able to unravel the mystery of who created the NEED network before it destroys them all?</description>

  <description>Yuzuko Aihara, a high school girl whose main interests are fashion, friends and having fun, is about to get a reality check. Due to her mom's remarriage, Yuzu has transfered to a new, all-girls school that is extemely strict. Her real education is about to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Day One, happy-go-lucky Yuzu makes enemies, namely the beautiful yet stern Student Council President Mei. So what happens when a dejected Yuzu returns home and discovers the shock of her life: that Mei is actually her new step-sister who has come to live with her? Even more surprising, when Mei catches Yuzu offguard and kisses her out of the blue, what does it all mean?</description>

  <description>A yuri tale like no other, now a New York Times manga best seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuzu and Mei may be step-sisters, but that's about all the two girls have in common. Yuzu is an outgoing girly-girl who cares more about fashion than school work, while Mei is the serious student council president. Yet despite their differences, or perhaps because of them, the two girls find themselves drawn to each other...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mei has been running herself ragged trying to oversee the school, and Yuzu is worried about her. When Mei's dad comes home from a business trip, however, it looks like the cavalry has arrived. Unfortunately, his presence opens up old wounds between father and daughter, and Yuzu finds herself caught in the middle. Will Yuzu put aside her feelings for Mei to help fix this family feud?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Milk Morinaga, the author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling manga &lt;i&gt;Girl Friends&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the cherry blossoms bloom it means the start of another school year—and for the girls at Sakuraki High, it signals the birth of new dreams, fears, and relationships. In “Even If We’re Not Friends,” Nana and Hitomi have been dear friends since childhood, but when Nana gets into the exclusive Sakuraki High while Hitomi doesn’t, their true feelings for each other emerge. In “The Summer Closest to Heaven,” Natsuka is a ghost who resides at the school, still in love with one of the former students who is now the school nurse. In “A Kiss, Love, and a Prince,” Narumi gets her first kiss from Tachiba in the school play, and is shocked at being kissed by a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen stories of blossoming romance between girls are interspersed throughout this heartfelt and adorably illustrated manga collection.</description>

One big question remains: are they ready to face the world as a couple?</description>

  <description>When it comes to grades, bookish high school student Kumakura Mariko is at the top of her class. Socially, however, she is shy and lonely, typically eating lunch by herself. Enter the charismatic and beautiful Ohashi Akko, whose goal is to befriend Mariko and burst her out of her introverted shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process of transforming "Plain Jane" Mariko into one of the cutest, most popular girls in school, deep feelings begin to emerge that suggest something deeper than friendship. Will these feelings destroy the budding relationship between Mariko and Akko, or will it turn into something else?</description>

  <description>Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles?&lt;p&gt;Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house "spark joy" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Well known and well regarded in the world of science fiction and fantasy writing, Vandana Singh brings her unique imagination to a wider audience in this collection of stories, newly reissued by Zubaan Books. In the title story, a woman tells her husband of her curious discovery: that she is inhabited by small alien creatures. In another, a young girl making her way to college through the streets of Delhi comes across a mysterious tetrahedron. Is it a spaceship? Or a secret weapon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Indian female speculative fiction writer, Singh has said that her genre is a “chance to find ourselves part of a larger whole; to step out of the claustrophobia of the exclusively human and discover joy, terror, wonder, and meaning in the greater universe.” A revolutionary voice in fantasy writing, Singh brings her passion for discovery to these stories, and the result is like nothing of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;Hunger (2007)&lt;br /&gt;Delhi (2004)&lt;br /&gt;The Woman Who Thought She Was a Planet (2003)&lt;br /&gt;Infinities (2008)&lt;br /&gt;Thirst (2004)&lt;br /&gt;Conservation Laws (2008)&lt;br /&gt;Three Tales from Sky River: Myths for a Starfaring Age (2004)&lt;br /&gt;The Tetrahedron (2005)&lt;br /&gt;The Wife (2003)&lt;br /&gt;The Room on the Roof (2002)&lt;br /&gt;A Speculative Manifesto (2008) essay</description>

  <description>From award-winning, Los Angeles Times bestselling author Jervey Tervalon comes a highly clever, twisting tale of suspense involving drugs, perverse sex, and poisonous celebrity worship, in which a man trying to rebuild his life becomes entangled in dangerous and deadly circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, Gibson was a successful chef with a popular restaurant and a beautiful loving wife. He was also a drug addict with a habit that nearly destroyed him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of rehab, he's now using his skills to feed his fellow halfway house residents budget gourmet meals--a talent that attracts two shady women who offer him a job cooking for a music superstar named Monster. Though Gibson doesn't have a good feeling about his seeming good fortune, he needs a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving on Monster's compound, Gibson senses that trouble is still on his tail. First, he's asked to sign a confidentiality agreement. Then he meets the compound's gardener, who warns him not to go outside at night--and tells him that to stay alive he must see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is advice that proves all too true when Gibson discovers a dead body near his bungalow a few nights later. Suddenly, all hell is breaking loose . . . and Gibson is at the center. Now he has to figure out how to escape this terrifying nightmare . . . and whether he can.</description>

  <description>In middle school, nothing is more important than friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Truly is invited to sit at the Popular Table with the group she has dreamed of joining, she can hardly believe her luck. Everyone seems so nice, so kind to one another. But all is not as it seems with her new friends, and soon she's caught in a maelstrom of lies, misunderstandings, accusations and counter-accusations, all happening very publicly in the relentless, hyperconnected social media world from which there is no escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six eighth-graders, four girls and two boys, struggle to understand and process their fractured glimples into one another's lives as they find new ways to disconnect, but also to connect, in Rachel Vail's richest and most searching book.</description>

  <description>When Cate Benson was a kid, her sister, Violet, died. Two hours after the funeral, Cate’s family picked up Violet’s replacement. Like nothing had happened. Because Cate’s parents are among those who decided to give their children a sort of immortality—by cloning them at birth—which means this new Violet has the same smile. The same perfect face. Thanks to advancements in mind-uploading technology, she even has all of the same memories as the girl she replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also might have murdered the most popular girl in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what the paparazzi and the anti-cloning protestors want everyone to think: that clones are violent, unpredictable monsters. Cate is used to hearing all that. She’s used to defending her sister, too. But Violet has vanished, and when Cate sets out to find her, she ends up in the line of fire instead. Because Cate is getting dangerously close to secrets that will rock the foundation of everything she thought was true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a thrilling debut, Stefanie Gaither takes readers on a nail-biting ride through a future that looks frighteningly similar to our own time and asks: how far are you willing to go to keep your family together?</description>

  <description>From acclaimed author Katie McGarry comes an explosive new tale of a romance forged in the fast lane &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl with straight A's and the perfect life—that's who people expect Rachel Young to be. So the private school junior keeps secrets from her wealthy family…and she's just added two more to the list. One involves racing strangers down dark country roads in her Mustang GT. The other? Seventeen-year-old Isaiah Walker—a guy she has no business even talking to. But after the foster kid with the tattoos and intense gray eyes comes to her rescue, she can't get him out of her mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Isaiah needs is to get tangled up with a rich girl who wants to slum it on the south side for kicks. But when their shared love of street racing puts their lives in jeopardy, Isaiah and Rachel will have six weeks to come up with a way out. Six weeks to discover just how far they'll go to save each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WELCOME TO THE PRESTIGIOUS&lt;/b&gt; Forge School of the Arts, where every waking moment of the students' lives is televised. For twelve hours a day, every class, conversation, and gesture is broadcast to millions of viewers. And for twelve hours each night, the students undergo an induced sleep, proven to maximize creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie Sinclair has staked all her dreams of becoming a filmmaker on succeeding at Forge. But when she skips her sleeping pill one night, she discovers an insidious world behind the cameras. As she navigates the Forge landscape of art and manipulation by day, Rosie finds it increasingly difficult to trust either her instincts or her mind. The only thing she knows for certain is that she must unearth the ghastly secret that the Forge School is hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author of the Birthmarked Trilogy comes a fast-paced, psychologically thrilling novel about what happens when the dreams you follow are no longer your own.</description>

  <description>It's the mid-1990s, and fifteen year-old Guernsey schoolgirls, Renée and Flo, are not really meant to be friends. Thoughtful, introspective and studious Flo couldn't be more different to ambitious, extroverted and sexually curious Renée. But Renée and Flo are united by loneliness and their dysfunctional families, and an intense bond is formed. Although there are obstacles to their friendship (namely Flo's jealous ex-best friend and Renée's growing infatuation with Flo's brother), fifteen is an age where anything can happen, where life stretches out before you, and when every betrayal feels like the end of the world. For Renée and Flo it is the time of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With graphic content and some scenes of a sexual nature, PAPER AEROPLANES is a gritty, poignant, often laugh-out-loud funny and powerful novel. It is an unforgettable snapshot of small-town adolescence and the heart-stopping power of female friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"The 1978 abductions of the South Korean actress Choi-Eun-hee and her ex-husband, the director Shin Sang-ok, in Hong Kong is the true crime at the center of Paul Fischer's gripping and surprisingly timely new book." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;-The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before becoming the world's most notorious dictator, Kim Jong-Il ran North Korea's Ministry for Propaganda and its film studios. Conceiving every movie made, he acted as producer and screenwriter. Despite this control, he was underwhelmed by the available talent and took drastic steps, ordering the kidnapping of Choi Eun-Hee (Madam Choi)-South Korea's most famous actress-and her ex-husband Shin Sang-Ok, the country's most famous filmmaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madam Choi vanished first. When Shin went to Hong Kong to investigate, he was attacked and woke up wrapped in plastic sheeting aboard a ship bound for North Korea. Madam Choi lived in isolated luxury, allowed only to attend the Dear Leader's dinner parties. Shin, meanwhile, tried to escape, was sent to prison camp, and "re-educated." After four years he cracked, pledging loyalty. Reunited with Choi at the first party he attends, it is announced that the couple will remarry and act as the Dear Leader's film advisors. Together they made seven films, in the process gaining Kim Jong-Il's trust. While pretending to research a film in Vienna, they flee to the U.S. embassy and are swept to safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nonfiction thriller packed with tension, passion, and politics, author Paul Fischer's &lt;i&gt;A Kim Jong-Il Production&lt;/i&gt; offers a rare glimpse into a secretive world, illuminating a fascinating chapter of North Korea's history that helps explain how it became the hermetically sealed, intensely stage-managed country it remains today.</description>

  <description>In 1949, a newly minted branch of the CIA (the precursor of today’s National Clandestine Service), flush with money and burning with determination to roll back the Iron Curtain, embarked on the first paramilitary operation in the history of the agency. They hatched an elaborate plan, coordinated with the British Secret Intelligence Service, to foment popular rebellion and detach Albania, the weakest of the Soviet satellites in Europe, from Moscow’s orbit. The operation resulted in dismal failure and was shut down by 1954.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Operation Valuable Fiend&lt;/i&gt;, Albert Lulushi gives the first full accounting of this CIA action, based on hundreds of declassified documents, memoirs, and recollections of key participants, including Albanian exiles recruited for missions and their Communist opponents. Up till now, the story of the operation has been obfuscated and even distorted. Some blamed the Soviet mole Kim Philby for sabotaging it; the communists credited the prowess of their secret police; and CIA memoirs were heavily sanitized. Lulushi documents a range of factors that led to the failure, from inexperienced CIA case officers outsmarted in spy-vs-spy games by their ruthless Stalinist opponents; to rivalries between branches of the CIA and between the agency and friendly intelligence services; and conflicts among anti-Communist factions that included Albania’s colorful exiled leader, King Zog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book also shows how this operation served as the proving ground for techniques used in later CIA Cold War paramilitary actions—involving some of the same agency operatives—including the coup d’états in Iran and Guatemala and the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</description>

  <description>Webster is a bundle of nerves headed into his first day of high school, but whatever academic and social horrors he feared are nothing compared to what's in store for him as he stumbles into an unsanctioned, street-level spelling bee! And this ain't no staged production, either - letters fly like jump kicks and the losers leave bruised and beaten more often than not! Soon he's propelled into the fast-paced world of competitive spelling by the mysterious Outlaw King and his cohort the Black Queen. Does Webster have what it takes to get the spelling world buzzing? Find out in this word-based battle royale from web-sensations Ananth Panagariya (Johnny Wander) and Tessa Stone (Hanna is Not a Boy's Name)!</description>

  <description>Socrates in Love took the Japanese publishing industry by storm, becoming the all-time best selling novel in Japan! Finally, U.S. readers will be able to experience the phenomenon that became the inspiration for a blockbuster movie, a hit TV show, and a popular manga. A national sensation that touched over three million readers, Kyoichi Katayama brought innocent love and romance to the forefront of Japan's ultra-hip mass market. Affectionately known as "Sekachu" in Japan, Katayama's novel depects a sweet high school romance between an average guy and a popular girl. But tragedy ensues when the girl falls ill with leukemia. A bittersweet tale of young love, enduring devotion, and heartbreaking loss, socrates in Love is a story to cherish and nurture.</description>

  <description>The hilarious and inspiring story of how a mysterious misfit got past every roadblock in the Hollywood system to achieve success on his own terms: a $6 million cinematic catastrophe called The Room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nineteen-year-old Greg Sestero met Tommy Wiseau at an acting school in San Francisco. Wiseau’s scenes were rivetingly wrong, yet Sestero, hypnotized by such uninhibited acting, thought, “I have to do a scene with this guy.” That impulse changed both of their lives. Wiseau seemed never to have read the rule book on interpersonal relationships (or the instruc­tions on a bottle of black hair dye), yet he generously offered to put the aspiring actor up in his LA apart­ment. Sestero’s nascent acting career first sizzled, then fizzled, resulting in Wiseau’s last-second offer to Sestero of costarring with him in The Room, a movie Wiseau wrote and planned to finance, produce, and direct—in the parking lot of a Hollywood equipment-rental shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiseau spent $6 million of his own money on his film, but despite the efforts of the disbelieving (and frequently fired) crew and embarrassed (and fre­quently fired) actors, the movie made no sense. Nevertheless Wiseau rented a Hollywood billboard featuring his alarming headshot and staged a red carpet premiere. The Room made $1800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. One reviewer said that watching The Room was like “getting stabbed in the head.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Disaster Artist is Greg Sestero’s laugh-out-loud funny account of how Tommy Wiseau defied every law of artistry, business, and friendship to make “the Citizen Kane of bad movies” (Entertainment Weekly), which is now an international phenomenon, with Wiseau himself beloved as an oddball celebrity. Written with award-winning journalist Tom Bissell, The Disaster Artist is an inspiring tour de force that reads like a page-turning novel, an open-hearted portrait of an enigmatic man who will improbably capture your heart.</description>

  <description>Blind Date is a spectacular &amp;amp; erotically charged psychological novel that shows Jerzy Kosinski, author of Being There &amp;amp; The Painted Bird, at the height of his power. George Levanter is an idea man, a small investor, an international playboy &amp;amp; a ruthless deal-maker whose life is delivered in a series of scorching encounters, each more incredible than the last. From Moscow to Paris, from a Manhattan skyscraper to a California mass murder, Blind Date is a dizzying vision of life among the beautiful people &amp;amp; the thrill-seekers.</description>

  <description>Take an administrative snafu, a bad breakup, and what shall heretofore be known as "The Hot-Tub Incident," and you’ve got two unprepared sophomores on a semester abroad. For American party girl Tasha, an escape to Oxford may be a chance to ditch her fame as a tabloid temptress, but wading Uggs-deep in feminist theory is not her idea of a break. Meanwhile, the British half of the exchange, studious Emily, nurses an aching heart amid the bikinis and beer pong of U.C. Santa Barbara. Soon desperation has the girls texting each other tips — on fitting in, finding love, and figuring out who they really are. With an anthropologist’s eye for detail and a true ear for teen-speak, exciting new novelist Abby McDonald has crafted a funny, fast-paced, poignant look at survival, sisterhood, and the surprising ways we discover our true selves.</description>

  <description>This book is about identifying the choices available when creating, fixing, steering, and discovering plots and then learning what narrative problems they are apt to create and how to choose an effective strategy for solving them. The result? Strong, solid stories and novels that move.</description>

  <description>Amy and Elder have finally left the oppressive walls of the spaceship&lt;i&gt; Godspeed&lt;/i&gt; behind. They're ready to start life afresh--to build a home--on Centauri-Earth, the planet that Amy has traveled 25 trillion miles across the universe to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But this new Earth isn't the paradise Amy had been hoping for. There are giant pterodactyl-like birds, purple flowers with mind-numbing toxins, and mysterious, unexplained ruins that hold more secrets than their stone walls first let on. The biggest secret of all? &lt;i&gt;Godspeed&lt;/i&gt;'s former passengers aren't alone on this planet. And if they're going to stay, they'll have to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Amy and Elder must race to discover who--or what--else is out there if they are to have any hope of saving their struggling colony and building a future together. They will have to look inward to the very core of what makes them human on this, their most harrowing journey yet. Because if the colony collapses? Then everything they have sacrificed--friends, family, life on Earth--will have been for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; FUELED BY LIES.&lt;br /&gt; RULED BY CHAOS.&lt;br /&gt; ALMOST HOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The post-war period in Japan was one of immense social change as Japanese society adjusted to the shock of defeat and to the occupation of Japan by American forces and their allies. Osamu Dazai’s The Setting Sun takes this milieu as its background to tell the story of the decline of a minor aristocratic family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told through the eyes of Kazuko, the unmarried daughter of a widowed aristocrat. Her search for self meaning in a society devoid of use for her forms the crux of Dazai’s novel. It is a sad story, and structurally is a novel very much within the confines of the Japanese take on the novel in a way reminiscent of authors such as Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata – the social interactions are peripheral and understated, nuances must be drawn, and for readers more used to Western novelistic forms this comes across as being rather wishy-washy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kazuko’s mother falls ill, and due to their financial circumstances they are forced to take a cottage in the countryside. Her brother, who became addicted to opium during the war is missing. When he returns, Kazuko attempts to form a liaison with the novelist Uehara. This romantic displacement only furthers to deepen her alienation from society.</description>

  <description>New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., have been abandoned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bill of Rights has been revoked, and replaced with the Moral Statutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no more police—instead, there are soldiers. There are no more fines for bad behavior—instead, there are arrests, trials, and maybe worse. People who get arrested usually don't come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ember Miller is old enough to remember that things weren't always this way. Living with her rebellious single mother, it's hard for her to forget that people weren't always arrested for reading the wrong books or staying out after dark. It's hard to forget that life in the United States used to be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ember has perfected the art of keeping a low profile. She knows how to get the things she needs, like food stamps and hand-me-down clothes, and how to pass the random home inspections by the military. Her life is as close to peaceful as circumstances allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until her mother is arrested for noncompliance with Article 5 of the Moral Statutes. And one of the arresting officers is none other than Chase Jennings—the only boy Ember has ever loved.</description>

  <description>R to L (Japanese Style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In company-owned rabbit-hutch apartments live tenants who can't afford to live anywhere else, and the apartment complex in which high-school girl Hatsumi Narita lives is ruled over by the rumor mongering, self-righteous Mrs. Tachibana. Get on Tachibana's bad side, and life becomes hell. When Hatsumi has to buy a pregnancy test because her popular sister Akane is late, Mrs. Tachibana's son, Ryoki, who used to bully Hatsumi as a kid, promises not to tell the world about Hatsumi's secret, only if she becomes his slave. Suddenly Azusa, Hatsumi's protector in their youth, reappears to save her again! He's moving back into the neighborhood! Despite the budding romance between Hatsumi and Azusa, Ryoki has control over her through the secret that could ruin the lives of everyone in Hatsumi's family, and he hasn't forgotten who his slave is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hatsumi is a sensible and mild-mannered young girl, but she suddenly finds herself in a swirl of drama that threatens to drive her totally crazy. Her younger sister is a shameless flirt and might be pregnant. [Oh no!] An old friend is back in town and is now a famous (and hot) fashion model.[Swoon...]Her neighbor is a bully and is blackmailing her to be his love slave. [Hate him!!]And this is just the beginning! Miki Aihara turned the manga world upside down with her salacious, outrageous, and funny hit series. If you think being a teenager in America is hard, wait until you read Hot Gimmick. These Tokyo boys and girls are really messed up!</description>

  <description>After months of squatting in the Literature Club's clubroom, the SOS Brigade puts pen to paper and starts writing some literature of their own! The Brigade has just one week to create a literature newsletter if they want to keep the Lit Club's space from being reallocated by the student council. As each member prepares his or her contribution, Supreme Editor in Chief Haruhi keeps a watchful eye on her team, especially as Kyon's assigned romance story unfolds!</description>

  <description>Brigham Young was a rough-hewn craftsman from New York whose impoverished and obscure life was electrified by the Mormon faith. He trudged around the United States and England to gain converts for Mormonism, spoke in spiritual tongues, married more than fifty women, and eventually transformed a barren desert into his vision of the Kingdom of God. While previous accounts of his life have been distorted by hagiography or polemical expose, John Turner provides a fully realized portrait of a colossal figure in American religion, politics, and westward expansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 1844 murder of Mormon founder Joseph Smith, Young gathered those Latter-day Saints who would follow him and led them over the Rocky Mountains. In Utah, he styled himself after the patriarchs, judges, and prophets of ancient Israel. As charismatic as he was autocratic, he was viewed by his followers as an indispensable protector and by his opponents as a theocratic, treasonous heretic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under his fiery tutelage, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints defended plural marriage, restricted the place of African Americans within the church, fought the U.S. Army in 1857, and obstructed federal efforts to prosecute perpetrators of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. At the same time, Young's tenacity and faith brought tens of thousands of Mormons to the American West, imbued their everyday lives with sacred purpose, and sustained his church against adversity. Turner reveals the complexity of this spiritual prophet, whose commitment made a deep imprint on his church and the American Mountain West.</description>

  <description>By exploring the relationship between the writer and love, grief, place, family, race and violence, John Rember helps you see how to go deep in your writing. He also tells you what you'll find there and how to get back. Along the way, you'll learn how to see the world as a writer sees it.&lt;p&gt;“A big part of writing involves grappling with the terrors and discouragements that come when you have writing skills but can’t project yourself or your work into the future,” says Rember. “My hope is that MFA in a Box will help writers balance the despair of writing with the joy of writing. It’s a book designed to help you to find the courage to put truth into words and to understand that writing is a life-and-death endeavor — but that nothing about a life-and-death endeavor keeps it from being laugh-out-loud funny.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REVIEWS/COMMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The essential truths about excellent writing are brought under consideration partly through the use of familiar fables and fairy tales. Another part is illustrated by the author’s own life experiences. Rember cleverly makes the reader dig into her own unconscious wisdom to recognize the true jewel at the center of a story. This book is not filled with rules and dogma to guide the writing process. Instead, an understanding of our relationship to our place on earth, acknowledging that our civilization is built on violence, and 'how the big moments in life require a witness,' impel us to infuse our stories with truth." — The Judges of the Hoffer Awards (&lt;i&gt;MFA in a Box&lt;/i&gt; was named to the Hoffer Award Grand Prize Short List in May 2011)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What makes [this book] different than the many, many books about writing on the market today is the way Rember engages his readers in some of the issues every writer faces — writing about place, about family, about grief — not as problems to be overcome but as issues to be understood.” — Jeff Baker, Book Editor, The (Portland) Oregonian &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Witty, audacious, and wise, John Rember’s MFA in a Box is a unique and valuable book that addresses the subject—and the life experience—of Creative Writing from both a practical perspective and in a manner so highly personable you’ll read it like a memoir—and want to meet the author. Rember has the storyteller’s magic. You’ll be enthralled. And walk away a more astute and vibrant writer.” — Robin Metz, author of Unbidden Angel, winner of the Rainer Maria Rilke International Poetry Award, and Director of the Program in Creative Writing at Knox College&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I started reading the book on the plane to a convention. Every chapter is an essay, one of those rich interconnected thought-weavings that we got to listen to as Pacific [University] students, with the addition of a top ten list at the end of each — valuable for focus and review, but also often funny. I found, reading on the plane, that when I was done with the first essay, I didn’t want to read the second. I wanted to write. So I dug out my carry-on and switched activities. On the plane ride home? Same thing. One essay, and then writing. Obviously, this is a rare writing book. I have read quite a few, and I don’t remember any of them making me want to write that moment like this does. The cover says it’s ‘a Why to Write Book,’ and the evidence says it’s convincing.” — Author Felicity Shoulders &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If you are ready to plunge into the depths of your writer’s soul and uncover the secrets that you might be holding back, then MFA in a Box could change the whole way you think about the process of writing.” — Sharon Harrigan, Author, Poet, Journalist, Walking on the Highway, Dec. 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“John Rember’s MFA in a Box is the best book on writing I’ve read since Stephen King’s On Writing. It should be on every writer’s bookshelf.” — Randy Richardson, author of &lt;i&gt;Lost in the Ivy&lt;/i&gt;, President of the Chicago Writers Association&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“MFA in a Box by John Rember is possibly the best book I’ve read about writing and living the creative life in general, and I have a personal library full of such books. I wish I had read this 30 years ago while I was at [college] hoping to be a writer some day.” — Gretchen Little, ”A Book Review and More,” Squidoo, October 2010 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There is such a wealth of life in each essay…deep, authentic stuff about relationships, politics, religion, mythology, and everything is discussed with such perfect humor. I love the Rules for Writers at the end of the chapters…great stuff…really useful as well as entertaining. This book should be mandatory for any writing course, undergrad or graduate. This is so much more than a craft book…this is an inspiration. It makes me want to write, helps me find the courage to do so, and allows me see the purpose in the hard work of it.” — Author Rebecca Elgin&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"London Times" journalist John Follain presents the most comprehensive account of the most publicized and controversial trial in a decade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after 12:30pm on November 2, 2007, Italian police were called to the Perugia home of twenty-one-year-old British student Meredith Kercher. They found her body on the floor under a beige quilt. Her throat had been cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four days later, the prosecutor jailed Meredith's roommate, American student Amanda Knox, and Raffaele Sollecito, her Italian boyfriend. He also jailed Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast drifter. Four years later Knox and Sollecito were acquitted amid chaotic scenes in front of the world's media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uniquely based on four years of reporting and access to the complete case files, and hundreds of first hand interviews, "Death in Italy" takes readers on a riveting journey behind the scenes of the investigation, as John Follain shares the drama of the trials and appeal hearings he lived through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including exclusive interviews with Meredith's friends and other key sources, "Death in Italy" reveals how the Italian dream turned into a nightmare.</description>

  <description>In this cogent volume, renowned Christian historian Martin Marty delivers a brief yet sweeping account of Christianity and how it spread from a few believers two thousand years ago to become the world’s largest religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comprising nearly one third of the world’s population–more than two billion followers–Christianity is distinctive among major faiths in that it derives both its character and its authority from the divinity of its central figure, Jesus Christ. Examining this facet of Christianity from historical and sociological viewpoints, Marty lays bare the roots of this faith, in turn chronicling its success throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing with great style, and providing impeccable interpretations of historical, canonical, and liturgical documents, Marty gives readers of all faiths and levels of familiarity with Christian practices and history a highly useful and supremely accessible primer. He depicts the life of Christ and his teachings and explains how the apostles set out to spread the Gospel. With a special emphasis on global Christianity, he shows how the religion emerged from its ancestral homelands in Africa, the Levant, and Asia Minor, was imported to Europe, and then spread from there to the rest of the world, most often via trade and conquest. While giving a broad overview, Marty also focuses on specific issues, such as how Christianity struggles with the polar tensions inherent to many of the faith’s denominations, and how it attempts to reconcile some of its stances on armed conflict, justice, and dominion with the teachings of Christ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Christian World &lt;/i&gt;is a chronicle of one of the great belief systems and its many followers. It’s a magnificent story of emperors and kings, war and geography, theology and politics, saints and sinners, and the earthly battle to save souls. Above all, it’s a remarkable testament to the teachings of Christ and how his message spreads around the globe to touch human experience everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Your mother hollers that you're going to miss the bus. She can see it coming down the street. You don't stop and hug her and tell her you love her. You don't thank her for being a good, kind, patient mother. Of course not-you launch yourself down the stairs and make a run for the corner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Only, if it's the last time you'll ever see your mother, you sort of start to wish you'd stopped and did those things. Maybe even missed the bus.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;But the bus was barreling down our street, so I ran.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Fourteen kids. One superstore. A million things that go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Laybourne’s debut ably turns what could have been yet another post apocalyptic YA novel into a tense, claustrophobic, and fast-paced thriller.” (Publishers Weekly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dean raced out the door to catch the school bus, he didn’t realize it would be the last time he’d ever see his mom. After a freak hailstorm sends the bus crashing into a superstore, Dean and a group of students of all ages are left to fend for themselves. &lt;br /&gt;They soon realize the hailstorm and the crash are the least of their worries. After seeing a series of environmental and chemical disasters ravage the outside world, they realize they’re trapped inside the store. &lt;br /&gt;Unable to communicate with the ones they love, the group attempts to cobble together a new existence. As they struggle to survive, Dean and the others must decide which risk is greater: leaving… or staying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monument 14 is a post-apocalyptic YA novel that transcends age barriers. If you like heart-stopping suspense, realistic characters, and new takes on survival novels, then you’ll love the first book in Emmy Laybourne’s Monument 14 series.</description>

  <description>Laurie Sandell grew up in awe (and sometimes in terror) of her larger-than-life father, who told jaw-dropping tales of a privileged childhood in Buenos Aires, academic triumphs, heroism during Vietnam, friendships with Kissinger and the Pope. As a young woman, Laurie unconsciously mirrors her dad, trying on several outsized personalities (Tokyo stripper, lesbian seductress, Ambien addict). Later, she lucks into the perfect job--interviewing celebrities for a top women's magazine. Growing up with her extraordinary father has given Laurie a knack for relating to the stars. But while researching an article on her dad's life, she makes an astonishing discovery: he's not the man he says he is--not even close. Now, Laurie begins to puzzle together three decades of lies and the splintered person that resulted from them--herself.</description>

  <description>Late in 1959, the Brown siblings—Maxine, Bonnie, and Jim Ed—were enjoying unprecedented international success, rivaled only by their longtime friend Elvis Presley. They had a bona fide megahit on their hands, which topped both the country and pop charts and gave rise to the polished sound of the multibillion dollar country music industry we know today. Mesmerized by the Browns’ haunting harmonies, the Beatles even tried to learn their secret. Their unique harmony, however, was only achievable through shared blood, and the trio’s perfect pitch was honed by a childhood spent listening for the elusive pulse and tone of an impeccably tempered blade at their parent’s Arkansas sawmill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Browns’ celebrity couldn’t survive the world changing around them, and the bonds of family began to fray along with the fame. Heartbreakingly, the novel jumps between the Browns’ promising past and the present, which finds Maxine—once supremely confident and ravenous in her pursuit of applause—ailing and alone. As her world increasingly narrows, her hunger for just one more chance to secure her legacy only grows, as does her need for human connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyrical and nuanced, &lt;i&gt;Nashville Chrome&lt;/i&gt; hits all the right grace notes with its vivid evocation of an era in American music, while at its heart it is a wrenching meditation on the complexities of fame and of one family—forgotten yet utterly unforgettable when reclaimed by Bass—who experienced them firsthand.</description>

  <description>Within this collection of miniature stories, entire worlds take shape—some like our own, some hallucinatory fairylands--populated by heartsick cowboys, random criminals, lovers and drifters. In a dazzling narrative constellation, Beach’s characters contend with the strange and terrible and beautiful in life, and no outcome is certain. Begun as a series of Facebook status updates, &lt;i&gt;420 Characters&lt;/i&gt; marks a new turn in an acclaimed artist and illustrator’s career, and features original collages by the author.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In December 2008, the world watched as master financier Bernard L. Madoff was taken away from his posh Manhattan apartment in handcuffs, accused of swindling thousands of innocent victims-including friends and family-out of billions of dollars in the world's largest Ponzi scheme. Madoff went to jail; he will spend the rest of his life there. But what happened to his devoted wife and sons? The people closest to him, the public reasoned, &lt;i&gt;must &lt;/i&gt;have known the truth behind his astounding success. Had they been tricked, too? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With unprecedented access to the surviving family members-wife Ruth, son Andrew and his fiancée Catherine Hooper-journalist Laurie Sandell reveals the personal details behind the headlines. How did Andrew and Mark, the sons who'd spent their lives believing in and building their own families around their father's business first learn of the massive deception? How does a wife, who adored her husband since they were teenagers, begin to understand the ramifications of his actions? The Madoffs &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; a tight-knit-even claustrophobic-clan, sticking together through marriages, divorces, and illnesses. But the pressures of enduring the massive scandal push them to their breaking points, most of all son Mark, whose suicide is one of the many tragedies that grew in the wake of the scandal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muzzled by lawyers, vilified by the media and roundly condemned by the public, the Madoffs have chosen to keep their silence-until now. Ultimately, theirs is one of the most riveting stories of our time: a modern-day Greek tragedy about money, power, lies, family, truth and consequences.</description>

  <description>The Yacoubian Building holds all that Egypt was and has become over the 75 years since its namesake was built on one of downtown Cairo's main boulevards. From the pious son of the building's doorkeeper and the raucous, impoverished squatters on its roof, via the tattered aristocrat and the gay intellectual in its apartments, to the ruthless businessman whose stores occupy its ground floor, each sharply etched character embodies a facet of modern Egypt -- where political corruption, ill-gotten wealth, and religious hypocrisy are natural allies, where the arrogance and defensiveness of the powerful find expression in the exploitation of the weak, where youthful idealism can turn quickly to extremism, and where an older, less violent vision of society may yet prevail. Alaa Al Aswany's novel caused an unprecedented stir when it was first published in 2002 and has remained the world's best selling novel in the Arabic language since.</description>

  <description>Eli and his family have lived in the underground Compound for six years. The world they knew is gone, and they've become accustomed to their new life. Accustomed, but not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Eli, no amount of luxury can stifle the dull routine of living in the same place, with only his two sisters, his father and mother, doing the same thing day after day after day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As problems with their carefully planned existence threaten to destroy their sanctuary—and their sanity—Eli can't help but wonder if he'd rather take his chances outside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eli's father built the Compound to keep them safe. But are they safe—or sorry?</description>

  <description>One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.</description>

      <![CDATA[This story flows better than the first book, with fewer fits and starts, but it still seems to lack some emotional depth to its characters. The main protagonist, who is also our storyteller, in particular doesn't make me feel much of anything for her. I wish I knew why, exactly, since she is supp...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;My sympathy fades as Chardonnay twists around to spread her lips in a demented grin. Her long yellow teeth probably haven't seen a toothbrush in months. I take a chance and smile back, and what do I get? A pudgy middle finger jabbed under my nose.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My next thought is&lt;/i&gt;: Wow. I may not even survive homeroom.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One hour into her first day of tenth grade, Martha Kowalski knows she's really in trouble. The school bully, Chardonnay, has already threatened her life--and at home, things are even worse. Martha's mom, fresh out of rehab, is shacking up with an obnoxious jerk in a neighborhood that can only be described as a "ghetto."&lt;br /&gt;More than anything she's ever wanted, Martha wants to play the cello. But even music becomes dangerous to her health--because nothing is what it seems in this place. With  her mother's willpower dissolving,  Martha watches helplessly as her own dreams slip further away.&lt;br /&gt;But in an exhilarating twist that would stun even Cinderella, everything changes. A wealthy lawyer invites her into his family's home and Martha is given a chance to start over. The warm, caring Brinkmans treat Martha like one of the family and even though it feels so right, she knows they &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; be as perfect as they seem. And she knows that this fairy tale can't last forever…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An unforgettable debut, &lt;i&gt;Before, After and Somebody in Between&lt;/i&gt; is smart, poignant, and very real.&lt;/div&gt;

In this case it tackles the children of addicts, class and race relations, drug violence, the frayed social safety net, and jus...]]>

  <description>Since the 1930s, the Nation of Islam has been one of the foremost all-black organizations in the United States. Yet for most people outside the movement, it has been known only through media portrayals of the controversial leaders such as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan. As a young girl, Sonsyrea Tate was one of tens of thousands of "Little X's, " the children raised within the Nation of Islam as future foot soldiers of black unity. In "Little X, " Tate, an award winning journalist, shows us the Nation of Islam from the inside: "Little X" is the compelling account of one woman's cultural identiy, family unity and spiritual fulfillment in a predominantly white and Christian America.</description>

  <description>Who was Cinna? What do the hawthorn and primrose symbolize? Or President Snow's roses and Peeta's bread? What about Katniss's last name? Bringing details from myths, herbal guides, military histories, and the classics, English professor and award-winning pop culture author Valerie Estelle Frankel sheds light on the deeper meanings behind Panem's heroes and villains in this hottest of YA trilogies. In her series, Collins not only weaves a heroic tale of deep complexity but harnesses the power of Shakespeare and Rome to retell an ancient epic of betrayal, violence, and glory on the stage of an apocalyptic future. The perfect treat for fans of all ages. Everything Hunger Games, packed into one volume. From Alma Coin to Wiress you'll learn about - Why roses are a flower of death - How eighteen of the characters are used in Shakespeare's plays - Katniss's nickname Catnip - The meaning of "The Hanging Tree" - Peeta's pearl and Katniss's salvation - Effie the saint and Finnick the Irish hero</description>

  <description>Both deliciously funny and deeply insightful, THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN is a beguiling multi-layered memoir that has touched the hearts of readers all over the world. At the age of one, Imran Ahmad moved from Pakistan to London, growing up torn between his Islamic identity and his desire to embrace the West. Join Imran in his lifelong struggle against corruption and injustice, and as he grapples with some of Life's most profound questions. What does God do exactly? Do you automatically go to Hell for following the wrong religion? How do you persuade a beautiful woman to become your girlfriend (and would driving a Jaguar XJS help?) Can you maintain a James Bond persona without the vodka, cigarettes and women - even whilst your parents are trying to arrange your marriage? Imran's unimagined journey makes thoughtful, compelling, and downright delightful reading. With a unique style and unflinching honesty, THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN addresses serious issues in an extraordinarily light way, and will leave readers both thinking deeply and laughing out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.</description>

  <description>A tremendous first novel from an exciting young author recently chosen as one of the Telegraph’s ‘20 under 40’ best UK writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famous for its electric chaos, the city of Bombay also accommodates pockets of calm. In one such space works Mohan, a contemplative man who has spent his life observing people from his seat as a letter-writer outside the main post office. But Mohan's lack of engagement with the world has caused a thawing of his marriage. At this delicate moment Mohan – and his wife, Lakshmi – are joined at their home in Saraswati Park by their nephew, Ashish, a sexually uncertain 19-year-old who has to repeat his final year in college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel unfolds, the lives of each of the three characters are thrown into relief by the comical frustrations of family life: annoying relatives, unspoken yearnings and unheard grievances. When Lakshmi loses her only brother, she leaves Bombay for a relative's home to mourn not only the death of a sibling but also the vital force of her marriage. Ashish, meanwhile, embarks on an affair with a much richer boy in his college and, not long afterwards, succumbs to the overtures of his English tutor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mohan scribbles away in the margins of the sort of books he secretly hopes to write one day, he worries about whether his wife will return, what will become of Ashish, and if he himself will ever find his own voice to write from the margins about the centre of which he will never be a part.</description>

  <description>Jeanne Trantel's life was perfect-or so it seemed. She had it all: a loving husband who worked on Wall Street, two beautiful, healthy sons, and a dream home in the affluent Long Island community where she grew up, surrounded by friends and family. But then, with one phone call, the life she knew and loved came crashing down around her. "Your husband," the caller said, "is in custody for a series of bank robberies that have occurred all over Nassau County." Jeanne would soon discover that her husband, Stephen, was living a lie. He was no longer the Wall Street trader that Jeanne, his family, and his friends all thought him to be. Instead of heading to Wall Street each morning as he claimed, Stephen was robbing banks. In Disguised Blessings, Jeanne chronicles the human toll of this ripped-from-the-headlines true story. Consumed by anger and humiliation and faced with mounting debt and piles of unpaid bills, Jeanne entered what she describes as the "darkest time" in her life. But Jeanne's story is not a tragedy; it is a story of hope and redemption, of faith, love, and the power of forgiveness. With heart-wrenching candor, Jeanne describes how, with the generosity of friends and family and the unconditional love of her two boys, she was able to put the broken pieces of her life back together, in the end discovering that from tragedy can come Disguised Blessings.</description>

  <description>George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic nominee for President, offers a tragic family drama while confronting the choices of his own life in this story of a daughter's fatal fight with alcoholism. Told in direct prose, the tale is a harrowing one. Teresa Jane McGovern, the middle child of five, began drinking at age 13, was hospitalized for depression after her arrest for smoking pot at age 19, cleaned up for a while in her 30s, but then spiraled out of control until she froze to death in a parking lot after a drinking binge. Her father openly examines his role and the causes of his daughter's demise.</description>

  <description>The Dark Duke has stolen the kingdom of Belsden, and now no one is safe. He rules with an iron fist, conquering lands and oppressing people at will. But one thing haunts the Dark Duke: the thought of the baby king who got away. That baby’s name is Taylor James, and as he grows into a man and discovers his past, he finds himself leading a ragtag army against the Dark Duke’s powerful forces. But when the Dark Duke captures his family and his one true love, the beautiful Rosemarie, everything comes to a head. This is an adventure beyond all adventures. It is filled with hilarious moments, incredible action, and unforgettable characters. Sword fighting, monsters, brutes, epic battles, and even the world’s ugliest army can be found inside. It reads like a movie and will have you on the edge of your seat cheering.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How long do you hold on to hope? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danica Greene has always hated flying, so it was almost laughable that the boy of her dreams was a pilot. She married him anyway and together, she and Etsell settled into a life where love really did seem to conquer all. Danica is firmly rooted on the ground in Blackhawk, the small town in northern Iowa where they grew up, and the wide slashes of sky that stretch endlessly across the prairie seem more than enough for Etsell.  But when the opportunity to spend three weeks in Alaska helping a pilot friend presents itself, Etsell accepts and their idyllic world is turned upside down. It’s his dream, he reveals, and Danica knows that she can’t stand in the way. Ell is on his last flight before heading home when his plane mysteriously vanishes shortly after takeoff, leaving Danica in a free fall. Etsell is gone, but what exactly does gone &lt;i&gt;mean&lt;/i&gt;? Is she a widow? An abandoned wife? Or will Etsell find his way home to her? Danica is forced to search for the truth in her marriage and treks to Alaska to grapple with the unanswerable questions about her husband’s mysterious disappearance. But when she learns that Ell wasn’t flying alone and that a woman is missing, too, the bits and pieces of the careful life that she had constructed for them in Iowa take to the wind.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;A story of love and loss, and ultimately starting over, &lt;i&gt;Far From Here&lt;/i&gt; explores the dynamics of intimacy and the potentially devastating consequences of the little white lies we tell the ones we love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From Louis Sachar, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and winner of the Newbery Medal for HOLES, comes the young adult novel THE CARDTURNER, an exploration of the human condition.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How are we supposed to be partners? He can’t see the cards and I don’t know the rules!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The summer after junior year of high school looks bleak for Alton Richards. His girlfriend has dumped him to hook up with his best friend. He has no money and no job. His parents insist that he drive his great-uncle Lester to his bridge club four times a week and be his cardturner—whatever that means. Alton’s uncle is old, blind, very sick, and very rich.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Alton’s parents aren’t the only ones trying to worm their way into Lester Trapp’s good graces. They’re in competition with his longtime housekeeper, his alluring young nurse, and the crazy Castaneda family, who seem to have a mysterious influence over him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alton soon finds himself intrigued by his uncle, by the game of bridge, and especially by the pretty and shy Toni Castaneda. As the summer goes on, he struggles to figure out what it all means, and ultimately to figure out the meaning of his own life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through Alton’s wry observations, Louis Sachar explores the disparity between what you know and what you think you know. With his incomparable flair and inventiveness, he examines the elusive differences between perception and reality—and inspires readers to think and think again.</description>

  <description>Dani Shapiro, a young woman from a deeply religious home, became the girlfriend of a famous and flamboyant married attorney-her best friend's stepfather. The moment Lenny Klein entered her life, everything changed: she dropped out of college, began drinking, and neglected her friends and family. But then came a phone call-an accident on a snowy road had left her parents critically injured. Forced to reconsider her life, Shapiro learned to re-enter the world she had left. Telling of a life nearly ruined by the gift of beauty, and then saved through tragedy, Shapiro's memoir is a beautiful account of how a life gone terribly wrong can be rescued through tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Godspeed was once fueled by lies. Now it is ruled by chaos.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been three months since Amy was unplugged. The life she always knew is over. Everywhere she looks, she sees the walls of the spaceship &lt;i&gt;Godspeed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there may be hope: Elder has assumed leadership of the ship. He's finally free to act on his vision—no more Phydus, no more lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Elder learns shocking news about the ship, he and Amy race to discover the truth behind life on &lt;i&gt;Godspeed&lt;/i&gt;. They must work together to unlock a mystery that was set in motion hundreds of years earlier. Their success—or failure—will determine the fate of the 2,298 passengers aboard &lt;i&gt;Godspeed&lt;/i&gt;. But with each step, the journey becomes more perilous, the ship more chaotic, and the love between them more impossible to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Revis catapulted readers into the far reaches of space with her &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling debut, &lt;i&gt;Across the Universe&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;A Million Suns&lt;/i&gt;, Beth deepens the mystery with action, suspense, romance, and deep philosophical questions. And this time it all builds to one mind-bending conclusion: &lt;i&gt;They have to get off this ship.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In '62, Mimi Beardsley was a naive teen, a product of her class &amp;amp; time. She'd attended the same exclusive girls' school as Jackie Bouvier, now installed in the White House as the first lady. Which is also where Mimi found herself, as an 18-year-old intern. JFK's White House was a place for which she wasn't remotely prepared, dominated by the charismatic &amp;amp; sexually rapacious figure of the president. Within four days, they'd started a relationship.&lt;br /&gt; There are several extraordinary things about Mimi's story. One is that she'd evaded notice from any of the biographers of JFK &amp;amp; other chroniclers of the heady days &amp;amp; sexual shenanigans of Camelot. Only by chance did a reporter in 2006 follow up a mention of her name in a JFK book, &amp;amp; doorstep her--a married NY grandmother--to find out whether she was the Mimi Beardsely mentioned in a passing reference. This is all the more surprising given the length of the affair--18 months--&amp;amp; the fact that it was ended only by his death.&lt;br /&gt; Mimi Beardsley Alford has decided, after decades of silence &amp;amp; reflection, to tell her story. This is not just a memoir of a young woman of her generation &amp;amp; class coming of age in the 60s, &amp;amp; her relationship with JFK. She also examines the significance it had in her life &amp;amp; relationships since, why she chose to be silent for so long &amp;amp; why she feels this is the time to speak out.</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1920: a brutal place to homestead, and especially tough for recent arrivals Jack and Mabel. Childless, they are drifting apart - he breaking under the weight of the work of the farm; she crumbling from loneliness and despair. In a moment of levity during the season's first snowfall, they build a child out of snow. The next morning the snow child is gone - but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness. As Jack and Mabel struggle to understand this child who could have stepped from the pages of a fairy tale, they come to love her as their own daughter. But in this beautiful, violent place, things are rarely as they appear, and what they eventually learn about Faina will transform all of them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A polite race of telepathic killer aliens, a ten-second world conquest, and one teenage boy collide in this wry, gutsy adventure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesse is in history class when a formidable, efficient race of aliens quietly takes over the earth in less time than it takes him to brush his teeth. Most humans simply fall asleep and never wake up. In moments, everyone Jesse knows and loves is gone, and he finds that he is now a slave to an inept alien leader. On the bright side, Jesse discovers he’s developing telepathic powers, and he’s not the only one. Soon he’s forging new friendships and feeling unexpectedly hopeful. When a mysterious girl appears in his dreams, talking about escaping, Jesse begins to think the aliens may not be invincible after all. But if Jesse and his friends succeed, is there anywhere left to go? Brian Yansky offers a funny, grim novel packed with everything boys and sci-fi fans love: aliens, humor, action, and a healthy dose of triumph.</description>

      <![CDATA[The second half of this book, where the action is, read like a short story written for a sci fi magazine; as something disposable, hastily written, and pressed for space.

  <description>This edition of This Side of Paradise presents at last an accurate text based on Fitzgerald's original manuscript.The story of Amory Blaine's moral education and sexual awakening as he journeys from prep school to Princeton to adulthood, it brilliantly captures the rhythms of postwar America and the spirit of a generation dedicated to the pursuit of excitement, sophistication, and success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 1920, This Side of Paradise made Fitzgerald famous for the stylish exuberance of his writing -- and infamous for the spelling, grammar, and chronology errors that peppered his text. Meticulously restored with explanatory notes on topical and historical references and a detailed account of the novel's creative and textual history, this volume will be welcomed by long-time fans, as well as those discovering Fitzgerald's magical prose for the very first time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Last Tycoon,&lt;/i&gt; edited by the renowned literary critic Edmund Wilson, was first published a year after Fitzgerald's death and includes the author's notes and outline for his unfinished literary masterpiece. It is the story of the young Hollywood mogul Monroe Stahr, a character inspired by the life of boy-genius Irving Thalberg, and is an exposé of the studio system in its heyday.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A love out of time. A spaceship built of secrets and murder.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Amy joins her parents as frozen cargo aboard the vast spaceship Godspeed and expects to awaken on a new planet, three hundred years in the future. Never could she have known that her frozen slumber would come to an end fifty years too soon and that she would be thrust into the brave new world of a spaceship that lives by its own rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy quickly realizes that her awakening was no mere computer malfunction. Someone—one of the few thousand inhabitants of the spaceship —tried to kill her. And if Amy doesn't do something soon, her parents will be next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Amy must race to unlock Godspeed's hidden secrets. But out of her list of murder suspects, there's only one who matters: Elder, the future leader of the ship and the love she could never have seen coming.</description>

  <description>When the beautiful Chisako and her lover are found murdered in a park, members of a small Ontario suburb in the 1970s must finally acknowledge certain inescapable truths about one another and the way their community has been shaped by the dark shadow of World War II internment camps. With all the suspense of a psychological thriller, &lt;em&gt;The Electrical Field&lt;/em&gt; slowly exposes all those implicated in the murders -- particularly Miss Saito, the novel's unreliable narrator, through whom we gradually discover the truth. Like Kazuo Ishiguru in &lt;em&gt;A Pale View of Hills&lt;/em&gt;, Kerri Sakamoto invokes a Japanese sense of the relativity of memory and reliability of consciousness. Miss Saito, middle-aged, caring for her elderly, bed-ridden father and her distracted younger brother, on the surface seems to be a passive observer. But her own disturbed past and her craving for an emotional connection will prove to have profound consequences. A masterful and elegant story of passion, memory, and regret, &lt;em&gt;The Electrical Field&lt;/em&gt; reaches deep into the past and into Canada's communal response to war. A reading group guide is bound into this paperback edition.</description>

  <description>A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel presents with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Memoirs of a Geisha&lt;/i&gt;, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction—at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful—and completely unforgettable.</description>

  <description>GEISHA, A LIFE ""No woman in the three-hundred-year history of the karyukai has ever come forward in public to tell her story. We have been constrained by unwritten rules not to do so, by the robes of tradition and by the sanctity of our exclusive calling...But I feel it is time to speak out.""&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrated as the most successful geisha of her generation, Mineko Iwasaki was only five years old when she left her parents' home for the world of the geisha. For the next twenty-five years, she would live a life filled with extraordinary professional demands and rich rewards. She would learn the formal customs and language of the geisha, and study the ancient arts of Japanese dance and music. She would enchant kings and princes, captains of industry, and titans of the entertainment world, some of whom would become her dearest friends. Through great pride and determination, she would be hailed as one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, and one of the last great practitioners of this now fading art form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "Geisha, a Life," Mineko Iwasaki tells her story, from her warm early childhood, to her intense yet privileged upbringing in the Iwasaki okiya (household), to her years as a renowned geisha, and finally, to her decision at the age of twenty-nine to retire and marry, a move that would mirror the demise of geisha culture. Mineko brings to life the beauty and wonder of Gion Kobu, a place that "existed in a world apart, a special realm whose mission and identity depended on preserving the time-honored traditions of the past." She illustrates how it coexisted within post-World War II Japan at a time when the country was undergoing its radical transformation from apost-feudal society to a modern one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There is much mystery and misunderstanding about what it means to be a geisha. I hope this story will help explain what it is really like and also serve as a record of this unique component of Japan's cultural history," writes Mineko Iwasaki. "Geisha, a Life" is the first of its kind, as it delicately unfolds the fabric of a geisha's development. Told with great wisdom and sensitivity, it is a true story of beauty and heroism, and of a time and culture rarely revealed to the Western world.</description>

  <description>From critically acclaimed author and Japanese scholar Lesley Downer, an enchanting portrait of the mysterious world of the geisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Westerners arrived in Japan, they have been intrigued by Japanese womanhood and, above all, by geisha. This fascination has spawned a wealth of extraordinary fictional creations, from Puccini's &lt;b&gt;Madama Butterfly&lt;/b&gt; to Arthur Golden's &lt;b&gt;Memoirs of a Geisha&lt;/b&gt;. The reality of the geisha's existence, though, whether today or in history, has rarely been addressed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to popular opinion, geisha are not prostitutes but, literally, "arts people." Their accomplishments include singing, dancing, playing a musical instruments; but above all, they are masters of the art of conversation, soothing the worries and stroking the egos of the wealthy businessmen who can afford their attentions. It is this which imbues the geisha with such power—and which makes absolute secrecy such a crucial aspect of their work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As denizens of a world defined by silence and mystery, geisha are notoriously difficult to meet and even to find. Lesley Downer, an award- winning writer, Japanese scholar, and consummate storyteller, gained more access into this world than almost any other Westerner ever has and spent several months living among them. In &lt;b&gt;Women of the Pleasure Quarters&lt;/b&gt;, she weaves together intimate portraits of modern geisha with the romantic legends and colorful historical tales of geisha of the past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Sadda Yakko, who dined with American presidents and had her portrait painted by Picasso, to Koito, a modern-day geisha who maintains her own website, geisha throughout history step out of the pages of &lt;b&gt;Women of the Pleasure Quarters&lt;/b&gt; to become living, breathing creatures. Looking into such traditions as &lt;i&gt;mizuage&lt;/i&gt;, the ritual deflowering which was once a rite of passage for all geisha, and providing colorful depictions of the geisha's dress, training, and homes, Downer, with grace, elegance, and respect, transforms their reality in a captivating narrative that both informs and entertains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a symbol of a bygone age and an institution more quintessentially Japanese than any other, geisha are a society at a crossroads, struggling to reinvent their place in the new millennium while honoring the traditions of the past. Both instructive and evocative, &lt;b&gt;Women of the Pleasure Quarters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is an enthralling portrait of a world unlike any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The year 2002 marks the fiftieth anniversary of Elizabeth II's accession to the British throne. To celebrate this occasion, William Shawcross, an award-winning writer and journalist, has written an intimate and revealing portrait of the Queen and an absorbing narrative of how the faces of the monarchy, Britain, and the world have changed over the past fifty years. Britain today bears little resemblance to the country the Queen inherited in 1952. There is more criticism than deference; the institution of the monarchy is no longer accepted unquestioningly. Yet, as Shawcross describes here, Elizabeth's long and valiant, sometimes difficult, always challenging reign shows us a monarch who has risen admirably to the occasion and has held the country and the commonwealth together. Drawn from the BBC's landmark four-part television series, "Queen and Country" combines personal recollections, classic archive film, and contemporary footage, as it examines how the Queen has adapted and succeeded. Exploring several aspects of her public role -- including her relationships with successive prime ministers -- Shawcross shows how she has remained a fixed point in the storm, a reassuring bedrock of stability, calm, and good sense, who has earned the respect and affection of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than one hundred photographs, this volume focuses on four parts of the Queen's life. The first explores the central relationship between the Queen and her subjects. Her private life is the subject of the second part as Shawcross describes how she enjoys horse racing, her dogs, shooting, and family life. He also discusses the turbulence of her children's marriages and lives. Part III focuses on theQueen's political role as head of state and explores how close she is to the center of decision making. The final part follows Elizabeth II as she travels the globe and strengthens the ties of the commonwealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with the cooperation of the Queen's family, friends, and her trusted aides, this unique portrait accompanies the celebration of her golden jubilee that will be one of the most televised and written-about events of 2002. "Queen and Country" is the most authoritative account of Elizabeth's reign that will appear during this year-long celebration.</description>

  <description>At 11:15 on the morning of June 28, 1914, in an outpost of the Austro-Hungarian Empire called Sarajevo, the twentieth century could be said to have been born. The repercussions of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand - Emperor Franz Josef's nephew and heir apparent - by a Bosnian Serb are with us to this day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate aftermath of that act was war. Global in extent, it would last almost five years and leave five million civilian casualties and more than nine million military dead. On both the Allied and Central Powers sides, losses - missing, wounded, dead - were enormous. After the war, barely a town or village in Europe was without its monument to the dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war also left us with new technologies of death: tanks, planes, and submarines; reliable rapid-fire machine guns and artillery; motorized cavalry. It ushered in new tactics of warfare: shipping convoys and U-boat packs, dog fights and reconnaissance air support. And it bequeathed to us terrors we still cannot control: poison gas and chemical warfare, strategic bombing of civilian targets, massacres and atrocities against entire population groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most of all, it changed our world. In its wake, empires toppled, monarchies fell, whole political systems realigned. Instabilities became institutionalized, enmities enshrined. Revolution swept to power ideologies of the left and right. And the social order shifted seismically. Manners, mores, codes of behavior; literature and the arts; education and class distinctions: all underwent a vast sea change. In all these ways, the twentieth century could be said to have been born on the morning of June 28, 1914. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in a companion volume to his acclaimed The Second World War, Martin Gilbert weaves together all of these elements to create a stunning, dramatic, and informative narrative. The First World War is everything we have come to expect from the scholar the Times Literary Supplement placed "&lt;i&gt;in the first rank of contemporary historians&lt;/i&gt;."</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a narrative that tells the story of the war as a story--from start to finish, from the pre-war innocence through the decades of monument-laying afterwards; with every month in-between. The focus shifts from the military history of battles (and occasionally the politics behind them) to the...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A page-turning account of the international cocaine trade, presented as five lessons in how to move tons of the drug across borders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about cocaine concealed in false-bottomed suitcases or swallowed in ovules resistant to gastric juices. When entire national economies are kept afloat by the money from cocaine smuggling, the quantities these tactics represent are meaningless. When a commodity like cocaine becomes a mainstay of the international economy, grams and kilos are irrelevant. Because what is needed to sustain the market is cocaine by the ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tons of cocaine means ships, cargo planes, and containers: large, cumbersome, extremely tangible, and visible amounts of white powder. So how is all that merchandise moved through harbors and airports? How are customs offices deceived, fiscal checks eluded, police networks infiltrated, and documents prepared to disguise mountains of cocaine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s done with coca made into cubes, dissolved in liquid, hidden in marble blocks or inside electric cables. With friends in the right places. With cocaine smuggled in cranes. With sniffer dogs supplied to the police, free of charge. With money in cash, always. And yes, with willing mules swallowing drugs. But they will be arrested, and that’s part of the plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from years of research and conversations with criminal sources and convicted drug smugglers, with new information on the techniques, methods, and strategies used, Luca Rastello brings us a devastating portrait of the international cocaine trade. Told from the perspective of the formidable entrepreneurs whose tactics evolve and adapt to keep pace with shifts in the global economy, &lt;i&gt;I Am the Market &lt;/i&gt;is a masterful exposé of a world we thought we understood—until now.</description>

  <description>Cselekményleírást tartalmaz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oscar ​Wilde klasszikus regényének hőse, a gazdag, gyönyörű és naiv fiatalember, Dorian Gray megszállottja annak a gondolatnak, hogy örökké fiatal és szép maradjon, s ezért még akár a lelkét is eladná. Miután az egyik barátja megfesti portréját, a fiú csak azt fájlalja, hogy az ő szépségét az élet és az idő hamar lerombolja majd, míg a képe örök marad, s azt kívánja, hogy bárcsak ez fordítva lenne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fiatalember hamarosan cinikus barátja, Lord Henry Wotton befolyása alá kerül, aki ráébreszti az élet ízeire. Dorian átadja magát az önző és rafinált élvezeteknek, férfiakat és nőket taszít a bűn útjára, majd egyre mélyebbre süllyed, s a züllés minden nemét és formáját megtapasztalja. Az események egyre riasztóbb fordulatot vesznek, mivel nemsokára megtudja, hogy kívánsága teljesült. Legnagyobb csodálkozására ugyanis csak a róla készült kép öregszik. Arca és szeme őrzi az ártatlan ifjú szépségét, a festett arcmás viszont, amelyet gondosan elzárva tart háza egy titkos helyiségében, híven mutatja az idő és a bűn rombolását vonásain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ekkor úgy érzi, itt az ideje megváltoztatnia az életét. Hogy teljesen tisztára mossa magát, bűnös múltjának tanúját, a szörnyűséges képet meg akarja semmisíteni…</description>

  <description>Keith B. Richburg was an experienced and respected reporter who had paid his dues covering urban neighborhoods in Washington D.C., and won praise for his coverage of Southeast Asia. But nothing prepared him for the personal odyssey that he would embark upon when he was assigned to cover Africa.In this powerful book, Richburg takes the reader on an extraordinary journey that sweeps from Somalia to Rwanda to Zaire and finally to South Africa. He shows how he came to terms with the divide within himself: between his African racial heritage and his American cultural identity.Are these really my people? Am I truly an African-American? The answer, Richburg finds, after much soul-searching, is that no, he is not an African, but an American first and foremost. To those who romanticize Mother Africa as a black Valhalla, where blacks can walk with dignity and pride, he regrets that this is not the reality. He has been there and witnessed the killings, the repression, the false promises, and the horror. “Thank God my nameless ancestor, brought across the ocean in chains and leg irons, made it out alive,” he concludes. “Thank God I am an American.”</description>

This is one reporter's story of a still-unsolved murder of a young woman that occurred in Ohio in the late 1960's, written a few years after the fact.

  <description>This instant classic relives the most incredible hands by the greatest poker player of all time. Great players, legends and unforgettable events in the history of poker march in and out of fifty years of momentous hands. Sit side-by-side with Doyle as he replays the excitement and life-changing moments of the most exciting and crucial hands in the history of poker—his early games as a rounder in the rough-and-tumble "Wild West" years where a man was as likely to get shot as he was to get a straight flush, to the nail-biting excitement of his two world championship titles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doyle brings to life the high stakes tension of sidestepping police, hijackers and murderers, competes for hands worth more than a million dollars, and sweats out situations where his last dollar relies on the outcome of a card. Engrossing, captivating, riveting, and ultimately, educational, this is a momentous and thrilling collection of great stories and sage poker advice from the living legend himself.</description>

  <description>At the height of the roaring ’20s, Swedish émigré Ivar Kreuger made a fortune raising money in America and loaning it to Europe in exchange for matchstick monopolies. His enterprise was a rare success story throughout the Great Depression.Yet after Kreuger’s suicide in 1932, the true nature of his empire emerged. Driven by success to adopt ever-more perilous practices, Kreuger had turned to shell companies in tax havens, fudged accounting figures, off-balance-sheet accounting, even forgery. He created a raft of innovative financial products— many of them precursors to instruments wreaking havoc in today’s markets. When his Wall Street empire collapsed, millions went bankrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Partnoy, a frequent commentator on financial disaster for the&lt;i&gt; Financial Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, NPR, and CBS’s “60 Minutes,” recasts the life story of a remarkable yet forgotten genius in ways that force us to re-think our ideas about the wisdom of crowds, the invisible hand, and the free and unfettered market.</description>

  <description>Hadley was and is no Zelda. She was Ernest Hemingway's first wife and she existed chiefly by proxy -- contentedly submissive to both his tastes (whether skiing or bullfighting) and work which she placed above her own demands or those of their child (she had him when Ernest was off on a job). A shy girl, encouraged to enjoy ill health by her family, she turned out to have far more stamina than anyone suspected, following Ernest ""into the fullness of an extraordinarily vital world"" -- Paris (Pound, Stein, the Fitzgeralds, et al), back to Canada, and Paris again where she gave him up -- equally acceptantly -- to Pauline. The author has told her story from existing correspondence and some relatively recent interviews (the '70's) and it serves as a memento rather than a memoir.</description>

  <description>A compassionate, humorous story of faith, betrayal, and coming of age on the sawdust trail. Only three when her mother became tent revivalist David Terrell's organist, Donna was soon part of the hugely popular evangelist's inner circle. At seventeen, she left the ministry for good. Holy Ghost Girl brings to life miracles, exorcisms, and face-offs with the Ku Klux Klan--and that's just what went on under the tent. As Terrell's fame grew in the 1960s and '70s, the caravan of broken-down cars that made up his ministry evolved into fleets of Mercedes. The glories of the Word mixed with betrayals of the flesh, and Donna's mom bore Terrell's children in one of his secret households. Thousands of followers headed to cult-like communities to await the end of the world. Jesus didn't show, but the IRS did, and the prophet-healer went to prison. This memoir bypasses easy judgment to articulate a rich world in which the mystery of faith and human frailty share surprising and humorous coexistence.</description>

  <description>Despite all the headlines about Bernard Madoff, who pleaded guilty to running a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, he is still shrouded in mystery. Why (and when) did he turn his legitimate business into a massive fraud? How did he fool so many smart investors for so long? And who among his family and employees knew the truth?</description>

  <description>A bestseller in Britain, &lt;strong&gt;The Africa House&lt;/strong&gt; vividly details the life of an English officer and gentleman and his remarkable house and colony in deepest Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ides of the British Empire, Stewart Gore Browne built himself a feudal paradise in northern Rhodesia, a sprawling country estate modeled on the finest homes in England, complete with uniformed servants, daily muster parades, rose gardens and lavish dinners finished off with vintage port in the library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wanted to share it with the love of his life, the beautiful, unconventional Ethel Locke King, one of the first women to drive and to fly. She, however, was nearly twenty years his senior, married and his aunt. Lorna, the only other woman he had ever really cared for, had married another. Then he met Lorna's orphaned daughter, so like her mother that he thought he had seen a ghost. It seemed he had at last found love -- but the Africa House was his dream, and it would be a hard one to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina Lamb's updated account of this fascinating and complicated man -- a colonialist who beat his servants yet supported independence, a stiff Englishman with deep passions -- is a masterpiece of biography and storytelling. Set against the backdrop of sweeping change across Africa, this is a tale of fantasies made real, tragedy endured and lifelong love.</description>

  <description>In this classic, John le Carre's third novel and the first to earn him international acclaim, he created a world unlike any previously experienced in suspense fiction. With unsurpassed knowledge culled from his years in British Intelligence, le Carre brings to light the shadowy dealings of international espionage in the tale of a British agent who longs to end his career but undertakes one final, bone-chilling assignment. When the last agent under his command is killed and Alec Leamas is called back to London, he hopes to come in from the cold for good. His spymaster, Control, however, has other plans. Determined to bring down the head of East German Intelligence and topple his organization, Control once more sends Leamas into the fray -- this time to play the part of the dishonored spy and lure the enemy to his ultimate defeat.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Thea lives a strange and sheltered life with her mother, Nalia, retired opera singer and Holocaust survivor. A virtual prisoner of her mother's obsessive love, Thea escapes with a mysterious and suave friend of her father's and is taken to the remote island on which he lives. "The rule is this," she says. "I am to pretend that my other life does not exist. And yet, pretending, it seems to be true." What Thea discovers on the island is that the house in which she grew up-with its gates and padlocks and dogs-has been replaced by a prison of a different kind. "All my life," she says, "I have noticed keys. I like to know where they fit, how they work. 'What do you need your own keys for?' my mother would shout. 'When you're old enough for keys, you'll be old enough to understand a lot of things.'"</description>

  <description>In 1920, Agnes La Grange leaves a poor life in England for Durban, South Africa, to make her future. In the house of the Jewish family where she first works as a maid, the wife is dying--which doesn't keep the husband from sneaking to Agnes's room to make love while watching in a mirror he's given her. His unrestrained passion for her (old and a head shorter he may be) leads her to say, "I have never felt so strongly the power of being alive." And that's in truth the only power Agnes ever wants or values. During her pregnancy, the "old Jew," as she calls him bluntly but without judgment, puts her up in the Railway Hotel--an establishment of which, after the birth of her daughter Leah, she becomes owner and new proprietress by finessing the old man into putting up the money. From then on, Agnes is on her way. "The newspaperman" will be a weak and soon-divorced husband, followed by such lovers as Agnes finds attractive--"the banker," "the hunter," and "the trader." Agnes doesn't even read the papers, but her beauty, life, and business sense draw others to her, seeing her through the Depression and WWII as she's cheated but recovers, buys more property, sees Leah become a famous singer--although not before Leah does just what Agnes did in seducing a husband (readers will find out whose), leaving Agnes a gorgeous child to raise as a second daughter. Forget improprieties: As Agnes says, "this wasn't a story . . . this was a life."</description>

  <description>These fourteen short stories, written over the past ten years but never before collected, deal with the struggles between mothers and their wayward daughters, the often preposterous bonds that tie men and women together, and the complex games masters and servants play with one another. In spare, elegant prose, Freed delivers surprise after surprise as she shakes the truth from life. Whether it's her portrayal of a mother mired in senile dementia in "Ma," a young girl experiencing her first sexual encounter with an itinerant knife-sharpener in "Under the House," or a young woman incapable of loving conventionally in "An Error of Desire," Freed portrays the absurdity, the delusions, the dramas, and the dignity of her characters' lives. These masterful stories reinforce her reputation as one of our most fearless and sophisticated explorers of sexual and filial love.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>What had happened to my beautiful boy? To our family? What did I do wrong? Those are the wrenching questions that haunted every moment of David Sheff’s journey through his son Nic’s addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery. Before Nic Sheff became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy, joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Sheff traces the first subtle warning signs: the denial, the 3 A.M. phone calls (is it Nic? The police? The hospital?), the rehabs. His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself, and the obsessive worry and stress took a tremendous toll, but as a journalist, he instinctively researched every avenue of treatment that might save his son and refused to give up on him. &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Boy&lt;/i&gt; is a fiercely candid memoir that brings immediacy to the emotional roller coaster of loving a child who seems beyond help.</description>

  <description>After nearly twenty years of living in California, March Murray, along with her fifteen-year-old daughter, Gwen, returns to the sleepy Massachusetts town where she grew up to attend the funeral of Judith Dale, the beloved housekeeper who raised her. Yet returning to her hometown also brings her back to Hollis, March’s former soul mate and lover. March’s father had taken the teenaged Hollis, an abandoned child, and the product of a series of detention homes, into his house as a boarder, and treated him like a son. Yet March and Hollis’s passionate love was hardly a normal sibling relationship. When Hollis left her after a petty fight, March waited for him three long years, wondering what she had done wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Encountering Hollis again makes March acutely aware of the choices that she has made, and the choices everyone around her has made—including Mrs. Dale, who knew more of love than March could ever have suspected, and her brother Alan, whose tragic history has left him grief-struck, with alcohol as his only solace. Her attraction to Hollis is overwhelming—and March jeopardizes her marriage, her relationship with her daughter and her own happiness in an attempt to reclaim the past.</description>

  <description>In 1945, two and a half million people were forced out of Germany’s most easterly province, East Prussia, and in particular its capital, Königsberg. Their flight was a direct result of Hitler’s ill-fated decision to invade the Soviet Union in 1941. The horrors of Leningrad and Stalingrad were to be avenged by an army determined not only to invade Germany but to take over its eastern-frontier territories. The Russians launched Operation Bagration in June 1944, to coincide with the D-Day landings. As US and British forces pushed west the Russians liberated Eastern Europe and made their first attacks in the autumn of 1944. Königsberg itself was badly damaged by two British air raids at the end of August 1944, and the main offensive against the city by the Red Army began in January 1945. The depleted and poorly armed German army could do little to hold it back, and by the end of January East Prussia was cut off. The Russians exacted a terrible revenge on the civilian population, who were forced to flee across the freezing Baltic coast in an attempt to escape. On April 9, the city surrendered to the Russians after a four-day onslaught. Through first-hand accounts as well as archival material, Königsberg 1945: The Annihilation of Hitler's Fortress City tells the dramatic story of a place and its people that bore the brunt of Russia's vengeance against the Nazi regime. It is Isabel Denny's first book.</description>

  <description>Dr. Thompson made the list of inspirational scribes when I polled in a recent writing workshop, and why not? Back in a spiffy Modern Library edition, replete with additional essays, I find in this iconographic work that HST both invoked--and provoked--an era that was not so much the '60s proper, but rather the mean, shadow-filled death of that time, which is still playing out. Thank God Thompson was there to explode the myth of "objective" journalism and help pave the way for the pens and voices that followed.</description>

  <description>Most sports fans have heard the tragic story of the plane crash that killed all the members of the 1961 U.S. World Figure Skating Team, along with sixteen of their friends, family and coaches. Now, for the first time, &lt;i&gt;Frozen in Time&lt;/i&gt; takes readers inside the lives of the skaters, telling one of the most iconic stories in the history of American sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dramatic focus lingers on two families of powerful women. Maribel Owen—the most famous woman in figure skating at the time—who relentlessly drove her two young daughters, pairs champion Mara and the spectacular Laurence, who graced the cover of Sports Illustrated. Myra Westerfeld, meanwhile, lost her marriage while guiding her daughters Sherri and Steffi to the pinnacle of the sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Nikki Nichols also explores the crash’s aftermath, an unprecedented period in American athletics. The U.S. skating program had lost all of its stars and struggled to rebuild with very young competitors, such as Peggy Fleming. But, perhaps the most far-reaching effect was the creation of a memorial fund that would support skaters who would not otherwise be able to afford the sport—among them Scott Hamilton, Kristi Yamaguchi, and others.</description>

  <description>The second adventure in the Bartimaeus trilogy finds our young apprentice magician Nathaniel working his way up the ranks of the government, when crisis hits. A seemingly invulnerable clay golem is making random attacks on London. Nathaniel and the all-powerful, totally irreverent djinni, Bartimaeus, must travel to Prague to discover the source of the golem's power. &lt;br /&gt;In the ensuing chaos, readers will chase a dancing skeleton across London's skyline, encounter the horror of the dreaded Night Police, witness a daring kidnapping, and enter the Machiavellian world of the magician's government. Eventually, Nathaniel and Bartimaeus have to go head to head with the fearsome golem before the surprise identity of his master is finally revealed.</description>

  <description>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt;--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt;, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, &lt;i&gt;Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.&lt;p&gt; It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For nine years, John Dowell and his wife have spent the summer season at a German spa town in the company of the respectable Ashburnhams. Behind the placid exterior of their lives lie the destructive passions of men and women. When Dowell's world breaks apart, he tells his story as intimately as to a silent listener across the fireplace of a country cottage. 'Who in this world knows anything of any other heart -- or of his own?'.</description>

  <description>The war against Voldemort is not going well: even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of The Daily Prophet looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort - and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.</description>

He's never worn a cloak of invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that is about change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him...if Harry can survive the encounter.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Heavenly Intrigue&lt;/b&gt; is the fascinating, true account of the seventeenth-century collaboration between Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe that revolutionized our understanding of the universe–and ended in murder.One of history’s greatest geniuses, Kepler laid the foundations of modern physics with his revolutionary laws of planetary motion. But his beautiful mind was beset by demons. Born into poverty and abuse, half-blinded by smallpox, he festered with rage, resentment, and a longing for worldly fame. Brahe, his mentor, was a flamboyant aristocrat who had spent forty years mapping the heavens with unprecedented accuracy–but he refused to share his data with Kepler. With Brahe’s untimely death in Prague in 1601, rumors flew across Europe that he had been murdered. But it took twentieth-century forensics to uncover the poison in his remains, and the detective work of Joshua and Anne-Lee Gilder to identify the prime suspect–the ambitious, envy-ridden Kepler himself. A fast-paced, true-life account that reads like a thriller, &lt;b&gt;Heavenly Intrigue&lt;/b&gt; is a remarkable feat of historical re-creation.</description>

  <description>Everything happened at once. One minute Kip Russell was walking about in his own backyard, testing out an old space suit and dreaming about going to the Moon—and the next he was out cold and the captive of an insidious space pirate. The whole thing seemed like a very bad dream until he discovered he wasn't the only prisoner on board. Then the reality of the situation became inescapable. He—along with the daughter of a world-renowned scientist and a beautiful creature from an alien planet—had been skyjacked by a monstrous extraterrestrial and they were on their way to the Moon...a journey toward a fate worse than death!</description>

  <description>In the early 1990s, Classics professor Mary Lefkowitz discovered that one of her faculty colleagues at Wellesley College was teaching his students that Greek culture had been stolen from Africa and that Jews were responsible for the slave trade. This book tells the disturbing story of what happened when she spoke out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lefkowitz quickly learned that to investigate the origin and meaning of myths composed by people who have for centuries been dead and buried is one thing, but it is quite another to critique myths that living people take very seriously. She also found that many in academia were reluctant to challenge the fashionable idea that truth is merely a form of opinion. For her insistent defense of obvious truths about the Greeks and the Jews, Lefkowitz was embroiled in turmoil for a decade. She faced institutional indifference, angry colleagues, reverse racism, anti-Semitism, and even a lawsuit intended to silence her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;History Lesson&lt;/i&gt; Lefkowitz describes what it was like to experience directly the power of both postmodernism and compensatory politics. She offers personal insights into important issues of academic values and political correctness, and she suggests practical solutions for the divisive and painful problems that arise when a political agenda takes precedence over objective scholarship. Her forthright tale uncovers surprising features in the landscape of higher education and an unexpected need for courage from those who venture there.</description>

  <description>Without Lou Pearlman, there would have been no Backstreet Boys, no *NSYNC, and possibly no Justin Timberlake. In the late 1990s, Pearlman's boy bands ushered out guitar-and-angst-driven grunge music, and *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys began to dominate the television and radio airwaves. At the core of this squeaky-clean pop revolution was a sinister international fraud conceived by Pearlman, a husky huckster who first honed his crooked business skills as a teenage math nerd and blimp enthusiast in Flushing, Queens. From there in the mid 1980s and from his Orlando, Florida, base in the early 1990s through 2007, he cheated hundreds of investors out of nearly $500 million. When they finally caught on to him and started demanding he return their money, the “Sixth Backstreet Boy” had already fled to Germany and then to Indonesia, where he was eventually nabbed by authorities and charged with a historic federal fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyler Gray (the only journalist to speak with Pearlman while he was in jail) weaves together the fascinating behind-the-scenes story of the greed and desperation of this boy-band mogul and monumental scam artist. Gray unravels Pearlman's twenty-year long Ponzi scheme and explores persistent rumors about alleged inappropriate behavior by Pearlman toward members of the boy bands and other young men. Along the way, former friends, family members, Pearlman business associates, and band members themselves reveal detailed accounts of everything from the heyday of their stardom to Pearlman's more troubled times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hit Charade&lt;/em&gt; starts with Pearlman's awkward youth and follows along as his juggling act becomes increasingly complex, then builds to the heartbreaking moments when investors—retirees, relatives, and friends—and government authorities discover that the man they had trusted had been cheating them all along. How did this chubby boy from middle-class Queens, who pioneered some of the music industry's most lucrative pop ensembles, mastermind one of the largest and longest running Ponzi schemes in U.S. history? Here, finally, is the true story of Lou Pearlman's epic rise and fall.</description>

  <description>Copiously researched and documented,&lt;i&gt; Hit Men &lt;/i&gt;is the highly controversial portrait of the pop music industry in all its wild, ruthless glory: the insatiable greed and ambition; the enormous egos; the fierce struggles for profits and power; the vendettas, rivalries, shakedowns, and payoffs. Chronicling the evolution of America's largest music labels from the Tin Pan Alley days to the present day, Fredric Dannen examines in depth the often venal, sometimes illegal dealings among the assorted hustlers and kingpins who rule over this multi-billion-dollar business. </description>

  <description>A sharply written satire, &lt;em&gt;Honey for the Bears&lt;/em&gt; sends an unassuming antiques dealer, Paul Hussey, to Russia to do one final deal on the black market as a favor for a dead friend's wife. Even on the ship's voyage across, the Russian sensibility begins to pervade: lots of secrets and lots of vodka. When his American wife is stricken by a painful rash and he is interrogated at his hotel by Soviet agents who know that he is trying to sell stylish synthetic dresses to the masses starved for fashion, his precarious inner balance is thrown off for good. More drink follows, discoveries of his wife's illicit affair with another woman, and his own submerged sexual feelings come breaking through the surface, bubbling up in Russian champagne and caviar.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"In Search of Stupidity" is National Lampoon meets Peter Drucker. It's a funny and well-written business book that takes a look at some of the most influential marketing and business philosophies of the last 20 years and, through the dark glass of hindsight, provides an educational and vastly entertaining examination of why they didn't work for many of the country's largest and best-known high-tech companies. Make no mistake: most of them did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing wizard Richard Chapman takes readers on a hilarious ride in this book, which is richly illustrated with cartoons and reproductions of many of the actual campaigns used at the time. Filled with personal anecdotes spanning Chapman's remarkable career (he was present at many now-famous meetings and events), "In Search of Stupidity" is a no-holds-barred look at the best of the worst hopeless marketing ideas and business decisions in the last 20 years of the technology industry.</description>

  <description>Jacob Ericson is a shy, enigmatic, and somewhat inept ranch hand who works for crotchety Professor Carter and his crippled daughter, Sharon, on a ranch in California's Mojave Desert in the 1920s. One day he learns that his hands possess the mysterious gift of healing, a gift he uses to cure animals (whom he adores). Sharon (whom he also adores) then persuades him to heal her. When he successfully cures Sharon, his gift is quickly exploited and the boundaries of his charm and naivete begin to stretch. First he offers his healing powers for free at a church in Los Angeles - where Jacob has gone after Sharon, who fled her father and the ranch to pursue her dreams of stardom. Jacob and Sharon cross paths when they work for the same pair of exploitative showmen. Jacob stays with the seedy stage show only because Sharon is close by. It is when Jacob's gift is recruited to heal Earl Medwin, an eccentric, ailing young millionaire, that the love and security for which he has worked so hard begin to collapse.</description>

  <description>In dramatic commentary, Indoctrination U. unveils the intellectual corruption of American universities by faculty activists who have turned America's classrooms into indoctrination centers for their political causes. It describes how academic radicals with little regard for professional standards or the pluralistic foundations of American society have created an ideological curriculum that it is as odds with the traditional purposes of a democratic education.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the summer of 2009 the blog Gawker stated “Everybody in New Jersey Was Arrested Yesterday.” Now for the first time, the real story behind the biggest corruption bust in New Jersey’s notoriously corrupt history &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Among the forty-four people arrested in July 2009 were three mayors, five Orthodox rabbis, two state legislators, and the flamboyant deputy mayor of Jersey City, Leona Beldini, once a stripper using the stage name “Hope Diamond.” At the center of it all was a dubious character named Solomon Dwek, who perpetrated a $50 million Ponzi scheme before copping a plea and wearing a wire as a secret FBI undercover informant, setting up friends, partners, rabbis, and dozens of politicians. Mr. Dwek played his role like an extra in a mob movie. On surveillance tape, he repeatedly referred to his fraudulent “schnookie deals,” which is Yiddish for, well, schnook. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Full of impossible-to-make-up detail and fresh revelations from the continuing trials and investigations, this book—the inside, untold account of a federal sting operation that moves from the streets of Brooklyn to the diners of Jersey City, and all the way to Israel—is a wonderful tour de force of investigative journalism by the reporting team that broke this amazing story.&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Like a loyal Victorian wife, Jenny has devoted her life to her much older husband, the famous writer and naturalist Wilkie Walker, bringing up their children and researching and editing his best-selling books. But this year, as winter approaches, Wilkie is increasingly depressed and withdrawn. At her wit's end, Jenny persuades him to visit Key West, the Last Resort. Within weeks of their arrival Jenny not only has a part-time job but is becoming involved with assorted local characters, including Gerry, an ex-beatnik poet, and Lee, the dramatically attractive manager of a women-only guesthouse. Wilkie, meanwhile, is planning his own "accidental" death by drowning--a task that turns out to be more difficult than he thought--and trying to avoid the attentions of a breathless young female fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate Cover Edition for ISBN: 9780786849567&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten thousand years ago, humans and fairies fought a great battle for the magical island of Ireland. When it became clear to the fairy families that they could never win, they decided to move their civilisation underground and keep themselves hidden from the humans. All the fairy families agreed on this, except the eighth family, the demons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The demons planned to lift their small island out of time until they had regrouped and were ready to wage war on the humans once more. However, the time spell went wrong, and the island of Hybras was catapulted into Limbo, where it has remained for ten thousand years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the tainted time spell is deteriorating and demons are being sucked back into the present space and time. The fairy Council are naturally concerned about this and are monitoring any materialisations. When the spell’s deterioration accelerates, the materialisations become unpredictable. Even the fairy scientists cannot figure out where the next demon will pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But someone can. Artemis Fowl, the teenage criminal mastermind, has solved temporal equations that no normal human should be intelligent enough to understand. But Artemis Fowl is no normal human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a confused and frightened demon pops up in a Sicilian theatre, Artemis Fowl is there to meet him. Unfortunately, he is not the only one. A second, mysterious party has also solved the temporal equations, and manages to abduct the demon before Artemis can secure him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a disaster for the fairy People, because this demon was no ordinary fairy. He was the last demon warlock, and as such held the key to the survival of the entire demon race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is up to Artemis and his old comrade Captain Holly Short to track down the missing demon and rescue him before the time spell dissolves completely and the lost demon colony returns violently to Earth.</description>

  <description>The collapse of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme led to the instant evaporation of $65 billion of wealth. The effects of Madoff's brazen fraud were felt most closely in New York and Palm Beach but the story was, and continues to be, front page news across the country. Now, Brian Ross and his team of investigators shed an unyielding light onto Madoff's scheme--how he got started, how he succeed for so long, who helped him, and who shielded him from early investigations. From hard hitting revelations to fascinating anecdotes, this is an incisive and voyeuristic look into this first family of financial crime . This is both news and the most addictive kind of true crime reading, certain to appeal to both Madoff junkies and neophytes who will love a juicy story filled with intrigue, betrayal, and billions and billions of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Madoff Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; includes a vast array of news and material that readers won't find anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Contains a reproduction of Bernie's Little Black Book. The essential contacts contained here were always kept close at hand. This material has been extremely useful to the FBI investigation as they try to determine the roles that ther people played in the fraud.Ross has also secured Madoff's calendar for the past three years and other never-before-seen documents from inside the Madoff empire, straight from his desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read key details of how Madoff carried out his scam and the revelation that he began the fraud from almost the first day, in the 1960s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hear how investigators tell believe that a billion dollars or more may have been hidden by Madoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn what was going on inside the Madoff apartment as Bernie prepared for his life in prison and Ruth prepared for life in self-imposed confinement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extensive cooperation by Madoff's personal assistant, Eleanor Squillari. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extensive cooperation by Little Rick-a former employee who used to fetch drugs for the Madoffs. Little Rick knows all their dirty secrets. We learn that Bernie also liked prostitutes. He kept his favorites' names and numbers in his Little Black Book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed chronicle of Madoff's conversations and movement inside and outside the office in the days before his arrest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains incriminating connections between Madoff and certain members of the SEC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooperation of childhood friends and neighbors has enabled Ross to write a compelling portrait of Bernie and Ruth in their early years.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An intriguing look at Bernie Madoff the man, and his scam&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Madoff with the Money&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply disturbing portrait of Bernie Madoff based on dozens of exclusive, news-making interviews. From the values Madoff was taught growing up in the working class town of Laurelton, Queens to his high-life on Wall Street and the super-rich enclaves of Palm Beach and the French Riviera, bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer follows the disgraced money manager's trail as he works his way up the social and economic ladder, and eventually scams his trusting clients in a $50 billion Ponzi scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Oppenheimer's in-depth reporting, you'll discover new revelations in this startling case, and become familiar with the trusting victims-ranging from non-profit Jewish charities to the likes of seemingly sophisticated individuals such as actress Jane Fonda who would "like to shake Madoff until his teeth fall out," the scion of the Baskin-Robbins ice cream empire who lost a bundle and was forced to rent out rooms in his house, and New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg. There's even Madoff's own sister-in-law and talk show host Larry King, who apparently didn't ask the right questions when he invested. All lost their much-needed life savings, while others saw fortunes small and large evaporate in the greedy financial operations of one of history's all-time charlatans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Madoff With the Money&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delves into the details of the illusive man that lost investors billions Weaves stories of Madoff's past with those of the present in an engaging and accessible style Explores how the financial scam that Madoff ran cost individuals and institutions billions of dollars Other titles by Oppenheimer: &lt;i&gt;Toy Monster: The Big, Bad World of Mattel, &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Just Desserts: Martha Stewart the Unauthorized Biography&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there may be other books on the Bernie Madoff debacle, none digs as deep or goes as far to uncover the truth behind the man, and his incredible scam.</description>

Yet behind the glamour and glory of his high-stakes poker career lurked the flip side: a person torn between two debilitating mental illnesses?—?bipolar disorder and ADHD. To dig himself out of depression and suicidal despair, Matusow turned to dangerous street drugs to self-medicate a problem he didn’t understand, and spiraled deeper into the darker world of addiction, police narcotic stings, and jail time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this revealing and tumultuous autobiography, the combustible Matusow holds nothing back. You’ll get a mouthful of the man behind the infamous Matusow Meltdowns seen on national TV. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riveting, exhilarating, sexy, sometimes shocking and always fascinating, this voyeur’s look into the world of high-stakes poker, mental illness, and ultimately, Matusow’s inspiring redemption, will keep you glued to your seat until the very last page!</description>

  <description>Begun in the autumn of 1957 and published posthumously in 1964, Ernest Hemingway's &lt;i&gt;A Moveable Feast&lt;/i&gt; captures what it meant to be young and poor and writing in Paris during the 1920s. A correspondent for the &lt;i&gt;Toronto Star,&lt;/i&gt; Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist form; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed &lt;i&gt;Ulysses;&lt;/i&gt; Gertrude Stein held court at 27 Rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of &lt;i&gt;une gneration perdue;&lt;/i&gt; and T.S. Eliot was a bank clerk in London. It was during these years that the as-of-yet unpublished young writer gathered the material for his first novel &lt;i&gt;The Sun Also Rises,&lt;/i&gt; and the subsequent masterpieces that followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these small, reflective sketches are unforgettable encounters with the members of Hemingway's slightly rag-tag circle of artists and writers, some also fated to achieve fame and glory, others to fall into obscurity. Here, too, is an evocation of the Paris that Hemingway knew as a young man - a map drawn in his distinct prose of the streets and cafes and bookshops that comprised the city in which he, as a young writer, sometimes struggling against the cold and hunger of near poverty, honed the skills of his craft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Moveable Feast&lt;/i&gt; is at once an elegy to the remarkable group for expatriates that gathered in Paris during the twenties and a testament to the risks and rewards of the writerly life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>First published in Switzerland in 1892, finally printed in Russia in 1906, and never before translated into English, &lt;i&gt;Nihilist Girl&lt;/i&gt; is the coming-of-age story of Vera Barantsova, a young aristocrat who longs to devote her life to a cause. Her privileged world is radically changed by Alexander I's emancipation of the serfs. Vera first hopes to follow in the footsteps of Christian martyrs, but a neighboring landowner�a liberal professor fired from his position at Saint Petersburg University and exiled to his estate�opens her eyes to the injustice in Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blend of social commentary and psychological observation, &lt;i&gt;Nihilist Girl&lt;/i&gt; depicts the clash between a generation of youth who find their lives caught up by political action and a society unwilling to abandon its patriarchal traditions.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not Out of Africa&lt;/i&gt; has sparked widespread debate over the teaching of revisionist history in schools and colleges. Was Socrates black? Did Aristotle steal his ideas from the library in Alexandria? Do we owe the underlying tenets of our democratic civilizaiton to the Africans? Mary Lefkowitz explains why politically motivated histories of the ancient world are being written and shows how Afrocentrist claims blatantly contradict the historical evidence. Not Out of Africa is an important book that protects and argues for the necessity of historical truths and standards in cultural education.For this new paperback edition, Mary Lefkowitz has written an epilogue in which she responds to her critics and offers topics for further discussion. She has also added supplementary notes, a bibliography with suggestions for further reading, and a glossary of names.</description>

  <description> &lt;br /&gt;From its earliest days, America served as an arena for the revolutions in alternative spirituality that eventually swept the globe. Esoteric philosophies and personas—from Freemasonry to Spiritualism, from Madame H. P. Blavatsky to Edgar Cayce—dramatically altered the nation’s culture, politics, and religion. Yet the mystical roots of our identity are often ignored or overlooked. Opening a new window on the past, &lt;b&gt;Occult America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;presents a dramatic, pioneering study of the esoteric undercurrents of our history and their profound impact across modern life.</description>

  <description>"Sometimes when I'm at work and waiting for customers I think about the two of us living like kings and not bothering about the future. Because there may not be any future to bother about, you know. Not for anybody, one of these days. And it's a wicked world."&lt;br /&gt;Average couple Janet and Howard's lives begin to unravel when Howard's photographic memory helps win him a gameshow fortune. &lt;br /&gt;Janet doesn't want their lives to change that much. She's quite happy working at the supermarket, cooking for her husband three times a day and watching quiz shows in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;But once Howard unleashes his photographic brain on the world, the once modest used-car salesman can't seem to stop.&lt;br /&gt;And what he sees as the logical conclusion to his success isn't something Janet can agree to.</description>

  <description>"Beautifully written...Ann Patchett has produced a first novel that second- and third-time novelists would envy for its grace, insight, and compassion."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOSTON HERALD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Elizabeth's is a home for unwed mothers in the 1960s. Life there is not unpleasant and for most, it is temporary. Not so for Rose, a beautiful mysterious woman who comes to the lovely ex-hotel pregnant, but not unwed. She plans to give her baby up because she knows she cannot be the mother it needs. But St. Elizabeth's is near a healing spring, and when Rose's time draws near, she cannot go through with her plans, not all of them. And she cannot remain forever untouched by what she has left behind and who she has become in the leaving....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Stuey Ungar, the son of a Lower East Side bookie, grew up in a New York of the 1950s and '60s that was straight out of Damon Runyon. By his early teens, he had dropped out of high school and was spending most of his time in the city's under- ground card rooms. So prodigious was his talent for playing gin rummy that he soon found himself bankrolled by members of the Genovese crime family. After thrashing every top gin player on the East Coast, he was forced to broaden his horizons--traveling around the country to find opponents and also learning other card games, including poker. At twenty-one, he moved to Las Vegas for good and quickly found mentors in poker legends such as Jack "Treetop" Straus, "Amarillo Slim" Preston, Doyle Brunson, and Chip Reese, who embraced the skinny five-foot-five kid with the Rimbaud aura. Soon enough, Ungar was playing in the biggest games at the famous Dunes poker room, learning the finer points of the game at incredible speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1980, competing in his second tournament ever and playing a game--no-limit Texas Hold'em--he'd just learned, he shocked the poker universe by winning the World Series of Poker. He would go on to win the event a record three times. In One of a Kind, authors Nolan Dalla and Peter Alson tell the startling tale of a man who managed to win millions of dollars and live the highest of high-roller lives without ever quite understanding or respecting the value of money. Whether tossing away his winnings at the racetrack or on a single roll of the dice, Ungar was notorious for gambling every single dollar in his pocket on a daily basis. The risk that he embodied in his gambling carried over to his personal life. He had no concept ofnight or day. He didn't own a wristwatch, didn't have a bank account, and for years had no home address or personal possessions. For all his gambling successes, at the end of his life he bounced between hotel rooms, casinos, and crack houses, dependent upon the kindness of friends and strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This intimate, authorized biography illuminates the dark genius of poker's most charismatic and mysterious star, who could ruthlessly peer into and read other men's souls but seemed baffled and powerless when confronted with his own.</description>
