  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A remarkable work of slowed-down journalism...They are doing their jobs as journalists and writing the first draft of history." &lt;b&gt;--Jill Filipovic, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"...Generous but also damning." &lt;b&gt;--Hanna Rosin, The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From two &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; reporters, a deeper look at the formative years of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his confirmation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In September 2018, the F.B.I. was given only a week to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee. But even as Kavanaugh was sworn in to his lifetime position, many questions remained unanswered, leaving millions of Americans unsettled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Senate confirmation hearings that preceded the bureau's brief probe, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly broke critical stories about Kavanaugh's past, including the "Renate Alumni" yearbook story. They were inundated with tips from former classmates, friends, and associates that couldn't be fully investigated before the confirmation process closed. Now, their book fills in the blanks and explores the essential question: Who is Brett Kavanaugh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Education of Brett Kavanaugh &lt;/i&gt;paints a picture of the prep-school and Ivy-League worlds that formed our newest Supreme Court Justice. By offering commentary from key players from his confirmation process who haven't yet spoken publicly and pursuing lines of inquiry that were left hanging, it will be essential reading for anyone who wants to understand our political system and Kavanaugh's unexpectedly emblematic role in it.</description>

  <description>Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;With a foreword by Bill Gates&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Microsoft's President and one of the tech industry's wisest thinkers, a frank and thoughtful reckoning with how to balance enormous promise and existential risk as the digitization of everything accelerates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft President Brad Smith operates by a simple core belief: when your technology changes the world, you bear a responsibility to help address the world you have helped create. This might seem uncontroversial, but it flies in the face of a tech sector long obsessed with rapid growth and sometimes on disruption as an end in itself. Now, though, we have reached an inflection point: Silicon Valley has moved fast and it has broken things. A new understanding has emerged that companies that create technology must accept greater responsibility for the future. And governments will need to regulate technology by moving faster and catching up with the pace of innovation that is impacting our communities and changing the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Tools and Weapons&lt;/i&gt;, Brad Smith takes us into the cockpit of one of the world's largest and most powerful tech companies as it finds itself in the middle of some of the thorniest emerging issues of our time. These are challenges that come with no preexisting playbook, including privacy, cybercrime and cyberwar, social media, the moral conundrums of AI, big tech's relationship to inequality and the challenges for democracy, far and near. While in no way a self-glorifying "Microsoft memoir," the book opens up the curtain remarkably wide onto some of the company's most crucial recent decision points, as it strives to protect the hopes technology offers against the very real threats it also presents. Every tool can be a weapon in the wrong person's hands, and companies are being challenged in entirely new ways to embrace the totality of their responsibilities. We have moved from a world in which Silicon Valley could take no prisoners to one in which tech companies and governments must work together to address the challenges and adapt to the changes technology has unleashed. There are huge ramifications to be thought through, and Brad Smith provides a marvelous and urgently necessary contribution to that effort.</description>

  <description>While in grad school in the early 1990s, Chris Niebauer began to notice striking parallels between the latest discoveries in psychology, neuroscience, and the teachings of Buddhism, Taoism, and other schools of Eastern thought. When he presented his findings to a professor, his ideas were quickly dismissed as “pure coincidence, nothing more.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward 20 years later and Niebauer is a PhD and a tenured professor, and the Buddhist-neuroscience connection he found as a student is practically its own genre in the bookstore. But according to Niebauer, we are just beginning to understand the link between Eastern philosophy and the latest findings in psychology and neuroscience and what these assimilated ideas mean for the human experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this groundbreaking book, Niebauer writes that the latest research in neuropsychology is now confirming a fundamental tenet of Buddhism, what is called Anatta, or the doctrine of “no self.” Niebauer writes that our sense of self, or what we commonly refer to as the ego, is an illusion created entirely by the left side of the brain. Niebauer is quick to point out that this doesn't mean that the self doesn't exist but rather that it does so in the same way that a mirage in the middle of the desert exists, as a thought rather than a thing. His conclusions have significant ramifications for much of modern psychological modalities, which he says are spending much of their time trying to fix something that isn’t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this book unique is that Niebauer offers a series of exercises to allow the reader to experience this truth for him- or herself, as well as additional tools and practices to use after reading the book, all of which are designed to change the way we experience the world—a way that is based on being rather than thinking.</description>

  <description>How To is an instruction manual for taking everyday problems and using science and creative thinking to turn them into much bigger and more exciting problems. It teaches you how to cross a river by boiling it, outlines some of the many uses for lava around the home, and walks you through how to use experimental military research to ensure that your friends will never again ask you to help them move. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From changing a lightbulb to throwing a pool party, it describes unusual ways to accomplish common tasks, and analyzes what would happen to you if you tried them. In addition to being a profoundly unhelpful self-help book, it’s an exercise in applying math, science, and research to ordinary problems, and a tour through some of the strange and fun science underlying the world around us.</description>

  <description>"Indistractable provides a framework that will deliver the focus you need to get results." (James Clear, author of &lt;i&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You sit down at your desk to work on an important project, but a notification on your phone interrupts your morning. Later, as you're about to get back to work, a colleague taps you on the shoulder to chat. At home, screens get in the way of quality time with your family. Another day goes by, and once again, your most important personal and professional goals are put on hold.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would be possible if you followed through on your best intentions? What could you accomplish if you could stay focused and overcome distractions? What if you had the power to become "indistractable"?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;International best-selling author, former Stanford lecturer, and behavioral design expert, Nir Eyal, wrote Silicon Valley's handbook for making technology habit-forming. Five years after publishing Hooked, Eyal reveals distraction's Achilles' heel in his groundbreaking new book.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Indistractable&lt;/i&gt;, Eyal reveals the hidden psychology driving us to distraction. He describes why solving the problem is not as simple as swearing off our devices: Abstinence is impractical and often makes us want more.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyal lays bare the secret of finally doing what you say you will do with a four-step, research-backed model. Indistractable reveals the key to getting the best out of technology, without letting it get the best of us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside, Eyal overturns conventional wisdom and reveals: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why distraction at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture - and how to fix it  &lt;br /&gt;What really drives human behavior and why "time management is pain management"  &lt;br /&gt;Why your relationships (and your sex life) depend on you becoming indistractable  &lt;br /&gt;How to raise indistractable children in an increasingly distracting world &lt;br /&gt;Empowering and optimistic, &lt;i&gt;Indistractable&lt;/i&gt; provides practical, novel techniques to control your time and attention - helping you live the life you really want.</description>

  <description>In July 2015, a young black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over for a minor traffic violation in rural Texas. Minutes later she was arrested and jailed. Three days later, she committed suicide in her cell. What went wrong? &lt;i&gt;Talking to Strangers&lt;/i&gt; is all about what happens when we encounter people we don't know, why it often goes awry, and what it says about us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we make sense of the unfamiliar? Why are we so bad at judging someone, reading a face, or detecting a lie? Why do we so often fail to 'get' other people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through a series of puzzles, encounters and misunderstandings, from little-known stories to infamous legal cases, Gladwell takes us on a journey through the unexpected. You will read about the spy who spent years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon, the man who saw through the fraudster Bernie Madoff, the suicide of the poet Sylvia Plath and the false conviction of Amanda Knox. You will discover that strangers are never simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one shows us who we are like Malcolm Gladwell. Here he sets out to understand why we act the way we do, and how we all might know a little more about those we don't.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dazzling group portrait of Franz Boas, the founder of cultural anthropology, and his circle of women scientists, who upended American notions of race, gender, and sexuality in the 1920s and 1930s--a sweeping chronicle of how our society began to question the basic ways we understand other cultures and ourselves.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the 19th century, everyone knew that people were defined by their race and sex and were fated by birth and biology to be more or less intelligent, able, nurturing, or warlike. But one rogue researcher looked at the data and decided everyone was wrong. Franz Boas was the very image of a mad scientist: a wild-haired immigrant with a thick German accent. By the 1920s he was also the foundational thinker and public face of a new school of thought at Columbia University called cultural anthropology. He proposed that cultures did not exist on a continuum from primitive to advanced. Instead, every society solves the same basic problems--from childrearing to how to live well--with its own set of rules, beliefs, and taboos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boas's students were some of the century's intellectual stars: Margaret Mead, the outspoken field researcher whose &lt;i&gt;Coming of Age in Samoa&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most widely read works of social science of all time; Ruth Benedict, the great love of Mead's life, whose research shaped post-Second World War Japan; Ella Deloria, the Dakota Sioux activist who preserved the traditions of Native Americans of the Great Plains; and Zora Neale Hurston, whose studies under Boas fed directly into her now-classic novel, &lt;i&gt;Their Eyes Were Watching God&lt;/i&gt;. Together, they mapped vanishing civilizations from the Arctic to the South Pacific and overturned the relationship between biology and behavior. Their work reshaped how we think of women and men, normalcy and deviance, and re-created our place in a world of many cultures and value systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Gods of the Upper Air&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turning narrative of radical ideas and adventurous lives, a history rich in scandal, romance, and rivalry, and a genesis story of the fluid conceptions of identity that define our present moment.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Instant &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't need to be Ivy League educated, have money, be creative, or even have an idea to get rich. You just need to be willing to break the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At nineteen, I founded a software company with $119 in my bank account. Five years later, it was valued at $10.5 million. I don't consider myself exceptionally brilliant. I just realized something few people know: You don't need lots of money or an original idea to get really rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I make more than $100,000 in passive income every month, while also running my own private equity firm and hosting &lt;i&gt;The Top Entrepreneurs&lt;/i&gt; podcast, which has more than 10 million downloads. This book will show you how I went from college dropout to member of the New Rich. And I'm holding nothing back. You'll see my tax returns, my profit and loss statements, my email negotiations when buying and selling companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time to forget your grandfather's advice. I'll teach you how to be a modern opportunist--investor, entrepreneur, or side hustler--by breaking these four golden rules of the old guard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Focus on one skill: Wrong. Don't cultivate one great skill to get ahead. In today's business world, success goes to the multitaskers.&lt;br /&gt;2.Be unique: Wrong. The way to get rich is not by launching a new idea but by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist. &lt;br /&gt;3.Focus on one goal: Wrong. Focus instead on creating a system to produce the outcome you want, not just once, but over and over again. &lt;br /&gt;4.Appeal to the masses: Wrong. The masses are broke ($4k average net worth in America?). Let others cut a trail through the jungle so you can peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By rejecting these defunct rules and following my unconventional path, you can copy other people's ideas shamelessly, bootstrap a start-up with almost no funding, invest in small local businesses for huge payoffs, and reap all the benefits.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Obstacle Is the Way&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ego Is the Enemy&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling author Ryan Holiday made ancient wisdom wildly popular with a new generation of leaders in sports, politics, and technology. In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Stillness Is the Key&lt;/i&gt;, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. &lt;i&gt;Stillness Is the Key &lt;/i&gt;offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns&lt;br /&gt;driven time and again off course, once he had plundered&lt;br /&gt;the hallowed heights of Troy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;, which Jasper Griffin in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Review of Books&lt;/i&gt; hails as "a distinguished achievement."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt; is the world's greatest war epic, then the &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The 2013-2014 Ebola epidemic was the deadliest ever--but the outbreaks continue. Now comes a gripping account of the doctors and scientists fighting to protect us, an urgent wake-up call about the future of emerging viruses--from the #1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Hot Zone, &lt;/i&gt;soon to be a National Geographic original miniseries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, Ebola started with a two-year-old child who likely had contact with a wild creature and whose entire family quickly fell ill and died. The ensuing global drama activated health professionals in North America, Europe, and Africa in a desperate race against time to contain the viral wildfire. By the end--as the virus mutated into its deadliest form, and spread farther and faster than ever before--30,000 people would be infected, and the dead would be spread across eight countries on three continents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this taut and suspenseful medical drama, Richard Preston deeply chronicles the outbreak, in which we saw for the first time the specter of Ebola jumping continents, crossing the Atlantic, and infecting people in America. Rich in characters and conflict--physical, emotional, and ethical--&lt;i&gt;Crisis in the Red Zone&lt;/i&gt; is an immersion in one of the great public health calamities of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preston writes of doctors and nurses in the field putting their own lives on the line, of government bureaucrats and NGO administrators moving, often fitfully, to try to contain the outbreak, and of pharmaceutical companies racing to develop drugs to combat the virus. He also explores the charged ethical dilemma over who should and did receive the rare doses of an experimental treatment when they became available at the peak of the disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Crisis in the Red Zone&lt;/i&gt; makes clear that the outbreak of 2013-2014 is a harbinger of further, more severe outbreaks, and of emerging viruses heretofore unimagined--in any country, on any continent. In our ever more interconnected world, with roads and towns cut deep into the jungles of equatorial Africa, viruses both familiar and undiscovered are being unleashed into more densely populated areas than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more we discover about the virosphere, the more we realize its deadly potential. &lt;i&gt;Crisis in the Red Zone&lt;/i&gt; is an exquisitely timely book, a stark warning of viral outbreaks to come.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - A clear-eyed account of learning how to lead in a chaotic world, by General Jim Mattis--the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of our time--and Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call Sign Chaos&lt;/i&gt; is the account of Jim Mattis's storied career, from wide-ranging leadership roles in three wars to ultimately commanding a quarter of a million troops across the Middle East. Along the way, Mattis recounts his foundational experiences as a leader, extracting the lessons he has learned about the nature of warfighting and peacemaking, the importance of allies, and the strategic dilemmas--and short-sighted thinking--now facing our nation. He makes it clear why America must return to a strategic footing so as not to continue winning battles but fighting inconclusive wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mattis divides his book into three parts: Direct Leadership, Executive Leadership, and Strategic Leadership. In the first part, Mattis recalls his early experiences leading Marines into battle, when he knew his troops as well as his own brothers. In the second part, he explores what it means to command thousands of troops and how to adapt your leadership style to ensure your intent is understood by your most junior troops so that they can own their mission. In the third part, Mattis describes the challenges and techniques of leadership at the strategic level, where military leaders reconcile war's grim realities with political leaders' human aspirations, where complexity reigns and the consequences of imprudence are severe, even catastrophic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call Sign Chaos&lt;/i&gt; is a memoir of a life of warfighting and lifelong learning, following along as Mattis rises from Marine recruit to four-star general. It is a journey about learning to lead and a story about how he, through constant study and action, developed a unique leadership philosophy, one relevant to us all.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;NOW A &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; AND &lt;em&gt;WALL STREET JOURNAL&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your limits? Care to break them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To inspire change in yourself and your team, you must break free from what's holding you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Elevate&lt;/em&gt;, Robert Glazer reveals four life-changing principles -- or capacities -- that will allow you to overcome self-limiting beliefs, establish positive habits, and find your "why." As we look to elevate ourselves, we mean so much more than beating the competition. After all, our greatest competition is ourselves! We need to find ways to consistently outperform ourselves and our own expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Glazer has built a career on accelerating productivity and careers. ELEVATE is based on his five foundational elements necessary for increasing our capacity: Finding Your Why, Overcoming Self-Limiting Beliefs, Setting Goals and Creating Accountability, Maintaining Health and Wellness, and Establishing Routine and Positive Habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is elevating yourself beyond the edge of your current abilities. Challenge yourself, and the result will inspire others to rise along with you. It's time to break free of your limits.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For any woman who has experienced illness, chronic pain, or endometriosis comes an inspiring memoir advocating for recognition of women's health issues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the fall of 2010, Abby Norman's strong dancer's body dropped forty pounds and gray hairs began to sprout from her temples. She was repeatedly hospitalized in excruciating pain, but the doctors insisted it was a urinary tract infection and sent her home with antibiotics. Unable to get out of bed, much less attend class, Norman dropped out of college and embarked on what would become a years-long journey to discover what was wrong with her. It wasn't until she took matters into her own hands--securing a job in a hospital and educating herself over lunchtime reading in the medical library--that she found an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Ask Me About My Uterus&lt;/i&gt;, Norman describes what it was like to have her pain dismissed, to be told it was all in her head, only to be taken seriously when she was accompanied by a boyfriend who confirmed that her sexual performance was, indeed, compromised. Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women's bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It's time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Esperanza thought she'd always live with her family on their ranch in Mexico--she'd always have fancy dresses, a beautiful home, and servants. But a sudden tragedy forces Esperanza and Mama to flee to California during the Great Depression, and to settle in a camp for Mexican farm workers. Esperanza isn't ready for the hard labor, financial struggles, or lack of acceptance she now faces. When their new life is threatened, Esperanza must find a way to rise above her difficult circumstances--Mama's life, and her own, depend on it.</description>

  <description>Marian Anderson is best known for her historic concert at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, which drew an integrated crowd of 75,000 people in pre-Civil Rights America. While this momentous event showcased the uniqueness of her voice, the strength of her character, and the struggles of the times in which she lived, it is only part of her story. Like the operatic arias Marian would come to sing, Ryan's text is as moving as a libretto, and Selznick's pictures as exquisitely detailed and elaborately designed as a stage set. What emerges most profoundly from their shared vision is a role model of courage.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Keep Working. Keep Playing. Keep Creating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his previous books &lt;i&gt;Steal Like an Artist &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Show Your Work!&lt;/i&gt;, both &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestsellers, Austin Kleon gave readers the keys to unlock their creativity and showed them how to become known. Now he offers his most inspiring work yet, with ten simple rules for how to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself—for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The creative life is not a linear journey to a finish line, it’s a loop—so find a daily routine, because today is the only day that matters. Disconnect from the world to connect with yourself—sometimes you just have to switch into airplane mode. &lt;i&gt;Keep Going&lt;/i&gt; celebrates getting outdoors and taking a walk (as director Ingmar Bergman told his daughter, ”The demons hate fresh air”). Pay attention, and especially pay attention to what you pay attention to. Worry less about getting things done, and more about the worth of what you’re doing. Instead of focusing on making your mark, work to leave things better than you found them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keep Going&lt;/i&gt; and its timeless, practical, and ethical principles are for anyone trying to sustain a meaningful and productive life.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>How best to adapt established companies to a rapidly changing economy has long been a topic of debate in both the corporate and academic worlds. This challenge is especially pressing for large organizations that may have grown top-heavy and rigid with time but now need to be light on their feet to stay relevant and profitable. Until now, the best attempts have consisted of plucking tools and methods from the world of start-ups and applying them wholesale in large corporate environments. Most of these efforts have either fizzled or failed outright because they lacked a framework for a comprehensive corporation-sized rollout. &lt;i&gt;The Loop Approach&lt;/i&gt; introduces a new series of methods that could help change the course of operations for even the most colossal organizations. Sebastian Klein and Ben Hughes provide a wide-ranging set of guidelines for achieving corporate agility, complete with checklists and worksheets that should prove instantly applicable. Want proof? The methods outlined in &lt;i&gt;The Loop Approach&lt;/i&gt; have already been successfully implemented at such European corporate giants as Audi, Deutsche Bahn, and Telekom.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Read award-winning journalist Frank Bruni's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller: an inspiring manifesto about everything wrong with today's frenzied college admissions process and how to make the most of your college years. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last few decades, Americans have turned college admissions into a terrifying and occasionally devastating process, preceded by test prep, tutors, all sorts of stratagems, all kinds of rankings, and a conviction among too many young people that their futures will be determined and their worth established by which schools say yes and which say no.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Where You Go is Not Who You'll Be&lt;/i&gt;, Frank Bruni explains why this mindset is wrong, giving students and their parents a new perspective on this brutal, deeply flawed competition and a path out of the anxiety that it provokes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bruni, a bestselling author and a columnist for the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, shows that the Ivy League has no monopoly on corner offices, governors' mansions, or the most prestigious academic and scientific grants. Through statistics, surveys, and the stories of hugely successful people, he demonstrates that many kinds of colleges serve as ideal springboards. And he illuminates how to make the most of them. What matters in the end are students' efforts in and out of the classroom, not the name on their diploma.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Where you go &lt;i&gt;isn't &lt;/i&gt;who you'll be. Americans need to hear that--and this indispensable manifesto says it with eloquence and respect for the real promise of higher education.</description>

  <description>First published in 1952 and immediately hailed as a masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;Invisible Man&lt;/i&gt; is one of those rare novels that have changed the shape of American literature. For not only does Ralph Ellison's nightmare journey across the racial divide tell unparalleled truths about the nature of bigotry and its effects on the minds of both victims and perpetrators, it gives us an entirely new model of what a novel can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he journeys from the Deep South to the streets and basements of Harlem, from a horrifying "battle royal" where black men are reduced to fighting animals, to a Communist rally where they are elevated to the status of trophies, Ralph Ellison's nameless protagonist ushers readers into a parallel universe that throws our own into harsh and even hilarious relief. Suspenseful and sardonic, narrated in a voice that takes in the symphonic range of the American language, black and white, &lt;i&gt;Invisible Man&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most audacious and dazzling novels of our century.</description>

  <description>Imagine a world where your phone is too big for your hand, where your doctor prescribes a drug that is wrong for your body, where in a car accident you are 47% more likely to be seriously injured, where every week the countless hours of work you do are not recognised or valued. If any of this sounds familiar, chances are that you're a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population. It exposes the gender data gap – a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the impact this has on their health and well-being. From government policy and medical research, to technology, workplaces, urban planning and the media, Invisible Women reveals the biased data that excludes women. In making the case for change, this powerful and provocative book will make you see the world anew.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A sweeping history--and counter-narrative--of Native American life from the Wounded Knee massacre to the present.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Brown's 1970 &lt;i&gt;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&lt;/i&gt; was the first truly popular book of Indian history ever published. But it promulgated the impression that American Indian history essentially ended with the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee--that not only did one hundred fifty Sioux die at the hands of the U. S. Cavalry but Native civilization did as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up Ojibwe on a reservation in Minnesota, training as an anthropologist, and researching Native life past and present for his nonfiction and novels, David Treuer uncovered a different narrative. Instead of disappearing, and despite--or perhaps because of--intense struggles to preserve their language, their culture, their very families, the story of American Indians since the end of the nineteenth century to the present is one of unprecedented growth and rebirth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee&lt;/i&gt;, Treuer melds history with reportage and memoir. Beginning with the tribes' devastating loss of land and the forced assimilation of their children at government-run boarding schools, he shows how the period of greatest adversity also helped to incubate a unifying Native identity. He traces how conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it steered the emerging shape of their self-rule and spawned a new generation of resistance. In addition, Treuer explores how advances in technology allowed burgeoning Indian populations across the continent to come together as never before, fostering a political force. Photographs, maps, and other visuals, from period advertisements to little-known historical photos, amplify the sense of accessing a fascinating and untold story. &lt;i&gt;The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee&lt;/i&gt; is an essential, intimate history--and counter-narrative--of a resilient people in a transformative era.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groundbreaking take on how complexity causes failure in all kinds of modern systems--from social media to air travel--this practical and entertaining book reveals how we can prevent meltdowns in business and life &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Endlessly fascinating, brimming with insight, and more fun than a book about failure has any right to be, &lt;i&gt;Meltdown&lt;/i&gt; will transform how you think about the systems that govern our lives. This is a wonderful book."--&lt;b&gt;Charles Duhigg, author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Smarter Faster Better&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crash on the Washington, D.C. metro system. An accidental overdose in a state-of-the-art hospital. An overcooked holiday meal. At first glance, these disasters seem to have little in common. But surprising new research shows that all these events--and the myriad failures that dominate headlines every day--share similar causes. By understanding what lies behind these failures, we can design better systems, make our teams more productive, and transform how we make decisions at work and at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together cutting-edge social science with riveting stories that take us from the frontlines of the Volkswagen scandal to backstage at the Oscars, and from deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico to the top of Mount Everest, Chris Clearfield and Andras Tilcsik explain how the increasing complexity of our systems creates conditions ripe for failure and why our brains and teams can't keep up. They highlight the paradox of progress: Though modern systems have given us new capabilities, they've become vulnerable to surprising meltdowns--and even to corruption and misconduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Meltdown&lt;/i&gt; isn't just about failure; it's about solutions--whether you're managing a team or the chaos of your family's morning routine. It reveals why ugly designs make us safer, how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with &lt;i&gt;fewer&lt;/i&gt; experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. The result is an eye-opening, empowering, and entirely original book--one that will change the way you see our complex world and your own place in it.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s chief political correspondent provides a rollicking insider’s look at the making of the modern Republican Party—how a decade of cultural upheaval, populist outrage, and ideological warfare made the GOP vulnerable to a hostile takeover from the unlikeliest of insurgents: Donald J. Trump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2016 election was a watershed for the United States. But, as Tim Alberta explains in &lt;em&gt;American Carnage&lt;/em&gt;, to understand Trump’s victory is to view him not as the creator of this era of polarization and bruising partisanship, but rather as its most manifest consequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Carnage&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a president’s rise based on a country’s evolution and a party’s collapse. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: They had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party’s base. Yet Obama’s forceful pursuit of his progressive agenda, coupled with the nation’s rapidly changing societal and demographic identity, lit a fire under the right, returning Republicans to power and inviting a bloody struggle for the party’s identity in the post-Bush era. The factions that emerged—one led by absolutists like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz, the other led by pragmatists like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell—engaged in a series of devastating internecine clashes and attempted coups for control. With the GOP’s internal fissures rendering it legislatively impotent, and that impotence fueling a growing resentment toward the political class and its institutions, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to announce his run in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the GOP—and of the parallel sense of cultural, socioeconomic, and technological disruption during that period—can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America’s current turmoil. How did a party&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;once obsessed with national insolvency come to champion trillion-dollar deficits&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; How did the party of compassionate conservatism become the party of Muslim bans and family separation? How did the party of family values elect a thrice-married philanderer? And, most important, how long can such a party survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loaded with explosive original reporting and based off hundreds of exclusive interviews—including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Jim DeMint, and Reince Priebus, among many others—&lt;em&gt;American Carnage&lt;/em&gt; takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period as we’ve never seen it before and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of this political era.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now a Wall Street Journal bestseller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education—a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgár, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship—without knowing French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in &lt;em&gt;Ultralearning&lt;/em&gt; will guide you to success.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A follow-up to Matt Haig's internationally bestselling memoir, &lt;i&gt;Reasons to Stay Alive&lt;/i&gt;, a broader look at how modern life feeds our anxiety, and how to live a better life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The societies we live in are increasingly making our minds ill, making it feel as though the way we live is engineered to make us unhappy. When Matt Haig developed panic disorder, anxiety, and depression as an adult, it took him a long time to work out the ways the external world could impact his mental health in both positive and negative ways. &lt;i&gt;Notes on a Nervous Planet &lt;/i&gt;collects his observations, taking a look at how the various social, commercial and technological "advancements" that have created the world we now live in can actually hinder our happiness. Haig examines everything from broader phenomena like inequality, social media, and the news; to things closer to our daily lives, like how we sleep, how we exercise, and even the distinction we draw between our minds and our bodies.</description>

An epic, first-of-its-kind book, entwining leading-edge scientific discovery with the intimate stories of four individual lives, by the Pulitzer Prize–winning &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terminal cancer patient rises from the grave. A medical marvel defies HIV. Two women with autoimmunity discover their own bodies have turned against them. Matt Richtel's &lt;i&gt;An Elegant Defense&lt;/i&gt; uniquely entwines these intimate stories with science’s centuries-long quest to unlock the mysteries of sickness and health, and illuminates the immune system as never before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immune system is our body’s essential defense network, a guardian vigilantly fighting illness, healing wounds, maintaining order and balance, and keeping us alive. Its legion of microscopic foot soldiers—from T cells to “natural killers”—patrols our body, linked by a nearly instantaneous communications grid. It has been honed by evolution over millennia to face an almost infinite array of threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all its astonishing complexity, however, the immune system can be easily compromised by fatigue, stress, toxins, advanced age, and poor nutrition—hallmarks of modern life—and even by excessive hygiene. Paradoxically, it is a fragile wonder weapon that can turn on our own bodies with startling results, leading today to epidemic levels of autoimmune disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richtel effortlessly guides readers on a scientific detective tale winding from the Black Plague to twentieth-century breakthroughs in vaccination and antibiotics, to the cutting-edge laboratories that are revolutionizing immunology—perhaps the most extraordinary and consequential medical story of our time. The foundation that Richtel builds makes accessible revelations about cancer immunotherapy, the microbiome, and autoimmune treatments that are changing millions of lives. &lt;i&gt;An Elegant Defense&lt;/i&gt; also captures in vivid detail how these powerful therapies, along with our behavior and environment, interact with the immune system, often for the good but always on a razor’s edge that can throw this remarkable system out of balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on his groundbreaking reporting for the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and based on extensive new interviews with dozens of world-renowned scientists, Matt Richtel has produced a landmark book, equally an investigation into the deepest riddles of survival and a profoundly human tale that is movingly brought to life through the eyes of his four main characters, each of whom illuminates an essential facet of our “elegant defense.”</description>

  <description>The Appalachian Trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America—majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you’re going to take a hike, it’s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you’ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way—and a couple of bears. Already a classic, &lt;i&gt;A Walk in the Woods &lt;/i&gt; will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘Bruce Daisley is on a mission to change the world of work.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years we've been told that the secret of motivation at work was found by searching for the answer to the question 'why?' but what about if we could find satisfaction not in 'why?' but 'how?' This is a book that's intelligent but compellingly readable, funny but substantially evidenced. Bruce Daisley shares the learnings from his hugely popular podcast &lt;i&gt;Eat Sleep Work Repeat&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and he takes us on a quest to probe experts on about how best to make our jobs happier and more fulfilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Work&lt;/i&gt;, provides the fruits of his discoveries. Its succinct chapters range across all aspects of 21st-century office life, tackling the key questions and offering inspiration, empirically tested insight and down-to-earth practical answers in equal measure. Covering personal motivation through to the science of building winning team cultures this is a fascinating read. Are lunch breaks for wimps, or do they actually make us more productive? Is it true that you can improve team performance simply by moving the location of the kettle or coffee machine? And what is a Monk Mode Morning, and why do people swear by it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re not happy with the status quo, if you think things could be done better, if you’re seeking greater fulfilment at work and a life that is a little less fraught, &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Work &lt;/i&gt;will point the way.</description>

  <description>Everyone says they want to be happy. But that's much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the millennia, philosophers have thought long and hard about happiness, and come up with all sorts of different definitions and ideas for how we might live a happier life. Here, Derren explores the history of happiness from classical times until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. His aim is to reclaim happiness for us all, and enable us to appreciate the really good things in life for what they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascinating, entertaining and revelatory, this is a book for anyone who has ever wondered if there must be more to life...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A gentle, knowledgeable guide to a fate we all share” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;): the first and only all-encompassing action plan for the end of life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There is nothing wrong with you for dying,” hospice physician B.J. Miller and journalist and caregiver Shoshana Berger write in &lt;i&gt;A Beginner’s Guide to the End&lt;/i&gt;. “Our ultimate purpose here isn’t so much to help you die as it is to free up as much life as possible until you do.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Theirs is a clear-eyed and big-hearted action plan for approaching the end of life, written to help readers feel more in control of an experience that so often seems anything but controllable. Their book offers everything from step-by-step instructions for how to do your paperwork and navigate the healthcare system to answers to questions you might be afraid to ask your doctor, like whether or not sex is still okay when you’re sick. Get advice for how to break the news to your employer, whether to share old secrets with your family, how to face friends who might not be as empathetic as you’d hoped, and how to talk to your children about your will. (Don’t worry: if anyone gets snippy, it’ll likely be their spouses, not them.) There are also lessons for survivors, like how to shut down a loved one’s social media accounts, clean out the house, and write a great eulogy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An honest, surprising, and detail-oriented guide to the most universal of all experiences, &lt;i&gt;A Beginner’s Guide to the End&lt;/i&gt; is “a book that every family should have, the equivalent of Dr. Spock but for this other phase of life” (&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Dr. Abraham Verghese).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Music of the Primes&lt;/i&gt; explores the future of creativity and how machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be human.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a well-programmed machine do anything a human can―only better? Complex algorithms are choosing our music, picking our partners, and driving our investments. They can navigate more data than a doctor or lawyer and act with greater precision. For many years we’ve taken solace in the notion that they can’t create. But now that algorithms can learn and adapt, does the future of creativity belong to machines, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to imagine a better guide to the bewildering world of artificial intelligence than Marcus du Sautoy, a celebrated Oxford mathematician whose work on symmetry in the ninth dimension has taken him to the vertiginous edge of mathematical understanding. In &lt;i&gt;The Creativity Code&lt;/i&gt; he considers what machine learning means for the future of creativity. The Pollockizer can produce drip paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock, Botnik spins off fanciful (if improbable) scenes inspired by J. K. Rowling, and the music-composing algorithm Emmy managed to fool a panel of Bach experts. But do these programs just mimic, or do they have what it takes to create? Du Sautoy argues that to answer this question, we need to understand how the algorithms that drive them work―and this brings him back to his own subject of mathematics, with its puzzles, constraints, and enticing possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While most recent books on AI focus on the future of work, &lt;i&gt;The Creativity Code&lt;/i&gt; moves us to the forefront of creative new technologies and offers a more positive and unexpected vision of our future cohabitation with machines. It challenges us to reconsider what it means to be human―and to crack the creativity code.</description>

  <description>From a universal basic income to a 15-hour workweek, from a world without borders to a world without poverty – it’s time to return to utopian thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rutger Bregman takes us on a journey through history, beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he introduces ideas whose time has come. Utopia for Realists is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think you know. In the words of leading social theorist Zygmunt Bauman, it is "brilliant, truly enlightening, and eminently readable."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This original Dutch bestseller sparked a national movement for basic income experiments that soon made international headlines.</description>

  <description>Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, a God-realized being named Lao-tzu in ancient China dictated 81 verses, which are regarded by many as the ultimate commentary on the nature of our existence. The classic text of these 81 verses, called the Tao Te Ching or the Great Way, offers advice and guidance that is balanced, moral, spiritual, and always concerned with working for the good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, &lt;b&gt;Dr. Wayne W. Dyer&lt;/b&gt; has reviewed hundreds of translations of the Tao Te Ching and has written 81 distinct essays on how to apply the ancient wisdom of Lao-tzu to today’s modern world. This work contains the entire 81 verses of the Tao, compiled from Wayne’s researching of 12 of the most well-respected translations of text that have survived for more than 25 centuries. Each chapter is designed for actually living the Tao or the Great Way today. Some of the chapter titles are “Living with Flexibility,” “Living Without Enemies,” and “Living by Letting Go.” Each of the 81 brief chapters focuses on living the Tao and concludes with a section called “Doing the Tao Now.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        Wayne spent one entire year reading, researching, and meditating on Lao-tzu’s messages, practicing them each day and ultimately writing down these essays as he felt Lao-tzu wanted you to know them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a work to be read slowly, one essay a day. As Wayne says, “This is a book that will forever change the way you look at your life, and the result will be that you’ll live in a new world aligned with nature. Writing this book changed me forever, too. I now live in accord with the natural world and feel the greatest sense of peace I’ve ever experienced. I’m so proud to present this interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, and offer the same opportunity for change that it has brought me.”</description>

  <description>A runaway bestseller in Sweden that has sold more than a million copies worldwide, Surrounded by Idiots shares a groundbreaking new method of understanding the people around you that will change how you interact with everyone from your coworkers to your spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Thomas Erikson explains that there are four key behavior types that define how we interact with and perceive the people around us. Understanding someone’s pattern of behavior is the key to successful communication. Erikson breaks down the four kinds of behavior types—Reds who are dominant and commanding, Yellows who are social and optimistic, Greens who are laid back and friendly, and Blues who are analytical and precise—and explains how to identify and interact with each type of person. Instead of being bogged down with overly technical categorizations, the simple four color system allows you to speedily identify a friend or coworker and adjust how you speak and share with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by Idiots is full of practical information for interacting with people based on their color, including the strengths and weaknesses of all the profiles, how to give positive and negative feedback to each, and the best way to word an email when writing to someone with a different profile.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An epic true-tale of hubris and greed from two Pulitzer-finalist &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; reporters, &lt;i&gt;Billion Dollar Whale&lt;/i&gt; reveals how a young social climber pulled off one of the biggest financial heists in history--right under the nose of the global financial industry--exposing the shocking secret nexus of elite wealth, banking, Hollywood, and politics.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The dust had yet to settle on the global financial crisis in 2009 when an unlikely Wharton grad was setting in motion a fraud of unprecedented gall and magnitude--one that would come to symbolize the next great threat to the global financial system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Billion Dollar Whale&lt;/i&gt; will become a classic, harrowing parable about the financial world in the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>When Chloe Pierce’s mom forbids her to apply for a spot at the dance conservatory of her dreams, she devises a secret plan to drive two hundred miles to the nearest audition. But Chloe hits her first speed bump when her annoying neighbor Eli insists upon hitching a ride, threatening to tell Chloe’s mom if she leaves him and his smelly dog, Geezer, behind. So now Chloe’s chasing her ballet dreams down the east coast—two unwanted (but kinda cute) passengers in her car, butterflies in her stomach, and a really dope playlist on repeat.</description>

  <description>Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and the world's eighth largest oil producer, but its success has been undermined in recent decades by ethnic and religious conflict, political instability, rampant official corruption and an ailing economy. Toyin Falola, a leading historian intimately acquainted with the region, and Matthew Heaton, who has worked extensively on African science and culture, combine their expertise to explain the context to Nigeria's recent troubles through an exploration of its pre-colonial and colonial past, and its journey from independence to statehood. By examining key themes such as colonialism, religion, slavery, nationalism and the economy, the authors show how Nigeria's history has been swayed by the vicissitudes of the world around it, and how Nigerians have adapted to meet these challenges. This book offers a unique portrayal of a resilient people living in a country with immense, but unrealized, potential.</description>

  <description>Many businesses are based on creating desirable experiences, products and services for users. However in spite of this, companies often fail to consider the end user - the customer - in their planning and development processes. As a result, organizations find themselves spending huge sums of money creating products and services that, quite simply, don't work. User experience research, also known as UX research, focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs and motivations through a range of observational techniques, task analysis and other methodologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;User Research &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;is a practical guide that shows readers how to use the vast array of user research methods available. Covering all the key research methods including face-to-face user testing, card sorting, surveys, A/B testing and many more, the book gives expert insight into the nuances, advantages and disadvantages of each, while also providing guidance on how to interpret, analyze and share the data once it has been obtained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;User Research&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is about putting natural powers of observation and conversation to use in a specific way. The book isn't bogged down with small, specific, technical detail - rather, it explores the fundamentals of user research, which remain true regardless of the context in which they are applied. As such, the tools and frameworks given here can be used in any sector or industry, to improve any part of the customer journey and experience; whether that means improving software, websites, customer services, products, packaging or more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A linguistically informed look at how our digital world is transforming the English language. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Language is humanity's most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What's more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer "LOL" or "lol," why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because Internet&lt;/em&gt; is essential reading for anyone who's ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come from. It's the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that's a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A founder of the field of evolutionary medicine uses his decades of experience as a psychiatrist to provide a much-needed new framework for making sense of mental illness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why do I feel bad? &lt;/i&gt;There is real power in understanding our bad feelings. With his classic &lt;i&gt;Why We Get Sick&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Randolph Nesse helped to establish the field of evolutionary medicine. Now he returns with a book that transforms our understanding of mental disorders by exploring a fundamentally new question. Instead of asking why certain people suffer from mental illness, Nesse asks why natural selection has left us all with fragile minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on revealing stories from his own clinical practice and insights from evolutionary biology, Nesse shows how negative emotions are useful in certain situations, yet can become overwhelming. Anxiety protects us from harm in the face of danger, but false alarms are inevitable. Low moods prevent us from wasting effort in pursuit of unreachable goals, but they often escalate into pathological depression. Other mental disorders, such as addiction and anorexia, result from the mismatch between modern environment and our ancient human past. And there are good evolutionary reasons for sexual disorders and for why genes for schizophrenia persist. Taken together, these and many more insights help to explain the pervasiveness of human suffering, and show us new paths for relieving it by understanding individuals as individuals.</description>

  <description>Four undocumented Mexican American students, two great teachers, one robot-building contest...and a major motion picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2004, four Latino teenagers arrived at the Marine Advanced Technology Education Robotics Competition at the University of California, Santa Barbara. They were born in Mexico but raised in Phoenix, Arizona, where they attended an underfunded public high school. No one had ever suggested to Oscar, Cristian, Luis, or Lorenzo that they might amount to much - but two inspiring science teachers had convinced these impoverished, undocumented kids from the desert who had never even seen the ocean that they should try to build an underwater robot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And build a robot they did. Their robot wasn't pretty, especially compared to those of the competition. They were going up against some of the best collegiate engineers in the country, including a team from MIT backed by a $10,000 grant from ExxonMobil. The Phoenix teenagers had scraped together less than $1,000 and built their robot out of scavenged parts. This was never a level competition - and yet, against all odds... they won! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is just the beginning for these four, whose story - which became a key inspiration to the DREAMers movement - will go on to include first-generation college graduations, deportation, bean-picking in Mexico, and service in Afghanistan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joshua Davis' Spare Parts is a story about overcoming insurmountable odds and four young men who proved they were among the most patriotic and talented Americans in this country - even as the country tried to kick them out.</description>

  <description>As revelatory as Atul Gawande's &lt;i&gt;Being Mortal&lt;/i&gt;, physician and award-winning author Louise Aronson's &lt;i&gt;Elderhood&lt;/i&gt; is an essential, empathetic look at a vital but often disparaged stage of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than 5,000 years, "old" has been defined as beginning between the ages of 60 and 70. That means most people alive today will spend more years in elderhood than in childhood, and many will be elders for 40 years or more. Yet at the very moment that humans are living longer than ever before, we've made old age into a disease, a condition to be dreaded, denigrated, neglected, and denied. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminiscent of Oliver Sacks, noted Harvard-trained geriatrician Louise Aronson uses stories from her quarter century of caring for patients, and draws from history, science, literature, popular culture, and her own life to weave a vision of old age that's neither nightmare nor utopian fantasy--a vision full of joy, wonder, frustration, outrage, and hope about aging, medicine, and humanity itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elderhood&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who is, in the author's own words, "an aging, i.e., still-breathing human being."</description>

Reading it is an effective inoculation against the widespread perception of doom that humanity cannot and will not solve the climate crisis. Reported by-effects include increased determination and a sense of grounded hope." --Per Espen Stoknes, Author, &lt;i&gt;What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There's been no real way for ordinary people to get an understanding of what they can do and what impact it can have. There remains no single, comprehensive, reliable compendium of carbon-reduction solutions across sectors. At least until now. . . . The public is hungry for this kind of practical wisdom." --David Roberts, &lt;i&gt;Vox&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is the ideal environmental sciences textbook--only it is too interesting and inspiring to be called a textbook." --Peter Kareiva, Director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the face of widespread fear and apathy, an international coalition of researchers, professionals, and scientists have come together to offer a set of realistic and bold solutions to climate change. One hundred techniques and practices are described here--some are well known; some you may have never heard of. They range from clean energy to educating girls in lower-income countries to land use practices that pull carbon out of the air. The solutions exist, are economically viable, and communities throughout the world are currently enacting them with skill and determination. If deployed collectively on a global scale over the next thirty years, they represent a credible path forward, not just to slow the earth's warming but to reach drawdown, that point in time when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere peak and begin to decline. These measures promise cascading benefits to human health, security, prosperity, and well-being--giving us every reason to see this planetary crisis as an opportunity to create a just and livable world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An automotive and tech world insider investigates the quest to develop and perfect the driverless car—an innovation that promises to be the most disruptive change to our way of life since the smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stand on the brink of a technological revolution. Soon, few of us will own our own automobiles and instead will get around in driverless electric vehicles that we summon with the touch of an app. We will be liberated from driving, prevent over 90% of car crashes, provide freedom of mobility to the elderly and disabled, and decrease our dependence on fossil fuels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autonomy&lt;/em&gt; is the story of the maverick engineers and computer nerds who are creating the revolution. Longtime advisor to the Google Self-Driving Car team and former GM research and development chief Lawrence D. Burns provides the perfectly-timed history of how we arrived at this point, in a character-driven and heavily reported account of the unlikely thinkers who accomplished what billion-dollar automakers never dared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the way 9/11 spurred the U.S. government to set a million-dollar prize for a series of off-road robot races in the Mojave Desert up to the early 2016 stampede to develop driverless technology, &lt;em&gt;Autonomy&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turner that represents a chronicle of the past, diagnosis of the present, and prediction of the future—the ultimate guide to understanding the driverless car and navigating the revolution it sparks.</description>

  <description>‘At no point in history have edible items been so easy to obtain. Humans have always gone out and gathered food, but never before has it been so simple for us to gather anything we want, whenever and wherever we want it, from sachets of squid ink to strawberries in winter.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does it no longer seem odd that we’re able to eat sushi in Italy and Neapolitan pizza in Dubai?&lt;p&gt;What has happened to the food we eat to make this possible, and how have these blurred boundaries influenced cultural development, as well as national appetites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From bananas and grapes to ultra-processed snacks, we may not spend enough time thinking about the origins of the food we’re eating, or how their ingredients might have altered over time. In&lt;em&gt; The Way We Eat Now&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson examines the current food climate, exploring how we have found ourselves here, and at what potential cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Way We Eat Now&lt;/em&gt; also introduces us to the countries and communities that are making revolutionary efforts towards improving their populations’ relationship with food, and considers how we too might re-establish a more balanced connection with what, as well as how, we eat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From two leaders of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, a bold, contrarian guide to retiring at any age, with a reproducible formula to financial independence&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bull***t-free guide to growing your wealth, retiring early, and living life on your own terms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristy Shen retired with a million dollars at the age of thirty-one, and she did it without hitting a home run on the stock market, starting the next Snapchat in her garage, or investing in hot real estate. Learn how to cut down on spending without decreasing your quality of life, build a million-dollar portfolio, fortify your investments to survive bear markets and black-swan events, and use the 4 percent rule and the Yield Shield--so you can quit the rat race forever. Not everyone can become an entrepreneur or a real estate baron; the rest of us need Shen's mathematically proven approach to retire decades before sixty-five.</description>

  <description>Perpetually awkward Nima Kumara-Clark is bored with her insular community of Bridgeton, in love with her straight girlfriend, and trying to move past her mother’s unexpected departure. After a bewildering encounter at a local festival, Nima finds herself suddenly immersed in the drag scene on the other side of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macho drag kings, magical queens, new love interests, and surprising allies propel Nima both painfully and hilariously closer to a self she never knew she could be—one that can confidently express and accept love. But she’ll have to learn to accept &lt;i&gt;lost&lt;/i&gt; love to get there.</description>

  <description>Happy Mind, Happy Life&lt;br /&gt;From the Wall Street Journal bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Unlimited Memory&lt;/i&gt; comes a new book on finding happiness in life using the power of your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for happiness is fundamental for all humans, and the answers lie within the depths of your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is happiness? What causes it? How do you hold onto it? What makes it go away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These questions have led to many philosophical debates over thousands of years. The philosophers of Greece were famous for their quest to define the pillars of "the good life." Faith-based movements have painstakingly crafted dogmas and prescribed behaviors in pursuit of ultimate peace and joy. Academic studies have been concentrated on finding the answer to "the optimal life experience."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Governments have professed to craft policies to promote the overall well-being of their citizens. Every day, ordinary dinner table discussions are, at heart, a dialogue in search of a happy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happiness is Unique to You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes one person happy may make another miserable. There is no one key to happiness for everyone. Instead, the answers lie within you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Happy Mind&lt;/i&gt;, you'll learn to find your own personal answers to your most important questions. What makes you happy? What changes can you make to bring more happiness into your life? And how can you let go of old habits, beliefs, and situations that no longer fulfill you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim of this book is not to push a specific definition of happiness. Instead, you'll discover valuable insights that will allow you to create lasting happiness instead of being driven by short-term pleasure-seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book you will learn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How people look for happiness in all the wrong places, and how you can avoid these "happiness traps" that keep you stuck and unfulfilled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why most people mistake pleasure for happiness, and how this simple mistake causes you to lose sight of what really matters to you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The nine common qualities that super happy people share (and how you can apply them to brighten up your life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The key traits of unhappiness (and the most important behaviors you should avoid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Many easy-to-grasp suggestions that can be viewed daily to enhance your capacity to live a happy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give Yourself the Gift of The Happy Mind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Happy Mind is your roadmap to living a happy life, custom-designed just for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scroll up and click the "Buy Now" button to get started.</description>

  <description>We all want our students to feel safe, collaborate well with others, feel ownership for their learning, and be joyfully engaged in their work. Nevertheless, many teachers end up using language patterns that undermine these goals. Do any of these scenarios sound familiar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want students to take responsibility for their learning, yet we use language that implies teacher ownership.&lt;br /&gt;We want to build positive relationships with students, yet we use sarcasm when we get frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;We want students to think learning is fun, yet we sometimes make comments that suggest the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;We want students to exhibit good behavior because it's the right thing to do, yet we rely on threats and bribes, which implies students don't naturally want to be good.&lt;br /&gt;What teachers say to students--when they praise or discipline, give directions or ask questions, and introduce concepts or share stories--affects student learning and behavior. A slight change in intonation can also dramatically change how language feels for students. In &lt;em&gt;What We Say and How We Say It Matter, &lt;/em&gt; Mike Anderson digs into the nuances of language in the classroom. This book's many examples will help teachers examine their language habits and intentionally improve their classroom practice so their language matches and supports their goals.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;This riveting narrative explores the lives of six remarkable female pharaohs, from Hatshepsut to Cleopatra--women who ruled with real power--and shines a piercing light on our own perceptions of women in power today.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Female rulers are a rare phenomenon--but thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt, women reigned supreme. Regularly, repeatedly, and with impunity, queens like Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, and Cleopatra controlled the totalitarian state as power-brokers and rulers. But throughout human history, women in positions of power were more often used as political pawns in a male-dominated society. What was so special about ancient Egypt that provided women this kind of access to the highest political office? What was it about these women that allowed them to transcend patriarchal obstacles? What did Egypt gain from its liberal reliance on female leadership, and could today's world learn from its example?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrated Egyptologist Kara Cooney delivers a fascinating tale of female power, exploring the reasons why it has seldom been allowed through the ages, and why we should care.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Jon Gordon and rising star Damon West comes &lt;i&gt;The Coffee Bean&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;an illustrated fable that teaches readers how to transform their environment, overcome challenges, and create positive change.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is often difficult. It can be harsh, stressful, and feel like a pot of boiling hot water. The environments we find ourselves in can change, weaken, or harden us, and test who we truly are. We can be like the carrot that weakens in the pot or like the egg that hardens. Or, we can be like the coffee bean and discover the power inside us to transform our environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Coffee Bean &lt;/i&gt;is an inspiring tale that follows Abe, a young man filled with stress and fear as he faces challenges and pressure at school and home. One day after class, his teacher shares with him the life-changing lesson of the coffee bean, and this powerful message changes the way he thinks, acts, and sees the world. Abe discovers that instead of letting his environment change him for the worse, he can transform any environment he is in for the better. Equipped with this transformational truth, Abe embarks on an inspirational journey to live his life like the coffee bean. Wherever his life takes him, from school, to the military, to the business world, Abe demonstrates how this simple lesson can unleash the unstoppable power within you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delightful, quick read, &lt;i&gt;The Coffee Bean&lt;/i&gt; is purposely written and designed for readers of all ages so that everyone can benefit from this transformational lesson. This is a book and message that, when read and shared, has the power to change your life and the world around you. You just have to decide: are you a carrot, egg, or coffee bean?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a preeminent historian of Eastern Europe, the definitive history of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of April 26, 1986, Europe witnessed the worst nuclear disaster in history: the explosion of a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine. Dozens died of radiation poisoning, fallout contaminated half the continent, and thousands fell ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/i&gt;, Serhii Plokhy draws on new sources to tell the dramatic stories of the firefighters, scientists, and soldiers who heroically extinguished the nuclear inferno. He lays bare the flaws of the Soviet nuclear industry, tracing the disaster to the authoritarian character of Communist party rule, the regime's control of scientific information, and its emphasis on economic development over all else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the risk of another Chernobyl looms in the mismanagement of nuclear power in the developing world. A moving and definitive account, &lt;i&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/i&gt; is also an urgent call to action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>One of the start-up world’s most in-demand executive coaches - hailed as the “CEO Whisperer” (Gimlet Media) - reveals why radical self-inquiry is critical to professional success and healthy relationships in all realms of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Colonna helps start-up CEOs make peace with their demons, the psychological habits and behavioral patterns that have helped them to succeed - molding them into highly accomplished individuals - yet have been detrimental to their relationships and ultimate well-being. Now, this venture capitalist turned executive coach shares his unusual yet highly effective blend of Buddhism, Jungian therapy, and entrepreneurial straight talk to help leaders overcome their own psychological traumas. Reboot is a journey of radical self-inquiry, helping you to reset your life by sorting through the emotional baggage that is holding you back professionally and, even more important, in your relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry has taught CEOs and their top teams to realize their potential by using the raw material of their lives to find meaning, to build healthy interpersonal bonds, and to become more compassionate and bold leaders. In Reboot, he inspires everyone to hold themselves responsible for their choices and for the possibility of truly achieving their dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work does not have to destroy us. Work can be the way in which we achieve our fullest self, Jerry firmly believes. What we need, sometimes, is a chance to reset our goals and to reconnect with our deepest selves and with each other. Reboot moves and empowers us to begin this journey.</description>

  <description>What is understanding and how does it differ from knowledge? How can we determine the big ideas worth understanding? Why is understanding an important teaching goal, and how do we know when students have attained it? How can we create a rigorous and engaging curriculum that focuses on understanding and leads to improved student performance in today s high-stakes, standards-based environment?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and many other questions in this second edition of Understanding by Design. Drawing on feedback from thousands of educators around the world who have used the UbD framework since its introduction in 1998, the authors have revised and expanded their original work to guide educators across the K16 spectrum in the design of curriculum, assessment, and instruction. With an improved UbD Template at its core, the book explains the rationale of backward design and explores in greater depth the meaning of such key ideas as essential questions and transfer tasks. Readers will learn why the familiar coverage- and activity-based approaches to curriculum design fall short, and how a focus on the six facets of understanding can enrich student learning. With an expanded array of practical strategies, tools, and examples from all subject areas, the book demonstrates how the research-based principles of &lt;i&gt;Understanding by Design&lt;/i&gt; apply to district frameworks as well as to individual units of curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining provocative ideas, thoughtful analysis, and tested approaches, &lt;i&gt;Understanding by Design&lt;/i&gt;, Expanded 2nd Edition, offers teacher-designers a clear path to the creation of curriculum that ensures better learning and a more stimulating experience for students and teachers alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The lack of teaching cases in program evaluation is often cited as a gap in the field. This ground-breaking book fills this gap, covering the essentials of program evaluation as it is used in education and with a wide variety of evaluation projects to be discussed, analyzed, and reflected upon. The book covers the essentials of program evaluation, including foundation and types of evaluation, tools for collecting data, writing of reports, and sharing of findings. Individual cases cover classroom instruction, community-based program, teacher training, professional development, a secondary-school based program, after-school program, reading achievement, school-improvement grant, and confidentiality. Each case is structured to include learning objectives, program description, evaluation plan, summary of evaluation activities and findings, key concepts, discussion questions, class activities, and suggested reading. As useful for students as it is for evaluators in training, Program Evaluation in Practice is a must-have for those aspiring to become effective evaluators.</description>

  <description>Strong, sassy, always surprising—and titled after a &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; “Weekend Update” monologue by Tina Fey—&lt;em&gt;Bitch Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt; is a deliciously addictive memoir-in-essays in which Helena Andrews goes from being the daughter of the town lesbian to a hot-shot political reporter… all while trying to answer the question, “can a strong, single, and successful black woman ever find love?” Fans of Sloane Crosley (&lt;em&gt;I Was Told There’d Be Cake&lt;/em&gt;) will love the bold and brassy &lt;em&gt;Bitch Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>The challenges of working in an urban school are not for every teacher. Some get burnt out fast. Some lose sight of why they started teaching in the first place. Some find their calling in other neighborhoods...with other kids. But not Salome Thomas-El. A Teacher at Roberts Vaux Middle School in Philadelphia's inner city, he chose to stay. Gripping, poignant, and homest, this is his blistering real-life tale of mentoring and making a difference—and how the reformation of America's educational system can start with just one school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;I Choose To Stay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"An intensely moving story of loyalty and courage and a deeply pewrsonal tribute to the great potential of our inner-city kids, so frequently dismissed and denigrated by American society. The redemptive power of a teacher's love shines through these pages with prophetic grace. I am grateful to the author for the lesson of essential decency he teaches us" --Jonathan Kozol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This book is about courage. It is a story about determination, about compassion, love and the ultimate fight. This is the fight against the odds, against the 'system' and years of cultural, social and economic factors that would have allowed this group of inner-city kids to become nothing more than a set of statistics. But Salome Thomas-El would not let that happen. He would not give up. He saw the potential in them and he fought for them. he used a board game as a weapon in this figth." --From the forward by Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A powerful story about what an inspirational teacher can do to open new horizons for economically disadvantaged young people" --William H. Gray, III, President, United Negro College Fund&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This book shows how one dedicated educator who believes in th potential of all our kids can make a huge difference and how, under teh proper circumstances, urban education can work." --Edward G. Rendell, former mayor of Philadelphia, Chairman of the Democratic National Convention&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An eloquent example of how commitment and innovation can better the lives of inner-city children." --&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>This much acclaimed text has been fully updated to incorporate the latest advances in the field. As leading authorities on adult education and training, Elwood Holton and Dick Swanson have revised this edition building on the work of the late Malcolm Knolwes. Keeping to the practical format of the last edition, this book is divided into three parts. The first part contains the classic chapters that describe the roots and principles of andragogy, including a new chapter, which presents Knowles program planning model. The second part focuses on the advancements in adult learning with each chapter fully revised updated, incorporating a major expansion of Androgogy in Practice. The last part of the book will contain an updated selection of topical readings that advance the theory and will include the HRD style inventory developed by Dr. Knowles. This new edition is essential reading for adult learning practitioners and students and HRD professionals. It provides a theoretical framework for understanding the adult learning issues both in the teaching and workplace environments.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Global Issues and Adult Education&lt;/i&gt;brings together seven years of cutting-edge research and analysis from the Cyril O. Houle Scholars in Adult and Continuing Education. These emerging leaders in the field investigate the importance of adult education in responding to the challenges of global issues. The book is divided into five sections, each of which examines one overarching topic--globalization and the market economy, marginalized populations, environment and health, community empowerment, and lifelong learning and educational systems. Each section begins with an introduction that provides a framework for understanding the overarching issues and summarizes the chapters in the section.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Michael Wolff, author of the bombshell bestseller &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury&lt;/i&gt;, once again takes us inside the Trump presidency to reveal a White House under siege.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Fire and Fury&lt;/i&gt;, Michael Wolff defined the first phase of the Trump administration; now, in Siege, he has written an equally essential and explosive book about a presidency that is under fire from almost every side. A stunningly fresh narrative that begins just as Trump’s second year as president is getting underway and ends with the delivery of the Mueller report, Siege reveals an administration that is perpetually beleaguered by investigations and a president who is increasingly volatile, erratic, and exposed.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;This text offers a brief, but comprehensive overview of qualitative research that balances the practicalities of conducting research and the theory and debates that keep qualitative inquiry vibrant. As faculty and students increasingly turn to qualitative inquiry, they need a text that will not only provide them with an understanding of qualitative research methods, but also open them to the diverse possibilities within this inquiry approach. This text covers the range of possibilities along with numerous exercises that offer beginning students the opportunity to practice and refine the skills of being a qualitative researcher. The wealth of examples in the text is exceptional, as is the accessible writing style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This step-by-step handbook guides beginning researchers through the stages of planning and implementing case studies. Starting with how to establish a rationale for conducting a systematic case study and identifying literature that informs the research effort, this indispensable resource shows students how to determine an appropriate research design and conduct informative interviews, observations and document analyses. It also describes how to derive meaning from data and how to communicate results. Finally, the authors delineate the ways to verify the results attained. Students and advisors can use these easy-to-follow steps to shape a thesis, dissertation, or independent project from conceptualization to completion.</description>

  <description>For courses in Introductory Statistics and Research Methods courses using SPSS. Using SPSS guides students through the most basic of SPSS techniques using step-by-step descriptions, presents statistical techniques and instruction on how to conduct statistical analyses, and explains in detail how to avoid all the obstacles common in the study of statistics. The development of easy-to-use statistical software like SPSS has changed the way statistics is being taught and learned. Students can make transformations of variables, create graphs of distributions of variables, and select among statistical analyses all at the click of a button. However, even with these advancements, students sometimes still find statistics to be an arduous task. They continue to be faced with many potential obstacles and they might feel overwhelmed and stressed rather than challenged and excited about the potential for mastering these important skills. Samuel Green and Neil Salkind have written a text to specifically address these issues.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form. You've got to have models in your head."&lt;br /&gt;- Charlie Munger, investor, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world's greatest problem-solvers, forecasters, and decision-makers all rely on a set of frameworks and shortcuts that help them cut through complexity and separate good ideas from bad ones. They're called mental models, and you can find them in dense textbooks on psychology, physics, economics, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, you can just read Super Thinking, a fun, illustrated guide to every mental model you could possibly need. How can mental models help you? Well, here are just a few examples...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • If you've ever been overwhelmed by a to-do list that's grown too long, maybe you need the &lt;b&gt;Eisenhower Decision Matrix&lt;/b&gt; to help you prioritize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • Use the &lt;b&gt;5 Whys&lt;/b&gt; model to better understand people's motivations or get to the root cause of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • Before concluding that your colleague who messes up your projects is out to sabotage you, consider &lt;b&gt;Hanlon's Razor&lt;/b&gt; for an alternative explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • Ever sat through a bad movie just because you paid a lot for the ticket? You might be falling prey to &lt;b&gt;Sunk Cost Fallacy&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • Set up &lt;b&gt;Forcing Functions&lt;/b&gt;, like standing meeting or deadlines, to help grease the wheels for changes you want to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the next time you find yourself faced with a difficult decision or just trying to understand a complex situation, let Super Thinking upgrade your brain with mental models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: in the US the subtitle is The Big Book of Mental Models and outside it is Upgrade Your Reasoning and Make Better Decisions with Mental Models.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a preeminent presidential historian comes a groundbreaking and often surprising narrative of America’s wartime chief executives&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It sometimes seems, in retrospect, as if America has been almost continuously at war. Ten years in the research and writing, &lt;i&gt;Presidents of War&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, magisterial, intimate look at a procession of American leaders as they took the nation into conflict and mobilized their country for victory. It brings us into the room as they make the most difficult decisions that face any President, at times sending hundreds of thousands of American men and women to their deaths. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From James Madison and the War of 1812 to recent times, we see them struggling with Congress, the courts, the press, their own advisors and antiwar protesters; seeking comfort from their spouses, families and friends; and dropping to their knees in prayer. We come to understand how these Presidents were able to withstand the pressures of war—both physically and emotionally—or were broken by them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beschloss’s interviews with surviving participants in the drama and his discoveries in original letters, diaries, once-classified national security documents, and other sources help him to tell this story in a way it has not been told before. &lt;i&gt;Presidents of War&lt;/i&gt; combines the sense of being there with the overarching context of two centuries of American history. This important book shows how far we have traveled from the time of our Founders, who tried to constrain presidential power, to our modern day, when a single leader has the potential to launch nuclear weapons that can destroy much of the human race.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A practical and irreverent guide to taking the sting out of feedback and reclaiming it as a motivating, empowering experience for everyone involved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback: the mere mention of the word can make our blood pressure rise and our defenses go up. For many of us, it's a dirty word that we associate with bias, politics, resentment, and self-doubt. However, if we take a step back and think about its true intent, we realize that feedback needn't be a bad thing. After all, understanding how others experience us provides valuable opportunities to learn and grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors M. Tamra Chandler and Laura Grealish explain how feedback got such a bad rap and how to recognize and minimize the negative physical and emotional responses that can erode trust and shut down communication. They offer a new and more ambitious definition of feedback, explore the roles we each play as Seeker, Extender, and Receiver, and introduce the three Fs of making feedback focused, fair, and frequent. You'll also find valuable exercises and strategies, along with real-world examples that illustrate how you can put these ideas into action and join in the movement to fix feedback, once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it's done right, feedback has been proven to be the most effective means of improving communication and performance for you and your organization. It's too important to give up, and with Chandler and Grealish's help, you'll be able to use it deftly, equitably, and effectively.</description>

  <description>The age-old question for every leader--how do we bring out the best in those we lead? Anyone who has run a company, raised a family, lead an army, or coached a team struggles to find the key to help others excel and realize their potential. It is surprising how often we resort to criticism vs. an approach that actually results in a better worker and a better person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if we could speak &lt;i&gt;Words of Life&lt;/i&gt; that transform those under our influence and ignite fires of intrinsic motivation? What if those we lead found great purpose in what they do and worked at their jobs with all their heart? Isn't that what leaders, parents and teachers really want? Ultimately, don't we hope to foster intrinsic motivation so that the individuals we lead become better employees, better students or better athletes? Recent discoveries of brain science and the wisdom of top CEO's that Dr. Tim Irwin interviewed for this book give us the answers we've long sought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most organizations, the methods used to provide feedback to employees such as performance appraisal or multi-rater feedback systems&lt;i&gt;, in fact, accomplish the exact opposite of what we intend. &lt;/i&gt;We inadvertently speak &lt;i&gt;Words of Death.&lt;/i&gt; Brain science tells us that these methods tend to engage a natural "negativity bias" that is hardwired in us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science in recent years discovered that affirmation sets in motion huge positive changes in the brain. It releases certain neuro chemicals associated with well-being and higher performance. Amazingly, criticism creates just the opposite neural reaction. The most primitive part of the brain goes into hyper defense mode, compromising our performance, torpedoing our motivation and limiting access to our higher-order strengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we redirect employees who are out-of-line without engaging our natural "negativity bias?" Leaders must forever ban the term, "Constructive Criticism." Brain science tells us that we can establish a connection between the &lt;i&gt;employee's work and his or her aspirations.&lt;/i&gt; This book calls for a new approach to align workers with an organization's mission, strategy and goals, called &lt;i&gt;Alliance Feedback.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The stunning story of an Alabama serial killer and the true-crime book that Harper Lee worked on obsessively in the years after To Kill a Mockingbird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reverend Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim. Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell’s murderer was acquitted–thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the audience during the vigilante’s trial was Harper Lee, who had traveled from New York City to her native Alabama with the idea of writing her own In Cold Blood, the true-crime classic she had helped her friend Truman Capote research seventeen years earlier. Lee spent a year in town reporting, and many more working on her own version of the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Casey Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders to the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South.</description>

  <description>Here is the first volume in George R. R. Martin’s magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GAME OF THRONES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;source: georgerrmartin.com</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A newer edition of this book can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48675438-why-we-get-the-wrong-politicians" rel="nofollow"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politicians are consistently voted the least trusted professional group by the UK public. They've recently become embroiled in scandals concerning sexual harassment and expenses. Every year, they introduce new legislation that doesn't do what it sets out to achieve - often with terrible financial and human costs. But, with some notable exceptions, they are decent, hard-working people, doing a hugely difficult and demanding job. &lt;p&gt;In this searching examination of our political class, award-winning journalist Isabel Hardman tries to square this circle. She lifts the lid on the strange world of Westminster and asks why we end up with representatives with whom we are so unhappy. Filled with forensic analysis and revealing reportage, this landmark and accessible book is a must read for anyone who wants to see a future with better government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>Selected by the &lt;i&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/i&gt; as one of the "hundred most influential books since the war"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the threat it poses to individual freedom? In this classic book, Milton Friedman provides the definitive statement of his immensely influential economic philosophy—one in which competitive capitalism serves as both a device for achieving economic freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom. The result is an accessible text that has sold well over half a million copies in English, has been translated into eighteen languages, and shows every sign of becoming more and more influential as time goes on.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In&lt;i&gt; The Growth OS&lt;/i&gt;, startup guru David Kidder and the Bionic Team reveal their blueprint for helping companies recapture their growth skills--by funding a portfolio of startups and monitoring their progress to encourage entrepreneurship within companies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When David Kidder was invited to speak at GE's annual leadership conference in 2012, he yelled down to chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt, "How many $50 million companies did you launch last year?" The answer was zero. But Immelt, rather than being angry or offended at the interruption, candidly said to his teams, "That was the most important question in the thirty-seven years of this conference."&lt;br /&gt; The fact is, as Kidder shows in &lt;i&gt;The Growth OS&lt;/i&gt;, entrenched thinking and outdated bureaucracy is at war with new ideas. Yet, of the top five companies by market cap in 2001, only Microsoft remains in 2016. Traditional companies have tumbled off the list.&lt;br /&gt; To think like a scaled startup, companies today need to look for markets that haven't been discovered or created yet.&lt;br /&gt;They need to identify a customer problem and work backward from the outside in to discover a business model for that solution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Growth OS&lt;/i&gt; is designed to instill the mindsets, methods, and tools that veteran venture investors and experienced entrepreneurs use to discover the future in the face of the unknowable. But even most bets placed by VC's fail, more than 80 percent of the time. That is why you need a portfolio of investments and a growth board to measure the progress of each business, only continuing to fund those that show validated progress.</description>

  <description>This monograph is focused on educating faculty and administrators about the developmental issues faced by students from different racial, ethnic, or other social groupings as they attempt to define themselves during the college years and the ways this information can enhance campus classrooms, programs, and policies. Although there is a growing body of work on how various racial, ethnic, gender and other social groups develop their identity, there has been limited synthesis or application of this literature to the practice of professionals in higher education. The authors have higher education administrative backgrounds, so their recommendations are grounded in experience, and each also has a solid record of scholarship in identity development. The combined scholarly and administrative experience of the three authors enhances the contribution of this book.</description>

  <description>This book provides a concise introduction to the practical and theoretical complexities of studying urban youth culture today. Looking across disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, and education, Dimitriadis explores the ways urban youth have been framed - in often limiting and problematic ways - in the popular and academic imagination. Moving beyond critique alone, this highly accessible primer opens a discussion about what a truly powerful, emergent field of �critical youth studies� might look like. Looking toward the future of this field, this book discusses the most important methodological and substantive trends and issues scholars will be addressing now and in the years to come. The &lt;i&gt;Studying Urban Youth Culture Primer&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensable text for students in a range of qualitative methods and urban education courses.</description>

  <description>Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles?&lt;p&gt;Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house "spark joy" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Rainbow Fish is missing! Where can he be? Children will enjoy this sweet story about the search for Rainbow Fish. They'll have fun assembling the 9 puzzle pieces (take one from each spread) to create a beautiful picture of Rainbow Fish's undersea world. And they'll be challenged to find the subtle difference between each puzzle piece and the almost identical picture beneath it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Common—the Grammy Award, Academy Award, and Golden Globe–winning musician, actor, and activist—follows up his &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling memoir &lt;i&gt;One Day It’ll All Make Sense&lt;/i&gt; with this inspiring exploration of how love and mindfulness can build communities and allow you to take better control of your life through actions and words.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common believes that the phrase "let love have the last word" is not just a declaration; it is a statement of purpose, a daily promise. Love is the most powerful force on the planet and ultimately, the way you love determines who you are and how you experience life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touching on God, self-love, partners, children, family, and community, Common explores the core tenets of love to help others understand what it means to receive and, most important, to give love. He moves from the personal—writing about his daughter, to whom he wants to be a better father—to the universal, where he observes that our society has become fractured under issues of race and politics. He knows there's no quick remedy for all of the hurt in the world, but love—for yourself and for others—is where the healing begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courageous, insightful, brave, and characteristically authentic, &lt;i&gt;Let Love Have the Last Word&lt;/i&gt; shares Common’s own unique and personal stories of the people and experiences that have led to a greater understanding of love and all it has to offer. It is a powerful call to action for a new generation of open hearts and minds, one that is sure to resonate for years to come.</description>

  <description>We use money to solve our everyday problems, and it generally works well. Despite its economic benefits, however, money has a psychological downside: it trains us to think about negotiations narrow-mindedly, leading us to negotiate badly. Suggesting that we need a non-monetary mindset to negotiate better, &lt;i&gt;The Bartering Mindset &lt;/i&gt;shows us how to look outside the monetary economy - to the bartering economies of the past, where people traded what they had for what they needed. The book argues that, because of the economic difficulties associated with bartering, barterers had to use a more sophisticated form of negotiation - a strategic approach that can make us master negotiators today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book immerses readers in the assumptions made by barterers, collectively referred to as the "bartering mindset," and then demonstrates how to apply this mindset to modern, monetary negotiations. &lt;i&gt;The Bartering Mindset &lt;/i&gt;concludes that our individual, organizational, and social problems fester for a predictable reason: we apply a monetary mindset to our negotiations, leading to suboptimal thinking, counterproductive behaviors, and disappointing outcomes. By offering the bartering mindset as an alternative, this book will help people negotiate better and thrive.</description>

  <description>An ALA Notable Children's Book, &lt;em&gt;Honey, I Love and Other Love Poems&lt;/em&gt; includes sixteen poems that tell of love and the simple joys of everyday life, seen through the eyes of a child: playing with a friend, skipping rope, riding on a train—or keeping Mama company till Daddy gets back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of these sixteen "love poems" is spoken straight from the perspective of a child. Riding on a train, listening to music, playing with a friend...each poem elicits a new appreciation of the rich content of everyday life. The poems are accompanied by both portrait and panorama drawings that deepen the insights contained in the words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beloved book of poetry is a &lt;em&gt;Reading Rainbow&lt;/em&gt; Selection and the winner of George C. Stone Center for Children's Books' Recognition of Merit Award.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Proust and the Squid&lt;/em&gt; follows up with a lively, ambitious, and deeply informative book that considers the future of the reading brain and our capacity for critical thinking, empathy, and reflection as we become increasingly dependent on digital technologies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade ago, Maryanne Wolf’s &lt;em&gt;Proust and the Squid&lt;/em&gt; revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing deeply on this research, this book comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us—her beloved readers—to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital mediums. Wolf raises difficult questions, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will children learn to incorporate the full range of "deep reading" processes that are at the core of the expert reading brain?&lt;br /&gt;Will the mix of a seemingly infinite set of distractions for children’s attention and their quick access to immediate, voluminous information alter their ability to think for themselves?&lt;br /&gt;With information at their fingertips, will the next generation learn to build their own storehouse of knowledge, which could impede the ability to make analogies and draw inferences from what they know?&lt;br /&gt;Will all these influences, in turn, change the formation in children and the use in adults of "slower" cognitive processes like critical thinking, personal reflection, imagination, and empathy that comprise deep reading and that influence both how we think and how we live our lives?&lt;br /&gt;Will the chain of digital influences ultimately influence the use of the critical analytical and empathic capacities necessary for a democratic society?&lt;br /&gt;How can we preserve deep reading processes in future iterations of the reading brain?&lt;br /&gt;Who are the "good readers" of every epoch?&lt;br /&gt;Concerns about attention span, critical reasoning, and over-reliance on technology are never just about children—Wolf herself has found that, though she is a reading expert, her ability to read deeply has been impacted as she has become, inevitably, increasingly dependent on screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf draws on neuroscience, literature, education, technology, and philosophy and blends historical, literary, and scientific facts with down-to-earth examples and warm anecdotes to illuminate complex ideas that culminate in a proposal for a biliterate reading brain. Provocative and intriguing, &lt;em&gt;Reader, Come Home&lt;/em&gt; is a roadmap that provides a cautionary but hopeful perspective on the impact of technology on our brains and our most essential intellectual capacities—and what this could mean for our future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are venture capitalists saying about your startup behind closed doors? And what can you do to influence that conversation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Silicon Valley is the greatest wealth-generating machine in the world, Sand Hill Road is its humming engine. That's where you'll find the biggest names in venture capital, including famed VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, where lawyer-turned-entrepreneur-turned-VC Scott Kupor serves as managing partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you're trying to get a new company off the ground or scale an existing business to the next level, you need to understand how VCs think. In &lt;i&gt;Secrets of Sand Hill Road&lt;/i&gt;, Kupor explains exactly how VCs decide where and how much to invest, and how entrepreneurs can get the best possible deal and make the most of their relationships with VCs. Kupor explains, for instance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Why most VCs typically invest in only one startup in a given business category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Why the skill you need most when raising venture capital is the ability to tell a compelling story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- How to handle a "down round," when startups have to raise funds at a lower valuation than in the previous round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- What to do when VCs get too entangled in the day-to-day operations of the business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Why you need to build relationships with potential acquirers long before you decide to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with Kupor's firsthand experiences, insider advice, and practical takeaways, &lt;i&gt;Secrets of Sand Hill Road&lt;/i&gt; is the guide every entrepreneur needs to turn their startup into the next unicorn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Research Shows Organizations That Focus on Employee Experience Far Outperform Those That Don't&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently a new type of organization has emerged, one that focuses on employee experiences as a way to drive innovation, increase customer satisfaction, find and hire the best people, make work more engaging, and improve overall performance. &lt;i&gt;The Employee Experience Advantage&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of its kind to tackle this emerging topic that is becoming the #1 priority for business leaders around the world. Although everyone talks about employee experience nobody has really been able to explain concretely what it is and how to go about designing for it...until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can organizations truly create a place where employees want to show up to work versus need to show up to work? For decades the business world has focused on measuring employee engagement meanwhile global engagement scores remain at an all time low despite all the surveys and institutes that been springing up tackle this problem. Clearly something is not working. Employee engagement has become the short-term adrenaline shot that organizations turn to when they need to increase their engagement scores. Instead, we have to focus on designing employee experiences which is the long term organizational design that leads to engaged employees. This is the only long-term solution. Organizations have been stuck focusing on the cause instead of the effect. The cause is employee experience; the effect is an engaged workforce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backed by an extensive research project that looked at over 150 studies and articles, featured extensive interviews with over 150 executives, and analyzed over 250 global organizations, this book clearly breaks down the three environments that make up every single employee experience at every organization around the world and how to design for them. These are the cultural, technological, and physical environments. This book explores the attributes that organizations need to focus on in each one of these environments to create COOL spaces, ACE technology, and a CELEBRATED culture. Featuring exclusive case studies, unique frameworks, and never before seen research, &lt;i&gt;The Employee Experience Advantage&lt;/i&gt; guides readers on a journey of creating a place where people actually want to show up to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers will learn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trends shaping employee experience&lt;br /&gt;How to evaluate their own employee experience using the Employee Experience Score&lt;br /&gt;What the world's leading organizations are doing around employee experience&lt;br /&gt;How to design for technology, culture, and physical spaces&lt;br /&gt;The role people analytics place in employee experience&lt;br /&gt;Frameworks for how to actually create employee experiences&lt;br /&gt;The role of the gig economy&lt;br /&gt;The future of employee experience&lt;br /&gt;Nine types of organizations that focus on employee experience&lt;br /&gt;And much more! There is no question that engaged employees perform better, aspire higher, and achieve more, but you can't create employee engagement without designing employee experiences first. It's time to rethink your strategy and implement a real-world framework that focuses on how to create an organization where people want to show up to work. &lt;i&gt;The Employee Experience Advantage&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to do just that.</description>

  <description>Shakespeare may have written &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt; as the first of his plays to be performed at the Globe, in 1599. For it, he turned to a key event in Roman history: Caesar’s death at the hands of friends and fellow politicians. Renaissance writers disagreed over the assassination, seeing Brutus, a leading conspirator, as either hero or villain. Shakespeare’s play keeps this debate alive.</description>

Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. &lt;br /&gt;Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. &lt;br /&gt;Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. &lt;br /&gt;Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. &lt;br /&gt;Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. &lt;br /&gt;Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. &lt;br /&gt;Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. &lt;br /&gt;Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. Stephen R. Covey is the most respected motivator in the business world today.

  <description>About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the National Magazine Award-winning &lt;i&gt;Runner’s World&lt;/i&gt; columnist, frequent &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; online contributor, and Cambridge-trained physicist: a fascinating and definitive exploration of the extraordinary science of human endurance and the secrets of human performance, for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Born to Run&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Grit&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we’re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person’s limits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. &lt;i&gt;Endure&lt;/i&gt; widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It’s the brain that dictates how far we can go—which means we can always push ourselves further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hutchinson presents an overview of science’s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs’ legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals—whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid—and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology—brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging—and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance—and get the most out of their bodies.</description>

  <description>Staring unflinchingly into the abyss of slavery, this spellbinding novel transforms history into a story as powerful as Exodus and as intimate as a lullaby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sethe was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free. She has too many memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where so many hideous things happened. Her new home is haunted by the ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with bitter poetry and suspense as taut as a rope, &lt;i&gt;Beloved&lt;/i&gt; is a towering achievement by Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison.</description>

  <description>'An act of consummate literary bravery, a writer known for her clarity allowing us to watch her mind as it becomes clouded with grief.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of America's iconic writers, a stunning book of electric honesty and passion. Joan Didion explores an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage–and a life, in good times and bad–that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill with what seemed at first flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later–the night before New Year's Eve–the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of forty years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powerful book is Didion's attempt to make sense of the "weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness . . . about marriage and children and memory . . . about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself."</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/i&gt; is Toni Morrison's first novel, a book heralded for its richness of language and boldness of vision. Set in the author's girlhood hometown of Lorain, Ohio, it tells the story of black, eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be as beautiful and beloved as all the blond, blue-eyed children in America. In the autumn of 1941, the year the marigolds in the Breedloves' garden do not bloom. Pecola's life does change- in painful, devastating ways.&lt;br /&gt;What its vivid evocation of the fear and loneliness at the heart of a child's yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment. &lt;i&gt;The Bluest Eye&lt;/i&gt; remains one of Tony Morrisons's most powerful, unforgettable novels- and a significant work of American fiction.</description>

  <description>In this seminal book on helping, corporate culture and organizational development guru Ed Schein analyzes the dynamics of helping relationships, explains why help is often not helpful, and shows what any would-be-helper must do to insure that help is actually provided.Many words are used for helping -- assisting, aiding, advising, coaching, consulting, counseling, supporting, teaching, and many more -- but they all have common dynamics and processes. Schein exposes and shows how to resolve the inequities and role ambiguities of helping relationships, describes the different roles that helpers can take once the relationship is balanced, and explains how to build a balanced relationship and how to intervene as that relationship develops. In this short but profound book Schein examines the social dynamics that are at play in helping relationships in order to better understand why offers of help are sometimes refused or resented, and how to make help more helpful.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A dazzlingly erudite synthesis of history, philosophy, anthropology, genetics, sociology, economics, epidemiology, statistics, and more" (Frank Bruni, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Blueprint&lt;/i&gt; shows how and why evolution has placed us on a humane path -- and how we are united by our common humanity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For too long, scientists have focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for aggression, cruelty, prejudice, and self-interest. But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all our inventions -- our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations -- we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society. &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Blueprint&lt;/i&gt;, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide. &lt;br /&gt;With many vivid examples -- including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own -- Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness. &lt;br /&gt;In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it's tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, &lt;i&gt;Blueprint &lt;/i&gt;shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies have shaped, and are still shaping, our genes today.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/em&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"If you’ve ever wondered how you have the capacity to wonder, some fascinating insights await you in these pages.” --Adam Grant, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Originals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As concise and enlightening as &lt;em&gt;Seven Brief Lessons on Physics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Astrophysics for People in a Hurry&lt;/em&gt;, this mind-expanding dive into the mystery of consciousness is an illuminating meditation on the self, free will, and felt experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is consciousness? How does it arise? And why does it exist? We take our experience of being in the world for granted. But the very existence of consciousness raises profound questions: Why would any collection of matter in the universe be conscious? How are we able to think about this? And why should we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this wonderfully accessible book, Annaka Harris guides us through the evolving definitions, philosophies, and scientific findings that probe our limited understanding of consciousness. Where does it reside, and what gives rise to it? Could it be an illusion, or a universal property of all matter? As we try to understand consciousness, we must grapple with how to define it and, in the age of artificial intelligence, who or what might possess it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conscious &lt;/em&gt;offers lively and challenging arguments that alter our ideas about consciousness—allowing us to think freely about it for ourselves, if indeed we can.</description>

  <description>Crazy Rich Asians is the outrageously funny debut novel about three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich.</description>

  <description>As business leaders, we are so often called to do things: make decisions, fix problems, manage money. But, the irony is, the more we do, the less control we have. Effective leadership requires composition, control, and focus--skills which are all strengthened by learning to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;b&gt;nothing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years of practicing mindful meditation have helped Rob Dubé become an acclaimed entrepreneur, propelling his leadership to new heights. In &lt;i&gt;do&lt;b&gt;nothing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, he shares his experiences with meditation and silent retreats, the wisdom of other business leaders who have established meditation routines, and scientific studies that prove the positive effects of meditation on the mind, body, and heart. He also teaches you how to meditate--the easy part!--and the best ways to turn a daily practice into a lifelong habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time to become the strongest, most efficient, and most mindful leader you can be--and all by embracing the ability to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;b&gt;nothing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>The possibilities are endless in Dr. Seuss’s classic Beginner Book! Young readers will delight in &lt;i&gt;Oh, the Thinks You Can Think! &lt;/i&gt;which celebrates the imagination and encourages young readers to think . . . about thinking! “Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the Thinks you can think up if only you try.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This beautifully illustrated book showcases women who changed the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring 18 trailblazing black women in American history, &lt;i&gt;Dream Big, Little Leader&lt;/i&gt; is the irresistible board book adaptation of &lt;i&gt;Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among these women, you'll find heroes, role models, and everyday women who did extraordinary things -- bold women whose actions and beliefs contributed to making the world better for generations of girls and women to come. Whether they were putting pen to paper, soaring through the air or speaking up for the rights of others, the women profiled in these pages were all taking a stand against a world that didn't always accept them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaders in this book may be little, but they all did something &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; and amazing, inspiring generations to come.</description>

  <description>In this groundbreaking book, the bestselling author of *Parenting from the Inside Out* and *The Whole-Brain Child* shows parents how to turn one of the most challenging developmental periods in their children's lives into one of the most rewarding. Between the ages of 12 and 24, the brain changes in important and often maddening ways. It's no wonder that many parents approach their child's adolescence with fear and trepidation. According to renowned neuropsychiatrist Daniel Siegel, however, if parents and teens can work together to form a deeper understanding of the brain science behind all the tumult, they will be able to turn conflict into connection and form a deeper understanding of one another. In *Brainstorm*, Siegel illuminates how brain development affects teenagers' behaviour and relationships. Drawing on important new research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology, he explores exciting ways in which understanding how the teenage brain functions can help parents make what is in fact an incredibly positive period of growth, change, and experimentation in their children's lives less lonely and distressing on both sides of the generational divide.</description>

  <description>Have you ever wondered why we stop to watch the orange glow that arrives before sunset or why we flock to see cherry blossoms bloom in spring? Is there a reason that people--regardless of gender, age, culture, or ethnicity--are mesmerized by baby animals and can't help but smile when they see a burst of confetti or a cluster of colorful balloons? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are often made to feel that the physical world has little or no impact on our inner joy. Increasingly, experts urge us to find balance and calm by looking inward--through mindfulness or meditation--and muting the outside world. But what if the natural vibrancy of our surroundings is actually our most renewable and easily accessible source of joy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Joyful&lt;/i&gt;, designer Ingrid Fetell Lee explores how the seemingly mundane spaces and objects we interact with every day have surprising and powerful effects on our mood. Drawing on insights from neuroscience and psychology, she explains why one setting makes us feel anxious or competitive while another fosters acceptance and delight--and, most importantly, she reveals how we can harness the power of our surroundings to live fuller, healthier, and truly joyful lives.</description>

In sharing her joys, pitfalls, adventures, self-doubt, and successes, she reminds us that through uncovering and discovering the many facets of ourselves, we are more than enough.”&lt;br /&gt;—Yara Shahidi&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Elaine’s book is a call for young women to find their voice and spark their courage—it’s a book I would have loved to discover as a young woman starting my own career.”&lt;br /&gt;—Reese Witherspoon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this part-manifesto, part-memoir, the revolutionary editor who infused social consciousness into the pages of &lt;i&gt;Teen Vogue&lt;/i&gt; explores what it means to come into your own—on your own terms &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout her life, Elaine Welteroth has climbed the ranks of media and fashion, shattering ceilings along the way. In this riveting and timely memoir, the groundbreaking journalist unpacks lessons on race, identity, and success through her own journey, from navigating her way as the unstoppable child of an unlikely interracial marriage in small-town California to finding herself on the frontlines of a modern movement for the next generation of change makers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welteroth moves beyond the headlines and highlight reels to share the profound lessons and struggles of being a barrier-breaker across so many intersections. As a young boss and often the only Black woman in the room, she’s had enough of the world telling her—and all women—they’re not enough. As she learns to rely on herself by looking both inward and upward, we’re ultimately reminded that we’re more than enough.</description>

  <description>What's the most effective path to success in any domain? It's not what you think. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, &lt;i&gt;Range&lt;/i&gt; makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.</description>

  <description>Mann is only thirteen, yet he has already had to deal with more than most go through in a lifetime. His family is still reeling from the tragic shooting death of his little brother, Jason, each person coping with grief in his or her own way. Mann's mother has stopped eating and is obsessed with preserving Jason's memory, while his father is certain that presenting a hard edge is the only way to keep his remaining son from becoming a statistic. Mann used to paint and ride horseback, but now he's doing everything he can to escape his emotions: getting involved in fights at school, joyriding at midnight, and much worse. His father, at his wit's end, does the only thing he thinks will teach his son how to be a man he abandons him and his friend Kee Lee in the woods, leaving them to navigate their way home, alone.</description>

  <description>Cassandra Bowden is no stranger to hungover mornings. She's a binge drinker, her job with the airline making it easy to find adventure, and the occasional blackouts seem to be inevitable. She lives with them, and the accompanying self-loathing. When she awakes in a Dubai hotel room, she tries to piece the previous night back together, already counting the minutes until she has to catch her crew shuttle to the airport. She quietly slides out of bed, careful not to aggravate her already pounding head, and looks at the man she spent the night with. She sees his dark hair. His utter stillness. And blood, a slick, still wet pool on the crisp white sheets. Afraid to call the police—she's a single woman alone in a hotel room far from home—Cassie begins to lie. She lies as she joins the other flight attendants and pilots in the van. She lies on the way to Paris as she works the first class cabin. She lies to the FBI agents in New York who meet her at the gate. Soon it's too late to come clean—or face the truth about what really happened back in Dubai. Could she have killed him? If not, who did?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Smart strategies for pragmatic, science-based growth and sustainable achievement.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Science of Intelligent Achievement&lt;/i&gt; teaches you the scientific process of finding success through your most valuable assets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Selective focus - how selective are you with who and what you let into your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Creative ownership - how dependent are you on others for your happiness and success?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pragmatic growth - how consistently and practically are you growing daily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this book will show you how to develop your focus by being very selective with where you spend your mental energy. If you've failed to reach an important goal because you were distracted, misinformed, or overcommitted, then you know the role focus and selectivity play in achievement. Second, you will learn how to stop allowing your happiness and success to be dependent on other people and instead, start taking ownership over your life through creative work. Finally, you will learn the art of changing your life through pragmatic decisions and actions. Self-improvement is not the result of dramatic changes. Instead, science has shown that personal and professional change is initiated and sustained by consistent, practical changes. To grow, you must leverage the power of micro-decisions, personality responsibility, and mini-habits. Your own biology will not let you improve your life in any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you currently value? What are working to attain? Have you been taught to value your job title or your relationship with some other person above all else? Have you been convinced that the most valuable things in life are your paycheck, the number of people who say 'hello' to you at the office, and the number of people who say 'I need you' at home? Or, have you become so passive in what you value that you let anyone and anything into your life, as long as whatever you let in allows you to stay disconnected from the cold hard truth that when things really go wrong in your life, the only person who will be able to fix it and the only person will be responsible for it is you. &lt;i&gt;If so...welcome to fake success&lt;/i&gt;. Passivity, dependence, and the sacrifice of practical thinking and personal responsibility to fuzzy, grandiose ideals and temporary feelings -- these are markers of fake success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intelligent Achievement&lt;/i&gt;, on the other hand, is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a moving target. It's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; empty either. Instead, it's sturdy, full, and immovable. It's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; something that's just handed to you. It's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; something you're nudged to chase or coerced into wanting. &lt;i&gt;Intelligent Achievement&lt;/i&gt; comes from within you. It's a collection of values that are aligned with who you are--values you have to protect and nurture. These values do not increase your dependence on other people and things. Instead, they relieve you of dependence. This kind of achievement is something that you have a part in building from the ground up--you know what's in it--you chose it, someone else didn't choose it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Achieving real success means you must focus, create, and grow daily. &lt;i&gt;The Science of Intelligent Achievement&lt;/i&gt; will show you how.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An eye-opening exploration of blood, the lifegiving substance with the power of taboo, the value of diamonds, and the promise of breakthrough science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Blood carries life, yet the sight of it makes people faint. It is a waste product and a commodity pricier than oil. It can save lives and transmit deadly infections. Each one of us has roughly nine pints of it, yet many don’t even know their own blood type. And for all its ubiquity, the few tablespoons of blood discharged by 800 million women are still regarded as taboo; menstruation is perhaps the single most demonized biological event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose George, author of &lt;i&gt;The Big Necessity&lt;/i&gt;, is renowned for her intrepid work on topics that are invisible but vitally important. In &lt;i&gt;Nine Pints&lt;/i&gt;, she takes us from ancient practices of bloodletting to modern “hemovigilance” teams that track blood-borne diseases. She introduces Janet Vaughan, who set up the world’s first system of mass blood donation during the Blitz, and Arunachalam Muruganantham, known as “Menstrual Man” for his work on sanitary pads for developing countries. She probes the lucrative business of plasma transfusions, in which the U.S. is known as the “OPEC of plasma.” And she looks to the future, as researchers seek to bring synthetic blood to a hospital near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning science and politics, stories and global epidemics, &lt;i&gt;Nine Pints&lt;/i&gt; reveals our life's blood in an entirely new light.</description>

  <description>Çocukluğumda babam, bana asla unutamayacağım bir şey söylemişti: "Evlat, doğduğunda tüm dünya gülümserken sen ağlıyordun. Öyle bir yaşam sür ki öldüğünde tüm dünya ağlarken sen gülümse." Hayatın gerçek anlamını unuttuğumuz bir çağdayız. Ay'a bile gidilebiliyorken arkadaşlarımıza zaman ayıramıyoruz. Dünyanın diğer ucundaki bir hedefi on ikiden vurabiliyoruz ama çocuklarımızla vakit geçiremiyoruz. İnsanlığımızla bağlarımızı yitirdik. Amacımızı kaybettik. En önemli değerlerimizi unuttuk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bu yüzden şimdi size içtenlikle soruyorum: Siz ölünce kim ağlayacak? Hala hayattayken kaç yaşamı etkileyeceksiniz? Gelecek nesillere nasıl bir miras bırakacaksınız?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin Sharma, 101 basit öneriyle içinizdeki boşluğu, derin bir huzur, tutku ve amaçla doldurmanız, yüreğinizdeki ışığı ortaya çıkarıp zengin bir hayat sürmeniz için size yol gösterecek...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Sharma, aydınlanma yolunda okurlarına rehberlik ediyor.” &lt;br /&gt;— The Chronicle-Herald&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>The Canterbury Tales is a collection of 24 stories written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer. They were written at the end of the 14th century; given mostly in verse, (although a number of them are in prose) they are told as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims during their travel on a journey to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. This is a reprint of a book published before 1923. This book may have occasional imperfections such as errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original writing. We believe this work is culturally important, and despite the imperfections, have elected to bring it back to you due to its value.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As a young mother facing a terminal diagnosis, Julie Yip-Williams began to write her story, a story like no other. What began as the chronicle of an imminent and early death became something much more--a powerful exhortation to the living.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Julie Yip-Williams survived infancy was a miracle. Born blind in Vietnam, she narrowly escaped euthanasia at the hands of her grandmother, only to flee with her family the political upheaval of her country in the late 1970s. Loaded into a rickety boat with three hundred other refugees, Julie made it to Hong Kong and, ultimately, America, where a surgeon at UCLA gave her partial sight. She would go on to become a Harvard-educated lawyer, with a husband, a family, and a life she had once assumed would be impossible. Then, at age thirty-seven, with two little girls at home, Julie was diagnosed with terminal metastatic colon cancer, and a different journey began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Unwinding of the Miracle&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a vigorous life refracted through the prism of imminent death. When she was first diagnosed, Julie Yip-Williams sought clarity and guidance through the experience and, finding none, began to write her way through it--a chronicle that grew beyond her imagining. Motherhood, marriage, the immigrant experience, ambition, love, wanderlust, tennis, fortune-tellers, grief, reincarnation, jealousy, comfort, pain, the marvel of the body in full rebellion--this book is as sprawling and majestic as the life it records. It is inspiring and instructive, delightful and shattering. It is a book of indelible moments, seared deep--an incomparable guide to living vividly by facing hard truths consciously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With humor, bracing honesty, and the cleansing power of well-deployed anger, Julie Yip-Williams set the stage for her lasting legacy and one final miracle: the story of her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strength and prestige of the American presidency has waxed and waned since George Washington. &lt;i&gt;Accidental Presidents&lt;/i&gt; looks at eight men who came to the office without being elected to it. It demonstrates how the character of the man in that powerful seat affects the nation and world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight men have succeeded to the presidency when the incumbent died in office. In one way or another they vastly changed our history. Only Theodore Roosevelt would have been elected in his own right. Only TR, Truman, Coolidge, and LBJ were re-elected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;John Tyler&lt;/b&gt; succeeded William Henry Harrison who died 30 days into his term. He was kicked out of his party and became the first president threatened with impeachment. &lt;b&gt;Millard Fillmore &lt;/b&gt;succeeded esteemed General Zachary Taylor. He immediately sacked the entire cabinet and delayed an inevitable Civil War by standing with Henry Clay’s compromise of 1850. &lt;b&gt;Andrew Johnson&lt;/b&gt;, who succeeded our greatest president, sided with remnants of the Confederacy in Reconstruction. &lt;b&gt;Chester Arthur&lt;/b&gt;, the embodiment of the spoils system, was so reviled as James Garfield’s successor that he had to defend himself against plotting Garfield’s assassination; but he reformed the civil service. &lt;b&gt; Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/b&gt; broke up the trusts. &lt;b&gt;Calvin Coolidge&lt;/b&gt; silently cooled down the Harding scandals and preserved the White House for the Republican Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression. &lt;b&gt;Truman&lt;/b&gt; surprised everybody when he succeeded the great FDR and proved an able and accomplished president. &lt;b&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/b&gt; was named to deliver Texas electorally. He led the nation forward on Civil Rights but failed on Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Accidental Presidents&lt;/i&gt; adds immeasurably to our understanding of the power and limits of the American presidency in critical times.</description>

  <description>In Why I Am a Hindu, one of India’s finest public intellectuals gives us a profound book about one of the world’s oldest and greatest religions. Starting with a close examination of his own belief in Hinduism, he ranges far and wide in his study of the faith. He talks about the Great Souls of Hinduism, Adi Shankara, Patanjali, Ramanuja, Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and many others who made major contributions to the essence of Hinduism. He delves deep into Hinduism’s most important schools of thought (such as the Advaita Vedanta). He explains, in easily accessible language, important aspects and concepts of Hindu philosophy like the Purusharthas and Bhakti, masterfully summarizes the lessons of the Gita and Vivekananda’s ecumenism, and explores with sympathy the ‘Hinduism of habit’ practised by ordinary believers. He looks at the myriad manifestations of political Hinduism in the modern era, including violence committed in the name of the faith by right-wing organizations and their adherents. He analyzes Hindutva, explains its rise and dwells at length on the philosophy of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, its most significant ideologue. He is unsparing in his criticism of extremist ‘bhakts’, and unequivocal in his belief that everything that makes India a great and distinctive culture and country will be imperiled if religious ‘fundamentalists’ are allowed to take the upper hand. However, he also makes the point that it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A book that will be read and debated now and in the future, Why I Am a Hindu is a revelatory and original masterwork.</description>

  <description>Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the start--Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for Lysander. Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.</description>

  <description>The first person who will live to be 150 years old has already been born.&lt;br /&gt;The screen that we peer into will soon be within us.&lt;br /&gt;We could soon be taking happiness pills before breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;The perfect partner might need to be charged before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a new world we are walking into. And the man who began this journey won't be the man who ends this journey. Where Will Man Take Us? explores the changes technology is bringing about in us as a society and as a species. What will the next generation turn into, what will it be like, how will the new Adam and Eve live and love?&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Atul Jalan tackles nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and genetics, seamlessly weaving the future of technology with the changing dynamics of human love, morality and ethics.</description>

  <description>"A gifted and thoughtful writer, Metzl brings us to the frontiers of biology and technology, and reveals a world full of promise and peril." -- Siddhartha Mukherjee MD, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; The Gene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passionate, provocative, and highly illuminating, &lt;em&gt;Hacking Darwin &lt;/em&gt;is the must read book about the future of our species for fans of &lt;em&gt;Homo Deus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Gene&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 3.8 billion years humankind is about to start evolving by new rules...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From leading geopolitical expert and technology futurist Jamie Metzl comes a groundbreaking exploration of the many ways genetic-engineering is shaking the core foundations of our lives -- sex, war, love, and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the laboratories where scientists are turning science fiction into reality. Look towards a future where our deepest beliefs, morals, religions, and politics are challenged like never before and the very essence of what it means to be human is at play. When we can engineer our future children, massively extend our lifespans, build life from scratch, and recreate the plant and animal world, should we? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton. It was originally published in 1667 in ten books; a second edition followed in 1674, redivided into twelve books (in the manner of the division of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout and a note on the versification. The poem concerns the Judeo-Christian story of the Fall of Man; the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Milton's purpose, stated in Book I, is "justify the ways of God to men" and elucidate the conflict between God's eternal foresight and free will.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;WHAT DO MEN WANT? &lt;br /&gt;WHY CAN'T THEY COMMIT?&lt;br /&gt;WHY ISN'T ONE WOMAN ENOUGH?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this book because I was sick and tired of scientific theories about why men do what they do. Never Satisfied is a collection of interviews about how men feel about sex, relationships, and monogamy? Do men know what they want? And more importantly, will women listen?</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt; has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.</description>

  <description>If a hungry little traveler shows up at your house, you might want to give him a cookie. If you give him a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk. He'll want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn't have a milk mustache, and then he'll ask for a pair of scissors to give himself a trim....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consequences of giving a cookie to this energetic mouse run the young host ragged, but young readers will come away smiling at the antics that tumble like dominoes through the pages of this delightful picture book.</description>

  <description>Michael Scott Moore, a journalist and the author of &lt;em&gt;Sweetness and Blood,&lt;/em&gt; incorporates personal narrative and rigorous investigative journalism in this profound and revelatory memoir of his three-year captivity by Somali pirates—a riveting,thoughtful, and emotionally resonant exploration of foreign policy, religious extremism, and the costs of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January 2012, having covered a Somali pirate trial in Hamburg for Spiegel Online International—and funded by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting—Michael Scott Moore traveled to the Horn of Africa to write about piracy and ways to end it. In a terrible twist of fate, Moore himself was kidnapped and subsequently held captive by Somali pirates. Subjected to conditions that break even the strongest spirits—physical injury, starvation, isolation, terror—Moore’s survival is a testament to his indomitable strength of mind. In September 2014, after 977 days, he walked free when his ransom was put together by the help of several US and German institutions, friends, colleagues, and his strong-willed mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Moore’s own struggle is only part of the story: &lt;em&gt;The Desert and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; falls at the intersection of reportage, memoir, and history. Caught between Muslim pirates, the looming threat of Al-Shabaab, and the rise of ISIS, Moore observes the worlds that surrounded him—the economics and history of piracy; the effects of post-colonialism; the politics of hostage negotiation and ransom; while also conjuring the various faces of Islam—and places his ordeal in the context of the larger political and historical issues.           &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sort of &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Black Hawk Down, The Desert and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; is written with dark humor, candor, and a journalist’s clinical distance and eye for detail. Moore offers an intimate and otherwise inaccessible view of life as we cannot fathom it, brilliantly weaving his own experience as a hostage with the social, economic, religious, and political factors creating it. &lt;em&gt;The Desert and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; is wildly compelling and a book that will take its place next to titles like &lt;em&gt;Den of Lions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Even Silence Has an End.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do--create value--more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author David Bach’s three secrets to financial freedom in an engaging story that will show you that &lt;i&gt;you are richer than you think&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drawing on the author’s experiences teaching millions of people around the world to live a rich life, this fast, easy read reveals how anyone—from millennials to baby boomers—can &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; make their dreams come true.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compelling, heartwarming parable, Bach and his bestselling coauthor John David Mann (&lt;i&gt;The Go-Giver&lt;/i&gt;) tell the story of Zoey, a twenty-something woman living and working in New York City. Like many young professionals, Zoey is struggling to make ends meet under a growing burden of credit card and student loan debt, working crazy hours at her dream job but still not earning enough to provide a comfortable financial cushion. At her boss’s suggestion, she makes friends with Henry, the elderly barista at her favorite Brooklyn coffee shop.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Henry soon reveals his “Three Secrets to Financial Freedom,” ideas Zoey dismisses at first but whose true power she ultimately comes to appreciate. Over the course of a single week, Zoey discovers that she already earns enough to secure her financial future and realize her truest dreams—all she has to do is make a few easy shifts in her everyday routine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Latte Factor&lt;/i&gt; demystifies the secrets to achieving financial freedom, inspiring readers to realize that it’s never too late to reach for your dreams. By following the simple, proven path that Henry shows Zoey, anyone can make small changes today that will have big impact for a lifetime, proving once again that “David Bach is the financial expert to listen to when you’re intimidated by your finances” (Tony Robbins, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Money: Master the Game&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of how a noted tech venture capitalist, an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and investor in his company, woke up to the serious damage Facebook was doing to our society and set out to try to stop it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had told Roger McNamee even three years ago that he would soon be devoting himself to stopping Facebook from destroying our democracy, he would have howled with laughter. He had mentored many tech leaders in his illustrious career as an investor, but few things had made him prouder, or been better for his fund's bottom line, than his early service to Mark Zuckerberg. Still a large shareholder in Facebook, he had every good reason to stay on the bright side. Until he simply couldn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZUCKED is McNamee's intimate reckoning with the catastrophic failure of the head of one of the world's most powerful companies to face up to the damage he is doing. It's a story that begins with a series of rude awakenings. First there is the author's dawning realization that the platform is being manipulated by some very bad actors. Then there is the even more unsettling realization that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are unable or unwilling to share his concerns, polite as they may be to his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then comes the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of one horrific piece of news after another about the malign ends to which the Facebook platform has been put. To McNamee's shock, even still Facebook's leaders duck and dissemble, viewing the matter as a public relations problem. Now thoroughly alienated, McNamee digs into the issue, and fortuitously meets up with some fellow travelers who share his concern, and help him sharpen its focus. Soon he and a dream team of Silicon Valley technologists are charging into the fray, to raise consciousness about the existential threat of Facebook, and the persuasion architecture of the attention economy more broadly -- to our public health and to our political order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zucked is both an enthralling personal narrative and a masterful explication of the forces that have conspired to place us all on the horns of this dilemma. This is the story of a company and its leadership, but it's also a larger tale of a business sector unmoored from normal constraints, just at a moment of political and cultural crisis, the worst possible time to be given new tools for summoning the darker angels of our nature and whipping them into a frenzy. Like Jimmy Stewart in &lt;i&gt;Rear Window&lt;/i&gt;, Roger McNamee happened to be in the right place to witness a crime, and it took him some time to make sense of what he was seeing and what we ought to do about it. The result of that effort is a wise, hard-hitting, and urgently necessary account that crystallizes the issue definitively for the rest of us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Fareed Zakaria GPS Book of the Week &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of the most important economic thinkers of our time, a brilliant and far-seeing analysis of the current populist backlash against globalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raghuram Rajan, distinguished University of Chicago professor, former IMF chief economist, head of India's central bank, and author of the 2010 FT-Goldman-Sachs Book of the Year &lt;i&gt;Fault Lines&lt;/i&gt;, has an unparalleled vantage point onto the social and economic consequences of globalization and their ultimate effect on our politics. In &lt;i&gt;The Third Pillar&lt;/i&gt; he offers up a magnificent big-picture framework for understanding how these three forces--the state, markets, and our communities--interact, why things begin to break down, and how we can find our way back to a more secure and stable plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "third pillar" of the title is the community we live in. Economists all too often understand their field as the relationship between markets and the state, and they leave squishy social issues for other people. That's not just myopic, Rajan argues; it's dangerous. All economics is actually socioeconomics - all markets are embedded in a web of human relations, values and norms. As he shows, throughout history, technological phase shifts have ripped the market out of those old webs and led to violent backlashes, and to what we now call populism. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reached, but it can be ugly and messy, especially if done wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, we're doing it wrong. As markets scale up, the state scales up with it, concentrating economic and political power in flourishing central hubs and leaving the periphery to decompose, figuratively and even literally. Instead, Rajan offers a way to rethink the relationship between the market and civil society and argues for a return to strengthening and empowering local communities as an antidote to growing despair and unrest. Rajan is not a doctrinaire conservative, so his ultimate argument that decision-making has to be devolved to the grass roots or our democracy will continue to wither, is sure to be provocative. But even setting aside its solutions, &lt;i&gt;The Third Pillar &lt;/i&gt;is a masterpiece of explication, a book that will be a classic of its kind for its offering of a wise, authoritative and humane explanation of the forces that have wrought such a sea change in our lives.</description>

  <description>Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.&lt;p&gt;Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, &lt;i&gt;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&lt;/i&gt; captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On March 16, 2018, just twenty-six hours before his scheduled retirement from the organization he had served with distinction for more than two decades, Andrew G. McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump&lt;/i&gt;, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI's agents, and of the institution's integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI's New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime—which is inextricably linked to the Russian state—and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Threat&lt;/i&gt; recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump's November 2016 election and McCabe's firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI's mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, &lt;i&gt;The Threat&lt;/i&gt; tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America.</description>

  <description>The people of the Congo, as this book shows, have suffered cruelly throughout the past century from a particularly brutal experience of colonial rule; and, following independence in 1960, external interference by the United States and other powers, a whole generation of patrimonial spoliation at the hands of Mobutu (the dictator installed by the West in 1965), and periodic warfare which even now continues fitfully in the East of the country. But, as this insightful political history of the Congolese democratic movement in the 20th century decisively makes clear, its people have not taken these multiple oppressions lying down. Instead, the Congolese people have struggled over the years to improve their conditions of life by trying both to establish democratic institutions at home and to free themselves from exploitation from abroad; indeed these cannot be separated one from the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The author of this book, Professor Nzongola-Ntalaja, is one of the country's leading intellectuals. Despite being forced into long years of exile (during which he taught political science in the United States and elsewhere), he has played a part at significant moments in his country's political struggle. His deep knowledge of personalities and events, and his understanding of the underlying class, ethnic and other factors at work, make his book a compelling, lucid, radical and utterly unromanticized account of his countrymen's struggle. In acknowledging their defeat, he sees it and the crisis of the post-colonial state as the result of the breakdown of the anti-colonial alliance between the masses and the national leadership after independence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book is essential reading for understanding what is happening in the Congo and the Great Lakes region. It will also stand as a milestone in how to write the modern political history of Africa. </description>
