  <description>The year is 2032. After traveling to a galaxy far far away, the three astronauts are back on Earth, but in the future. What they see shocks them. When they left Earth in 2015, America was united, but they come to a divided country.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only way to stop this from ever happening is for them to travel back to the year 2015. And the only person who can take them back is the alien who flew back with them. They have already witnessed the powers he possesses. They know that no human on Earth can do what he can. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will he do it?</description>

      <![CDATA[I really looked forward to reading this book as I've enjoyed Aithal's other books very much. This one disappointed me a little though. <br /><br />Through the other books there have been undercurrents of 'political' threads, particularly American ones, but this third book is driven by them and while climate...]]>

  <description>Freedom - in eleventh-century France, it is a luxury enjoyed by only the King and nobility. For the serf, it is surely worth fighting for. But is it worth dying for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving home disillusioned from the Crusades, Hugh DeLuc discovers that his village has been ransacked and his wife abducted. The dark riders came in the dead of night, like devils, wearing no colours but black crosses on their chests, leaving no clue as to who they are. Knights they may be, but honour and chivalry are not part of their code. They search for a relic, one worth more than any throne in Europe, and no man can stand in their way. Until Hugh, taking on the role of a jester, is able to infiltrate the enemy's castle where he believes his wife is being held captive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when a man is fighting for freedom - for his wife, and for everything he holds dear - he will prove a formidable opponent.</description>

  <description>The next stunning thriller from the author of SPHINX, T.S. Learner. THE TIMES called that novel 'a magnificently imagined story ... convincing characters and well-crafted prose. Learner is that rare beast: a wordsmith who can spin a yarn.' London, 1953. Classics scholar August Winthrop, veteran of the Spanish Civil War and son of a prominent American politician, has stumbled upon an extraordinary artefact: an ancient chronicle that once belonged to an infamous alchemist burned at the stake in 1646. Within the ancient text is a map - an intricate, ingeniously designed labyrinth that will lead August on a spectacular journey to three mazes secreted within France, Spain, and Germany. And at the heart of one of these mazes is hidden the elixir of eternal life. But Western Europe is still reeling from the shock of war, and if he's to survive his perilous quest, August must translate ancient codes, decipher deadly riddles, and expose a mystical secret three hundred years old - even as he outwits Spanish militants and German spies.</description>

  <description>'When the veil fell, any half bloods not strong enough to withstand Chaos were torn apart. Some, like me and my brother, survived The Fall. Most did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the good news. The bad news saw a whole other world try and devour ours. Demons, we call them. They came in countless waves. Destroying. Killing. Many people thought it was the end...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fall lasted a week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tens of thousands died. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hell almost claimed our world as its own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, from one day to the next, it was over. The veil came back, stronger than ever. I'm not sure if anyone knows how it was put right. But I do know it's been six months since The Fall, me and my brother are on the run, and the leftover demons aren't the most dangerous things in LA. &lt;br /&gt;We are.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"They have no defence against chaos."&lt;/b&gt; ~ Asmodeus, Ties That Bind, #5 The Veil Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the same 'world' as the Veil Series, &lt;i&gt; Chaos Rises, #1 The Chaos Series &lt;/i&gt; will feature some of the characters we love (and hate?), and also introduce some new faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The streets of LA are about to become a demon proving ground. Chaos will find a way. And as the Prince of Greed once said, "When chaos reigns, the veil falls."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like to be kept informed of all the news, sign up to Pippa's &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/XBe0D" rel="nofollow"&gt;mailing list here.&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Sit back, relax and allow Hans Christian Asbosen to tell you fantastical stories of far-away lands. Once upon a time there were. . . Hansel and Britney and their trail of Wotsits, Jack and the Weedstalk, Snow White and the Seven Dads and Bling-erella. Not quite as traditional as first glance might suggest, these hilarious reworkings of traditional classics are a wonderfully acerbic look at today's society. &lt;i&gt;The Asbo Fairy Tales&lt;/i&gt; are fantastically packaged to resemble a traditional book of fairy stories, with great comic illustrations of the unique characters. There's Little Red Riding Hoodie, the Crack Piper of Camden, mistakenly enlisted to rid London of its rats, and Sleep-In Beauty, who is cursed with an addiction to fairydust. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is an excellent, very much tongue in cheek, retelling of some of those famous fairy tales we all love. It certainly isn't one to be read if you don't have a wacky sense of humour or if you're easily offended. It's a very easy and quick read that can have the reader laughing all the way throu...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Survive the infected and find the serial killer ... or die trying.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world has fallen apart, the FBI gone, but former Agent Jules Vandevelde won’t stop. She can’t. She’s driven to find the psychopathic serial killer known as the Calligrapher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her search leads her to the small town of Gideon in Southern Utah. There, amongst the 116 survivors, a serial killer hides in plain sight. There’s only one clue to his identity. Using a scalpel, he inscribes the letters AJ into the abdominal area of his victims--postmortem--in an ancient Chinese text called Tsao, the lettering precise and artistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jules knows the key to finding the Calligrapher lies in discovering the identity of AJ. If she can find AJ, she can find the Calligrapher. But the Calligrapher knows who Jules is. Jules must survive the infected and find the Calligrapher before she becomes his latest victim.</description>

  <description>For Jake, a perilous journey of survival will soon turn into a quest for redemption...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrible virus has struck and the world has deteriorated into chaos. And with the infected now outnumbering their human counterparts, chances for survival lessen with each passing day. After running out of food in his condo, Jake must make his way across the Salt Lake Valley to reach the safety of the mountains, and he must use his wiles to avoid the packs of infected roaming the streets. But Jake is haunted by a devastating personal tragedy he can't let go of, and his journey of survival quickly turns into a quest for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as he’s about to reach the safety of the mountains, a phone call changes everything. A woman and her child need help and Jake finally sees an opportunity to redeem himself. But will his helping them put them in harm's way? Jake is being stalked by a brutal and sadistic alpha (by far the most dangerous of the infected). In the end, Jake will have to decide how far he's willing to go to keep them safe and earn the redemption he seeks.</description>

  <description>It’s 1944 and sixteen-year-old ballerina and gymnast Edith Eger is sent to Auschwitz. Separated from her parents on arrival, she endures unimaginable experiences, including being made to dance for the infamous Josef Mengele. When the camp is finally liberated, she is pulled from a pile of bodies, barely alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horrors of the Holocaust didn’t break Edith. In fact, they helped her learn to live again with a life-affirming strength and a truly remarkable resilience. &lt;i&gt;The Choice&lt;/i&gt; is her unforgettable story.</description>

  <description>Part autobiography, part self help, part confession, part celebration of being a common-or-garden woman, part collection of synonyms for nunny, Sarah Millican's debut book delves into her super normal life with daft stories, funny tales and proper advice on how to get past life's blips - like being good at school but not good at friends, the excitement of IBS and how to blossom post divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever worn glasses at the age of six, worn an off-the-shoulder gown with no confidence, been contacted by an old school bully, lived in your childhood bedroom in your thirties, been gloriously dumped in a Frankie and Benny's, cried so much you felt great, been for a romantic walk with a dog, worn leggings two days in a row even though they smelt of wee from a distance, then this is &lt;i&gt;Your Book&lt;/i&gt;. If you haven't done those things but wish you had, &lt;i&gt;This Is Your Book&lt;/i&gt;. If you just want to laugh on a train/sofa/toilet or under your desk at work, &lt;i&gt;This Is Your Book&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In the early 19th century, when it was the policy of many of the poorhouses and workhouses to deter paupers from applying by making the conditions inside harsh and unpleasant, two boys set out on a journey to Hackney Workhouse in London. Their starting point was in the pleasant Cheshire countryside, where they were apprenticed to the cotton mill built by Samuel Greg in 1784. Children as young as 9 would be employed there, as scavengers, piecers, mule doffers or can tenters. These jobs could be just as unpleasant and difficult for a poor child as those we may have heard of, such as chimney sweeps and match girls.&lt;br /&gt;Quarry Bank Mill was some 200 miles north of London and the boys had to sneak out unnoticed and then attempt to walk all the way. It was likely that these enterprising travellers took advantage of the drovers’ roads and the newly developed “motorways” of the times – the canals. Perhaps they were lucky enough some days to hitch a lift; their general direction of travel taking them to Beartown, the Potteries, Dunstable Downs and eventually to London. Whatever challenges they encountered along the way archive evidence shows that they made it.&lt;br /&gt;Runaway apprentices had become a problem for society during the years of the Industrial Revolution – so what had prompted Thomas and Joseph to do such a hazardous thing? What happened to them on their long journey? Did they receive any help? Or were they chased relentlessly wherever they ran, since what they were doing was illegal in the eyes of the authorities?&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of their adventure and it concludes with the events in the Middlesex courthouse, known then as the Old Sessions.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a very easy read and extremely interesting. The book shows a high level of research into the impact the industrial revolution had on the lives of ordinary people at the time without being boring and tedious. For me it was made more interesting because the author used real people, children...]]>

  <description>WARNING! This book may contain NUTS! (Non-Uniform Text Speech)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words speech in what some have called "Olde English Vernacular". It is spoken by characters in the book from the North, the Midlands and the South of England. There is a glossary at the end of the book to help if you can rise to the challenge. It adds shades of colour to this 19th century story that you may not be expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mrs Alexander wrote about “the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate” and declared that “God made them, high or lowly, and order’d their estate” in the ever popular hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, she was probably reflecting one of the mores of the times. It would fit in well with prejudices and beliefs of the middle and upper classes that paternalism had indeed been intended by God, thus laws protecting the workers in their fields, mills and factories were not necessary. In the words of Browning so long as “God’s in his heaven, all’s right with the world!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The continuing story of the Quarry Bank Runaways is about what happened to two cotton apprentices over three decades during the Industrial Revolution; first as qualified young men with hopes and later when they are full grown. By the start of the Victorian period the fates and their ambitions would have collided. Serious events and incidents, both personal and national, were about to impinge upon the lives of Thomas Priestley and Joseph Sefton, who had earlier run away from their apprentice master, Samuel Greg. What would cause a qualified mule spinner to give up his comparatively safe job and risk failure, ridicule or destitution? Ambitious and determined working class individuals like Tommy and Joe had to carefully step through a pathway involving love, loyalty and legal persecution and prejudice, from within the social hierarchy of the times.</description>

  <description>84-year-old Sylvia barely escapes death when a teenage driver plows down six children and a crossing guard, never looking back. Shaken, Sylvia draws his portrait, creating a connection with this 14-year-old boy that allows the police to locate and arrest him. That night, he appears to her through a supernatural process neither understands. Can one woman's belief in the power of love make a difference in the life of one boy who wants to change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Hit And Run, a new novel by Dr. Bob Rich, is something quite rare--actually an example of a new genre of novel. Call it EA for Elderly Adult fiction. Call it whatever you will, I call it a brilliantly told story. The protagonist, one Sylvia Kryz, is clever, humane, and gifted as an artist. And one other thing--late in her life, in her mid-eighties, she comes to recognize she has an incredible gift. Her empathetic nature has blossomed into a supernatural talent to connect with a troubled young man in ways both frightening and wonderful. Five Stars, a simply Must Read for mature adults of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Reviewed by John Klawitter, Hollywood writer/director/producer&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Anaterri, leaning forward, head bowed, had both hands on the big oak table bracing herself. Leto moved around Genevieve and the kids, coming in behind his mother. She raised a hand, stopping his progress. "I'm sorry, but I must finish this," she said quietly, taking a deep breath to calm herself. &lt;br /&gt;Standing upright, she slowly looked at each individual around the table, taking a moment to make sure she had eye contact with them before moving to the next. &lt;br /&gt; "I apologize for my outburst, but it is imperative that you understand what's at stake. I'm tired of losing family, tired of seeing my children and grandchildren losing precious parts of their lives. Many times I've wished I'd never heard of this prophecy or been involved in setting it in motion. But then again, I would have missed out on the most passionate love I've ever known and this, my family," she said, pointing to all those surrounding her. &lt;br /&gt; "You asked, how they could look this way," she said, pointing at the kids. "I will let my grandchildren tell you their story, but before they do, I ask a commitment from each and every one of you in this room today. A commitment to stand tall and stand united. A commitment to end the evil plaguing this land. The same evil that has been terrorizing and killing our families and friends for the last three decades. A commitment to kill that bastard Treagar once and for all. If you can't make that commitment today, please stand and leave. We will understand. There will be no ill will against you. Those of us that remain will still carry on the fight to fulfill the Prophecy once and for all. &lt;br /&gt; The Dragon King is here among us today, for those that didn't know. So, I leave you with this from the Dragon Book of Lore; 'A tale is told in days of lore, of a Dragon King born that will end the war. Appearing as one he is really three, the Prophecy reads, this will be.' The war is here. Please reveal yourself, mighty Dragon King."</description>

  <description>The Door is a Mystery. Not so much a who done it, as how and why? Renee could only watch as her sister Cadi slowly deteriorated. Why would someone once so full of life, suddenly become sick and in need of constant care? What caused Cadi’s husband Ted to fall ill and suddenly die? And what was behind the small locked door in the library? Renee had so many questions and as yet no answers. Nevertheless, she knew something was wrong, and was determined to uncover the truth. But what she didn’t know was the truth would be more shocking than she could have imagined.</description>

  <description>Patterson and Ledwidge introduce a new hero in an exciting thriller set in the heart of Manhattan. NYPD detective Michael Bennett is concentrating on getting his family through a particularly difficult Christmas: he and his 10 adopted children are facing the loss to cancer of his brave wife, Maeve. But a major crisis calls him away: the funeral of a former First Lady at St. Patrick's Cathedral goes horribly awry when men storm the church and take hundreds of attendees hostage. Michael is asked to try to reason with a sinister man named Jack. Jack releases all but the most famous people, and makes his demands: he wants several million dollars from each celebrity hostage, including the mayor, a popular comedic actor, a beloved talk show host, and a pop starlet. Once Jack starts killing, Michael realizes he's up against a truly diabolical foe. Patterson has a knack for creating genuinely likable heroes, and Michael fits the bill. As readers rapidly turn the pages to learn how the tense hostage drama plays out, they will also be sympathizing with Michael as he faces the agonizing loss of his wife. Totally gripping and downright impossible to put down, this is a promising start to a potential new series.</description>

  <description>Police Captain John Iron Hawk’s life is a speeding vehicle down a deserted road. A road with his tormented past looming at his back and a future summed up by the black thunder clouds building on the horizon. &lt;br /&gt;His relationship with his daughter is nonexistent. And he can’t seem to say the words to the woman he loves to make her stay. &lt;br /&gt;When Zora Hughes receives a job offer from Cosmopolitan magazine, she knows she has to take it and reestablish her career on the New York fashion scene. She has nothing to keep her on Little River Reservation, even if John is the only man she’s ever trusted or loved this completely. John’s life is his job, and he has little left over to build something with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a psychopathic killer turns their world upside down, they must dig deep to find the strength to outwit an adversary who will strip them of everything they hold dear…including each other.</description>

  <description>The compelling, inspiring, and comically sublime New York Times bestseller about one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: penguinrandomhouse.ca</description>

  <description>Don't Think, Just Love« is the fruit of my inner balance; the female and male energies coming together in unity, from which a new Aleksandra« was born, awoken from a long dream of an unkind world, into a world of love. &lt;br /&gt; Stories from my diary recollect everyday situations from my life, evincing the turning point at which I have stopped thinking and started to love. Perhaps some of these stories will help you recognize and better understand events of your own life. &lt;br /&gt; It's very likely that there are many readers who are just like me; kind, loving and good people, but who don't seem to be able to find their way through life, even though they have plenty of love deep within themselves - the love they consider to be too risky to express. That's why I invite all of you good-hearted people, similar to myself, to wake up, start living the love and reach your full potential, just as your heart is telling you. &lt;br /&gt; This world needs your love!&lt;br /&gt; The picture on the cover was made by the author. It represents her way of sharing with the readers a piece of her inner world.</description>

  <description>When police killed his two best friends in a supposedly accidental shooting, detective Mark Brown left the force bitter and angry, abandoning a promising career and leaving his special skills to languish. A year later, the trail of one of the killers has Mark looking south, to Mexico, just as he receives a mysterious, anonymous, encrypted message over e-mail: The dead demand much more than vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same day, two Mexican police are murdered in guerrilla territory in Chiapas, Mexico, where the Zapatista rebels face the Mexican government in a deadly conflict in which no one is safe and no one can afford to be neutral. A US firm close to the Mexican government is contracted to do an independent investigation, and they want Mark in the field. But does anyone want the truth to come out? The Mexican police stand accused of corruption and collusion in drug trafficking. The rebels and their apparently benign supporters have secrets of their own. And the US Embassy wants Mark to use his new contacts to bolster their intelligence on the rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn into the conflict zone by the connection to the deaths of his friends, Mark finds that he has to work on both sides to solve the case, in a place where any mistake could endanger lives – or reignite a war.</description>

  <description>My book Reneging Quiescence, is a poke to the heart, a brushing up of memories piled under dust in a morgue of shed chronicles. The book is a reminder that sometimes conspiracy to silence makes us allies and victim to the sequelae of wrong deeds.</description>

  <description>American journalist Paul Schaffer is forced to continue his service in the Sonderbattalion Dirlewanger, the partisan hunters whose reputation for brutal cruelty in occupied Russia is too much even for the Waffen-SS. Yet the battalion sinks to a new low. Returning from Russia to Poland they are pressed into service to fight in the hell of the Warsaw Ghetto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SS and the Red Army are not the only dangers he has to confront. Schaffer becomes acquainted with a Catholic priest, a Jesuit. He seems to be a genuine and compassionate patriot, but gradually a new picture emerges of the man. Schaffer suspects he could be part of a threat that is even greater than the warring nations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thrilling story of the Eastern Front, the war in Russia that claimed millions of lives. Based on real people and real events, the action is so vivid and real that you can almost smell the smoke. From the front line through to the Warsaw Ghetto and the anti-partisan operations, this is an epic tale that paints an astonishing picture of how the war in Russia was truly fought. Yet for some, the killings are not enough to satisfy their lust for blood and their ambitions for power. Behind the scenes men are plotting an infamy that could pitch the war into a new level of slaughter.</description>

  <description>An American journalist returns to Germany, his birthplace, to be a part of the miracle that Hitler is creating. When war breaks out he joins an SS War Correspondents Unit. A futile attempt to stop the SS killing prisoners in France results in a sentence to Mauthausen Concentration Camp. His only escape from the living hell of the camp is to join a police battalion, SS Sonderbattalion Dirlewanger. He is pitched into the maelstrom of the battlefront in Russia, but quickly finds that behind the lines murder on a vast scale is being committed. The wholesale slaughter that Dirlewanger’s men inflict on the innocent civilian population of Occupied Eastern Europe is an evil that almost defies description. His fight is no longer against the enemies of the Third Reich, but a race to prevent some of the worst of the atrocities perpetrated by his own SS colleagues. A superb, fact-based account of the war behind the lines on the Eastern Front in World War Two.</description>

  <description>Condannato per omicidio, è tornato in tribunale.&lt;br /&gt;Questa volta come avvocato.&lt;br /&gt;E nessuno più di lui sa che la legge può sbagliare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quando William Benson, appena ventenne, viene condannato all'ergastolo per un omicidio che non ha commesso, c'è un pensiero che lo ossessiona: come può la giustizia commettere un errore così plateale? Forse è per questo che in carcere sceglie di studiare legge. La stessa legge che gli ha rovinato la vita. Dieci anni dopo, ormai diventato avvocato dietro le sbarre, viene scarcerato: per somma ironia, confessando ciò che non ha commesso - quindi mentendo -, ha ottenuto uno sconto di pena.&lt;br /&gt;Peccato che, per tutti, William Benson altri non sia che un assassino. Un reo confesso che ora recita la parte dell'avvocato: chi accetterà di farsi difendere da lui? C'è solo una persona che non gli volta le spalle: Tess de Vere. Stagista dello studio legale che anni prima aveva difeso Benson, Tess era stata l'unica a credere alla sua innocenza. E adesso, avvocatessa in carriera, è di nuovo l'unica a fidarsi di lui. Insieme, difenderanno una donna accusata dell'omicidio dell'amante, che sembra condannata in partenza - proprio come era successo a William. Insieme, proveranno a far trionfare la giustizia in cui, nonostante tutto, vogliono ancora credere.&lt;br /&gt;Perché l'avvocato colpevole è pronto a tornare in tribunale, questa volta da vincitore.</description>

  <description>A nun commits suicide in front of thousands in Spain. In Australia, Siobhan Russo recognises that nun as her mother, Denise Russo, who disappeared six years ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In search of answers, Siobhan travels to the isolated convent where her mother once lived. Here she discovers Denise’s final confession, a book that details a heinous betrayal that left her crippled and mute, and Denise’s subsequent deal with the Devil to take revenge. In the desperate bargain Denise made with the Prince of Darkness, she wagered Siobhan’s soul. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Siobhan discovers the fate of her soul, she learns that hidden within the pages of her mother’s confession is part of The Devil’s Prayer, an ancient text with the power to unleash apocalyptic horrors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And now her mother’s enemies know Siobhan has it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Siobhan escape an order of extremist monks determined to get the Prayer back? Can she save the world from its own destruction? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Explicit Content Warning: "The Devil’s Prayer" is a historical horror thriller that contains brutality, rape, sex, drug abuse and murder. Readers may find its content offensive and confronting. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Are we alone? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three astronauts go to space in search of a planet that probably has water—one of the basic elements for humanity to survive. Do they find it? What else do they find? They encounter something—something strange—beyond their wildest imaginations, and their mission-to-explore becomes a mission-to-survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They experience something that makes them question their beliefs. All the things they had taken for granted, everything they had seen and learned, don’t seem to apply any longer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something happens along the way that makes them yearn to come back to Earth. After all, home is where the heart is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not just another science fiction. Rather, it will make you question your own beliefs—may they be scientific, religious, political, or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first installment of The Galaxy Series, find out about the strange world they discover.</description>

  <description>This is a story of resilience, the irrepressible, enduring nature of love, and the fragility of life. From one of Australia's most loved novelists. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He felt like a pirate landing on an island of little maimed animals. A great wave had swept them up and dumped them here. All of them, like him, stranded, wanting to go home. It is 1954 and thirteen-year-old Frank Gold, refugee from wartime Hungary, is learning to walk again after contracting polio in Australia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Golden Age Children's Polio Convalescent Hospital in Perth, he sees Elsa, a fellow-patient, and they form a forbidden, passionate bond. &lt;i&gt;The Golden Age&lt;/i&gt; becomes the little world that reflects the larger one, where everything occurs, love and desire, music, death, and poetry. Where children must learn that they are alone, even within their families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in Joan London's customary clear-eyed prose, &lt;i&gt;The Golden Age&lt;/i&gt; evokes a time past and a yearning for deep connection. It is a rare and precious gem of a book from one of Australia's finest novelists.</description>

  <description>I think I have fallen in love with the girl on the cover of my latest book Memories &amp;amp; Kisses. She is beautiful, of course, but what really attracts me is her mystery. I’m sure it is no accident that she uses bright red lipstick. Take a casual glance at her picture, and you are caught by that luscious, lovable mouth. Who does she kiss? Just one lover? Or several? Does she kiss men or perhaps women? Would she kiss me on the right evening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think? Is she thinking about memories of love lost? Perhaps the memories made trying to forget a lost love? Even old memories revisited by old friends, united in a kiss that rekindles flames, passions and desire, too. Old memories are like old red wine - all the richer for time passed. And the kisses taste sweeter too. Three romantic and very sexy stories take us back to things as they once were, and forward to the wonderful times to come.&lt;br /&gt;Memories &amp;amp; Kisses has three stories of old loves remembered; a grieving woman rescued from the sea, two childhood friends growing old friendship into passionate loving, and two long separated teenagers finding that time has mellowed them both and maturity has brought a passionate intensity they had never imagined. All three stories are of rekindled love that survived decades of longing and is now ready to burst into flame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blurb:&lt;br /&gt;The Storm ~ a newly widowed woman unable to face the world alone and lonely, buries her husband. Overcome by grief, she walks into the rough, grinding pitiless surf in an effort to blend the gray in her heart with the gray on the horizon. She is saved from the crashing waves by a man, a bearded white haired man who brings her back to life and gives her a reason to live again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Park ~ two childhood friends, now adults, reunite on the eve of the dedication of their once favorite playground now slated to become a high-tech water park. The destruction of their favorite playground makes them melancholy; reliving their dreams as children in this park inspires them to greater, more passionate long buried desires they never responded to as teens, but knew existed but in their memories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Story of Us ~ high school friends, once nearly sweethearts, reconnect in their sixties. The Internet removes the veil of uncomfortable shyness. They are open and revealing in emails about their youthful teen-aged desires for one another. They discover what we all hope is true: that love is eternal. Surviving decades, not only in the shadowed recesses of our memories, but in a kiss, a touch, a magnetic embrace love thrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have memories of a love that once was?...of a love that was lost?...of, perhaps, a rekindled love that survived decades of longing?</description>

  <description>The Dead Game takes place in a coastal town with sparkling blue waters. But are its waters truly harmless? Or is evil lurking beneath its soothing waves, ready to ensnare unsuspecting victims into its dark and murky depths?&lt;br /&gt;Life changes in the remote town...as darkness falls on the picturesque streets, the ominous sounds of chanting linger on the whispering winds. It all begins with the mysterious invitation to a party at End House. It is not at all what they had expected. They find themselves trapped in a deserted house where they must flee for their lives through revolving rooms and a trick basement. Not knowing if their stalkers are shape-shifters or human, they must uncover the one controlling the game and everyone else in town.</description>

  <description>The Note &lt;br /&gt;After a bizarre dream a man wakes up in the middle of a deserted highway, with no clothes, and no memory of who he is. In front of him is a vehicle with keys and a note inside: Drive this forward. Drive, or there will be consequences. The consequences will be immediate, and they will get worse with every transgression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Highway &lt;br /&gt;The task is straightforward, but what happens next is anything but. As he unravels the mysteries of both his past and future, he’ll come to understand that there are dark truths around him, and he’ll find that those who wrote the note meant every word of their threat. But underneath the terror he’ll find an inner strength, and he’ll find the power that comes from reason. He’ll need them both – because his decisions on this lonely night will impact this world in ways he can’t even begin to imagine.</description>

  <description>…Suddenly, he saw something shiny at the bottom of the abyss. He squinted to see what it was. He ran back to his binoculars and turned them to see what it was. Sharp barbed wires that separated the two mountains came into focus. He had come as far as he could in his country. But she was standing in another country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was in South India and she was in North India…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever imagined India being divided into two countries? What happens to the millions of Indians who are from South India but are now residing in North India? Kaahi &amp;amp; Jai were two such people who got trapped in this situation. Everything was going smoothly for them and suddenly, their world turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will they get together? Will India become one again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take an exciting journey with them from their college days in Mumbai to their life in the US and back to India when they find out that India is divided.</description>

  <description>Princess Grace and Prince Dignity, a royal couple with mystical powers, are set to be crowned king and queen of the magnificent Kingdom of Love. But on the eve of their coronation, disaster strikes, and Grace is told her prince has been murdered. Grief-stricken, the princess reportedly dies of a broken heart, and the shocked kingdom falls into the eager hands of Dignity’s unscrupulous cousin, Prince Denial. Months later, however, Grace is found alive with a gap in her memory, a loss of her powers, and a mysterious Pig Latin note suggesting Prince Dignity is very much alive. As she searches for her prince throughout the rundown kingdom, Grace stumbles upon an ancient secret known as the Cosmic Source—a powerful force which promises to revive her mystical powers and lead to an exciting new way of living. But with the crown title “throne” for a loop, the future of the Kingdom of Love hangs upon the prince’s Dignity. Find out if True Love conquers all in this mystical, linguistical tale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Royalty Fiction, Clean Romance, YA Fantasy Adventure, Metaphysical Fiction, Fairy tales for adults, Visionary fiction, Romantic comedy Kindle books</description>

  <description>Existence is the first instalment from the Synthetics' Society serial book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orian “Ryan” Griffith has finished school and is going to be starting his next term in a local village. A safe haven for all walks of magical life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when Ryan’s human friends give him a send off, there’s a little bit more than alcohol in his punch. It’s a concoction his sister had been using with her friends. A potion to give the drinker temporary magical abilities. And without the correct reversal potion, they could be stuck that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, they've attracted a whole host of unsavoury magical creatures. And they’re after blood.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hooded silhouette was outlined on an overhanging rock in the blue lunar light of Tinmal and Hamal. Motionless, the individual was tracking his every movement.&lt;br /&gt;Pelmen shivered.&lt;/em&gt; He looks more like a protodactyl ready to fall on its prey than anything else. &lt;em&gt;Not wishing to find himself alone in the presence of the unnerving stranger for a moment longer than necessary, with no further thought to what Komel was doing, he hurried back to the relative safety of the hut.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;A fantasy novel set in a prehistoric world&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pelmen hates being a tanner, but that’s all he would ever be, thanks to the rigid caste system amongst his people, the hevelens. Then he meets Master Galn Boisencroix and his family. The master carpenter opens up a world of archery to young Pelmen, who excels at his newfound skill. But Pelmen’s intractable father would have none of it, and tries to force Pelmen to stay in the tannery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, however, Pelmen’s best friend and Master Galn's son, Teleg, disappears. Lured away by the prospect of untold riches through mining amberrock, the most precious substance in the world, Teleg finds himself a prisoner of the Nylevs, fierce fire-wielding worshippers of the god of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Pelmen must leave all he knows behind, overcome his fears and travel across the land, in search of his childhood friend. Along the way, he will ally himself with strange and fantastic beings: a shaman who controls the Breath of Aoles, or the power of the wind, a krongos, a creature of the mineral realm who can become living rock, and a malian, adept at water magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;The most complete version of the Ardalia universe&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ebook includes the trilogy three books, &lt;em&gt;The Breath of Aoles&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Turquoise Water&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Flames of the Immolated&lt;/em&gt;, along with &lt;em&gt;A brief History of Ardalia&lt;/em&gt;, which will help you go deeper into the universe imagined by the author, a map of Ardalia, and a glossary. You will also find pronunciation suggestions for the peculiar words of Ardalia and the characters' names.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;What readers are saying&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Forget elves, dwarves, trolls and dragons. In Ardalia, you have all sorts of alien species that fit well into the ecosystem of a low-magic world, which is sort of elemental in its own way. The originality is excellent here." —&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Indies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I absolutely loved this book. It is phenomenal. The power of the author’s imagination and his use of language really make it a brilliant read. It's complex but you get used to it and really start to enjoy it." —&lt;strong&gt;Paige&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The story is great. Lots of adventure, action, some romance. The main character's coming of age is great to follow. He is overcoming the arrogance of youth, and realizing other cultures often have much to offer." —&lt;strong&gt;Mike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This story was really good. It drew me in from the first few pages and was packed with adventure, excitement, and danger. The main character, Pelmen, is just an ordinary tanner at the bottom of the “totem pole”, wishing to escape for a better life at the start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This is the inspiring true story of what happens when ordinary people unite to make a stand against evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lidice was a peaceful and vibrant community in Czechoslovakia with a rich mining heritage. But an act of Nazi revenge saw this village wiped from existence in a horrifying chapter of European history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disaster struck for Lidice in 1942 when the prominent Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich was assassinated. Described by Hitler as "the man with an iron heart", Heydrich was one of the key architects of the Holocaust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His death, after an attack by members of the Czech resistance, left Hitler furious and desperate for vengeance. Looking for a scapegoat to blame for Heydrich's death, he settled on the village of Lidice, which had been falsely linked to the assassination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a brutal act which shocked the world, Lidice was completely destroyed. The men were shot while the women and children were rounded up and sent to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitler was determined that by the time he had finished, no one would even remember Lidice, let alone live there. What he hadn't reckoned on was the efforts of a group of campaigners in Britain, who resolved to make sure Lidice would never be forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Ray of Light tells the tale of Lidice's downfall and what happened next. Would the village simply be allowed to become a footnote in history, or would it rise from the ashes and forge a new future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a compelling testament to the power of friendship and solidarity, and how empathy and compassion can help rebuild the world.</description>

  <description>I was middle aged and homeless, soon to be penniless, and really and truly no different from that bag lady sitting on the bench over there. I couldn’t jack it in and go home, because I didn’t have a home to go to anymore. The bicycle and the tent were now home. Wherever I found myself on any given night was now home. And that meant, for tonight, Genoa Piazza Principe Railway Station was home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cycling across Europe in search of Utopia, a place I believed was located somewhere in Greece. When I found it, I would start a new life there. It was my big, fat, Greek midlife crisis. But now I was having a crisis within a crisis. What the hell had I been thinking?</description>

  <description>Aging managing director Charlie Forsythe begins his work day with a phone call to Jocasta Binns, the unacknowledged illegitimate daughter of Weibigand Funeral Home founder Karl Heinz Sr. Alma Wurtz, a scooter bound sextenarian, community activist, and neighborhood pain in the ass is emptying her urine into the flower beds, killing the petunias. Jocasta cuts him off, reminding him that a staff meeting has been called. Charlie, silenced, is taken aback: he has had no prior input into the meeting and that, on its own, makes it sinister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second novel in the UNAPOLOGETIC LIVES series, SCOOTER NATION takes place two years after HEUER LOST AND FOUND. This time, funeral directors Scooter Creighton and Carla Moretto Salinger Blue take centre stage as they battle conflicting values, draconian city by-laws, a mendacious neighborhood gang bent on havoc, and a self absorbed fitness guru whose presence shines an unwanted light on their quiet Michigan neighborhood.</description>

  <description>Memories define us, they tell us who we’ve been in the past and give insight to who we are likely to be in the future. But what if you wake with no memory? Tom Gardener faces this very situation when he wakes in a freezing car with no idea where or who he is. As memories emerge, fuelled by music and dreams, so too comes a sense of dread that there may be things he does not want to recall. Is his mind protecting him from something? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is he? &lt;br /&gt;What has he done? &lt;br /&gt;Where does he belong? &lt;br /&gt;Why can he not remember? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VOID: a psychological journey of discovery that forces the question: To what extent can our memories be trusted?</description>

  <description>Discover a unique eco-urban fantasy with a touch of romance.&lt;br /&gt;When Scottish water sprite, Cassie, volunteers for an anti-fracking protest, the last thing she expects is to find herself at odds with a druid.

Can she avert catastrophe? Or will she become the very agency of an ecological disaster?&lt;br /&gt;A Caledonian Sprite short story.</description>

  <description>FINALIST IN THE PEOPLE'S BOOK PRIZE 2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'You summoned Mephistopheles, Henry. What is your wish?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shadows of Northwell School a demon lurks. His name: Mephistopheles. Four hundred years ago, young John Striven struck a bargain with him in return for help against his murderous foster brother. Nice work for a demon – or it should have been. Because somehow, his plan to trap the 12-year-old went wrong. All he needs now is another soul, in similar desperation, to call on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter 13 year-old Henry Fowst. When you're as desperate as he is, you'll do anything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32595880-the-breath-of-aoles" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pelmen hates being a tanner, but that’s all he would ever be, thanks to the rigid caste system amongst his people, the hevelens. Then he meets Master Galn Boisencroix and his family. The master carpenter opens up a world of archery to young Pelmen, who excels at his newfound skill. But Pelmen’s intractable father will have none of it, and tries to force Pelmen to stay in the tannery.&lt;br /&gt;One day, however, Pelmen’s best friend and Master Galn’s son, Teleg, disappears. Lured away by the prospect of untold riches through mining amberrock, the most precious substance in the world, Teleg finds himself a prisoner of the Nylevs, fierce fire-wielding worshippers of the god of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;Now Pelmen must leave all he knows behind, overcome his fears and travel across the land, in search of his childhood friend. Along the way, he will ally himself with strange and fantastic beings: a shaman who controls the Breath of Aoles, or the power of the wind, a krongos, a creature of the mineral realm who can become living rock, and a malian, adept at water magic.</description>

  <description>The great hunt had begun, and the hevelens were the prey. When would it end, and how? Impossible to predict…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the malian army defeated, the forces of Destruction are laying siege to the Gate of the Canyons and spreading out over the Windy Steppes. For every child of the wind or the water captured and hurled into the Great Rift, a Nylev, a fire-being, is born. Pelmen, Laneth, Lominan and Elisan-Finella must convince the krongos to join them in their desperate struggle, but only a handful of the mineral creatures remain, and Valshhyk, the Immolated, seems unstoppable…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flames of the Immolated is the third and final book of the Ardalia trilogy. It includes a map of Ardalia and a glossary, with a description of the various creatures peculiar to its universe, and suggestions for the pronunciation of some words.</description>

  <description>A Step Outside of Normal is the first in the Read on the Run series. It is an anthology of seven short stories, by five different authors, presenting situations which are almost, but not quite, normal. Not really supernatural, not really fantasy, not really general fiction. But what they all share is that each is a little bit “off”. And short, to suit your busy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;Hell of a Day, by Laurie Axinn Gienapp, is about a young man who has to deal with divorced parents who don’t like each other… but with an unusual setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunnybrook Acres, by Catherine Valenti, is a story of a retirement home, with an unusual cadre of residents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pirates, by Kathleen Terrell, looks at the world out of the eyes of a young child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always, by Theresa Thompson, is a tender story about loss, except that maybe it’s not so tender. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyxyx, by R. S. Leergard, examines the beginning of the world, but perhaps not our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Double, by Laurie Axinn Gienapp, presents a young woman who appears to have a doppelganger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Rage, by Catherine Valenti – well, you’ll just have to read that one.</description>

Determined to fulfil her promise made over Daniel's grave she tries to ensure that Mark Bonner walks strong, tall and unafraid in the living world.

  <description>The once-beautiful domed neo-Victorian city of Bridges is split between four crime families in an uneasy cease-fire. Social disparity increasing and its steam-driven infrastructure failing, a new faction is on the rise: the Red Dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Spadros has a dream life: a wealthy husband, a powerful family. But her life is not what it seems. Kidnapped from her mother's brothel and forced to marry, the murder of her best friend Air ten years before haunts her nightmares. She finds moments of freedom in a small-time private eye business, which she hides in fear of her sadistic father-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air's little brother disappears off his back porch and the Red Dogs are framed for it. With the help of a mysterious gentleman investigator hired by the Red Dogs to learn the truth, Jacqui pushes her abilities to their limits in hope of rescuing the child before the kidnapper disposes of him.</description>

  <description>Would you like an adventure on another planet? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just one of the questions Lara and her sister, Eva, must answer one sunny day in their garden. They wonder, how will they return to Earth in time for lunch? And how will they get there when the aliens' spaceship is so small? &lt;br /&gt;When it's only big enough for ants! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their help is needed on the planet Zeegrazzalo- Jeewoppza so off they go - into the unknown. Their feelings of helplessness only start to fade after a flight across the planet's Outerlands, in Kweezy Capolza's hummingcraft. Maybe, just maybe, the sisters can find some solutions to the aliens' problems. However, they think they might need their mother's help and she is back on Earth!</description>

  <description>How do you solve a mystery when you can’t trust your own sanity? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood private detective Willy Whale finds a severed human nose one morning in his burger. Convinced that he’s either hallucinating or that he is the victim of a cosmic practical joke, Willy initially tries to ignore his gruesome discovery. But when a string of unsolved murders all point back to this sinister first clue, Willy realizes that he has stumbled on a dark secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As all around him A-list stars lose their heads, starlets sell their bodies to become famous, and movie moguls shoot out the holes between their ears, Willy tracks the unknown killer through Hollywood, even as all the evidence seems to point to him being the murderer. Running from his past, his memories, and even his real name, Willy knows he must discover the true killer before the cops begin to look into his identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And time is running out.</description>

  <description>‘You haven’t said a single word since you’ve been here. Is it on purpose?’ I tried to answer David but I couldn’t … my brain wanted to speak but my throat wouldn’t cooperate…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam blames himself for his best friend’s death. After attempting suicide, he is put in the care of a local mental health facility. There, too traumatized to speak, he begins to write notebooks detailing the events leading up to Jake’s murder, trying to understand who is really responsible and cope with how needless it was as a petty argument spiralled out of control and peer pressure took hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad but unsentimental, this is a moving story of friendship and the aftermath of its destruction.</description>

  <description>One gifted young man, sold into slavery, ignites a revolution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the year 2115, twelve families control all wealth in America, the middle class is myth, democracy a con game and the Supreme Court has just legalized a new entertainment and status option for the bored elite—human bondage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spartak Jones, an Olympic bound gymnast, is kidnapped, sold and forced to become the first legal slave since the Civil War, a trophy birthday present for the eldest son of the richest family. Targeted for his physical beauty and athletic talents, the teenager is not shy about using them to survive and protect his family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a war erupts within the ruling class, he proves himself a lethal warrior, fearless, resourceful and photogenic. His swashbuckling exploits awaken a long dormant liberal underground hungry to restore democracy. In a world both familiar and horribly twisted, Spartak becomes a symbol of hope, a flesh and blood icon for an American that used to be and might be again, if he can survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A riveting tale with a powerful political undercurrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, twisted, dystopian, uplifting, and romantic—The Chronicles of Spartak (Rising Son) delivers a 22nd century action hero who will make you cheer.</description>

  <description>-- Collecting Parts 1 - 4 in one Book --&lt;br /&gt;No one knows what lies beneath the surface of another human being: what they desire, what questionable things they have done, and what they are willing to do to get what they want. We take comfort in knowing, or at least hoping, that the skeletons we keep in the closet will never see the light of day. We live on a thin edge, balancing fantasy against reality, always wary of letting the monster inside of us out of the cage, or worse yet, that we may come across someone who already has. It is the thin veil of control that we all exist behind, and our four main characters are about to face the consequences of lifting that veil.&lt;br /&gt;	Roofy Reiner is a Russian ex-wrestler fighting his inner demon, quite literally. Losing control of his body to evil inhibitions and forced out of wrestling for crippling an opponent, his life has dwindled to a pale shadow of its former self. Spending his days lifting weights and being emotionally whipped by a self-indulging tyrant for a wife, Roofy longs to leave and start over, but he no longer has the mental fortitude to see the plans through. A phone call and a teenage girl are about to change all of that, sending him down a road that will have Roofy rediscovering himself and facing his worst fears.&lt;br /&gt;	Saddled with news of a fatal health issue, that he believes is actually demonic possession, and framed for murder, the Russian leaves town with Constance, his youthful neighbor. Longing to escape the boring routines of her dull existence and a mother too self-engaged to be tolerated, the girl invites herself on a journey that will have life-altering ramifications. None of that matters to Constance, though, who is smitten with the ex-wrestler; all she needs to do is continue to control his decisions. She has learned all too quickly that her innocent beauty and cunning words will accomplish that goal.&lt;br /&gt;	Unbeknownst to either, a serial killer is following them. Bent on revenge and blaming Roofy for the transformation that has left him a blood dealing night-stalker, Ambrose has left a trail of grizzly carnage in his wake. Dressing women up as superheroines and disposing of their lives in horrifically unique ways, the crazed, vampire-like murderer is determined to kill everyone the Russian ex-wrestler cares for, culminating in the demise of Roofy himself. &lt;br /&gt;	Hot on the case of the crimes is Richmond P.D. Detective Laura Stenks. Torn between her duties as a law enforcement officer and her twisted desires to sexually reenact the murders being investigated, Laura races to catch up to the unsuspecting travelers before it's too late. The only thing more important than saving them is keeping control of her own haunted, abusive past, and perhaps, her lust for the Russian's physical pleasures. It is an erotic dance on the edge that she cannot resist. The only thing in the way is a teenage girl.&lt;br /&gt;	The four of them, destinies entangled, will collide in the heart of sin city, but will their secrets – their frailties – make them stronger or destroy them all? It all comes down to control...and the lack of it.&lt;br /&gt;	Frailty is a character driven novel at heart, but it's roots are all science fiction. If you like your sci-fi chock full of sarcastic demons, vampires, erotica, and jaw-dropping revelations, then this is the story for you.</description>

Enlisting the help of Lonnie's friends, Chazz and Malika, the group looks to resolve the mystery of not only the woman in white, but of two mysterious men in a van, and the dreaded Bardo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/587533" rel="nofollow"&gt;SmashWords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Melody-Jackson-happened-Lafayette-Street-ebook/dp/B00U4C1TVS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1474309677&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=MELODY+JACKSON#nav-subnav" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/melody-jackson-v.-woman-in/id1053698333?mt=11" rel="nofollow"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/melody-jackson-v-the-woman-in-white-it-happened-on-lafayette-street-season-one-bmb-johnson/1122870960?ean=2940152432435" rel="nofollow"&gt;Barnes and Nobel&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Becoming a teenager always involves challenges. But Neema seems to have more than her fair share. Her brother, Peter, whose only desire is to become a warrior, is where Neema longs to be - secondary school. Their father's plans for her own future are in keeping with Maasai tradition. Her mother's mysterious illness, the reaction of her father's other wives and Aunt Sifa's strange message cause Neema to wonder whether the family has indeed been cursed by the vengeful Red God. In standing against Maasai tradition, she risks the wrath of her father and community. But with determination and the kindly Black God on her side, can Neema find a way to continue her education and break the Red God's curse? Red God Black God is contemporary real-life drama, with a target audience of upper Middle Grade. However it's generating a lot of interest among adults too. The novel explores family relationships and the transition into early teens through the eyes of a young Maasai girl, Neema, whose tribe is undergoing a parallel transition - attempting to uphold traditional values against the encroachment of modern-day advancement. The warring red and black gods of Neema's favourite legend represent her own individual struggle to make sense of what's going on around her and gain a much-desired education.</description>

  <description>Butters Comes Home is the true story, with a few fantasy elements thrown in, of a little Holland Lop bunny who finds his forever home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully illustrated by Rachel Montreuil and lovingly written by Claudette Melanson, follow Butters as he makes his journey from the cold and lonely breeder's shed to his warm and loving forever home. Rabbits are highly intelligent creatures with unique personalities and Butters is a very unique bunny indeed. Children will enjoy the heartwarming story of how this loving little rabbit's fate changes one day, leaving behind a life of discomfort and fear and trading it for a home where he can be emotionally and intellectually stimulated, receive the proper feeding and care and most importantly...be loved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first in a series of Butters' adventures, Butters Comes Home is not only an enjoyable, feel-good story, one which teaches compassion for animals, but also serves as an educational source for rabbit care--furbabies who have special needs which differ greatly from other species of pets.</description>

  <description>Thirty-six-year-old Father John Martin is the youngest priest to have been accepted into the Vatican, the most sacred city on earth. Joining the priesthood at seventeen, this is the only life he s ever known. But everything he and all the world has been led to believe is a lie. He feels he has steered the entire world astray, just as the Bible had foretold. Martin now knows the Catholic Church has been hiding the truth for nearly two thousand years. This shocking discovery leads him to flee the Vatican with a stolen scroll that contains the evidence he s uncovered hidden safely in his suitcase. Looking to leave his sacred life behind, Martin meets Alyssa, falls in love, and they have a baby on the way. But John and his son are about to be tested in ways they could never have imagined. &lt;br /&gt; As John battles with Satan, he wonders if his mother s revelation, uttered just moments before her death, is true: You have been made to suffer so you would learn kindness. You have been made to feel pain so you would learn to comfort. You have known death so you would learn to heal. You, John Martin, are a special man of God. Your life has been created so you will bring about all things. "</description>

  <description>Richard Pours, Philadelphia resident and new college grad, is excited to find his first job. But despite his 4.0 GPA, master's degree, and secret photographic memory, no one will hire him--until a mysterious letter arrives offering him $300,000 to be the recorder on an expedition. Stranger yet, when he arrives for his interview, he doesn't have to convince anyone that he is right for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his unusual interview, Richard is whisked away to meet his travel companions. An impressive mix of doctors specializing in a variety of sciences--and a musician--will accompany Richard on his expedition, which will take them to lands unseen since the dawn of time. The voyage has barely begun when Richard discovers that he's not the only one aboard who has unique abilities--and the uncanny similarities between him and his colleagues don't end there.</description>

  <description>Josie Skye was one of the most accurate meteorologists in the country – but not everyone considered that a good thing. When weather forecasters and others start disappearing or dying and Josie fears she's one of the targets, she teams up with weather researcher, Oliver Burns, to try to find some of their missing colleagues and figure out what's going on. And what's with all these butterflies?</description>

  <description>Sean here. When wolf-riding trolls attack our house, my sister Fiona and I find out the hard way that we're destined to be heroes. That goes for our friends Arturo and Parvati, too. Next thing we know, we're all enrolled in the last hero school on Midgard (that’s hero speak for 'Earth'). In fact, we're the entire final freshman class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not all bad. We get to go to school on an enchanted island. The girls get to ride flying horses, Arturo gets to go berserk, and I get to learn more about swordfighting than I ever wanted to know. We also get our own personal bard who sings our praises in deathless...well, verse that you wish would die, but it won't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'd think we’d also get to save the world. But as it turns out, there are about a million prophecies guaranteeing that Ragnarok is right around the corner and the world is literally toast, so all we get to do is die (heroically, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, our mom winds up in Hel while trying to rescue our dad from, believe it or not, an even worse place. And for some reason even Odin won't explain, we're the only ones who can bring them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that takes care of summer vacation. I can't wait for the school year to start!</description>

  <description>Elaina Maury Curtis inherits her family's estate in Maury, Florida, and moves in to the dismay of some local citizens. They know Elaina isn't going anywhere, though. Her uncle founded the town, and she's married to Rob Curtis, the local chief of police. Still, townsfolk want her gone, because murder didn't come to Maury until she arrived. Fortunately for Elaina, her tearoom and charming bed and breakfast businesses are going well. Unfortunately, she soon comes upon a ghost in her tearoom and finds a burial mound on her family's land just as murder rocks the small town once again. Rob and his sidekick deputy, Jimmy Dougal, take the case, but it's clear they aren't making any progress. Elaina makes it her responsibility to sniff out the killer with the help of Irish wolfhound, Chloe, but she uncovers more secrets in her own home than she ever could have expected. Now, suspects are plenty, as are motives, and why is there a ghost in her tearoom? As the suspense grows, it's possible Elaina could be the next victim unless she solves this mystery first.</description>

  <description>Wilbur Bone must use all his inner-strength to control his emotions as he drives his lifelong best friend, Michael Moresby, to the airport for the last time. On the seat next to him, is a box containing Michael s remains. Minutes later, Wilbur steps onto a two-seater plane with Michael s ashes and heads to Lake Ontario where he carries out his friend s final wishes. As Wilbur begins grieving his loss, he learns that Michael has left him his dive boat and business, sixteen photographs of sunken ships, and a mysterious poem. But there is only one problem: Wilbur has never conquered the fears that overtake him when he dives. Still, Wilbur knows that Michael spent a lifetime fruitlessly diving for treasure and feels obligated to continue his quest. Now as danger looms ahead, Wilbur must determine whether the clues will actually lead to riches and, more importantly, if he can survive the treacherous, deep waters of Lake Ontario. White Treasure is the thrilling tale of a retired English teacher s adventure after he inherits his best friend s diving boat and risky mission beneath the surface of a Canadian lake."</description>

  <description>Sophie Mills is, or rather was, a bitch. When she is brutally slaughtered and trapped as a ghost in her new apartment building, she is forced to become a servant to the other side; battling a demon killer of ghosts, ushering the newly dead to their "next chapter," and handling the annoying resident ghosts who refuse to leave. All while trying (and often failing) not to make everything even worse. Warning: explicit sexual content, graphic violence, and profanity</description>

  <description>Headstrong. Rachel Kinsey fits the description perfectly. The divorced soccer mom may be ditzy and as sympathetic to losers as a charity, but she knows what she wants. A man completely different from her unreliable ex-husband and the outrageous characters she’s usually doomed to attract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Jim Landers, the ideal candidate. An accidental encounter introduces her to the tall, dark attorney who loves soccer and kids. The only problem? He’s not prepared for a ready-made family and a woman as comfortable as a beloved sweater rather than a beauty queen. A woman whose kindness, enthusiasm for life, and unguarded honesty may disturb a man who values order, perfection, and serenity. Jim turns to the flawless yet distant Donna as a substitute for Rachel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She should show him how much he means to her, but rejection from an absent father and a capricious ex-husband may have ruined Rachel’s ability to connect to Jim Will she risk herself, her son and their future by revealing how much Jim means to her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A touching, tender tale full of gentle humor, about thinking too much and feeling too little. Rachel must learn to be heart-strong in order to find her soul mate.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Why we all deserve a life worth living and a death worth dying for&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Most men don’t fear death. They fear those things – the knife, the shipwreck, the illness, the bomb – which precede, by microseconds if you’re lucky, and many years if you’re not, the moment of death.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Terry Pratchett was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in his fifties he was angry - not with death but with the disease that would take him there, and with the suffering disease can cause when we are not allowed to put an end to it. In this essay, broadcast to millions as the BBC Richard Dimblebly Lecture 2010 and previously only available as part of &lt;i&gt;A Slip of the Keyboard&lt;/i&gt;, he argues for our right to choose - our right to a good life, and a good death too.</description>

  <description>Dr. Eitan Green is a good man. He saves lives. Then, speeding along a deserted moonlit road in his SUV, he hits someone. Seeing that the man, an African migrant, is beyond help, he flees the scene. It is a decision that changes everything. Because the dead man’s wife knows what happened. When she knocks at Eitan’s door the next day, tall and beautiful, he discovers that her price is not money. It is something else entirely, something that will shatter Eitan’s safe existence and take him into a world of secrets and lies. &lt;i&gt;Waking Lions&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping, suspenseful and morally devastating drama of guilt and survival, shame and desire.</description>

  <description>Lenny Petrocelli had always been a slacker, a mediocre low-life, getting by on his good looks and street smarts. One day he woke up. Entangled by his gangland bosses in the web of child prostitution and human trafficking, he was being set up as the fall guy to take the rap, if the horrifying but lucrative enterprise went down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the violence and abuse young girls from Asia were subjected to in the gruesome world of sex slavery, Lenny did the most difficult but the most important thing in his entire life: He became a better person. Now he would risk everything, even his life, to put an end to this savage exploitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peer into this awful world. See it through Lenny’s eyes. Discover what’s possible even in the face of the worst, most pernicious evil and cruelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embrace the promise of redemption and the power of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this gritty novel rings true, it’s for good reason. “Petrocelli” is based on actual stories from a violent and gruesome under-world, where millions of children and adolescents across the globe are held in bondage as slaves.</description>

  <description>Becoming a teenager always involves challenges and Neema seems to have more than her fair share. She wants a secondary school education like her brother, but their father has more traditional plans for Neema's future. Her mother's mysterious illness and aunt's strange message make her wonder whether her family has indeed been cursed by the vengeful Red God. In standing against Maasai tradition, Neema risks the wrath of her father and community. With determination and the kindly Black God on her side, can Neema finally find a way to continue her education and break the family curse?</description>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Matt Archer spends his days studying Algebra, hanging out with his best friend and crushing on the Goddess of Greenhill High, Ella Mitchell. To be honest, he thinks his life is pretty lame until he discovers something terrifying on a weekend camping trip at the local state park. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monsters are real. And living in his backyard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's not the half of it. After Matt is forced to kill a strange creature to save his uncle, he finds out that the weird knife he took from his uncle's bag has a secret, one that will change Matt's life. The knife was designed with one purpose: to hunt monsters. And it's chosen Matt as its wielder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Matt's part of a world he didn't know existed, working with a covert military unit dedicated to eliminating walking nightmares. Faced with a prophecy about a looming dark war, Matt soon realizes his upcoming Algebra test is the least of his worries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His new double life leaves Matt wondering which is tougher: hunting monsters or asking Ella Mitchell for a date?</description>

  <description>“For women readers, this is a romantic international spy novel; for men, it’s an international spy novel with romance – all wrapped up in a true life suspense thriller written with Dan Brown flare.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First in the SILENT CATS series, JD Wallace's Deadly Dance spins the mind-bending, genre-blurring fictionalized true story based on the life of Kat, the youngest Kidon Katsa Assassin in the history of Mossad, and her husband, Pantera, the fabled Chief Black Site Interrogator, who worked under such special access programs as the Operation Copper Green (created under Donald Rumsfeld), the United Nations Security Council – Special Operations Group (UN-SOG), and Task Forces 88 and 121.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaching back to 1989, Kat and Pantera meet in the City of Seven Hills, beautiful Rome, Italy, at a U.S. Embassy New Year’s Eve ball, kicking off their 16-year relationship in the onion-layered world of covert operatives, spy hunters, slave traders, and sovereign-paid intelligence peddlers. Of necessity, their encounters are beset by lies wrapped in half-truths, concealed in shadowy realities. Kat and Pantera maneuver through action-packed covert operations, romantic encounters, torture, and acrobatic combat, all while coming to grips about who they’re hunting and who is hunting them.</description>

  <description>SOME PEOPLE LIVE UNDER OCCUPATION.&lt;br /&gt;SOME PEOPLE OCCUPY THEMSELVES.&lt;br /&gt;NO ONE IS FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step into a world which is both magically fictitious and shockingly real, to follow the lives of Tamsin, Ellie, Arun and Charlie; a refugee, native, occupier and economic migrant. Watch them grow up during a halcyon past, an everyday present, and a dystopian future. And be prepared to be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the occupations of Palestine, Kurdistan and Tibet, and by the corporate occupation of the west, ‘Occupied’ is a haunting glance into a society which is a little too familiar for comfort. It truly is a unique piece of literary fiction…</description>

      <![CDATA[The basic story in this is sound but I feel that the characters aren't fully fleshed out. This means a lot of the time there is very little holding it all together and the interaction between the characters often leaves a lot to be desired. The dialogue between the characters is very stilted whic...]]>

  <description>To avert an impending life of servitude, Bethany Cook seeks freedom on a wagon train bound for gold country. Disguised as a young boy she secures work as a travel companion with Thomas Nolan, a rich New Yorker who is on his own quest to distance himself from the nightmare of a fraudulent marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A cross-country journey by Thomas’ side proves more difficult than Bethany anticipated when he becomes obsessed with her true identity—the golden haired beauty he shared one night of passion with. Bethany attempts to confess the truth, but a bounty hunter exposes her as a devious woman that lied to Thomas for months for her own evil gain. Her life and her heart now rest in the hands of Thomas, who must decide if he can forgive and marry her or leave her to the fate she’s brought upon herself.</description>

While there are some steamy scenes there is no foul language and nor is there any 'dirty talk'.<br /><br />Without giving plot spoilers this was a refre...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Magic and Mayhem in Manhattan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francesca Bellafiore comes from a nice Jewish family -- one that happens to have magical powers. Underneath her good-girl exterior, though, she’s a wannabe badass with dreams of becoming a paranormal detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Party boy Rafael Muñoz does everything possible to publicly disappoint his high profile father. Privately, it's a different story. His carefully crafted bad boy reputation masks the fact he’s a master illusionist, forced into solo covert ops. The role is wearing thin and Rafael longs to be part of a team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Francesca and Rafael meet, it’s love at first sight… For about five minutes. Rafael is spectacularly attractive—and, Francesca discovers, fully aware of the fact. Rafael knows from experience that girls like Francesca are more trouble than they’re worth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it sucks big time when they’re caught in a web of magic, minions, secrets, and enough sexual tension to power NYC. Their only chance to save the city and survive is to team up, trust each other–and maybe even fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Provided they don't kill each other first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get Real&lt;/i&gt; is a romantic comedy, urban fantasy whirlwind with sass, sex, and swoon.</description>

  <description>Trigger is once again sitting at home in front of his computer; only this time, he's got a stomach full of powerful anti-depressants and gin. As an outcast that's becoming disillusioned by society's increasing addiction to social media, he decides to end it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He posts his suicide note on Fortune-69.com, his digital playground of choice, but things don't go exactly as planned. When Trigger unexpectedly wakes up the next morning, he quickly learns two things: at some point during the night he unknowingly posted an inspirational message that was deleted by moderators, and that he now has a legion of anonymous followers who want to follow his every command. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to find a way to cope with his bizarre family history, Trigger finds himself tangled up with a sexually liberated cosplayer who pushes him to his limits and a mysterious hacker, intent on changing the world through digital anarchy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love, revenge... and the law of unintended consequences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While attending his brother's funeral, Mark suspects a second murder is being planned. He evades his enemies and prepares his attack when love strikes. The two forces of nature will battle for Mark's soul with tragic consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started one night and followed me for days and weeks and months. How I &lt;i&gt;prayed&lt;/i&gt; it would stop!&lt;br /&gt; Little did I know the ending would turn out to be the worst part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear the sound of the phone like in a dream.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would stop after two rings, like the postman used to, but the obvious criminal intent of this annoying instrument of obstruction makes me think it will not relent so easily.&lt;br /&gt;It's three o'clock at night.&lt;br /&gt;A wicked hour for a call.&lt;br /&gt;I pick up and a strange voice, coming from the other end of the world, tells me that my brother is dead.&lt;br /&gt;And this is how the nightmare begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six days have passed since I received the call.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we buried my brother.&lt;br /&gt;I hate their criminal minds.&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow is predicted to be another day in hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Murder My Love&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A now outdated theory postulates that the measure of a man is best revealed during love and war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After his brother is murdered, Mark fears the action plan calls for a second killing,this time his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He decides to escape and plot his revenge. &lt;br /&gt;But with murder on the mind, while evading his pursuers, love strikes. The two forces of nature will battle for Mark's soul with tragic consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Copyright © 2015 M. V. Luca</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a really easy read which seems to drift along through the crazy life of professional criminals and hit men.

  <description>Rebecca and Gideon have been married for years and they are enjoying life happily when a tragic accident happens. They both die in the accident and are waiting to see what their fate will be. God makes them live the last three months of their life again separately on earth and they have to go through a series of trials to find each other again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'I'll meet you in heaven!' Gideon promises as they are separated and cast back onto the earth in bodily forms which are no longer fully human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their unity was their strength, their bind, their soul, their separation yields a yearning to find each other again that nothing else can fulfill. Was God so cruel as to create this special love then remove it and test it? Will they ever see each other again? Will they be reunited? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Gideon's promise ever really come true? Rebecca yearns for the answers to these questions and more as she seeks for a purpose. Why were they cast back onto the earth, is the earth they have been cast back down onto real or is it merely a waiting room for death? What if at the end of it all there is nothing? What if its a deception and she never sees Gideon again. Can there be life whilst you are waiting for a love to be rekindled or is it just an empty existence void of promises and truths? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if she really died in the accident and he didn't and her mind is tricking her to believe something that did not exist. Or what if Gideon really died and she didn't and this is her imagination's way of shielding her from the grief of loss?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Rebecca really meet Gideon again in Heaven or was the promise an illusion which will never be fulfilled?</description>

Her family told her she was going on a little holiday, and although she finds herself still on her beloved Isle of Wight, to her horror she is now living permanently in a residential home at the mercy of Bridie, the ‘horrible’ one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make what is left of her life happier she thinks about years gone by, and once again wonders about the strange disappearance of her 14 year old sister Violet in 1897. However, every cloud has a silver lining, and amidst the daily horror of her life she is delighted to find out that somebody at the home can shed new light on the mystery.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32693558-so-what-do-i-do" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thriller of the “Why’d they do it?” category and the book stands alone with its intriguing trail of catch-up between the police and the criminals. A crime that goes badly wrong in its execution, and goes on to tragically affect the local school community, produces a trail of chaos. It’s a winding trail that the reader must try to follow and which two ex-pupils from the school, one a detective and the other his violent quarry, take around Britain only to end at its shocking conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In So What Do I Do?, the third novel in the So What! series, we see the return of a few of readers' favourite characters from the previous books. Constable Nigel Shantra returns as a detective, determined to bring to justice Kyle Crabbe, the psychotic adversary of his from the first So What! novel. And just what does a class of cheeky chimps, and a large black spider monkey, have to do with the traumatic events surrounding Hodgson's Hide - the legacy of retired Technology teacher Gil Hodgson?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly is back also, now as an experienced teacher and a new mum. She's trying to come to terms with the major changes planned for Birch Green High School, while she and Oliver have dramatic plans of their own that could seriously affect both their careers. Still anxious to save the natural environment and its wildlife, Molly is also troubled by the plight of the neglected children of the world and climate change. Is she ever going to settle down to a blissful life of domesticity with her family when so many problems insist on grabbing her attention?&lt;br /&gt;When a conspiracy to defraud the local populace, devised by two apparently respectable but unscrupulous pillars of the community, goes disastrously wrong it results in an intriguing case for detective constable Shantra to solve. The traumatic events that ensue will prove to affect the haplessly incompetent pair of criminal perpetrators, hired by the swindling conspirators, as well as the teachers and pupils of Birch Green High School.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently promoted Molly discovers that the pressures of helping newly qualified teachers, like James Gibborn, to cope with unruly classes bear no comparison to the eventual strain that she and her colleagues experience when an ex-pupil of the school decides it’s time for payback. This bullying past enemy of Nigel Shantra and his brother, Adam, will prove to be far more ruthless and cruel than anyone could have imagined in order to achieve his criminal ambitions. But he is just as likely to turn his attention towards anyone who upsets his plans, with terrifying consequences for those who won’t comply with his wishes.</description>

  <description>Along the Great Rift, in the heart of the volcano Ixal, Valshhyk the Immolated is stirring. The creatures corrupted by his putrid fumes are growing in number daily. Within the fiery walls of Sinista the amberrock swords, axes and lances of an army of outcasts gleam, waiting. The day is drawing near when the ties binding the dark god will collapse. Then, the nylevs will surge forward from the depths of the abyss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pelmen, Xuven, Teleg, Elisan-Finella and Lominan, the Messengers of Destiny, have an urgent mission. However, dissent soon rears its ugly head and they go their separate ways. Who among the Children of Aoles or Malia will succeed in warning the world of the danger it faces? When the time comes to confront the servants of the Sacred Fire, will the Breath of Aoles and the power of Turquoise Water be enough to defeat them?</description>

And she's in some serious trouble. The majority of the company's shares have been bought out by none other than Maddie's ex-boyfriend, self-made billionaire Nick Holter. Now Maddie needs his help...even if it means buying Nick from a charity bachelor auction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Kingstons destroyed his grandfather's career, Nick vowed to take over their company. He's inches from victory when he finds himself bought and paid for...by his sexy ex-girlfriend who's hell-bent on saving her family's company.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;ACE for ASIN: B005C1N24I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Black Thursday triggers financial despondency, three young couples in New York City must trade their lives of luxury for poverty, tragedy, and setbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jonathan Garrett's brokerage firm collapses on the day of the Stock Market Crash, he unites with his closest friends (and former business partners), Aryl and Caleb, to relocate, track down a low-paying job, and cultivate a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the three men toil in their laborious jobs, their wives, Ava, Arianna, and Claire, slowly adapt to life in a shabby, rundown apartment, learning to sew, cook, and clean. With the help of their former, outspoken, Irish maid, Maura, and a new, equally Irish friend, Shannon, the wives become even closer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couples' rocky path leads to more turmoil, however, when a business rival, Victor Drayton, creates one disaster after another. From petty tricks to outright violence, Victor's nefarious mind will stop at nothing to beat down Jonathan's last glimmer of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite everything, Jonathan and his friends are fixated on surviving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotional and financial destruction nip at their heels, until finally, with a lucky twist of fate, they escape city life and begin anew in their hometown of Rockport, Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story set in the past, 1929 is full of romance, drama, and humor. Vivid, expertly crafted characters make this novel more than memorable–1929 is unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Everyone has secrets... What if you didn't know your own?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One young man with latent supernatural abilities plus one street gang hell-bent on recruiting him equals... IA: Initiate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most important&lt;/b&gt; thing in the world to thirteen-year-old orphan, "Naz" Andersen is keeping his little sister safe from the streets of a Chicago/Detroit-like urban ghetto known as the Exclave. Naz tries to stay out of the way at his foster parent's home, but he walks in his sleep. He is unable to keep the fact that he hears voices from his therapist. He attempts to go unnoticed at school and in the streets of the Exclave but attracts the attention of friends and bullies alike. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Naz is ordinary, or so he thinks. He harbors a secret of which he is unaware. A seemingly random act of gang violence propels Naz on a path that leads to discoveries about his supernatural abilities, abilities that will ultimately decide whether he lives or dies. Now he must navigate his turbulent surroundings and face the full force of the world around him. The only way he can survive is to discover the supernatural world within. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pure science fiction, IA: Initiate is the first book in a YA supernatural thriller trilogy, an origin story, and a coming of age hero's journey set in the mean streets of America. It's like Anakin Skywalker growing up in a bad urban environment instead of a desert planet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Award-winning author, John Darryl Winston has penned a story about, and for, those living the real story. Pick it up. Pick it up! PICK IT UP ... today!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>FIRST CONTRACT: A decade ago, JJ Stoner was a soldier. He killed people for a living and made no bones about it. On a scorching day in the Iraqi desert, when British blood stained the sand, he over-stepped the mark. Men died in compromising circumstances; too many men for an easy explanation. Faced with a dishonourable discharge and accusations of murder, Stoner accepted an offer from a stranger who represented an intelligence agency. Suddenly, Stoner found himself half a world away and about to execute his first private contract… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST CONTRACT, a short story, introduces the central character from the JJ Stoner / Killing Sisters series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first full-length book in that series, ‘A Last Act of Charity’, is published in September 2014. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as a complete, stand-alone story, First Contract includes an excerpt from ‘A Last Act of Charity’ and a sneak preview of the second book in the series, ‘The Corruption of Chastity.’ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing about ‘A Last Act of Charity’, R J Ellory, award-winning author of ‘A Quiet Belief In Angels’, said: &lt;br /&gt;'Guns, girls, guitars and scenes of gruesome violence, all shot through with a wit sharp enough to draw blood. With terse and brilliant prose, Westworth delivers a plot that drags you along relentlessly. &lt;br /&gt;‘Loved it, unconditionally.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the author: Frank Westworth shares several characteristics with JJ Stoner: they both play mean blues guitar and ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Unlike Stoner, Frank hasn't deliberately killed anyone. Instead, he edits a classic motorcycle magazine and has written extensively for the UK motoring press.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A true dream is when the events I see in my sleep have, or will happen. It’s a talent that runs in my family. I was thirteen when I had my first true dream.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana wishes she wasn’t a princess. She’s always being told how to behave, what to wear. There’s a strangeness in the castle – why will no one talk about the Guardian, or the necklace that protects the land? And why does her father look at her with such sorrow? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to A Necklace of Souls: a story of love and loss, of shattered lives and desperate hopes. In the Kingdom of the Rose, bravery is not always measured by strength and magic is real, if only one has the courage to dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortlisted for the Sir Julius Vogel Award, A Necklace of Souls was awarded the Tessa Duder Award for Young Adult Fiction, Best First Book at the New Zealand Post Children and Young Adult Book Awards and is a Storylines Notable Book.</description>

Marriott takes us on a journey through the eyes of Diego, a young guitarist, as he struggles to find his path in life. It's a touching tale which will not only have you reaching for the next in the series, but maybe your backpack as well." - Richard Paul Evans, #1 New York Times Bestselling Author &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diego is drifting. He has been content with living his life in a sun-scorched village that lies on the route of the pilgrim path: The Camino de Santiago. But one stormy night, change is forced upon Diego when his father, Eduardo, the local candyfloss maker, unexpectedly catches him entertaining a captivated crowd with flamenco guitar rhythms. At that moment, Eduardo lets go of the ghosts from his past and realises it's time for Diego to find his path in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eduardo arranges for Diego to live and work on a farm and sends him on his way with the gift of his old Spanish guitar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Diego commit to working on the farm, or will he confront his destiny on the road where a million pilgrims have passed before him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - WARNING (By Candyfloss Guitar Readers) - - - - - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Very inspirational!" &lt;br /&gt;"I could NOT PUT IT DOWN!!" &lt;br /&gt;"Loved it" &lt;br /&gt;"great characters" &lt;br /&gt;"A great read!" &lt;br /&gt;"This story sucks you right in." &lt;br /&gt;"Very well crafted, and executed." &lt;br /&gt;"I would recommend this story to everyone." &lt;br /&gt;"A very enjoyable read." &lt;br /&gt;"Excellent storytelling..." &lt;br /&gt;"I am looking forward to hearing more" &lt;br /&gt;"Fascinating story!" &lt;br /&gt;"swept away in this story about self-discovery" &lt;br /&gt;"I wanted more, much more." &lt;br /&gt;"Thought provoking!" &lt;br /&gt;"a fantastic story about self-discovery." &lt;br /&gt;"I absolutely loved it." &lt;br /&gt;"I definitely recommend reading this." &lt;br /&gt;"Filled with lushly descriptive language" &lt;br /&gt;"Surprised me with both its subject and quality." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people Diego encounters on the way and the faith they share will take him on a much longer journey, one that once would have seemed unimaginable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candyfloss Guitar is the first book in the Reluctant Pilgrim series about one man's journey of self-discovery and the hope he will eventually bring to others. A journey both physical and spiritual, guided at times by the unlikeliest of angels!</description>

  <description>The prophecy, a foretelling of a great king born of dragon-human-elven blood that unites all of the races in a millennium of peace is an ancient story told to all dragon hatchlings from the Dragon Book of Lore. A foretelling born of old majic, through the centuries, became just another story to give the young hope. The old believed...the young cannot perceive how it could ever manifest; who would ever want to be other than pure blood dragon? The prophecy existed in story only, until Anaterri Strayarth, a blue dragon living in human form and the daughter of Stragor Strayarth - Head of the High Council of Dragons, saves the life of Prince Leandro Sargovia with a transfusion of her dragon blood. The unification of human-dragon blood sets in motion the beginning of the once dormant tale and a love that transcends time. Grand Magi Aloysius Alamaris, a black dragon hiding in human form, learns of the initiation of the prophecy and plots the ultimate destruction of all who seek to bring the prophecy to fruition. Anaterri and Leandro are now pitted against the ultimate evil, fighting not only for their own lives but also the lives of their children...and they must insure the prophecy is allowed to manifest...at all cost.</description>

  <description>WARNING! The book contains material some readers may find shocking or offensive. Also, there are strong emotional triggers. Themes include BDSM, suicide, murder, violence, blood, scarification, non-consensual sex, M/M sex. If any of these offend you or could act as triggers, please refrain from buying it. Also, please be aware that some of the stories contain material suitable only for adults. (+18) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen short stories on desire, darkness, and the webs we weave. Just like in theater, the face behind the monster is human. Just like a splendid dusk, truth is never black or white. Care to join me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampires, Death, a demon, an Archangel, a pixie, a dominatrix, an assassin, a photographer, a rock star, a genetically modified warrior of the future and several humans populate the pages of this book. That, of course, without counting the cats... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection contains two award winning stories: Interlude and Saturday Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sylph- The way we see reality determines our reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interlude- Allow me to introduce you Mr. Dorian Wilford, antiques dealer and collector… with a second, more disturbing hobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday night- When escape is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judas- Best to let sleeping dogs lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodnight- Love came a moment too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rendez-vous- The rock star in question bit off more than he could chew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misapprehension- After all, a girl just wants to have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance- It blooms in the most unlikely places and bears its thorns with pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Luck- An agent of chaos meets a singer of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mobius- It’s just so wrong that it’s inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death and the Maiden- And cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Man of Good Fortune- “Graveyards are full of those who considered themselves invincible.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endymion- Even a god of war needs someone to come home to.</description>

  <description>Metal Flesh (After Eden Series: Tek-Fall, Episode I) is the companion novella in the After Eden science fiction and international thriller series by Austin Dragon—a dramatic mix of politics, religion, and intrigue. The sci-fi, adventure follows the hunt for the elusive “Man Made Out of String.” But who is this contract killer—or what is he? From the tek-cities of America to the Outlands of the Middle East, the sci-fi adventure thriller continues in the year 2093. Tek-World loves its artificial-intelligent mechanization, including robotic pets and ubiquitous drones. But humans have also created machines in their image—robots—using metal instead of flesh.</description>

  <description>The Odyssey of Daniel Bonner. The first chapter finds Daniel Bonner as frightened fifteen year-old making an escape from a young offenders' institution, incarcerated for a crime of which he is innocent. During a harrowing escape he receives unexpected help from a total stranger who later becomes his mentor, to aid and abet his survival as a fugitive on the open moor. Daniel learns to trust him implicitly in what is seemingly an unbreakable friendship, and remains unaware that the stranger, Anthony Windrow, has a hidden, and altogether, sinister agenda. At the time of his escape, Danny, unwittingly, sells his soul to the Devil, and nothing in this, or any other world comes free. Anthony Windrow, hell's second-in-command, otherwise known as the Chancellor, sets Daniel on a course to leave the moor and make his fortune, hoping that greed would be the catalyst to turn him into the perfect representative for the forces of evil in the living world. However, no one had counted on Daniels inbuilt sense of right and wrong. With an act of selfless philanthropy he undermines the Chancellor's plan, proving that his path through life is destined to carry him on a very different journey; to become the Chancellor's nemesis.</description>

  <description>On a sultry afternoon in the summer of 1936 a woman accidentally interrupts an attempted murder in a London hotel room. Nina Land, a West End actress, faces a dilemma: she’s not supposed to be at the hotel in the first place, and certainly not with a married man. But once it becomes apparent that she may have seen the face of the man the newspapers have dubbed ‘the Tie-Pin Killer’ she realises that another woman's life could be at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Erskine is the raffish doyen of theatre critics who fears that his star is fading: age and drink are catching up with him, and in his late-night escapades with young men he walks a tightrope that may snap at any moment. He has depended for years on his loyal and longsuffering secretary Tom, who has a secret of his own to protect. Tom’s chance encounter with Madeleine Farewell, a lost young woman haunted by premonitions of catastrophe, closes the circle: it was Madeleine who narrowly escaped the killer’s stranglehold that afternoon, and now walks the streets in terror of his finding her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Curtain Call&lt;/i&gt; is a comedy of manners, and a tragedy of mistaken intentions. From the glittering murk of Soho’s demi-monde to the grease paint and ghost-lights of theatreland, the story plunges on through smoky clubrooms, tawdry hotels and drag balls towards a denouement in which two women are stalked by the same killer. As bracing as a cold Martini and as bright as a new tie-pin, it is a poignant and gripping story about love and death and a society dancing towards the abyss.</description>

And with the infected now outnumbering their human counterparts, chances for survival lessen with each passing day. After running out of food in his condo, Jake must make his way across the Salt Lake Valley to reach the safety of the mountains, and he must use his wiles to avoid the packs of infected roaming the streets. But Jake is haunted by a devastating personal tragedy he can't let go of, and his journey of survival quickly turns into a quest for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as he’s about to reach the safety of the mountains, a phone call changes everything. A woman and her child need help and Jake finally sees an opportunity to redeem himself. But will his helping them put them in harm's way? Jake is being stalked by a brutal and sadistic alpha (by far the most dangerous of the infected). In the end, Jake will have to decide how far he's willing to go to keep them safe and earn the redemption he seeks.</description>

  <description>Richard Ford returns to the territory that sealed his reputation as a master: the world of Frank Bascombe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his trio of bestselling novels – The Sportswriter, Pulitzer Prize and PEN/Faulkner-winning Independence Day, and The Lay of the Land – Richard Ford set out the zeitgeist of an entire generation, through the divining and wit of his now-famous literary chronicler, Frank Bascombe, one of the most indelible, provocative and anticipated characters in modern American literature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Let Me Be Frank With You, Ford returns with four deftly linked Christmas stories narrated by the iconic Bascombe. Now sixty-eight, Frank resides again in the New Jersey suburb of Haddam, and has thrived – seemingly but not utterly – amidst the devastations of Hurricane Sandy. The desolations of Sandy, which left houses, shorelines and countless lives unmoored and flattened, are the perfect backdrop and touchstone for Ford – and Bascombe. With a flawless comedic sensibility and unblinking intelligence, these stories range over the full complement of universal subjects: ageing, race, loss, faith, marriage, the real estate debacle – the tumult of the world we live in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Bascombe – funny, profane, touching, wise, often inappropriate – we share the aspirations and sorrows, longings, achievements and failings of American life in the morning of the new century. With his trademark candour and brimming wit, Richard Ford brings Bascombe back in all his imperfect glory to say (often hilariously) what all of us are thinking but few will voice aloud.</description>

      <![CDATA[This one was really hard going for me. It is well written with a rounded central character in Frank Bascombe living life through the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy but, for me, it lacked engagement and offered nothing to grab my attention and keep me held.

  <description>In the course of one days time, Princess Genevieve Cheval discovers that her ears are starting to point, that she is really the daughter of an Elven Princess that died giving birth to her and that she has inherited the only weapon that can kill the evil beast overtaking the forbidden forest…which also happens to be the step-brother she never knew she had.&lt;br /&gt;	Drawn into the forbidden forest by a mysterious dream, Genevieve is led to Queen Bellaserena of the Pegasaurs by two young elven brothers. She discovers the Queen is with foal and due at any moment. Delivering the young one, Genevieve saves the life of the Queen and her son with the weapon she’d inherited from her dead mother. Bellaserena informs Genevieve that the young Princess is destined to a power and a life greater than she’d ever imagined. Now, not only seeking her elven family of origin, she finds out that she is an integral part of the Prophecy as told in the ancient Dragon Book of Lore. Embroiled in battle to save the forest and her elven kinsmen from the bloodvine, she soon discovers there is an ancient evil set to destroy her and the man she loves, King Leto Sargovia. Aware that this is a battle to the death, she is ready to commit to any action that will allow the Prophecy to manifest.</description>

  <description>Maura finally found the truth she was always seeking…or has she? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being left in the dark for all of her life, Maura’s father, Maxwell, has finally returned to reveal sinister family secrets Maura could never have dreamed possible—including his revelation that she is one of The Born. But his daughter soon discovers both he and her mother are keeping pieces of her reality hidden, still. As Maura struggles to unravel the mysteries surrounding her new existence and discover every piece of the cryptic puzzle, life appears intent on casting stumbling blocks across her path with every step forward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tragedy seems to stalk Maura, and those around her, as she stumbles along, altering the young changeling’s family, just when they have all come back together. The changes left in its wake could be for the better, or may threaten their existence, entirely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the arrival of Christmas comes the opportunity for Maura to draw close to everyone she loves—and finally reunite with Ron, her long-distance boyfriend. But permanence has always eluded her, and in her current state of flux this pattern endures, as fate seems intent on snapping the threads that bind her to those she holds most dear. Maxwell’s good intentions pave a road for Maura, littered with misery, while her mother, Caelyn’s, desire to shield her family from pain may tear her away from them, altogether. The perfect happiness in the young vampire’s grasp is so easily swept away and dragged under, out of reach. Can Maura erupt from the darkness and confusion to break the surface and find the life she’s always dreamed of? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of chaos, assistance materializes in the form of another of her kind—ephemerally beautiful, yet explosively volatile, this new vampire may prove capable of unlocking the puzzle-box Maxwell seems intent on securing from her sight. Maura will discover the darkest parts of herself in her quest to understand the being she is destined to become. Her newfound friend has some shady intentions of his own—such as thwarting the love that has grown between Maura and Ron. Following in the wake of the impulsive vampire’s misguided instruction may further pull a naive Maura down into the depths of ultimate despair, heartbreak…and even destruction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undertow: Death’s Twilight is the second book in the Maura DeLuca trilogy and the sequel to Rising Tide: Dark Innocence. In this dark, urban fantasy, readers will discover a world full of uncommon vampires, troubled romance and a splash of blood—and uniquely devoid of werewolves. The rollercoaster that is Maura’s life continues in this YA, paranormal novel that fans of the Twilight series, Vampire Diaries, and Vampire Academy will love. Reminiscent of the classic Fairy Tale, the characters introduced in this series are at the other end of the spectrum from the vampire found in the age of Bram Stoker and his famous Dracula. Although there are ties to the myths created by Stoker and his timeless novel, the Maura DeLuca story possesses a sprinkle of magic, coupled with ‘monsters’ that—in most cases—retain the majority of their humanity.</description>

  <description>Irene, a gifted young artist, always paints with a mirror strategically positioned behind her, as an aid with perspective. As she puts the finishing touches to her latest painting, and studies its reflection in the mirror. She is shocked to see an extremely tall man, half hidden by the trees staring back at her. &lt;br /&gt;Irene had not placed a figure in the painting. So who was he? Where did he come from? &lt;br /&gt;When she examines the canvas, there is no one there! &lt;br /&gt;Puzzled and a little apprehensive, Irene turns, and refocuses on the mirror. To her astonishment, the glass appears strangely liquid. She tentatively puts her hand out to touch it, and in a split second finds herself transported into the world of her own painting.&lt;br /&gt;In this strange and frightening place, Irene meets the mysterious tall man, and embarks on a journey that will test every ounce of courage and faith she possesses.</description>

  <description>Plagued by memories of the fire that claimed her family when she was younger, Savannah suffers from insomnia and nightmares. Although she is seeking help, Savannah finds that the best therapy is when Sandman visits her at night and not only soothes her mind, but also her body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is the only man she dares allow in her bed for fear that her issues would scare off a mere mortal. However, what starts off as a chance encounter with Jed, a handsome stranger, becomes a repeated occurrence as Savannah continually runs into him at a local coffee house. As much as the idea of dating Jed is appealing to her, she won’t accept his advances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can nightly visits from her other-worldly suitor help Savannah to move on with her life and take a chance on love? Or, will she decide that Sleeping with the Sandman is safer and more satisfying?</description>

  <description>The year is 2051: Humanity’s pursuit of ever more powerful computer technology has created a horrifying new reality: Earth is now controlled by sentient machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The human race has been reduced to a fraction of its former self. A war to end all wars has changed the world forever.

  <description>Irina awakes, bound and beaten, in a cabin. A prisoner of a rogue Wolf. Her life is a living hell until she reaches the point where she longs for death to take her. &lt;br /&gt;Two powerful Vampires, Vlad and Zach, are on the hunt for this Wolf, and finding him ends in a bloody fight to the death. Only Zach's vast Vampire abilities alert them to Irina's whereabouts. They find her, bloodied and broken...and newly turned. &lt;br /&gt;With no other option, they take the young woman to their home, Unity, where she refuses to be separated from Vlad. The Vampire reluctantly lets her stay in his home and all too soon he realises he feels for her things that no Vampire should for a Wolf. &lt;br /&gt;This is the story of Vlad and Irina from the Defender's Blood series of books. Here you find out exactly how things were for them in the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>B.R.A.G. Medallion Winner 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When four alien visitors arrive on Earth and disappear into the cornfields of Indiana, it is Stewart Faulkner’s job to find them. Who they are, where they’re headed, and what’s important enough to make them jump from a moving spaceship are all questions that Stewart must uncover. And he will have to do it all while &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) training a new team member named Mindy—who is developing a crush on him; &lt;br /&gt;2) flying under the radar of his boss to make sure he’s not removed from the case; and &lt;br /&gt;3) staying one step ahead of a government agent named Karl Bruner, who is determined to expose the presence of aliens on Earth.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a cracking little story that seems to revolve around a set of unconnected people who have nothing in common. This soon changes and the story evolves into a complex murder mystery that has a very unexpected twist to it.<br /><br />As a whole the characters appear very superficial but they...]]>

  <description>NOTE: this book is currently in moratorium. &lt;br /&gt;Please see the two currently produced books in the series: Melody Jackson v. the Woman in White, or Melody Jackson v. the Hound from Hell, or check out http:\\&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.lafayettestreetbooks.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.lafayettestreetbooks.com&lt;/a&gt; for the current line of Melody Jackson books and swag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house next door had always been a little creepy. But when her father began to tell stories of his own childhood, Melody Jackson knew this wasn't going to be an average summer vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story about a smart girl who hates new-fangled technologies, and is more interested in machinery and objects of the past. Melody also believes little in the ways of spiritual, metaphysical, or the unprovable. She's home schooled, a little nerdy but a stern realist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't long, however, before Melody stumbles into some very old truths of the world and the universe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, horrible things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the house next door, which was really the start of it. The house had always been a little creepy, but when her father began to open up with stories of his own childhood, Melody Jackson knew this wasn't going to be an average summer vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Melody, her parents, and her friend Flutter (who becomes fixated with the creepy neighbor next door) as they travel through a whirlwind of adventure, suspense and terror. Starting at the local, haunted amusement park and ending with a terrifying night drive to nearly bottomless lake in the dark, Melody's view of the world would never quite be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;From the Author&lt;br /&gt;B.M.B. Johnson lives in Portland with his own family. Although the events of this novel are fictional, the characters and some of the situations are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Back Cover&lt;br /&gt;From behind the door came a deep, grumbling voice. The words were unintelligible, and Melody could not decide if they were produced by a human or the presupposed spectral entity from the depths of her imagination. This was followed by a whirlwind of clicking, as though a multitude of hands were undoing dozens of locks in quick succession.&lt;br /&gt;"This is it," Melody said, much too softly for Flutter to hear. "This is the end." She only wished her parents were here so she could say goodbye to them.</description>

  <description>THE GUARDIAN is a story about how Sarah's spiritual beliefs are reaffirmed when the existence of Angels and Demons are horrifically revealed. Never had she dreamt that her mundane life would be caught in not only a struggle to stay alive in this clash of worlds, but also in a sadistic plan by the Dark Angels to lure Jacob, her own Guardian, to fall.</description>

  <description>A primeval fiend is loose in the ancient metropolis of Malkandrah, intent on burning it to a wasteland. The city's leaders stand idly by and the sorcerers that once protected the people are long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maldren, a young necromancer, is the only person brave enough to stand against the creature. Instead of help from the Masters of his Guild, he is given a new apprentice. Why now, and why a girl? As they unravel the clues to defeating the fiend, they discover a secret society holding the future of the city in its grip. After betrayals and attempts on his life, Maldren has reason to suspect everyone he thought a friend, even the girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His last hope lies in an alliance with a depraved and murderous ghost, but how can he trust it? Its sinister past is intertwined in the lives of everyone he holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can only evil defeat evil?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;alternate cover for 1493708252/9781493708253&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 300 years, peace has reigned in the Southern Kingdom.  After forging that peace, the Armor of God disappeared from the world and became legend.  Over the centuries, even the legend faded into obscurity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the time approaches when the armor will again be needed, a young Druid begins a quest for a hero who will deliver hope to the Southern Kingdom.  That hero is a 16 year old boy who is years away from having the skills needed, but the Kingdom doesn’t have years to wait. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fate of the Southern Kingdom rests on the shoulders of an untrained and untested hero who must find the armor and become the righteous warrior the Kingdom needs.  Can he find the armor and figure out how to save his friends, family, kingdom, and, ultimately, himself?</description>

  <description>Be Careful What You Wish For.&lt;br /&gt;It Just May Be Given To You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An orphaned 15 year old boy named Graham is burdened with reoccurring dreams of loving parents, but the dream always takes a turn for the worse. Before seeing the ending, he awakens to find the supernatural elements of his nightmare manifested in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to control his unexplainable power and protect those around him, Graham goes in search for a man who may hold the answers he needs. It isn’t until he wakes up tied to a chair with a black hood over his head that he wishes he could take it all back. Why was he taken captive? How do they also have supernatural powers and what do they want with him? Who is this group called Aegis? With Graham’s power becoming more uncontrollable with each turn of events, will they be able to escape before it is too late?</description>

  <description>Aliens, giant chicken monsters, vampires and a mad scientist. Just another day in Imaginary City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The signs are all there. Something big is happening. Something not very good. It's up to Matthew Doorkey to find out what's going on and put a stop to it. With the help of a vampire with a cheese fixation, a slightly deranged but world-renowned author, a man who shares his body with an alien, a Hero who has just discovered his superhuman powers and a Villain bent on world conquest, Matthew sets out to find the truth and save his city from an unknown evil. Or at the very least, to get laid.</description>

  <description>STORIES FROM THE CLASSROOM! HOW DO THEY SURVIVE? WHETHER STUDENT, TEACHER OR PARENT THEY WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING OR CRYING! Waterloo Road or Grange Hill meet Gervase Phinn - well maybe! Whether you love this book or hate it you will have to admit that the stories about its characters will stay in your memory for a long time. With over twenty years teaching experience behind him, G J Griffiths has brought to the reader some of the stories about the children he taught, in this amusing and often poignant book. Parents, teachers, pupils and students will all recognise the characters and their tales. All through the book we are made aware of the joys and disappointments experienced by their teachers, Mr Jeffrey and his colleagues. With the ever-present controversy about changing the education system (again!) this is a timely illustration of what is to be found in the classrooms of the contemporary High School.</description>

They are the timeless classics of typical school life from the perspective of the staff and, just occasionally, the children.

  <description>A Christmas story for middle school students with a science fiction twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Edwin cuts his finger, dripping a few drops of blood onto a bone-colored tracking device he becomes a target of a group of aliens that think he holds the secret to the human race’s defeat. The only person who seems to know what to do is a fat man wearing a Santa Claus suit and he somehow seems to know just a little too much. Who is he and why does he know so much? Where did the aliens come from and what are they after? Can a Fourteen year old wandering the cold, empty streets of Manhattan late on Christmas Eve and an odd character dressed as Santa Claus stop the aliens, save the planet and discover the true meaning of Christmas?</description>

The hurdles that she meets along the way will include bullied and bullying pupils, as well as the expected ones of finance and willing manpower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But leaping those fences does not prepare the ambitious Molly for a dramatic fire and the confusion of a new passion in her life, in the form of Oliver Shrimpton. Will he become that significant someone, or is he just another obstacle for her to overcome?</description>

  <description>Children will be the death of you, Especially if they spike your wine with antifreeze. That is what Mathew Derrick suspects his precious young Sarah did to her mother so that she could have daddy all to herself. But the police think that he killed his wife after discovering that his daughter was the product of an extra-marital affair. Rather than face the wrath of the law he takes little Sarah and runs. Although he manages to elude the law, he can't escape Sarah's unquenchable wrath for the women in his life. Could this adorable and seemingly innocent child really be a murderess? And if not, who is killing the loves of his life, and why?</description>

  <description>A young woman with the fate of a nation in her hands. &lt;br /&gt;An aircraft designed by science, fueled by magic and flown with passion. &lt;br /&gt;A World War re-imagined like never before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strap yourself in for a wild ride as award-winning author Charles A. Cornell takes you on his dieselpunk adventure, DragonFly; a collision of science fiction with fantasy that fast forwards steampunk into an alternative World War Two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1942, an unlikely heroine changes the course of history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of invasion by the Nazis, twenty-two year old RAF pilot Veronica ‘Ronnie’ Somerset is fighting another battle - winning respect within the stuffy, male-dominated British military. She’s feisty and brash and determined to overcome every obstacle to become Britain’s first female combat pilot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ronnie is re-assigned to Enysfarne, a mysterious Royal Navy base off the coast of Cornwall, fate places her inside the cockpit of the most revolutionary aircraft ever invented. Brilliant engineer, Dr. Nigel Pennbridge has discovered quadra-hydrogen, an element that powers the DragonFly, a remarkable fighter-bomber that carries the hopes of Britain on its blue and silver wings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the English Channel, Nazi Germany is busy planning its next conquest. Reichsführer Bernhardt Morax, Hitler's personal sorcerer and leader of the Third Reich’s Zauber Korps is preparing his Blutskriegers for the invasion; bio-mechanical warriors created by a depraved occult science whose dark secrets cross the boundaries of evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In DragonFly, Veronica Somerset’s adventures unfold in two self-contained novellas: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Part I: ‘To Hell and Back’, Ronnie proves she’s a hard-nosed, quick-thinking daredevil. She embarks on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines to spy on Hitler's invasion plans and rescue a defecting officer from the Zauber Korps. Hans Schüller is a Nachtjäger or Night Hunter who introduces her to psychic powers she didn’t know she possessed; powers that entwine her destiny with his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Part II: ‘Victory or Death’, DragonFly comes to its dramatic conclusion. The Nazi invasion fleet is gathering off the shores of England. Morax, with help from his spies, is determined to seize the DragonFly and unlock the secrets of Enysfarne’s Druid past. Will the Druid wizard, Affodill - whose ancestral home of Enysfarne has been expropriated by the Royal Navy - join forces with the British, or will he make a pact with the evil Morax? Can Princess Victoria and Ronnie Somerset convince Affodill to place his magic in the service of a nation that has betrayed his Druid ancestors for centuries? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘DragonFly – the Illustrated Edition’ is the ultimate DragonFly reading experience! It’s packed with sixty illustrations that make the action jump off the page, including character dossiers, historical ‘retrographs’ and fantastic designs of retro-futuristic aircraft. Eleven of the sixty illustrations are exclusive to this omnibus edition of DragonFly and will be unavailable anywhere else!</description>

  <description>You can never go home. That had always been understood, so when Major Thomas Birch and his bedraggled crew limped back hundreds of years later it was clear that something had gone wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact nothing had gone right. Their mission of hope had been hopeless from the start. The new world they had tried to create had nearly destroyed them, and when their commander, Colonel Ratliff, had disappeared Birch had done the only thing he could. He had taken command and taken them home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Failure had not been an option. It had been inevitable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They had given up so much for this mission. Their lives were over. Everything they loved had died long ago. They had done it to serve others, for the common good, or so it was said. Major Birch had his reasons. Everyone had their reasons. Nobody volunteered to be frozen and blasted into space without a reason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But now they were going home. Hardly knowing what to expect, they returned to find Base Two abandoned, a desolate outpost crumbling back into the Martian soil it had risen from. And now earth wasn’t answering. Was anyone left, or in this vast universe were they now truly alone? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stumbling from a failed past into an uncertain future the crew of the Hypnos III find that sometimes the only thing worse than what you run from is the thing you run to.</description>

  <description>The discovery of an ancient bottle unleashes a Genie - and the wrath of the Demon Gypsies chasing her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Suzette (“Suki”) is released from her bottle by two teen girls, she is more than a bit surprised that a Genie of her calibre is beholden to two average high school students. After dealing with dignitaries and noblemen, however, she believes this will be a welcome break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she discovers the teens’ hidden powers and that one will come to possess the Amulet of Pollox, a necklace that contains the secrets from some of the greatest minds throughout history. Unfortunately, she’s not the only one who notices. The Amulet draws the attention of the two powerful and vengeful Demon Gypsies who have pursued Suki through time and will stop at nothing to snatch the girls and the Amulet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Suki is not just helping the girls navigate high school crushes, she’s safeguarding them from danger unlike anything they’ve ever known. To make matters more complicated, she must also fight her attraction to James - her protector through the ages - whose sudden arrival threatens her resolve and her heart.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A time-traveling Genie and her unrequited love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demon Gypsies with an insatiable quest for power...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the teen girls whose existence threatens them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the world of “Released,” book one of The Romani Realms series by Mia Fox, a Young Adult trilogy featuring elements of paranormal romance and steampunk.</description>

  <description>Macy Mercer only wants a little independence. Eager to prove herself grown up, she goes to a dark, secluded park. She’s supposed to meet the boy of her dreams who she met online. But the cute fifteen year old was a fantasy, his pictures fake. She finds herself face to face with Chester Woodran, a man capable of murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught over his own missing daughter, Chester insists that Macy replace his lost girl. He withholds food, locks Macy up, and roughs her up, demanding that she call him dad. Under duress from his constant threats and mind games, her hold on reality starts to slip. Clinging to her memories is the only way of holding onto her true identity, not believing that she is Chester’s daughter. Otherwise she may never see her family again.</description>

  <description>Eight years ago, Luke Retter witnessed the brutal murder of his mother and sister at the hands of his demon-possessed father. He survived but lost a hand and an eye. The demon also burned its emblem into his skin, marking him as a cursed. Those who bear this mark are at risk of becoming possessed themselves, so they are monitored and enslaved by the state-run UCIS. Working as a slave is hard, but Luke prefers it to the possibility of being controlled by a demon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, Luke wakes to find his worst nightmare coming true. His father's demon has returned. In a panic, he runs to the only person who might be able to help: Zack, a cursed who ran away from the state and created an underground community to protect other fugitive curseds. Zack helps him suppress the demon. But the city's become a time bomb, and Luke's demon itches to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the UCIS closing in on Zack's underground operation and Luke's demon crafting its own, nefarious plot, Luke realizes that he must take a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=5096" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/stor...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Raine is a slave, a gladiator. Known as the Bloody Wolf, he is the champion of all champions in the Empire of Khalid. Ly'Tana is a warrior princess of Kel'Halla and is set to wed the heir to Khalid's throne, Crown Prince Broughton. When Raine and his new wizard pal, Rygel, accidentally murder the High King, they set in motion events which rapidly spiral out of control. Ly'Tana discovers the true, and violent, nature of her betrothed, a man nicknamed Prince Brutal for his vicious nature, and escapes her marriage. Brutal will stop at nothing to have her for his wife. To entice his runaway bride into a trap, he brings down and captures her griffin bodyguard, Bar. Ly'Tana vows to have Bar back or die trying, and seeks the help of Raine and Rygel, to free Bar from Brutal's clutches. In doing so, Raine and Ly'Tana are forced to flee for their lives, hunted by Brutal's secretive assassins. Can they escape the hunters and their silent, evil hounds? Can Ly'Tana evade Brutal's hungry need to marry her and seize her beloved country? Can Raine keep Ly'Tana alive and still save himself from capture and torture? Can they stop themselves from falling in love? Thus begins the first novel of The Saga of the Black Wolf series.</description>

  <description>When her otherwise healthy, even idyllic, first pregnancy ends in the sudden and terrible stillbirth of daughter Avery, Heidi Chandler and her husband are left at a total loss. Looking into Avery’s perfect face, one that never cooed or cried, Heidi realizes how much her life has changed. &lt;i&gt;Holding Avery&lt;/i&gt; is a raw exploration of life after the death of a child. Heidi Chandler unapologetically recounts her heartache — the fears and doubts that come with knowing she is a mother but without a child to care for. The unabashed honesty of her grief will resonate with anyone who has experienced loss and found that the question &lt;i&gt;why?&lt;/i&gt; may always go unanswered. But Heidi learns that moving through the tragedy is not impossible.</description>

  <description>Sunderwynde Drive lies deep within the heart of the Cleveland suburbs. At the end of Sunderwynde Drive sits number forty-five twenty-six, home to Jerry, Liz and their children, Melissa and Kenny. Unbeknownst to them, their house covers a piece of ground with a past. Hundreds of years earlier, a curse had been placed on it by a local Native American medicine man (fellowship at Hopkins), who was ticked off at the flood of obnoxious New England settlers bent on competely ruining his neighborhood. The spirits were duly invoked, and these agreed to perform some appropriately retributive act (specifics to be determined) at some far-off, future date. As it happens, a group of rather odd individuals has stumbled upon the legend of the curse, and has managed to figure out when and where it'll be carried out. The when is soon, and the where is forty-five twenty-six Sunderwynde Drive. They are determined to be on hand when the fireworks start going off.</description>

  <description>Paige is a rock star. The world just doesn't know it yet. She's got the charisma, the drive, and, of course, the mega-musical skills. All she needs is to make her debut album, one that will change the world, inspire revolutions--and make her galactically famous along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When John Bustin, a former semi-famous singer/songwriter offers to record Paige's album for free, it feels like destiny, like the next step on her way to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitar in hand, Paige sets off to John's recording compound, ready to unfold her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ever-elusive John, with his mysterious history, and Paige, a big dreamer but naive about her footing in life, clash as much as they coalesce. Before they can change the world through Paige's music, the improbable duo must learn to work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coming of age story and retrospective, The Big Wide Calm focuses on human nature and the complexities of love through the eyes of young and old on the journey of creating the perfect album.</description>

  <description>A year ago a boy was found murdered at a girlsʼ boarding school, and the case was never solved. Detective Stephen Moran has been waiting for his chance to join Dublin’s Murder Squad when sixteen-year-old Holly Mackey arrives in his office with a photo of the boy with the caption: “I KNOW WHO KILLED HIM.” Stephen joins with Detective Antoinette Conway to reopen the case—beneath the watchful eye of Holly’s father, fellow detective Frank Mackey. With the clues leading back to Holly’s close-knit group of friends, to their rival clique, and to the tangle of relationships that bound them all to the murdered boy, the private underworld of teenage girls turns out to be more mysterious and more dangerous than the detectives imagined.</description>

  <description>ABOUT THE BOOK: "Mexican Eskimo" is a story for grown-ups: a love story about finding trust and hope amidst generations of anger and neglect, suicide and substance abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A faithful documentation of a most unlikely existence, "Mexican Eskimo" is an intricate layer-cake of actual and imagined pieces of dimly remembered facts, generously frosted with sweet, sticky gobs of gospel-truth fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is peppered with international flavor, vibrant characters, multi-cultural themes, and lush settings. It is rife with magical realism, and also features a large cast of young protagonists struggling with identity conflicts and independence, described in a range of historical periods from the 1850's, 1930's, the present day, and even in worlds that existed so long before now that time itself had not yet started to be counted in years.</description>

  <description>When Sam Chaplin runs into financial difficulties, a generous, yet strange offer from wealthy businessman and suspected IRA member, Morris O'Hara seems a Godsend. The Irishman's business is suffering after he accidentally kills a young girl in a road accident, so he dreams up a scheme which will hopefully win back the support of the public. A promise of a bonus for recruiting three penniless, heroic subjects to each receive one million pounds, is not enough reward for Chaplin. Together with his brother in law and journalist friend, they devise an elaborate and ingenious plot to steal the money. What the trio did not count on was the desperation of O'Hara's ex-IRA hoods and Pakistan terror organisation Sipah-e-Sahaba, who aim to retrieve the money. Blood Money is an intricate and thrilling story, which will take you on a breathtaking journey to places such as London, Belfast, Jakarta, Islamabad, Athens, Florida, New York and Wales. A guaranteed page turner, not to be missed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Witness the Birth of Fear.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has always been something wrong with the sinister and secluded town of Lakefield View. For one, people get murdered on the streets and nobody does anything about it. Even if they hear their screams curse the night skies, the number of saints has diminished. But it isn't the sick and twisted residents of Lakefield View that are the ones who you should avoid... it's the killers, the psychopaths, the witches and the monsters you should watch out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five unsuspecting workers of a picturesque café get the shock of their lives when a family member is killed before their eyes. A chain of events ensue and they are all catapulted down a spiralling road of mystery and magic, each struggling to overcome constant obstacles that threaten their lives and the safety of their families. As the mystery progresses and the secrets get darker, the friends find it harder and harder to keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing worse than being alone in the dark, is finding out you're not!&lt;br /&gt;_______________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prism of genres, &lt;i&gt;Remnants of the Damned&lt;/i&gt; promises to be a truly different approach of a series of novels with one of the main characters being gay – a rare occurrence in a mainstream piece of literature in this kind of genre.</description>

  <description>What could an assassination program begun by the Nixon administration and a malfunctioning camera on board NASA’s Voyager II space probe possibly have in common?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Francis Moore, finding the answer is about to become a matter of life and death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Uprooted by a chance encounter from a promising career in the Marine Corps and thrust onto the front line of the country’s clandestine “war on terror”, Francis has few illusions left about the world and how it works. In an attempt to atone for his complicity in one of the more egregious of the CIA’s clandestine operations, he resolves to expose the program, only to find his efforts thwarted at the last minute by the intervention of a highly determined “third party”, whose motives he neither suspects nor understands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in a rising tempest of murder, deceit and betrayal, Francis has no choice but to turn his talents to identifying his new assailants before it is too late.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the streets of Manhattan and the country lanes of rural New England to the wilderness of Canada and far beyond, he reluctantly finds himself dragged into the depths of a mystery that is as frightening as it is incredible, a journey that will open his eyes to the existence of something few could imagine, and fewer still would believe possible. A secret with the power to both resurrect the fortunes of a world edging ever closer to the brink of disaster, or tip it over once and for all.</description>

  <description>Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote . . . and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</description>

  <description>Libby and the gang visit the Isle of Wight for the funeral of an old friend, whose death is (for once) entirely un-suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some elderly cousins of the deceased do however have an unexplained death in the family. Libby's best friend Harry seems to be somehow involved, and Libby is therefore determined to get to the bottom of the situation, and valiantly ignores the growing reluctance of the elderly cousins to help as she investigates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will she get to the bottom of it, or will the cousins resistance prove too much? And why are they even resisting in the first place?</description>

  <description>When enigmatic poet Henry Coronado disappears six months after the New Year’s Eve, 1959, Welcoming Chaos event, he takes with him a profound secret wrapped within the words of his poem, Autumn In The Abyss. Fifty years later, an ill man’s research into Coronado’s work and life reveals that poetry can indeed change the world, or leave it in ruins. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Word is a living thing...and often with lethal intentions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reality is the strangest mirror... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The stories in John Claude Smith's new collection take their characters to the limits of human experience, the places where our bodies come asunder in the face of the abyss. Positioning his stories in the seams of our cultural history, Smith chronicles the efforts of artists of all stripes--poets, musicians, sculptors, filmmakers--to break through our common experience to another, more essential one that is painted in blood. It's a quest that draws these artists into proximity with the serial-killer in the book's single and singular tale of a police detective's obsessive manhunt. Whether with pen or carving knife, Smith's characters will not stop until they have gone too far, into a space where revelation and terror are part of the same, vast thing." —John Langan, author of The Wide, Carnivorous Sky and Other Monstrous Geographies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These five emotionally complex tales ask, above all, what it means to be human in a tempestuous universe. What part of ourselves do we owe to the pursuit of goodness, especially if there's no apparent advantage to being good? How can we define ourselves in the absence of moral authority? Blurred lines of identity, the role of the artist, and the nature of temptation are explored in these stories of sacrifice and self-destruction. Autumn in the Abyss is another dark and captivating collection from a writer who isn't afraid to plumb the depths of our greatest and most dangerous desires." —S.P. Miskowski, Shirley Jackson Award nominated author of The Skillute Cycle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;”The best compliment for any artist is leaving the audience desperately wanting more. And that’s exactly what John Claude Smith accomplishes with the tour de force of Autumn in the Abyss. The title novelette is a breathtaking exercise in dark fantasy—a surreal, unabashedly literary, horrific mystery with a surprising, heartrending truth at its end. It’s a tough act to follow, and yet the next four tales not only hold their own, but occasionally even up the ante. The novelette “Becoming Human” is a chilling mix of the serial killer genre and… something much more frightening. And three shorter tales all share a common gatekeeping character, as Smith explores some “Night Gallery” style places that are… just beyond the pale. Smart, creepy, unexpected … these are stories from that nightmare zone that will stick with you long after midnight. Hell, these are stories that will haunt you beneath the bright sun at noon. This is one of the best collections I’ve read in years!" —John Everson, Bram Stoker Award-Winning Author of NightWhere and Violet Eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;”The Rhythmic flow of John's words instantly absorbs you into his world, bringing not only his words to life but the story as well." —Joe Mynhardt, Crystal Lake Publishing</description>

  <description>Pelmen hates being a tanner, but that’s all he would ever be, thanks to the rigid caste system amongst his people, the hevelens. Then he meets Master Galn Boisencroix and his family. The master carpenter opens up the world of archery to young Pelmen, who excels at his newfound skill. But Pelmen’s intractable father would have none of it, and tries to force Pelmen to stay in the tannery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, however, Pelmen’s best friend and Master Galn's son, Teleg, disappears. Lured away by the prospect of untold riches through mining amberrock, the most precious substance in the world, Teleg finds himself a prisoner of the Nylevs, fierce fire-wielding worshippers of the god of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Pelmen must leave all he knows behind, overcome his fears and travel across the land, in search of his childhood friend. Along the way, he will ally himself with strange and fantastic beings: a shaman who controls the Breath of Aoles, or the power of the wind, a krongos, a creature of the mineral realm who can become living rock, and a malian, adept at water magic.</description>

  <description>This is the magical story of Poppy Lung, an inquisitive young girl full of questions and ideas who finds herself in the unusual position of being abducted by a giant crow. Delivered unceremoniously to a distant and other world, she discovers that her only hope of returning home is to find a mysterious prince who she is told can help her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With little choice she sets off on a long journey where she meets the four elements as the ancients understood them: fire, water, earth and air, all represented by their corresponding animals. From each of them she starts to learn about their place within the world as well as her own. Her predicament soon becomes all the more urgent when she finds herself being pursued by a dark and menacing wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Lung is a homage to Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’, as well as other fairy tales from the past but it is also very much its own story. Written with both older children and adults in mind, it is a tale of a young girl’s initiation into adulthood, the mysteries of nature and ultimately her awakening to the realisation of her own being. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reviews and to see some of the 13 accompanying illustrations as well as to order a copy, visit &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.poppylung.co.uk" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.poppylung.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;</description>
