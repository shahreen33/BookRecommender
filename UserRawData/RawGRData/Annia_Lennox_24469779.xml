  <description>All's &lt;i&gt;faire&lt;/i&gt; in love and war for two sworn enemies who indulge in a harmless flirtation in a laugh-out-loud rom-com from debut author, Jen DeLuca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily knew there would be strings attached when she relocated to the small town of Willow Creek, Maryland, for the summer to help her sister recover from an accident, but who could anticipate getting roped into volunteering for the local Renaissance Faire alongside her teenaged niece? Or that the irritating and inscrutable schoolteacher in charge of the volunteers would be so annoying that she finds it impossible to stop thinking about him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faire is Simon's family legacy and from the start he makes clear he doesn't have time for Emily's lighthearted approach to life, her oddball Shakespeare conspiracy theories, or her endless suggestions for new acts to shake things up. Yet on the faire grounds he becomes a different person, flirting freely with Emily when she's in her revealing wench's costume. But is this attraction real, or just part of the characters they're portraying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer was only ever supposed to be a pit stop on the way to somewhere else for Emily, but soon she can't seem to shake the fantasy of establishing something more with Simon, or a permanent home of her own in Willow Creek.</description>

  <description>The success stories speak for themselves in this book from money maestro Dave Ramsey. Instead of promising the normal dose of quick fixes, Ramsey offers a bold, no-nonsense approach to money matters, providing not only the how-to but also a grounded and uplifting hope for getting out of debt and achieving total financial health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramsey debunks the many myths of money (exposing the dangers of cash advance, rent-to-own, debt consolidation) and attacks the illusions and downright deceptions of the American dream, which encourages nothing but overspending and massive amounts of debt. "Don't even consider keeping up with the Joneses," Ramsey declares in his typically candid style. "They're broke!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Total Money Makeover isn't theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to the heart of the money problems: you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Princes have pomp and glory—not crushes on commoners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing gets the tongues of London’s high society wagging like a good scandal. And when the personal secretary of the visiting Prince Sebastian of Alucia is found murdered, it’s all anyone can talk about, including Eliza Tricklebank. Her unapologetic gossip gazette has benefited from an anonymous tip about the crime, prompting Sebastian to take an interest in playing detective—and an even greater interest in Eliza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a trade deal on the line and mounting pressure to secure a noble bride, there’s nothing more salacious than a prince dallying with a commoner. Sebastian finds Eliza’s contrary manner as frustrating as it is seductive, but they’ll have to work together if they’re going to catch the culprit. And when things heat up behind closed doors, it’s the prince who’ll have to decide what comes first—his country or his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"London’s observations of gender roles are keen, and her protagonists are eminently likable in their dogged pursuit of their own goals despite societal expectations and political pressures." -Publishers Weekly on THE PRINCESS PLAN</description>

  <description>Ivy Morgan hasn't been feeling like herself lately. Not like anyone can blame her. After all, being held captive by a psychotic fae prince hell-bent on permanently opening the gates to the Otherworld is bound to leave some mental scars. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s more than that, though. Something dark and insidious is spreading throughout Ivy, more powerful than she could ever imagine... and it’s coming between her and the man she’s fallen deeply in love with, elite Order member Ren Owens. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ren would do anything to keep Ivy safe. Anything. But when he makes a life altering choice for her, the fallout of his act has far reaching consequences that threaten to tear their lives apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Ivy is going to have any hope of surviving this, she must put aside the hurt and betrayal she feels, and work with not only those she loves, but with an enemy she would rather kill than ever trust. War is coming, and it soon becomes clear that what Ivy and Ren thought they knew about the Order, themselves, and even their enemies, has been nothing but a cluster of dangerous, deadly lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ivy knows she must be more than just brave to save those she loves--and, ultimately, to save herself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because behind every evil fae Prince, there’s a Queen….</description>

  <description>Torn between duty and survival, nothing can be the same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything Ivy Morgan thought she knew has been turned on its head. After being betrayed and then nearly killed by the Prince of the Fae, she’s left bruised and devastated—and with an earth-shattering secret that she must keep at all costs. And if the Order finds out her secret, they’ll kill her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there’s Ren Owens, the sexy, tattooed Elite member of the Order who has been sharing Ivy’s bed and claiming her heart. Their chemistry is smoking hot, but Ivy knows that Ren has always valued his duty to the Order above all else—he could never touch her if he knew the truth. That is, if he let her live at all. Yet how can she live with herself if she lies to him? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as the Fae Prince begins to close in, intent on permanently opening the gates to the Otherworld, Ivy is running out of options. If she doesn’t figure out who she can trust—and fast—it’s not only her heart that will be torn apart, but civilization itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this heat wave, anything and everything goes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/214951-red-hot-summer" rel="nofollow"&gt;Red-Hot Summer&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; story - and - book #1 in the new &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Out of Uniform&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelby Harper has lusted over Navy SEAL John Garrett for over a year, but no matter how many sexy signals she sends out, the man shows a complete lack of interest in getting naked. Then she overhears Garrett talking to his SEAL teammate--a discussion in which they conclude she's vanilla. Stung, Shelby sets out to show them exactly how un-vanilla she is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garrett can't believe it when sweet, sexy Shelby suggests a wild and sweaty menage. He's been trying to figure out how to ask her out without coming off as a guy who only wants to get in her pants--her friendship is too valuable to him to risk it. But if a crazy, heat-wave three-way is what Shelby wants, then he's ready and willing to give it to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she gets it out of her system, however...well, then he'll let her know he wants her all to himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: This title contains two dangerously hot Navy SEALS and a heroine determined to get it on with both of them. Be prepared to take a cold shower (or maybe two) after reading this heat-wave menage.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>STANDALONE NOVEL FROM CHELLE BLISS&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTHING CHANGED IN AN INSTANT.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I knew what was important, but one phone call sent my life into a tailspin. Alone and afraid, I clung to the one man I shouldn’t. I was warned about him and told to stay away. “He’s dangerous,” they said. But the man who could hurt me the most, gave me the greatest comfort. "He's not who they think," I told myself. But just like an illusion, things are never what they seem.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Kiersten White comes a new fantasy series reimagining the Arthurian legend, set in the magical world of Camelot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was nothing in the world as magical and terrifying as a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Guinevere has come to Camelot to wed a stranger: the charismatic King Arthur. With magic clawing at the kingdom's borders, the great wizard Merlin conjured a solution--send in Guinevere to be Arthur's wife . . . and his protector from those who want to see the young king's idyllic city fail. The catch? Guinevere's real name--and her true identity--is a secret. She is a changeling, a girl who has given up everything to protect Camelot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep Arthur safe, Guinevere must navigate a court in which the old--including Arthur's own family--demand things continue as they have been, and the new--those drawn by the dream of Camelot--fight for a better way to live. And always, in the green hearts of forests and the black depths of lakes, magic lies in wait to reclaim the land. Arthur's knights believe they are strong enough to face any threat, but Guinevere knows it will take more than swords to keep Camelot free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly jousts, duplicitous knights, and forbidden romances are nothing compared to the greatest threat of all: the girl with the long black hair, riding on horseback through the dark woods toward Arthur. Because when your whole existence is a lie, how can you trust even yourself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*THE FIRST BOOK IN THE CAMELOT RISING TRILOGY*</description>

  &lt;b&gt;To win her love...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extremely wealthy laird, Gowan Stoughton, Duke of Kinross, can have any of the maidens at the ball he attends. The only problem is they are all English and Gowan is not so certain they are suitable. He is accustomed to the hard-working lasses from his Highlands, not these dainty noblewomen who spend their days drinking tea or some other such nonsense. But then he makes the acquaintance of Lady Edith Gilchrist. Utterly bewitched by the emerald-eyed beauty with lush golden locks, he knows he must have her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;He must free her from her tower...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Edie" had the misfortune of being dreadfully ill at her debut ball and barely remembers what Gowan looks like. Even worse, she accepted his proposal the following day. Edie's only true passion is playing music—until Gowan writes a scandalous letter and stirs the most irresistible desire. Yet when they marry, Edie realizes her husband needs a lesson and locks herself in a tower. Somehow Gowan must find a way to enter the tower and convince his new bride that she belongs in his arms.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some loves will last ’til your dying breath&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every choice has consequences—but seventeen-year-old Layla faces tougher choices than most. Light or darkness. Wickedly sexy demon prince Roth, or Zayne, the gorgeous, protective Warden she never thought could be hers. Hardest of all, Layla has to decide which side of herself to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Layla has a new problem, too. A Lilin—the deadliest of demons—has been unleashed, wreaking havoc on those around her…including her best friend. To keep Sam from a fate much, much worse than death, Layla must strike a deal with the enemy while saving her city—and her race—from destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between two worlds and two different boys, Layla has no certainties, least of all survival, especially when an old bargain comes back to haunt them all. But sometimes, when secrets are everywhere and the truth seems unknowable, you have to listen to your heart, pick a side—and then fight like hell…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How can she dare to imagine he loves her... when all London calls her &lt;i&gt;The Ugly Duchess&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theodora Saxby is the last woman anyone expects the gorgeous James Ryburn, heir to the Duchy of Ashbrook, to marry. But after a romantic proposal before the prince himself, even practical Theo finds herself convinced of her soon-to-be duke's passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the tabloids give the marriage six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo would have given it a lifetime... until she discovers that James desired not her heart, and certainly not her countenance, but her dowry. Society was shocked by their wedding; it's scandalized by their separation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now James faces the battle of his lifetime, convincing Theo that he loved the duckling who blossomed into the swan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Theo will quickly find that for a man with the soul of a pirate, All's Fair in Love — or War.</description>

  <description>A mysterious epidemic of dental explosions,&lt;br /&gt;A teenage boy who got his wick stuck in a candlestick&lt;br /&gt;A remarkable woman who, like a human fountain, spurted urine from virtually every orifice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just a few of the anecdotal gems that have until now lain undiscovered in medical journals for centuries. This fascinating collection of historical curiosities explores some of the strangest cases that have perplexed doctors across the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From seventeenth-century Holland to Tsarist Russia, from rural Canada to a whaler in the Pacific, many are monuments to human stupidity – such as the sailor who swallowed dozens of penknives to amuse his shipmates, or the chemistry student who in 1850 arrived at a hospital in New York with his penis trapped inside a bottle, having unwisely decided to relieve himself into a vessel containing highly reactive potassium. Others demonstrate exceptional surgical ingenuity long before the advent of anaesthesia – such as a daring nineteenth-century operation to remove a metal fragment from beneath a conscious patient’s heart. We also hear of the weird, often hilarious remedies employed by physicians of yore – from crow’s vomit to port-wine enemas – the hazards of such everyday objects as cucumbers and false teeth, and miraculous recovery from apparently terminal injuries.</description>

  <description>Players gotta play.&lt;br /&gt;Hate is like a poison. It contaminates everything.&lt;br /&gt;So does doubt.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I deny what I overheard, even though I insist it isn’t true, the seed of doubt has been planted. I can’t help but be tormented with the endless what-if’s that have taken over our lives.&lt;br /&gt;Romeo and I were happy in love. The future stretched before us brighter than any star in the darkest sky. Now everything is broken. Literally broken. Romeo’s entire career is at stake, my entire future is threatened… and my past?&lt;br /&gt;It’s coming back to haunt me.&lt;br /&gt;To haunt us.&lt;br /&gt;Romeo says we’re in this together and right now the only sure thing is us. But how far can a love so new be pushed? The lengths we will have to go to save each other puts everything at risk.&lt;br /&gt;Romeo is a #player but how much of the game can one person play?</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Do You&lt;/i&gt; is a down-to-earth, irreverent, and no-holds-barred guide to letting go of the weight of others' expectations and doubling down on your dreams to find real, lasting happiness.&lt;br /&gt;First, bestselling "anti-guru" Sarah Knight taught you to shed unwanted guilt and obligations like a year's worth of old socks in &lt;i&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck&lt;/i&gt;. Then, in &lt;i&gt;Get Your Sh*t Together&lt;/i&gt;, she taught you how to set goals for the life you want and really achieve them. &lt;br /&gt;Now she's back, with her most broadly-applicable "No F*cks Given Guide" yet: helping you let go of family, social, and existential pressures to be happy with yourself and the life you really want. In the down-to-earth, warmly irreverent tone that has become her trademark, Sarah Knight helps readers find the conviction that it's not just &lt;i&gt;okay &lt;/i&gt;to be who you are and want what you want, but that it's&lt;i&gt; great&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;In the bestselling tradition of Shonda Rhimes' &lt;i&gt;Year of Yes &lt;/i&gt;and Jen Sincero's &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;You Do You &lt;/i&gt;is an unconventional yet universal guide to getting down with your bad self.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It started with unspoken animosity. The bitter bite of jealousy. And now its full blown hate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was during my first football game that I first felt the first chill of hate. I looked it right in the eyes and felt its sticky tentacles reach out for me. I’d never experienced something so cold and empty before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect of that look lingered, like an unspoken promise, long after it was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becoming a couple – becoming the other half of a campus celebrity wasn’t easy. I let down walls guarding my heart and he looked past my glasses and accident prone tendencies. Romeo and I are an unlikely match, a #nerd and a jock. But we made it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we’re happy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zach doesn’t want us to be happy. He wants Romeo to pay for getting him kicked out of Omega and for the night he spent in jail. He’s going to use anything and everything he can to get his revenge. Including me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weather on campus grows cold and the days become dark, revenge becomes the center of someone’s life and the happiness Romeo and I worked so hard for is threatened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t help but worry that our love is going to be overshadowed by hate.</description>

  <description>Vicky, Alice, Helena, and Beatrice were historically unique sisters, born to a sovereign who ruled over a quarter of the earth's people and who gave her name to an era: Queen Victoria. Two of these princesses would themselves produce children of immense consequence. All five would curiously come to share many of the social restrictions and familial machinations borne by nineteenth-century women of less-exulted class. Principally researched at the houses and palaces of its five subjects in London, Scotland, Berlin, Darmstadt, and Ottawa-and entertainingly written by an experienced biographer whose last book concerned Victoria's final days-Victoria's Daughters closely examines a generation of royal women who were dominated by their mother, married off as much for political advantage as for love, and finally passed over entirely with the accession of their brother Bertie to the throne. Jerrold M. Packard provides valuable insights into their complex, oft-tragic lives as daughters of their time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 12 hrs and 44 mins</description>

  <description>The first book in a new Regency romance series, an heiress and a rogue accidentally end up in a secret marriage of convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a desperate bid to keep her fortune out of her cousin's hands, shipping heiress Georgiana Caversteed marries a condemned criminal in Newgate prison. The scoundrel's first kiss is shockingly heated, but Georgie never expects to see her husband again. Until she spots him across a crowded ballroom. Notorious rogue Benedict Wylde never expected a wife. He was in Newgate undercover, working for Bow Street. To keep their marriage of convenience a secret, Wylde courts Georgie in public, but the more time they spend together, the more their attraction sparks. Could an heiress with the world at her feet find happiness with a penniless rake? Kate Bateman's &lt;i&gt;This Earl of Mine &lt;/i&gt;is a delightful start to the Bow Street Bachelors series, with witty banter, dynamic characters, and swoon-worthy romance.</description>

  <description>9 hrs 41 mins&lt;br /&gt;In Under the Knife, surgeon Arnold Van de Laar uses his own experience and expertise to tell the witty history of the past, present and future of surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the story of the desperate man from seventeenth-century Amsterdam who grimly cut a stone out of his own bladder to Bob Marley's deadly toe, Under the Knife offers all kinds of fascinating and unforgettable insights into medicine and history via the operating theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens during an operation? How does the human body respond to being attacked by a knife, a bacterium, a cancer cell or a bullet? And, as medical advances continuously push the boundaries of what medicine can cure, what are the limits of surgery?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the dark centuries of bloodletting and of amputations without anaesthetic to today's sterile, high-tech operating theatres, Under the Knife is both a rich cultural history, and a modern anatomy class for us all.</description>

  <description>Isabel Bookbinder is a twenty-seven-year-old assistant at the &lt;i&gt;Saturday Mercury&lt;/i&gt; newspaper in London. She has a disinterested boyfriend, a mother who loves clothes that match, and a father who always expects her to do better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although Isabel may spend most of her time measuring newspaper column inches, she's well on her way to becoming a bestselling author. She's already perfected Her Look (cashmere track suit, lots of mascara), is working on her toned size eight figure, and gets up at dawn to work on her novel (well, sort of). She even has a fabulous mentor -- a bestselling but increasingly eccentric author who takes her to glamorous book parties and introduces her to the dreamy literary agent Joe Madison. But when she inadvertently exposes a political sex scandal and her name becomes known for all the wrong reasons, her glamorous double life starts to spin out of control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With her distinctive voice, penchant for getting in sticky situations, and blind confidence in her dream of becoming a famous novelist, Isabel Bookbinder is a heroine that you can't help but root for.</description>

  <description>Ria Parkar is Bollywood's favorite Ice Princess--beautiful, poised, and scandal-proof--until one impulsive act threatens to expose her destructive past. Traveling home to Chicago for her cousin's wedding offers a chance to diffuse the coming media storm and find solace in family, food, and outsized celebrations that are like one of her vibrant movies come to life. But it also means confronting Vikram Jathar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ria and Vikram spent childhood summers together, a world away from Ria's exclusive boarding school in Mumbai. Their friendship grew seamlessly into love--until Ria made a shattering decision. As far as Vikram is concerned, Ria sold her soul for stardom and it's taken him years to rebuild his life. But beneath his pent-up anger, their bond remains unchanged. And now, among those who know her best, Ria may find the courage to face the secrets she's been guarding for everyone else's benefit--and a chance to stop acting and start living. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich with details of modern Indian-American life, here is a warm, sexy, and witty story of love, family, and the difficult choices that arise in the name of both.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In this highly practical guide, today's leading expert on habit formation lays out a proven system for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atomic Habits &lt;/i&gt;asks a simple but powerful question: How can we live better? We know good habits build better lives, but it's easy to get thrown off course--trying to lose weight when we eat poorly and sleep too little; spending when we want to save. What makes some habits easy to stick with while others fail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with self-improvement tips based on proven scientific research, &lt;i&gt;Atomic Habits &lt;/i&gt;reveals how altering our small daily habits can transform our lives for the better. This easy-to-understand guide uncovers the hidden forces that shape your behavior--everything from mindset to environment to genetics--and shows you how to take control of them. Organized around the Four Laws of Behavior Change, this book will show you how to apply each one to your life and work. In the end, you'll get a simple method for building a repeatable and sustainable system for success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Clear, author of a wildly popular blog with more than two million readers per month, is known for his ability to distill complex topics into an easy-to-understand format. Now, he breaks down the art and science of habit formation into its most fundamental state, giving us a playbook for success. Sharing stories of his own achievements alongside those of star athletes, business leaders, artists, people who have kicked addiction against all odds, and even folks who just wanted to stop biting their nails, Clear proves that your goals are within reach--as long as you start small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to transform your habits--or those of your family, team, or community--then you want to read this book.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For generations, the princes of Ilara have married the most beautiful maidens from the ocean village of Varenia. But though every girl longs to be chosen as the next princess, the cost of becoming royalty is higher than any of them could ever imagine…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor once dreamed of seeing the wondrous wealth and beauty of Ilara, the kingdom that’s ruled her village for as long as anyone can remember. But when a childhood accident left her with a permanent scar, it became clear that her identical twin sister, Zadie, would likely be chosen to marry the Crown Prince—while Nor remained behind, unable to ever set foot on land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Zadie is gravely injured, and Nor is sent to Ilara in her place. To Nor’s dismay, her future husband, Prince Ceren, is as forbidding and cold as his home—a castle carved into a mountain and devoid of sunlight. And as she grows closer to Ceren’s brother, the charming Prince Talin, Nor uncovers startling truths about a failing royal bloodline, a murdered queen… and a plot to destroy the home she was once so eager to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save her people, Nor must learn to negotiate the treacherous protocols of a court where lies reign and obsession rules. But discovering her own formidable strength may be the one move that costs her everything: the crown, Varenia and Zadie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Picking up where &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt; ended, &lt;i&gt;How to Be Yourself&lt;/i&gt; is the best book you'll ever read about how to conquer social anxiety.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"This book is also a groundbreaking road map to finally being your true, authentic self." --Susan Cain, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; and nationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to 40% of people consider themselves shy. You might say you're introverted or awkward, or that you're fine around friends but just can't speak up in a meeting or at a party. Maybe you're usually confident but have recently moved or started a new job, only to feel isolated and unsure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get nervous in social situations--meeting your partner's friends, public speaking, standing awkwardly in the elevator with your boss--you've probably been told, "Just be yourself!" But that's easier said than done--especially if you're prone to social anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together cutting-edge science, concrete tips, and the compelling stories of real people who have risen above their social anxiety, Dr. Ellen Hendriksen proposes a groundbreaking idea: you already have everything you need to succeed in any unfamiliar social situation. As someone who lives with social anxiety, Dr. Hendriksen has devoted her career to helping her clients overcome the same obstacles she has. With familiarity, humor, and authority, Dr. Hendriksen takes the reader through the roots of social anxiety and why it endures, how we can rewire our brains through our behavior, and--at long last--exactly how to quiet your Inner Critic, the pesky voice that whispers, "Everyone will judge you." Using her techniques to develop confidence, think through the buzz of anxiety, and feel comfortable in any situation, you can finally be your true, authentic self.</description>

  <description>How hard would you fight for the one you love?&lt;br /&gt;Taryn Landry was there that awful night fourteen years ago when Long Acre changed from the name of a town to the title of a national tragedy. Everyone knows she lost her younger sister. No one knows it was her fault. Since then, psychology professor Taryn has dedicated her life's work to preventing something like that from ever happening again. Falling in love was never part of the plan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaw Miller has spent more than a decade dealing with the fallout of his brother's horrific actions. After losing everything―his chance at Olympic gold, his family, almost his sanity―he's changed his name, his look, and he's finally starting a new life. As long as he keeps a low profile and his identity secret, everything will be okay, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the world and everyone you know defines you by one catastrophic tragedy...&lt;br /&gt;How do you find your happy ending?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Deep Work&lt;/i&gt;, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, &lt;i&gt;Deep Work&lt;/i&gt; takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories-from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. &lt;i&gt;Deep Work&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.</description>

  <description>Oakley Spurlock is dying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She only has weeks to live thanks to a freak infection that totally and completely destroyed her kidneys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite her family’s desperation, not a single one of them is a match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a last-ditch attempt, Oakley’s father takes to social media to beg for help to save his daughter’s life. &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pace Vineyard is lost. So lost, in fact, that he’s not sure he wants to be found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a beautiful woman’s face is splashed across social media, and Pace finds a spark in his soul for the first time since a bomb went off beside him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s already missing two legs. What’s one more kidney? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what he tells himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he doesn’t expect is to give his heart to the woman, too. Or for the woman to run away with it and force him to follow. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>At birth, Mick Trewlove, the illegitimate son of a duke, was handed over to a commoner. Despite his lowly upbringing, Mick has become a successful businessman, but all his wealth hasn’t satisfied his need for revenge against the man who still won’t acknowledge him. What else can Mick do but destroy the duke’s &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; son—and woo the heir’s betrothed into his own unloving arms . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and sheltered, Lady Aslyn Hastings longs for a bit of adventure. With her intended often preoccupied, Aslyn finds herself drawn to a darkly handsome entrepreneur who seems to understand her so well. Surely a lady of her station should avoid Mick Trewlove. If only he weren’t so irresistible . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets are about to be exposed, Mick must decide if his plan for vengeance is worth risking what his heart truly desires.</description>

  <description>Duration: 22 hours 38 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fascinating story behind the company that revolutionized the financial world &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Catching Lightning in a Bottle&lt;/i&gt; traces the complete history of Merrill Lynch and the company's substantial impact on the world of finance, from the birth of the once-mighty company to its inauspicious end. Throughout its ninety-four year history, Merrill Lynch revolutionized finance by bringing Wall Street to Main Street, operating under a series of guidelines known as the Principles. These values allowed the company to gain the trust of small investors by putting the clients' interests first, driving a business trajectory that expanded capital markets and fueled the growth of the American post-war economy. Written by the son of Merrill Lynch co-founder Winthrop H. Smith, this book describes the creation and evolution of the company from Charlie Merrill's one-man shop in 1914 to its acquisition by Bank of America in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Winthrop H. Smith Jr. spent twenty-eight years at the company his father co-founded, bringing a unique perspective to bear in telling the story of the company that democratized the stock market and eventually fell from its lofty perch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Learn why the industry initially scoffed at Charles Merrill's "radical" investment ideas&lt;br /&gt;- Discover the origin of the Principles, and how they drove operations for nearly a century&lt;br /&gt;- Find out why the author left a successful Wall Street career, and why it was such a smart move&lt;br /&gt;- Examine the culture and values that built Merrill Lynch into one of the world's most successful and respected companies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revolutionary vision is rare, and enduring success is even more so. When a single organization demonstrates both of those characteristics, it is felt throughout the world. Discover the fascinating story behind Merrill Lynch and the men who built it from an insider's perspective in &lt;i&gt;Catching Lightning in a Bottle&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>The Duchess of Cosway yearns for a man she has never met . . . her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Married by proxy as a child, Lady Isidore has spent years fending off lecherous men in every European court while waiting to meet her husband. She's determined to accept him, no matter how unattractive the duke turns out to be. When she finally lures Simeon Jermyn back to London, his dark handsomeness puts Isidore's worst fears to rest—until disaster strikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duke demands an annulment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forsaking his adventuresome past, Simeon has returned to London ready to embrace the life of a proper duke, only to find that his supposed wife is too ravishing, too headstrong, and too sensual to be the docile duchess he has in mind. But Isidore will not give up her claim to the title—or him—without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will do whatever it takes to capture Simeon's heart, even if it means sacrificing her virtue. After all, a consummated marriage cannot be annulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet in forcing Simeon into a delicious surrender, will Isidore risk not only her dignity—but her heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wingman rule number two: never reveal how much you want them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lex hates Gabi. Gabi hates Lex. But, hey, at least the hate is mutual, right? All Lex has to do is survive the next few weeks training Gabi in all the ways of Wingmen Inc. and then he can be done with her. But now that they have to work together, the sexual tension and fighting is off the charts. He isn’t sure if he wants to strangle her or throw her against the nearest sturdy table and have his way with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Gabi has a secret, something she’s keeping from not just her best friend but her nemesis too. Lines are blurred as Lex becomes less the villain she’s always painted him to be…and starts turning into something more. Gabi has always hated the way she’s been just a little bit attracted to him—no computer-science major should have that nice of a body or look that good in glasses—but “Lex Luthor” is an evil womanizer. He’s dangerous. Gabi should stay far, far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, she’s always wanted a little danger.</description>

  <description>Publisher's Summary&lt;br /&gt;Most children go through a dinosaur phase. Learning all the tongue-twisting names, picking favourites based on ferocity, armour, or sheer size. For many kids this love of ‘terrible lizards’ fizzles out at some point between starting and leaving primary school. All those fancy names slowly forgotten, no longer any need for a favourite.&lt;br /&gt;For all those child dino fanatics who didn’t grow up to become paleontologists, dinosaurs seem like something out of mythology. They are dragons, pictures in books, abstract, other, extinct. &lt;br /&gt;They are at the same time familiar and mysterious. And yet we’re in an age of rapid discovery - new dinosaur species and genera are being discovered at an accelerating rate, we’re learning more about what they looked like, how they lived, how they evolved and where they all went. &lt;br /&gt;This series isn’t just a top trumps list of dino facts - we’re interested in the why and the how and like all areas of science there is plenty of controversy and debate.&lt;br /&gt;©2019 Audible, Ltd (P)2019 Audible, Ltd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 2 hrs and 42 mins &lt;br /&gt;Original Recording Audiobook</description>

  <description>Skye Copeland is on paid leave from her broadcasting job after accidentally drawing a pecker on the traffic map. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let that sink in. Like it’s her fault the traffic pattern that day created a perfect schlong? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Skye isn’t laughing. She needs this job. And that’s the only reason she’s agreed to chase down a story in her least favorite place—that hell on earth known as Vermont. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A quick trip. In and out. Much like - never mind. Skye can sneak into the town that once tried to break her, get the story and get back into the good graces of her producer. Easy peasy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except things go sideways even as she sets foot over the county line. Her step-sister is on the run from a violent drug dealer. And the cop on the case is none other than Benito Rossi, the man who broke her teenage heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His dark brown eyes still tear her apart. And even as she steels herself to finally tell him off after twelve years, the old fireworks are still there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things are about to go boom.</description>

  <description>Some people--a sizeable minority-- prefer to avoid the limelight, tend to listen more than they speak, feel alone in large groups, and require lots of private time to restore their energy. Often they feel different, not right, less than. But as Marti Olsen Laney proves, that is far from the truth. &lt;br /&gt;"The Introvert Advantage" dispels common myths about introverts--they're not necessarily shy, aloof, or antisocial--and explains how they are hardwired from birth to focus inward, so outside stimulation such as chitchat, phone calls, parties, or office meetings can easily become "too much." Most importantly, it thoroughly refutes many introverts' belief that something is wrong with them. Instead, it helps them recognize their inner strengths--their analytical skills, ability to think outside the box, and strong powers of concentration. It provides tools to improve relationships with partners, kids, colleagues, and friends, while offering dozens of tips, including 8 ways to showcase their abilities at work and strategies for socializing. In short, "The Introvert Advantage" shows introverts how to take advantage of their special qualities not only to survive in an extrovert-oriented world, but to thrive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;These men are dark, bold, and brave. And there is only one woman who can bring them to their knees...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed and brilliant, Lady Alexandra Lane has always known how to look out for to herself. But nobody would ever expect that she has darkness in her past—one that she pays a blackmailer to keep buried. Now, with her family nearing bankruptcy, Alexandra strikes upon a solution: Get married to one of the empire’s most wealthy eligible bachelors. Even if he does have the reputation of a devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE TAKES NO PRISONERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piers Gedrick Atherton, the Duke of Redmayne, is seeking revenge and the first step is securing a bride. Winning a lady’s hand is not so easy, however, for a man known as the Terror of Torcliff. Then, Alexandra enters his life like a bolt of lightning. When she proposes marriage, Piers knows that, like him, trouble haunts her footsteps. But her gentleness, sharp wit, independent nature, and incredible beauty awakens every fierce desire within him. He will do whatever it takes to keep her safe in his arms.</description>

  <description>One-night stand + two percent condom failure rate = happily ever after? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar owner Kevin Kowalski is used to women throwing their phone numbers at him, but lately he's more interested in finding a woman to settle down with. A woman like Beth Hansen. If only their first meeting hadn't gone so badly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth's tending bar at a wedding when she comes face-to-face with a tuxedo-clad man she never thought she'd see again. She tries to keep her distance from Kevin but, by last call, she can't say no to his too-blue eyes or the invitation back to his room. Then she slips out before breakfast without leaving a note and, despite their precautions, she's pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin quickly warms to the idea of being a dad and to seeing where things go with Beth. After all, he's not the player she thinks he is. But she's not ready for a relationship and, given his reputation, it's going to take a lot to convince her to go on a second date with the father of her child...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Best friends. A fake relationship. And only one bed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Shannon Stacey delivers the feel-good beach read you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noah Stafford loves his life—his happy, &lt;i&gt;single life&lt;/i&gt;. So what if he made up a fake girlfriend to stop his boss’s matchmaking? He kept things close to the truth—Carly really does have long, sexy legs and a killer sense of humor. She just happens to be his best friend. His wicked awesome and completely platonic best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now his boss is having a destination wedding, and Noah is expected to attend…with Carly, his &lt;i&gt;girlfriend&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carly Randall has no interest in living out a rom-com plot. But Noah is her best friend, so she agrees to help. Still, once they arrive on Cape Cod, she can’t explain the sudden butterflies she feels when he looks at her that way. Or why she doesn’t mind when Noah’s hands stray a little south of her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happens on the Cape stays on the Cape.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except not really, not at all, and once their sexy faux-cation is over, Noah and Carly return to a reality where everything’s changed. Going for it would mean risking their friendship…but forgetting how good they were together just isn’t an option.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Karen Hawkins begins a sparkling new series with this thrilling tale of a desperate beauty on an urgent quest, a dark earl scarred by his beastly past—and the ancient treasure that binds their fates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; A mysterious abductor . . . &lt;/i&gt;Someone is holding her brother prisoner in exchange for a gold-and-onyx box covered in mysterious runes, so Mary Hurst boldly sets out from the family vicarage to find the priceless artifact. But the man who possesses it, Angus Hay, the Earl of Erroll, is less than sympathetic to her plight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A forbidding stranger . . . &lt;/i&gt;Himself a prisoner of his dark past, Angus refuses to yield the box—&lt;i&gt;or &lt;/i&gt;allow Mary to leave! Suspicious of the alluring lass’s mission, he vows to wrest a confession from her, but unearths a fiery temper and a will as strong as his own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unbreakable curse . . . &lt;/i&gt;Passion flares between them, but now there is more at stake: an unknown enemy is hunting down the precious box, and will stop at nothing. Risking all for love, Angus must solve the mystery behind the runes . . . and trust the only woman who can awaken his forgotten heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a perfectly average historical romance. I’m starting to think that’s just how I’m going to fell about all Karen Hawkins’ books. I also feel like I have read this exact book before (but I know I havent’).<br /><br />I like a scarred character, so I was predisposed to like this hero. He’s...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It’s goalie vs. goalie in this brand-new enemies-to-lovers hockey romance from Avon Gale and Piper Vaughn…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryu Mori has had a stellar season as goalie for the Atlanta Venom. So when he’s called into management’s office, he’s expecting to hear he’s the new starting goalie for the team, not that some new guy—an incredibly hot, annoyingly bratty rookie—is here to compete for his spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone gets to play in the best league in the world. Emmitt Armstrong knows that, and he’s not about to waste the opportunity after grinding his way from the bottom to the top. If the Venom is looking for a meek, mild-mannered pushover, they’ve got the wrong guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryu doesn’t want to admit the other goalie’s smart mouth turns him on. Beating Armstrong at practice feels good, sure, but there are other, more fun ways to shut his rival up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this league, it’s winner takes all. But there’s more to life than winning, and if Emmitt and Ryu can get past their egos and competitive natures, they might just discover they work better as partners than they ever imagined possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;b&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise:&lt;/b&gt; all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 72,000 words&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed this book and it had tons of potential, but I was a little disappointed. I just wish there could’ve been more development with the romance. Yes, these characters have great chemistry, but I didn’t really see the journey from sexual chemistry to love. The ending was also a little…lacking...]]>

  <description>Jessamy is moving up the ranks of the Fives—the complex athletic contest favored by the lowliest Commoners and the loftiest Patrons in her embattled kingdom. Pitted against far more formidable adversaries, success is Jes's only option, as her prize money is essential to keeping her hidden family alive. She leaps at the chance to tour the countryside and face more competitors, but then a fatal attack on Jes's traveling party puts her at the center of the war that Lord Kalliarkos—the prince she still loves—is fighting against their country's enemies. With a sinister overlord watching her every move and Kal's life on the line, Jes must now become more than a Fives champion...She must become a warrior.</description>

  <description>"Each volume of four 30-minute histories will dig into the petty name-calling and grumbling grudges that led to many of the world's greatest advancements, all delivered with a cheeky sense of humor."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that most of our dinosaur fossils were discovered because two grown men absolutely hated each other? It’s true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rivals! Frenemies Who Changed the World&lt;/i&gt; is a riotous audio exclusive, like if Monty Python taught your history class. Each volume of four 30-minute histories will dig into the petty name-calling and grumbling grudges that led to many of the world’s greatest advancements, all delivered with a cheeky sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose sides: Cope or Marsh, the jerks who discovered so many dinosaurs; Hamilton or Burr, whose rivalry fueled American politics; Queen Elizabeth or Mary Queen of Scots, who fought to rule England; Adidas or Puma, whose rivalry changed the world of sports and fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnappings, rock fights, duels, and explosions, Rivals! shows world leaders at their absolute best and their worst, often at the same time.</description>

  <description>All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A game of pretend with the highest stakes of all in the latest novel of breathtaking romance from &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Caitlin Crews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty Everett ran off to the rodeo when he turned eighteen and has been riding bulls ever since…until his last fall causes partial amnesia and he must return to Cold River Ranch to figure out what comes next. But how can he pick his next move when he can’t remember how he got here in the first place—much less the beautiful woman who appears at the ranch, claims she knows him, and warms his cold heart for the first time since he woke up in the hospital?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodeo Queen Hannah Monroe gave up her crown for Ty Everett, and her innocence. What she wants from Ty now is a divorce. But Ty can’t remember her—or their secret wedding, or even the son she never meant to hide from him—and Hannah is torn. How can she leave the man she can’t forget and still loves despite herself? And even if she’s willing to start over, what will happen when the truth comes out?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hilarious, entertaining, and illuminating compendium of the most bizarre ways you might become a federal criminal in America—from mailing a mongoose to selling Swiss cheese without enough holes—written and illustrated by the creator of the wildly popular @CrimeADay Twitter account. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever clogged a toilet in a national forest? That could get you six months in federal prison. Written a letter to a pirate? You might be looking at three years in the slammer. Leaving the country with too many nickels, drinking a beer on a bicycle in a national park, or importing a pregnant polar bear are all very real crimes, and this riotously funny, ridiculously entertaining, and fully illustrated book shows how just about anyone can become—or may already be—a federal criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re a criminal defense lawyer or just a self-taught expert in outrageous offenses, &lt;i&gt;How to Become a Federal Criminal &lt;/i&gt;is your wonderfully weird window into a criminally overlooked sector of American government.</description>

  <description>When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time three young ladies vowed to record their first London seasons…and to fill in the gaps of their finishing school educations. Thus began &lt;/i&gt;The Debutante Diaries&lt;i&gt;—and London will never be the same…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HE’S COME TO HER RESCUE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Lily Hartley is the anonymous mastermind behind the ton’s latest obsession: &lt;i&gt;The Debutante’s Revenge, &lt;/i&gt;a titillating advice column for ladies on the marriage mart. To keep her identity secret, Lily delivers her columns disguised as a chimney sweep—which is all well and good, until she unwittingly lands in the middle of an ugly tavern brawl. Fortunately, the devastatingly handsome Duke of Stonebridge sweeps in to rescue her.&lt;i&gt;Un&lt;/i&gt;fortunately, Lily’s dressed as a boy—and holding rather incriminating evidence linking her to the scandalous column. &lt;i&gt;Drat&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE’S LOST HER MEMORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Eric Nash, Duke of Stonebridge, sees a helpless lad receive a nasty blow to the head, he’s outraged. But when he discovers there’s a beautiful woman hiding beneath the chimney sweep’s cap, he’s positively stunned. Nash would happily escort her home, but she’s forgotten her name—leaving him little choice but to take her in himself until he can locate her family. But the closer he gets to finding them, the more he doesn’t want to let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WILL THEY FIND LOVE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily’s trying to figure out exactly who she is…in more ways than one. With so much at stake—her column, her reputation, and even her heart—she needs a plan, and she needs it fast. Before Nash finds her family. Before he learns who she is. Before they fall totally, completely, and utterly inconveniently in love.</description>

      <![CDATA[***I received this book via NetGalley from the publisher in exchange for an honest review***<br /><br />This was a cute story. I feel like I say that a lot, but it's how I feel. The characters were nice and the romance was fairly well-paced. It's also an amnesia story line which I've only read on...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Meg Cabot comes the first story in her Little Bridge Island series—which also includes an excerpt from her forthcoming new full-length novel &lt;em&gt;No Judgments&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for a tropical escape?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Little Bridge, one of the smallest—and most beautiful—islands in the Florida Keys, home to sandy white beaches, salt-rimmed margaritas, stunning sunsets, and some of the quirkiest—but also kindest and most resourceful—people you’ll ever meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical trainer Roberta “Rob” James moved to Little Bridge hoping she’d found paradise, but things haven’t turned out quite as she’d hoped. The closest Rob has come to her “happily ever after” is happy hour at the Mermaid Café with her buddy Bree, the bartender slash waitress who’s got romance problems of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rob’s situation suddenly changes when sheriff’s deputy Ryan Martinez accidentally enrolls in her bridal boot camp class. Turning mush into metal in time for the big day is Rob’s passion (because even the happiest bride could use a little toning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when a guy who’s all mush meets a girl who’s all metal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They discover they have a lot to learn . . . about each other, themselves, and the island paradise they’ve come to call home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Taking place during the most critical period of our nations birth, The First Conspiracy tells a remarkable and previously untold piece of American history that not only reveals George Washingtons character, but also illuminates the origins of Americas counterintelligence movement that led to the modern day CIA.In 1776, an elite group of soldiers were handpicked to serve as George Washingtons bodyguards. Washington trusted them; relied on them. But unbeknownst to Washington, some of them were part of a treasonous plan. In the months leading up to the Revolutionary War, these traitorous soldiers, along with the Governor of New York, William Tryon, and Mayor David Mathews, launched a deadly plot against the most important member of the military: George Washington himself.This is the story of the secret plot and how it was revealed. It is a story of leaders, liars, counterfeiters, and jailhouse confessors. It also shows just how hard the battle was for George Washington and how close America was to losing the Revolutionary War.In this historical masterpiece, New York Times bestselling author Brad Meltzer teams up with American history writer and documentary television producer, Josh Mensch, to unravel the shocking true story behind what has previously been a footnote in the pages of history. Drawing on extensive research, Meltzer and Mensch capture in riveting detail how George Washington not only defeated the most powerful military force in the world, but also uncovered the secret plot against him in the tumultuous days leading up to July 4, 1776. Praise for The First Conspiracy: "This is American history at its finest, a gripping story of spies, killers, counterfeiters, traitorsand a mysterious prostitute who may or may not have even existed.

  <description>When Keri Daniels's boss finds out she has previous carnal knowledge of reclusive bestselling author Joe Kowalski, she gives Keri a choice: get an interview or get a new job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe's never forgotten the first girl to break his heart, so he's intrigued to hear Keri's back in town—and looking for him. He proposes an outrageous plan—for every day she survives with his family on their annual camping trip, Keri can ask one question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between Joe and Keri is as potent as the bug spray, but Joe's sister is out to avenge his broken heart, and Keri hasn't ridden an ATV since she was ten. Who knew a little blackmail, a whole lot of family and some sizzling romantic interludes could make Keri reconsider the old dream of Keri &amp;amp; Joe 2gether 4ever?</description>

      <![CDATA[I read this in like 3 hours. And now I'm sad because I don't have any more Tricia Levenseller books to read. I just really enjoy her writing. For me, there is the right balance of fantasy, action, and romance. I also really appreciate a standalone fantasy.<br /><br />The Viking-inspired elements...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this imaginative escape into enthralling new lands, World Fantasy Award finalist Kate Elliott's first young adult novel weaves an epic story of a girl struggling to do what she loves in a society suffocated by rules of class and privilege. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessamy's life is a balance between acting like an upper-class Patron and dreaming of the freedom of the Commoners. But away from her family she can be whoever she wants when she sneaks out to train for The Fives, an intricate, multilevel athletic competition that offers a chance for glory to the kingdom's best contenders. Then Jes meets Kalliarkos, and an unlikely friendship between two Fives competitors--one of mixed race and the other a Patron boy--causes heads to turn. When Kal's powerful, scheming uncle tears Jes's family apart, she'll have to test her new friend's loyalty and risk the vengeance of a royal clan to save her mother and sisters from certain death.</description>

  <description>"I have never resented Ivan’s good looks. But there are times, once I became of age to date girls and women, that I wish I could look more like him than myself. Women are not often quick to date a monster. &lt;br /&gt;I was okay with that. Until now. Until Winter. She changed everything..." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ivan Petrov is a ruthless Russian businessman who is only six degrees off mob boss. He doesn't care about anything other than getting what he wants. And he wants Winter Rose, the prodigy opera singer, and is willing to torment her sexually until she begs for it. He could care less that Yury, his disfigured and most trusted guard has fallen for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Winter's Beast is one part sugar and sweet, two parts sex and sweat. It is not your typical Romance and although it has an HEA, it's a dark, twisty road to get there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***WARNING*** &lt;br /&gt;***Mature Content***May be triggering for some***</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brand new romantic comedy from New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle’s family runs the best home renovation business in town, but she picked balloons instead of blueprints and they haven’t taken her seriously since. Frankly, she’s over it. Georgie loves planning children’s birthday parties and making people laugh, just not at her own expense. She’s determined to fix herself up into a Woman of the World... whatever that means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase one: new framework for her business (a website from this decade, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase two: a gut-reno on her wardrobe (fyi, leggings are pants.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase three: updates to her exterior (do people still wax?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phase four: put herself on the market (and stop crushing on Travis Ford!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her best life means facing the truth: Georgie hasn’t been on a date since, well, ever. Nobody’s asking the town clown out for a night of hot sex, that’s for sure. Maybe if people think she’s having a steamy love affair, they’ll acknowledge she’s not just the “little sister” who paints faces for a living. And who better to help demolish that image than the resident sports star and tabloid favorite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Ford was major league baseball’s hottest rookie when an injury ended his career. Now he’s flipping houses to keep busy and trying to forget his glory days. But he can’t even cross the street without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there's Georgie, his best friend’s sister, who is not a kid anymore. When she proposes a wild scheme—that they pretend to date, to shock her family and help him land a new job—he agrees. What’s the harm? It’s not like it’s real. But the girl Travis used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman and there’s nothing fake about how much he wants her...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes lady luck shakes your hand, and sometimes she smacks your face. Sometimes she does both on the same day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago I met the most amazing girl in the world. We were both down on our luck. Then I got that call—the one that tells you to get your buns on a plane to go meet your destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the girl was left behind. I didn’t have her phone number, and she didn’t know my real name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I became a professional hockey player, she became a superstar, with platinum records and legions of fans. And a slick, music producer boyfriend who treated her badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fate wasn’t done with us yet. When Delilah turns up at a hockey game, I can’t resist making contact. The internet swoons when I ask her out on a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not remember me. But her jerkface ex does. He’ll do anything to keep us apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing athletes never give up. This time I’m playing for keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information at &lt;a href="https://www.sarinabowen.com/brooklynbruisers" rel="nofollow"&gt;SarinaBowen.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>How come I can never find my keys? Why don't I sleep as well? Why do my friends keep repeating the same stories? What can I do to keep my brain sharp? Scientists know. &lt;em&gt;Your Aging Brain&lt;/em&gt;, by developmental molecular biologist Dr. John Medina, gives you the facts -- and the prescription to age well -- in his engaging signature style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many discoveries over the years, science is literally changing our minds about the optimal care and feeding of the brain. All of it is captivating. A great deal of it is unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Brain Rules&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Medina showed us how our brains really work--and why we ought to redesign our workplaces and schools to match. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Your Aging Brain&lt;/em&gt;, he shares how you can make the most of the years you have left. In a book destined to be a classic on aging, Medina's fascinating stories and infectious sense of humor breathe life into the science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Aging Brain&lt;/em&gt;, is organized into four sections, each laying out familiar problems with surprising solutions. First up, an overview: looking under the hood of an aging brain as it motors through life. The second part focuses on the feeling brain, using topics ranging from relationships and stress to happiness and gullibility to illustrate how our emotions change with age. The third focuses on the thinking brain, explaining how various cognitive gadgets such as working memory and executive function change with time. Each section is sprinkled with practical advice: for example, a certain style of dancing may be better for your brain than eating fish. Medina explains not only how taking certain actions can improve your brain's performance, but also what is known about the brain science behind each intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final section is about the future. Your future. It's filled with topics as joyful as retirement and as heartbreaking as Alzheimer's. Medina connects all of the chapters into a plan, checklist-style, for maintaining your brain health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may already be experiencing the sometimes unpleasant effects of the aging process. Or you may be deeply concerned about your loved ones who are. Either way, &lt;em&gt;Your Aging Brain&lt;/em&gt; is for you.</description>

  <description>Meet Daisy Winters. She's an offbeat sixteen-year-old Floridian with mermaid-red hair, a part time job at a bootleg Walmart, and a perfect older sister who's nearly engaged to the Crown Prince of Scotland. Daisy has no desire to live in the spotlight, but relentless tabloid attention forces her join Ellie at the relative seclusion of the castle across the pond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the dashing young Miles has been appointed to teach Daisy the ropes of being regal, the prince's roguish younger brother kicks up scandal wherever he goes, and tries his best to take Daisy along for the ride. The crown--and the intriguing Miles--might be trying to make Daisy into a lady . . . but Daisy may just rewrite the royal rulebook to suit herself.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a cute YA contemporary. I read it in just a couple of hours and enjoyed my time with the characters. The romance was cute, but not as developed as I would've liked. Actually, I felt that way about a lot of the story. I wanted more development with many of the characters and story lines....]]>

  <description>Alosa's mission is finally complete. Not only has she recovered all three pieces of the map to a legendary hidden treasure, but the pirates who originally took her captive are now prisoners on her ship. Still unfairly attractive and unexpectedly loyal, first mate Riden is a constant distraction, but now he's under her orders. And she takes great comfort in knowing that the villainous Vordan will soon be facing her father's justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vordan exposes a secret her father has kept for years, Alosa and her crew find themselves in a deadly race with the feared Pirate King. Despite the danger, Alosa knows they will recover the treasure first . . . after all, she is the daughter of the Siren Queen.</description>

It was fun, engaging, and full of great characters.<br /><br />A lot of M/M romances (I've read) are pretty angsty. Keaton and Luke don't have perfect lives, but there isn't a ton of angst.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What does a Wickedly Wonderful Widow really want? One noble suitor is about to find out. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline, Dowager Countess of Wake, is all on her own after her husband’s sudden death. The good news? Losing him allowed her to find herself. Finally, Adeline is free to do, go, and &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; as she pleases. She cherishes her newfound independence and is not looking for another man to wed. But seeking out a new lover? Well, that is a whole ’nother story. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord Lyon, son of the two-timing Earl of Marksworth, wishes to have a respectable, loving wife someday. When he meets the beautiful and self-reliant Adeline, Lyon is instantly smitten. But Adeline would rather have the handsome suitor in her bed than to take his hand in marriage. It’s a scandalous proposal—and one that’s hard for Lyon to refuse. Unless the fire of his passion can melt Adeline’s resolve. . .and he can find a way to be the Wickedly Wonderful Widow’s lover for all time?</description>

  <description>How do elite athletes and star business leaders alike achieve their peak performance? Effective habits, rather than innate talent, are the keys to success in work and life. Dr. Jason Selk and star business coach Tom Bartow combine the most effective elements of both their disciplines to offer an organizational improvement plan that anyone can learn and apply right away. ORGANIZE TOMORROW TODAY is composed of eight simple, concrete, easy-to-understand guidelines-the multitasking myth, building and breaking habits, the two-minute mental toughness drill, and more. The key to high-level success is to pick one thing to change and master it. Then, over time, you can build on it, one step at a time. ORGANIZE TOMORROW TODAY is a blueprint for success.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third sizzling novel in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Karen Hawkins’s Duchess Diaries series, featuring three unruly sisters and their headstrong godmother with a penchant for matchmaking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reclusive Viscount Kirk, horribly scarred by a tragic accident that stole the life of his beloved first wife, is a man defined by fury. For years he’s eschewed society, growing abrupt and curmudgeonly. But now, when he’d given up on life, he’s fallen madly in love with the refreshingly naive daughter of his neighbor, dainty and charming Dahlia Balfour. Desperate to win her attention, Kirk calls in a favor from the Duchess of Roxburghe and asks that she transform him into a fashionable suitor for Dahlia’s hand. But what’s easy to change on the outside, isn’t as easy to change on the inside…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dahlia’s always dreamed of a fairytale romance. Although Viscount Kirk is only seven years her senior, because of his cantankerous ways and lack of social graces she thinks of him as her “older neighbor,” and is blissfully unaware that he sees her as anything other than an acquaintance. She is shocked to see him at the duchess’s grand house party, trying to fit with the very societal rules he so frequently mocks. Surprised by his attention, irritated at his bald honesty, and intrigued that he finds her worth the effort, Dahlia regards Kirk as the opposite of Prince Charming. Without the pretty words and grand gestures she yearns for, can true love find its way into her unwilling heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In Georgina Kincaid, succubus and she-demon, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Richelle Mead has created one of her most enticing characters. But with a shot at love, and maybe even redemption, is the ultimate seductress finally going soft? Like hell she is. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgina Kincaid has had an eternity to figure out the opposite sex, but sometimes they still surprise her. Take Seth Mortensen. The man has risked his soul to become Georgina's boyfriend. Still, with Lucifer for a boss, Georgina can't just hang up her killer heels and settle down to domestic bliss. In fact, she's being forced to transfer operations. . .to Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of Sin is a dream gig for a succubus, but Georgina's allies are suspicious. Why are the powers-that-be so eager to get her away from Seattle and from Seth? Georgina is one of Hell's most valuable assets, but if there's any way out of the succubus business she plans to take it, no matter how much roadkill she leaves behind. She just hopes the casualties won't include the one man she's risking everything for. . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SINGLE LADY SEEKS DUKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lady Delilah Montebank&lt;/b&gt; has her marital sights set on the Duke of Branville. There’s just one problem: he barely knows she exists. But no matter, she’s got a plan to win him over with her charm, her wit—and perhaps the love potion she has in her possession wouldn’t hurt her cause...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lord Thomas Hobbs&lt;/b&gt;, Duke of Huntley, thinks his best friend Delilah’s quest to become a duchess is ridiculous. He’s always said he’d rather give up all the brandy in London than commit to one person for life. Besides, he knows that Delilah’s love potion can’t possibly win over Branville…since she accidentally gave it to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; instead. But perhaps this is the excuse he needs to show her he’s always loved her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delilah can’t believe she gave the potion to the wrong duke. Then again, Delilah could do a lot worse than win the hand of her handsome best friend. Could it be that the right duke has been before her eyes all along?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If one must flirt...flirt with danger.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Lessons in the art of espionage aboard Mademoiselle Geraldine's floating dirigible have become tedious without Sophronia's sootie Soap nearby. She would rather thwart dastardly Picklemen, yet her concerns about their wicked intentions are ignored. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can she trust? Royal werewolf dewan? Stylish vampire Lord Akeldama? Only one thing is certain: a large-scale plot is under way. Sophronia must be ready to save her friends, her school, and all of London from disaster.</description>

  <description>Sophronia continues her second year at finishing school in style—with a steel-bladed fan secreted in the folds of her ball gown, of course. Such a fashionable choice of weapon comes in handy when Sophronia, her best friend Dimity, sweet sootie Soap, and the charming Lord Felix Mersey stowaway on a train to return their classmate Sidheag to her werewolf pack in Scotland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one suspected what—or who—they would find aboard that suspiciously empty train. Sophronia uncovers a plot that threatens to throw all of London into chaos and she must decide where her loyalties lie, once and for all.</description>

  <description>Georgina Kincaid has formidable powers. Immortality, seduction, shape-shifting into any human form she desires, walking in heels that would cripple mere mortals -- all child's play to a succubus like her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helping to plan her ex-boyfriend's wedding is a different story. Georgina isn't sure which is worse -- that Seth is marrying another woman, or that Georgina has to run all over Seattle trying on bridesmaid dresses. Still, there are distractions. Georgina's roommate, Roman, is cluttering her apartment with sexual tension. Then there's Simone, the new succubus in town, who's intent on corrupting Seth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real danger lies in the mysterious force that's visiting her thoughts, trying to draw her into a dark, otherworldly realm. Sooner or later, Georgina knows she'll be too weak to resist. And when that happens, she'll discover who she can trust, who she can't -- and that Hell is far from the worst place to spend eternity...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-new STANDALONE from New York Times bestselling author Julia Kent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started with the wrong Help Wanted ad. Of course it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a professional fluffer. It’s NOT what you think. I stage homes for a living. Real estate agents love me, and my work stands on its own merits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh. Get your mind out of the gutter. Go ahead. Laugh. I’ll wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See? That’s the problem. My career has used the term “fluffer” for decades. I didn’t even know there was a more… lascivious definition of the term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until it was too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad for a “professional fluffer” on Craigslist seemed like divine intervention. My last unemployment check was in the bank. I was desperate. Rent was due. The ad said cash paid at the end of the day. The perfect job! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staging homes means showing your best angle. The same principle applies in making a certain kind of movie. Turns out a “fluffer” doesn’t arrange decorative pillows on a couch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrange other soft, round-ish objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The job isn’t hard. Er, I mean, it is — it’s about being hard. Or, well… helping other people to be hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, man…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s the other problem. A man. No, not one of the stars on the movie set. Will Lotham – my high school crush. The owner of the house where we’re filming. Illegally. In a vacation rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time the cops show up, what I thought was just a great house staging gig turned into a nightmare involving pictures of me with an undressed star, Will rescuing me from an arrest, and a humiliating lesson in my own naivete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job turned out to be so much harder than I expected. But you know what’s easier than I ever imagined?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having all my dreams come true.</description>

  <description>Petite, kind, brilliant, and young, Stevie is nothing like the usual women bodyguard Shen Li is interested in. Even more surprising, the youngest of the lethal, ball-busting, and beautiful MacKilligan sisters is terrified of bears. But she’s not terrified of pandas. She loves pandas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which means that whether Shen wants her to or not, she simply won’t stop cuddling him. He isn’t some stuffed Giant Panda, ya know! He is a Giant Panda shifter. He deserves respect and personal space. Something that little hybrid is completely ignoring.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Stevie has a way of finding trouble. Like going undercover to take down a scientist experimenting on other shifters. For what, Shen doesn’t want to know, but they’d better find out. And fast. Stevie might be the least violent of the honey badger sisters, but she’s the most dangerous to Shen’s peace of mind. Because she has absolutely no idea how much trouble they’re in . . . or just how damn adorable she is.</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Trinity Marrow may be going blind, but she can see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Her unique gift is part of a secret so dangerous that she’s been in hiding for years in an isolated compound fiercely guarded by Wardens—gargoyle shape-shifters who protect humankind from demons. If the demons discover the truth about Trinity, they’ll devour her, flesh and bone, to enhance their own powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wardens from another clan arrive with disturbing reports that something out there is killing both demons and Wardens, Trinity’s safe world implodes. Not the least because one of the outsiders is the most annoying and fascinating person she’s ever met. Zayne has secrets of his own that will upend her world yet again—but working together becomes imperative once demons breach the compound and Trinity’s secret comes to light. To save her family and maybe the world, she’ll have to put her trust in Zayne. But all bets are off as a supernatural war is unleashed…</description>

  <description>A wrong number is supposed to be just that—a wrong number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delete. &lt;i&gt;Done.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not continue to text. Do not flirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wrong number shouldn't be the first person on your mind in the morning, or the last at night...and you're &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; not supposed to talk them into buying a baby goat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because that would be weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zach Hastings and I get into a wrong-number mix-up, we don't follow the rules. We keep texting and flirting, because he's wicked funny and perfectly nerdy and a wonderful distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not looking for love, and Zach definitely had the wrong number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he's the right guy.</description>

  <description>It's been two years since Enna was swept up in a heart-pounding court adventure. Now, having returned to her old life in the forests of Bayern, she is growing restless. When a strange force takes possession of her brother, Liefer, she returns to the capital to seek the help of her friend Isi, Bayern's princess. But Bayern is tottering on the verge of war with neighboring Tira.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When endowed with the terrifying gift that destroyed Liefer, Enna takes herself to war-only to embark on an epic journey of discovery and betrayal that will force her to come of age. Shannon Hale's fiery companion to her acclaimed retelling of &lt;i&gt;The Goose Girl&lt;/i&gt; is dark, intricate, deeply passionate, and ultimately triumphant. Listeners, whether returning to Bayern or making their first visit, will find themselves enthralled.</description>

So, it was definitely a stressful/tense read (or listen).<br /><br />The friendship between Enna and Isi is maybe one of the best friendships in all of fiction. It's so real, honest, and...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Does one need four fully grown foxgloves for decorating a dinner table for six guests? Or is it six foxgloves to kill four fully grown guests?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophronia's first year at Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality has certainly been rousing! For one thing, finishing school is training her to be a spy--won't Mumsy be surprised? Furthermore, Sophronia got mixed up in an intrigue over a stolen device and had a cheese pie thrown at her in a most horrid display of poor manners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as she sneaks around the dirigible school, eavesdropping on the teachers' quarters and making clandestine climbs to the ship's boiler room, she learns that there may be more to a field trip to London than is apparent at first. A conspiracy is afoot--one with dire implications for both supernaturals and humans. Sophronia must rely on her training to discover who is behind the dangerous plot-and survive the London Season with a full dance card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel to &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Etiquette &amp;amp; Espionage&lt;/i&gt;, class is back in session with more petticoats and poison, tea trays and treason. Gail's distinctive voice, signature humor, and lush steampunk setting are sure to be the height of fashion this season.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Katie McGarry’s trademark wrong-side-of-the-tracks romance is given a new twist in the gritty YA contemporary novel, &lt;i&gt;Only a Breath Apart&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say your destiny is carved in stone. But some destinies are meant to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only curse Jesse Lachlin believes in is his grandmother’s will: in order to inherit his family farm he must win the approval of his childhood best friend, the girl he froze out his freshman year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fortuneteller tells Scarlett she's psychic, but what is real is Scarlett’s father’s controlling attitude and the dark secrets at home. She may be able to escape, but only if she can rely on the one boy who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each midnight meeting pushes Jesse and Scarlett to confront their secrets and their feelings, but as love blooms, the curse rears its ugly head…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>Cunning, instructive, and amoral, this controversial bestseller distills 3,000 years of the history of power into 48 well-explicated laws. Law 1: Never Outshine the Master. Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions. Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit. Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally. Law 33: Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These are the laws of power in their unvarnished essence—the philosophies of Machiavelli (&lt;i&gt;The Prince&lt;/i&gt;), Sun-tzu (&lt;i&gt;The Art of War&lt;/i&gt;), Carl von Clausewitz, Talleyrand, the great seducer Casanova, con man Yellow Kid Weil, and other legendary thinkers and schemers. They teach prudence, stealth, mastery of one's emotions, the art of deception, and the total absence of mercy. Like it or not, all have practical applications in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each law is illustrated with examples of observance or transgression drawn from history and featuring such famous figures as Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, Mao, Alfred Hitchcock, P.T. Barnum, Haile Selassie, Catherine the Great, and Socrates. Convincing, practical, sometimes shocking, this book will fascinate anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control.</description>

  <description>How far would you be willing to go for your first love?&lt;br /&gt;Colin has broken every promise he's ever made, but what hurts him the most is the harsh memory of the way in which he abandoned the only girl for which he'd ever truly cared. After a summer romance in Shanghai with his host family's daughter, Feng Huang, he begged her to join him in America, only to fail her when she finally sacrificed everything for their future together.&lt;br /&gt;Shanghai-born Feng Huang has spent the last six years trying to get over Colin. Now beloved by the world as a famous pop star, she's moved on with a wealthy Chinese-American entrepreneur. When Colin appears in front of her at her boyfriend's gala celebrating her return to Shanghai, she is overcome by both the pain and love, which still linger inside her at the mere sight of him.&lt;br /&gt;Yet, nothing is as it seems, and when the sinister elements which have thrust them back into each other's orbit reveal themselves and threaten more than just their precious second opportunity at love.&lt;br /&gt;Will their stolen night together bring them the future of which they had always dreamed, or will Colin betray her love yet again?</description>

  <description>"A richly nuanced -- and smolderingly clever -- book about letting love shine in places where the past feels bigger than it needs to be. The cast of side characters range from quirky to mysterious, lending tremendous authenticity and depth to a romantic story that is so much more. A one-click must read!" Julia Kent, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A heartbreaking tale of letting go and learning to love again. A jaw-dropping debut novel you have to read.” - Helena Newbury, New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you start over when you gave everything to one life, one plan, and lost it all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Althea refuses to allow herself to love again. Imprisoned in grief at twenty-four after her husband’s sudden death, she’s convinced her heart died along with him. She spends her days honoring his memory by clinging to the legal career he helped her to build and to the remaining pieces linking her to their life together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffen’s been running from his past. Despite success as an author and investigative journalist, he’s been traveling through life on autopilot. For a decade, he’s chosen perilous adventures and meaningless sex over the danger of any attachments. When he finally returns home to Pittsburgh, he’s slammed by the awakened memories and regret he’s spent years trying to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter brings them together. Their instant desire for each other –and the bond they discover between them – shocks them both. Despite her best efforts, Althea can’t resist Griffen’s charm or his intriguing proposition– if she agrees to a no-strings affair with him for the two weeks he’s in town, he swears he’ll walk away when their time is up. Assured she can test the waters of a new life while keeping her vow never to betray her husband’s memory by opening her heart to another, Althea throws herself into the escape Griffen provides her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their perfect plans go awry when the intensity of their connection overwhelms them. Will they risk it all on the chance of something great together…or will the power of their secrets and guilt tear them apart?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Kleypas delivers a scintillating tale of a beautiful, young widow who finds passion with the one man she shouldn't...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although beautiful young widow Phoebe, Lady Clare, has never met West Ravenel, she knows one thing for certain: he's a mean, rotten bully. Back in boarding school, he made her late husband's life a misery, and she'll never forgive him for it. But when Phoebe attends a family wedding, she encounters a dashing and impossibly charming stranger who sends a fire-and-ice jolt of attraction through her. And then he introduces himself...as none other than West Ravenel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West is a man with a tarnished past. No apologies, no excuses. However, from the moment he meets Phoebe, West is consumed by irresistible desire...not to mention the bitter awareness that a woman like her is far out of his reach. What West doesn't bargain on is that Phoebe is no straitlaced aristocratic lady. She's the daughter of a strong-willed wallflower who long ago eloped with Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent—the most devilishly wicked rake in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Phoebe sets out to seduce the man who has awakened her fiery nature and shown her unimaginable pleasure. Will their overwhelming passion be enough to overcome the obstacles of the past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the devil's daughter knows...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Shouldn't a girl get to star in her own love story?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Megan Harper is about due for her next sweeping romance. It's inevitable—each of her relationships starts with the perfect guy and ends with him falling in love . . . with someone else. But instead of feeling sorry for herself, Megan focuses on pursuing her next fling, directing theater, and fulfilling her dream college's acting requirement in the smallest role possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she’s cast as Juliet (yes, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; Juliet) in her high school’s production, it’s a complete nightmare. Megan’s not an actress, and she’s used to being upstaged—both in and out of the theater. In fact, with her mom off in Texas and her dad remarried and on to baby #2 with his new wife, Megan worries that, just like her exes, her family is moving on without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Owen Okita, an aspiring playwright inspired by Rosaline from Shakespeare's &lt;i&gt;R+J&lt;/i&gt;. A character who, like Megan, knows a thing or two about short-lived relationships. Megan agrees to help Owen with his play in exchange for help catching the eye of a sexy stagehand/potential new boyfriend. Yet Megan finds herself growing closer to Owen, and wonders if he could be the Romeo she never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their fresh and funny debut, Emily Wibberly and Austin Siegemund-Broka break down the high school drama to find there's always room for familial love, romantic love, and—most importantly—self-love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London socialite Amelia-Rose Baxter is nobody’s fool. Her parents may want her to catch a title, but she will never change who she is for the promise of marriage. Her husband will be a man who can appreciate her sharp mind as well as her body. A sophisticated man who loves life in London. A man who considers her his equal―and won’t try to tame her wild heart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;IN THE HIGHLANDS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rough, rugged Highlander Niall MacTaggert and his brothers know the rules: the eldest must marry or lose the ancestral estate, period. But Niall’s eldest brother just isn’t interested in the lady his mother selected. Is it because Amelia-Rose is just too. . . Free-spirited? Yes. Brazen? Aye. Surely Niall can find a way to soften up the whip-smart lass and make her the perfect match for his brother for the sake of the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT HOTTER.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead it’s Niall who tempts Amelia-Rose, despite her reservations about barbarian Highlanders. Niall finds the lass nigh irresistible as well, but he won’t make the mistake his father did in marrying an Englishwoman who doesn’t like the Highlands. Does he have what it takes to win her heart? There is only one way to find out...</description>

  <description>People travel from afar to the small isle in the Aegean Sea hoping for a single glimpse of Princess Psyche. Their adoration for the mortal woman is so all-consuming that citizens begin to shower her with the very gifts and offerings they once left at the alter of Venus, goddess of love and beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But gods are known for their jealousy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cupid, the god of love, takes pleasure in causing strife and mischief in the lives of humans. He uses love as a weapon, humoring in the weakness of people at the whims of their feelings. When his mother Venus approaches him about punishing the human girl who dares to steal her offerings and affections from the people, Cupid gladly accepts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psyche's punishment is to be given to a mysterious creature who only comes to her in the dark of night under the pact that she will never lay eyes on him. She is terrified of this stranger, who the oracle described as a serpent. Her mate, however, is masterful in his dealings with his bride. He takes his time, morphing her fears into different sensations completely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the Roman/Greek mythology of Cupid and Psyche by Lucius Apuleius, New York Times bestseller Wendy Higgins brings the tale to life, weaving layers that show exactly how a sacrificial lamb can be enchanted by an unseen monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult Historical Fantasy. Standalone.</description>

  <description>A year ago, Flynn Cormac and Jubilee Chase made the now infamous Avon Broadcast, calling on the galaxy to witness for their planet, and protect them from destruction. Some say Flynn’s a madman, others whisper about conspiracies. Nobody knows the truth. A year before that, Tarver Merendsen and Lilac LaRoux were rescued from a terrible shipwreck—now, they live a public life in front of the cameras, and a secret life away from the world’s gaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in the center of the universe on the planet of Corinth, all four are about to collide with two new players, who will bring the fight against LaRoux Industries to a head. Gideon Marchant is an eighteen-year-old computer hacker—a whiz kid and an urban warrior. He’ll climb, abseil and worm his way past the best security measures to pull off onsite hacks that others don’t dare touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sofia Quinn has a killer smile, and by the time you’re done noticing it, she’s got you offering up your wallet, your car, and anything else she desires. She holds LaRoux Industries responsible for the mysterious death of her father and is out for revenge at any cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a LaRoux Industries security breach interrupts Gideon and Sofia’s separate attempts to infiltrate their headquarters, they’re forced to work together to escape. Each of them has their own reason for wanting to take down LaRoux Industries, and neither trusts the other. But working together might be the best chance they have to expose the secrets LRI is so desperate to hide.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ISBN13: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48845486-the-hating-game" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780062439604&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>Jane Austen's first novel—published posthumously in 1818—tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen's fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical novel pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There will be plenty of time for me to beat him soundly once I’ve gotten what I came for.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent on a mission to retrieve an ancient hidden map—the key to a legendary treasure trove—seventeen-year-old pirate captain Alosa deliberately allows herself to be captured by her enemies, giving her the perfect opportunity to search their ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a match for the ruthless pirate crew, Alosa has only one thing standing between her and the map: her captor, the unexpectedly clever and unfairly attractive first mate, Riden. But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.</description>

      <![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoyed this. It isn't a massive fantasy with multiple POVs and I'm thankful for that. There is a fairly substantial romance element, but I didn't think it was the main focus and I liked it.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It's one thing to learn to curtsy properly. It's quite another to learn to curtsy and throw a knife at the same time. Welcome to Finishing School.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen-year-old Sophronia is a great trial to her poor mother. Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper manners--and the family can only hope that company never sees her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. So she enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sophronia soon realizes the school is not quite what her mother might have hoped. At Mademoiselle Geraldine's, young ladies learn to finish...everything. Certainly, they learn the fine arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but they also learn to deal out death, diversion, and espionage--in the politest possible ways, of course. Sophronia and her friends are in for a rousing first year's education.</description>

  <description>Georgina Kincaid has been a bad, bad succubus. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. . .which should be a good thing. But lately, thanks to her foul mood over breaking up with bestselling writer Seth Mortensen, she's been so wicked that Seattle's über-demon Jerome, decides to "outsource " Georgina to a rival—and have her spy for him in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being exiled to the frozen north—okay, Vancouver—and leaving Seth in the cozy clutches of his new girlfriend is unpleasant enough. Then Jerome is kidnapped, and all immortals under his control mysteriously lose their powers. One bright spot: with her life-sucking ability gone, there's nothing to keep Georgina from getting down and dirty with Seth—nothing apart from his girlfriend that is. Now, as the supernatural population starts turning on itself, a newly mortal Georgina must rescue her boss and figure out who's been playing them—or all hell will break loose. . .</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, &lt;em&gt;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 5 hours and 30 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Fox News' politics editor Chris Stirewalt -- a fun and lively account of America's populist tradition, from Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt, to Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, and Donald Trump.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the ideological fad of the moment, American populism has always been home to a fascinating assortment of charismatic leaders, characters, kooks, cranks, and sometimes charlatans who have - with widely varying degrees of success - led the charge of ordinary folks who have gotten wise to the ways of the swamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This attitude of skeptical resentment also makes populism a fertile field for the work of conspiracy theorists and other enthusiastic apostates from civic convention. After all, if the people in power are found to be rigging one part of the system, why not the rest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERY MAN A KING tells the stories of America's populist leaders, from an elderly Andrew Jackson brutally caning his would-be-assassin, to William Jennings Bryan's pre-speech routine that combined equally prodigious quantities of prayer and food, to Ross Perot's military-style campaign that made even volunteers wear badges with stars to show rank. It is a rollicking history of an American attitude that has shaped not only our current moment, but also the long struggle over who gets to define the truths we hold to be self evident.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From the New York Times bestselling author of Off the Clock comes a story of love, hate, and the fire that ignites when the two collide... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Elle McCray has a plan. Work hard. Be the best. And do it alone. After her ex-husband’s betrayal, she’s learned being feared is a hell of a lot easier than being humiliated. So when trouble personified, Lane Cannon, dares to flirt with her, she shuts him down cold. Too gorgeous. Too cocky. And his job as The Grove’s sexual surrogate is to sleep with patients. No, thank you.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former escort Lane Cannon has spent enough years with people looking down on him. Stupid. Trailer trash. Rent boy. He’s heard it all. He’s worked too hard to shed his past to let some haughty doctor cut him down. But something about Elle’s ice queen act has his dominant instincts perking up and his body taking notice. He can’t walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an evening of verbal sparring turns into a night of steamy hate sex, Lane’s ready for round two. But Elle proposes a business deal. How better to keep things strictly physical than to pay him for his services? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane wants her, not her money. But he’ll play along in exchange for one thing—all the control. It’s only supposed to be a dirty little fling between colleagues, but these two are about to learn a lesson in love…by the hour.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;All of London knows the Duke of Rutherford has position and wealth. They also whisper that he’s dissolute, devilish, and determinedly unwed. So why, everyone is asking, has he hired a governess?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Miss Lily Russell crosses the threshold of the Duke of Rutherford’s stylish townhouse, she knows she has come face to face with sensual danger. For this is no doting papa. Rather, his behavior is scandalous, and his reputation rightly earned. And his pursuit of her is nearly irresistible—but resist she must for the sake of her pupil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the duke himself, it was bad enough when his unknown child landed on his doorstep. Now Lily, with her unassuming beauty, has aroused his most wicked fantasies—and, shockingly, his desire to change his wanton ways. He’s determined to become worthy of her, and so he asks for her help in correcting his behavior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lily has a secret, one that, if it becomes known, could change everything…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lady’s Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lady Henrietta Sedley declares her twenty-ninth year her own, she has plans to inherit her father’s business, to make her own fortune, and to live her own life. But first, she intends to experience a taste of the pleasure she’ll forgo as a confirmed spinster. Everything is going perfectly... until she discovers the most beautiful man she’s ever seen tied up in her carriage and threatening to ruin the Year of Hattie before it’s even begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bastard’s Proposal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he wakes in a carriage at Hattie’s feet, Whit, a king of Covent Garden known to all the world as Beast, can’t help but wonder about the strange woman who frees him—especially when he discovers she’s headed for a night of pleasure... on his turf. He is more than happy to offer Hattie all she desires... for a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Unexpected Passion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Hattie and Whit find themselves rivals in business and pleasure. She won’t give up her plans; he won’t give up his power... and neither of them sees that if they’re not careful, they’ll have no choice but to give up everything... including their hearts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows the girl is off limits. But it's so good to be bad. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this girl...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi and I have been trading hungry looks all year, and everything she does makes me smile. But I don't do girlfriends, and I certainly can't get involved with the league commissioner's daughter. I need shots on goal, not a hookup and a widely misunderstood paparazzi photo.&lt;br /&gt;Can I resist her, though? The way she teases me should be a game penalty for interference with my libido.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this guy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason wants me, but he won't admit it. That man looks at me the way a hockey player eyes the lunch buffet after practice--and I love it. &lt;br /&gt;But when victory is finally within my grasp, I blow it and humiliate myself. Even then I can't even avoid him--as the team intern, I'm in constant view of his hard body and cocky smile. &lt;br /&gt;I need another chance. Jason Castro is about to learn the true meaning of an overnight sensation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some days, a girl just can't catch a break...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men, can't have sex with her gorgeous bestselling author boyfriend Seth Mortensen--in case she inadvertently kills him. Second, Georgina's under demonic orders to mentor the new (and surprisingly inept) succubus on the block. Third, someone's manipulating her dreams, draining her energy and supplying eerie visions of her future. Georgina seeks answers from Dante, a dream interpreter with ties to the underworld, but his flirtatious charm only leaves her more confused--especially as the situation with Seth reaches a crisis point. Georgina needs to rein in her out-of-control love life and go toe-to-toe with an enemy capable of wreaking serious havoc among mankind. Otherwise, Georgina, and the entire mortal world, may never sleep easy again...</description>

  <description>Love hurts, and no one knows it better than Georgina Kincaid. If she so much as kisses Seth Mortensen, the shy, sexy writer she's been dating, she'll drain his life force. Admittedly, the shape shifting and immortality perks of a succubus are terrific, but it's completely unfair that a she-demon whose purpose is seduction can't get down with the one mortal who accepts her for who she is. . .&lt;br /&gt;It's not just her personal life that's in chaos. Doug, Georgina's co-worker at a local bookstore, has been exhibiting bizarre behavior, and Georgina suspects something far more demonic than double espressos. She could use an assist from Bastien, an irresistibly charming incubus and her best immortal friend, but he's giving Georgina some highly distracting come-hither vibes. Georgina is going to have to work solo on this one--and fast, because soon, Doug's life won't be the only one on the line. . .</description>

  <description>When it comes to jobs in hell, being a succubus seems pretty glamorous. A girl can be anything she wants, the wardrobe is killer, and mortal men will do anything just for a touch. Granted, they often pay with their souls, but why get technical?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Seattle succubus Georgina Kincaid's life is far less exotic. At least there's her day job at a local bookstore--free books; all the white chocolate mochas she can drink; and easy access to bestselling, sexy writer, Seth Mortensen, aka He Whom She Would Give Anything to Touch but Can't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dreaming about Seth will have to wait. Something wicked is at work in Seattle's demon underground. And for once, all of her hot charms and drop-dead one-liners won't help because Georgina's about to discover there are some creatures out there that both heaven and hell want to deny. . .</description>

  <description>Remember this name: Anna Randol! Destined to be a superstar of historical romance fiction, Anna makes a spectacular debut with &lt;em&gt;A Secret in Her Kiss&lt;/em&gt;—a heart-soaring romantic chronicle set in the heart of the Ottoman Empire. This is the story of a sultry and adventurous romance between an independent lady fiercely determined to live life on her own terms and a handsome soldier willing to break every rule he believes in for a love he never dreamed possible. &lt;em&gt;A Secret in Her Kiss&lt;/em&gt; is exciting, exotic, and original; colorful and glorious—a treat for fans of Loretta Chase, Sherry Thomas, and Stephanie Laurens—with nary a ballroom or hedgerow to be found. This is not your typical historical romance.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wingman rule number one: don’t fall for a client.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a career-ending accident, former NFL recruit Ian Hunter is back on campus—and he’s ready to get his new game on. As one of the masterminds behind Wingmen, Inc., a successful and secretive word-of-mouth dating service, he’s putting his extensive skills with women to work for the lovelorn. But when Blake Olson requests the services of Wingmen, Inc., Ian may have landed his most hopeless client yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her frumpy athletic gear to her unfortunate choice of footwear, Blake is going to need a miracle if she wants to land her crush. At least with a professional matchmaker by her side she has a fighting chance. Ian knows that his advice and a makeover can turn Blake into another successful match. But as Blake begins the transformation from hot mess to smokin’ hot, Ian realizes he’s in danger of breaking his cardinal rule.…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Year after year, readers pulled me aside at events and said, "I've never had a problem starting. I've started a million things, but I never finish them. Why can't I finish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to studies, 92 percent of New Year's resolutions fail. You've practically got a better shot at getting into Juilliard to become a ballerina than you do at finishing your goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I thought my problem was that I didn't try hard enough. So I started getting up earlier. I drank enough energy drinks to kill a horse. I hired a life coach and ate more superfoods. Nothing worked, although I did develop a pretty nice eyelid tremor from all the caffeine. It was like my eye was waving at you, very, very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, while leading a thirty-day online course to help people work on their goals, I learned something surprising: The most effective exercises were not those that pushed people to work harder. The ones that got people to the finish line did just the opposite-- they took the pressure off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because the sneakiest obstacle to meeting your goals is not laziness, but perfectionism. We're our own worst critics, and if it looks like we're not going to do something right, we prefer not to do it at all. That's why we're most likely to quit on day two, "the day after perfect"--when our results almost always underper-form our aspirations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strategies in this book are counterintuitive and might feel like cheating. But they're based on studies conducted by a university researcher with hundreds of participants. You might not guess that having more fun, eliminating your secret rules, and choosing something to bomb intentionally works. But the data says otherwise. People who have fun are 43 percent more successful! Imagine if your diet, guitar playing, or small business was 43 percent more suc-cessful just by following a few simple principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're tired of being a chronic starter and want to become a consistent finisher, you have two options: You can continue to beat yourself up and try harder, since this time that will work. Or you can give yourself the gift of done.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;They call him the Duke of Ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To an undaunted wallflower, he's just the beast next door.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy and ruthless, Gabriel Duke clawed his way from the lowliest slums to the pinnacle of high society—and now he wants to get even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyal and passionate, Lady Penelope Campion never met a lost or wounded creature she wouldn’t take into her home and her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her imposing—and attractive—new neighbor demands she clear out the rescued animals, Penny sets him a challenge. She will part with her precious charges, if he can find them loving homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done, Gabriel says. How hard can it be to find homes for a few kittens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a two-legged dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a foul-mouthed parrot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a goat, an otter, a hedgehog . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done, for a cold-blooded bastard who wouldn’t know a loving home from a workhouse. Soon he’s covered in cat hair, knee-deep in adorable, and bewitched by a shyly pretty spinster who defies his every attempt to resist. Now she’s set her mind and heart on saving him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if he ruins her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Content advisories are available for this book at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tessadare.com/content-advisories/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tessadare.com/content-advisories/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;he &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling collection from FOX News star Greg Gutfeld features his best and pithiest monologues on the current state of the world, covering everything from pop culture to politics, annotated for the modern day with all new content.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Wherever I go, I am hit repeatedly by the same question: where can I read your monologues? It should be easy to find these little nuggets of knowledge.”&lt;/i&gt; Well, now it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past few years, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld has covered everything from crazed academics, to unhinged celebrities, to the wildest election in recent history on his shows &lt;i&gt;The Five&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Greg Gutfeld Show&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;The Gutfeld Monologues,&lt;/i&gt; he brings together his best and favorite monologues in this funny, unconventional collection for new and longtime fans alike. Scored through with marginal edits, scratch-outs, 20/20 hindsight, and up-to-the-minute commentary on what he got wrong, this book isn’t your typical anthology collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his signature humor, wit, and insight, Greg explains it all in this memorable collection about some of our country’s most crucial—and not so crucial—modern moments.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Discrimination and Disparities&lt;/i&gt; challenges believers in such one-factor explanations of economic outcome differences as discrimination, exploitation or genetics. It is readable enough for people with no prior knowledge of economics. Yet the empirical evidence with which it backs up its analysis spans the globe and challenges beliefs across the ideological spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of &lt;i&gt;Discrimination and Disparities&lt;/i&gt; is not to recommend some particular policy "fix" at the end, but to clarify why so many policy fixes have turned out to be counterproductive, and to expose some seemingly invincible fallacies behind many counterproductive policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final chapter deals with social visions and their human consequences.</description>

  <description>The fourth edition of "Basic Economics" is both expanded and updated. A new chapter on the history of economics itself has been added, and the implications of that history examined. Among other additions throughout the book, a new section on the special role of corporations in the economy has been added to the chapter on government and big business."Basic Economics," which has now been translated into six foreign languages, has grown so much that a large amount of material previously found in the back of the book has now been put online instead so that neither the book itself nor its price will have to expand. The central idea of "Basic Economics," however, remains the same: The fundamental facts and principles of economics do not require jargon, graphs, or equations and can be learned in a relaxed and even enjoyable way.</description>

  <description>These wide-ranging essays—on many individual political, economic, cultural and legal issues—have as a recurring, underlying theme the decline of the values and institutions that have sustained and advanced American society for more than two centuries. This decline has been more than an erosion. It has, in many cases, been a deliberate dismantling of American values and institutions by people convinced that their superior wisdom and virtue must over-ride both the traditions of the country and the will of the people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether these essays (originally published as syndicated newspaper columns) are individually about financial bailouts, illegal immigrants, gay marriage, national security, or the Duke University rape case, the underlying concern is about what these very different kinds of things say about the general direction of American society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This larger and longer-lasting question is whether the particular issues discussed reflect a degeneration or dismantling of the America that we once knew and expected to pass on to our children and grandchildren. There are people determined that this country's values, history, laws, traditions and role in the world are fundamentally wrong and must be changed. Such people will not stop dismantling America unless they get stopped—and the next election may be the last time to stop them, before they take the country beyond the point of no return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The men of Boston Fire are back and hotter than ever! Don’t miss this brand-new novel from New York Times bestselling author Shannon Stacey.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin Boudreau lives for the job, but he also believes in “work hard, play harder.” As the youngest guy in Ladder 37, he figures he’s got plenty of time before settling down becomes a priority. Soft, pretty women who aren’t looking for promises are exactly his type, and he’s comfortable with that. Working with a gorgeous EMT isn’t going to change who he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Cait Tasker needs in her personal life is a firefighter whose challenges on-scene have been a thorn in her side from minute one. Her plate’s too full for a man anyway. Back in her childhood home to help her family cope with an unexpected tragedy, she’s got enough to handle without throwing a hot, testosterone-laden fireman into the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long days on the job lead to long nights together, Gavin and Cait will discover how far temptation can take them—and what happens when the one you thought was all wrong for you turns out to be the person you can’t live without.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When Jamie Rutherford takes a temporary assignment as lieutenant of Boston Fire's Engine 59, she doesn't anticipate any problems. She's been in the fire service for a long time and, even though she's fairly new to Boston, she knows how to make any firehouse her home. What she's not prepared for is her reaction to firefighter Scott Kincaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is looking for a wife. It's been a fun ride as a single guy, but he's tired of being the third wheel, and nearly losing his brother-in-law finally made him realize just how much he wants a family of his own. When the new guy at the firehouse turns out to be a capable, confident and very attractive &lt;em&gt;woman&lt;/em&gt;, his plan is completely derailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hooking up with a fellow firefighter has never been part of Jamie's plan, but she's tempted by Scott—even though getting involved with him could tarnish the reputation she's worked so hard for. And Scott can't stop thinking about Jamie, despite the fact that she's his superior and not sticking around. Chemistry can crush the best-laid plans, though, and while Jamie and Scott might not be each other's future…there's no resisting the right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Rick Gullotti lives the good life. He fights fires, dates beautiful women—though none long enough so they cast wistful glances at jewelry stores—and has great friends. And thanks to helping out the elderly couple who own his building, his rent is low. But when concerns about their health lead him to contact their only son, his life starts getting away from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Broussard has no interest in leaving sunny San Diego or her cushy corner office for Boston, but her father—who happens to be her boss—dispatches her to deal with the grandparents she's never met. She's unprepared for the frigid winter, loving relatives who aren't the monsters she's been led to believe, and the hot, scruffy firefighter who lives upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Jessica is determined to get back to her comfortable life as quickly as possible. All she has to do is talk her grandparents into selling their monstrosity of a house and moving to a retirement community. But she underestimates Rick's dedication—and his considerable charm. Nobody's taking advantage of his friends on his watch, even if that makes the tempting southern California girl with the long legs his adversary. Unfortunately for them both, the only thing more urgent than the matter at hand is their sizzling chemistry, and it's quickly becoming too strong to resist.</description>

  <description>Lydia Kincaid's shipping back to Boston, but she's not happy about it. She left to get away from the firefighting community—her father was a firefighter, her brother's a firefighter and, more important, her ex is a firefighter. But family is number one, and her father needs her help running the pub he bought when he retired. Soon, Lydia finds it hard to resist the familiar comfort and routine, and even harder to resist her brother's handsome friend Aidan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aidan Hunt is a firefighter because of the Kincaid family. He's had the hots for Lydia for years, but if ever a woman was off-limits to him, it's her. Aside from being his mentor's daughter, she's his best friend's sister. The ex-wife of a fellow firefighter. But his plan to play it cool until she leaves town again fails, and soon he and Lydia have crossed a line they can't uncross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Aidan and Lydia's flirtation turns into something more serious, Lydia knows she should be planning her escape. Being a firefighter's wife was the hardest thing she's ever done, and she doesn't know if she has the strength to do it again. Aidan can't imagine walking away from Boston Fire—even for Lydia. The job and the brotherhood are his life; but if he wants Lydia in it, he'll have to decide who's first in his heart.</description>

  <description>This anthology explores disability in fictional tales told from the viewpoint of disabled characters, written by disabled creators. With stories in various genres about first loves, friendship, war, travel, and more, Unbroken will offer today's teen readers a glimpse into the lives of disabled people in the past, present, and future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contributing authors are awardwinners, bestsellers, and newcomers including Kody Keplinger, Kristine Wyllys, Francisco X. Stork, William Alexander, Corinne Duyvis, Marieke Nijkamp, Dhonielle Clayton, Heidi Heilig, Katherine Locke, Karuna Riazi, Kayla Whaley, Keah Brown, and Fox Benwell. Each author identifies as disabled along a physical, mental, or neurodiverse axis―and their characters reflect this diversity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet the tough, dedicated men of Boston Fire - and the women who turn their lives upside down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nursing a broken heart while everybody around him seems to be drowning in happiness has Grant Cutter wondering whether staying with Engine 59 - or even Boston Fire - is in his future. It's tempting as hell to pack up what fits in his Jeep and hit the road. But then a 911 call brings the woman who shattered his heart back into his life, and he knows he won't ever be able to fully leave her in his rearview mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few months, Wren Everett had thought the nightmare of her past was behind her and she might live happily ever after with Grant. Until she got the phone call letting her know the time her ex had spent in jail for assault hadn't cooled his temper or determination that she belonged with him. Cutting ties with Grant was the hardest thing she'd ever had to do, but it was also the only way to keep him safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Grant is back, he's not letting Wren push him away again. Even with the trust issues between them, Wren dares to hope she and Grant might have a future together after all...if they're willing to fight for it.</description>

  <description>When faced with the opportunity to change shifts while staying in the same house, veteran firefighter Derek Gilman jumps at the chance. His new schedule means not working Saturdays, which means more time to spend with his two kids. His divorce may have been amicable, but being a firefighter and a single dad is a lot to juggle. And when fate brings a gorgeous, wealthy woman into his life, he’s pretty sure he can’t handle more than he already is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia McGovern loves plans. She planned to start her own business and planned its growth. It’s earning her seven figures now, but her personal life simply doesn’t exist. Getting trapped in a broken elevator figures in exactly nowhere, and freaking out in front of a sexy firefighter definitely isn’t on the agenda. Especially not one with two kids and an ex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would have been a random incident with an attractive stranger becomes something more when a charity event brings them back together. They’re from different sides of the tracks, literally—with friends, family and careers to consider. But as Derek and Olivia are discovering, chemistry doesn’t allow for plans, and love doesn’t bother with logistics.</description>

  <description>Miss Kate Daltry doesn't believe in fairy tales . . . or happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced by her stepmother to attend a ball, Kate meets a prince... and decides he's anything but charming. A clash of wits and wills ensues, but they both know their irresistible attraction will lead nowhere. For Gabriel is promised to another woman—a princess whose hand in marriage will fulfill his ruthless ambitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel &lt;i&gt;likes&lt;/i&gt; his fiancee, which is a welcome turn of events, but he doesn't &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; her. Obviously, he should be &lt;i&gt;wooing&lt;/i&gt; his bride-to-be, not the witty, impoverished beauty who refuses to fawn over him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Godmothers and glass slippers notwithstanding, this is one fairy tale in which destiny conspires to destroy any chance that Kate and Gabriel might have a happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless a prince throws away everything that makes him noble... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless a dowry of an unruly heart trumps a fortune... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless one kiss at the stroke of midnight changes everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In this thrilling new Night Rebel series set in New York Times bestselling author Jeaniene Frost’s Night Huntress world, sexy and ruthless vampire Ian finally meets his match!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rule Breaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Master vampire Ian is unrepentant, shameless…and every shade of wicked. He’s made one too many enemies in his two centuries of existence, including Dagon, a demon who now lays claim to his soul. Ian’s only chance to escape Dagon is to join forces with a Law Guardian, but he’s never been able to abide by the rules for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Law Maker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veritas’ normal role is police, judge and jury to reprobates like Ian. But she has her own ax to grind with Dagon, so if she can use Ian as bait…well, all’s fair in law and war. As they scour supernatural hotspots to perfect their trap, Veritas soon realizes Ian’s devil-may-care, roguish image hides something much more powerful. And Ian discovers that Veritas has shocking secrets of her own. As they’re drawn to each other with a passion as intense as their peril, either love or justice will prevail. But each will have devastating consequences…</description>

  <description>Listening Length: 4 hours and 48 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procrastination...Envy...Anger...Self-pity...Compulsion....In any of its many forms, self-defeating behavior is the single most common reason that people seek psychotherapy. It is a poison that prevents people from achieving the love, success, and happiness they desire. &lt;i&gt;Get Out of Your Own Way&lt;/i&gt; is an antidote, explaining the reasons for self-sabotage by going back to the childhood origins of various behaviors. With anecdotes and usable insights drawn from twenty years of psychiatric clinical practice, Dr. Mark Goulston shares ideas that have helped thousands of patients overcome pain, fear, and confusion-to approach life's challenges with dignity, wisdom, courage, and even humor.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning conclusion to the sci-fi romance duology by writing duo Krista &amp;amp; Becca Ritchie, &lt;i&gt;The Last Hope&lt;/i&gt; is filled with twists and turns you'll never see coming.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sacrifice all you have to survive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for weeks on an enemy starcraft, Franny, Court, and Mykal have sat with an unfathomable revelation. But as they fight to stay alive, escaping prison means trusting a young mysterious stranger. He knows everything about their lost histories, and when answers aren’t given freely, the bonded trio are forced to join a mission. One that will determine the fate of humanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legend says, a baby—the first of her species—has the power to cloak and teleport planets. Tasked with retrieving the infant, Court fears the baby is just a myth, and if they fail, they’ll never find the truth about their origins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Court and Mykal grow closer, their linked bond becomes harder to hide, and dynamics change when Franny begins to fall for someone new. Vulnerable and with no choice, the hunt for the baby sends the trio on a dangerous path to Saltare-1: a water world where their enemies can’t die and survival comes at a high cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the explosive finale to&lt;/i&gt; New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author Jeaniene Frost’s Night Prince series, Vlad is in danger of losing his bride to an enemy whose powers might prove greater than the Prince of Vampire’s…. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the wrong hands, love can be a deadly weapon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly six hundred years, Vlad Tepesh cared for nothing, so he had nothing to lose. His brutal reputation ensured that all but the most foolhardy stayed away. Now falling in love with Leila has put him at the mercy of his passions. And one adversary has found a devastating way to use Vlad’s new bride against him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful spell links Leila to the necromancer Mircea. If he suffers or dies, so does she. Magic is forbidden to vampires, so Vlad and Leila enlist an unlikely guide as they search for a way to break the spell. But an ancient enemy lies in wait, capable of turning Vlad and Leila’s closest friends against them…and finally tearing the lovers apart forever.</description>

  <description>Nearly everyone swears - whether it's over a few too many drinks, in reaction to a stubbed toe, or in flagrante delicto. And yet, we sit idly by as words are banned from television and censored in books. We insist that people excise profanity from their vocabularies, and we punish children for yelling the very same dirty words that we'll mutter in relief seconds after they fall asleep. Swearing, it seems, is an intimate part of us that we have decided to selectively deny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's a damn shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swearing is useful. It can be funny, cathartic, or emotionally arousing. As linguist and cognitive scientist Benjamin K. Bergen shows us, it also opens a new window onto how our brains process language and why languages vary around the world and over time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this groundbreaking yet ebullient romp through the linguistic muck, Bergen answers intriguing questions: How can patients left otherwise speechless after a stroke still shout "Goddamn!" when they get upset? When did a cock grow to be more than merely a rooster? Why is crap vulgar when poo is just childish? Do slurs make you treat people differently? Why is the first word that Samoan children say not mommy but eat shit? And why do we extend a middle finger to flip someone the bird? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart as hell and funny as f--k, What the F is mandatory listening for anyone who wants to know how and why we swear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2016 Benjamin K. Bergen (P)2016 Gildan Media LLC</description>

  <description>Brilliantly hot Matt Cannon doesn't mind his "boy wonder" nickname. At twenty-eight, he may be the youngest--and richest--broker at his firm, but the constant string of women in his bed know he's all man. When Matt's boss insists he clean up his image to land a potential investor, Matt knows just the woman to pose as his girlfriend.Sabrina Cross is Wall Street's go-to "fixer"--a chameleon of a woman who can be anything, to any man, for any reason, with just one rule: no touching. Matt and Sabrina have always been like oil and water, but their new arrangement lights a match to the animosity and leads to something altogether hotter.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks fly when the hot-shot divorce lawyer meets the high-powered wedding planner. The only question is, what kind?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you ever get married, remember my name: Max Henderson. In my line of work, you acquire a certain perspective on supposedly everlasting unions. . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Pre-nups are your friend. &lt;br /&gt;2. The person you married is not the person you’re divorcing. &lt;br /&gt;3. And I hope you didn’t spend much on the wedding because that was one helluva waste of hard-earned cash, wasn’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But some guys are willing to take a chance. Like my brother, who thinks he’s going to ride off into the sunset with the woman of his dreams in a haze of glitter on unicorns. And the wedding planner—the green-eyed beauty who makes a living convincing suckers to shell out thousands of dollars on centerpieces—is raking it in on this matrimonial monstrosity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing is, Charlie Love is not &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;like me. We’re both cogs in the wedding-industrial complex. As the best man, I know her game—and I can play it better than her. But after one scorching, unexpected kiss, I’m thinking I might just want to get played.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s playing hurt. She’s laying low. And they’re both flirting with disaster.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chase:&lt;/i&gt; The last thing I’d ever want to do is let my team down. After overcoming my bad-boy reputation, I was dominating on the ice. But things aren’t going so well this season, and even my parents think I’m partying again. Now I’m really worried about my career. The only bright spot in my life is the Twitter flirtation I’ve struck up with pop princess Jordyn Banks. Turns out she’s a huge hockey fan—and she’s willing to wager a date on her favorite team. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jordyn:&lt;/i&gt; Even though I’m an L.A. fan now, I’ve always had a soft spot for the Aces, since I grew up in Chicago. Then I lose a bet to Chase Hartman, and suddenly I’m up close and personal with a pro athlete who’s anything but soft. Not only is Chase the hottest guy I’ve ever met, he’s secretly super sweet. As if I had time for a relationship . . . yeah, right. But when I suddenly have nothing but time on my hands, he’s the only one who understands. Now, with both of our careers at stake, Chase is tempting me to put my heart on the line too.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the irreverent star of Fox News’s &lt;i&gt;Red Eye &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Five&lt;/i&gt;, hilarious observations on the manufactured outrage of an oversensitive, wussified culture.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg Gutfeld hates artificial tolerance. At the root of every single major political conflict is the annoying coddling Americans must endure of these harebrained liberal hypocrisies. In fact, most of the time liberals uses the mantle of tolerance as a guise for their pathetic intolerance. And what we really need is smart intolerance, or as Gutfeld reminds us, what we used to call common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Joy of Hate&lt;/i&gt; tackles this conundrum head on--replacing the idiocy of open-mindness with a shrewd judgmentalism that rejects stupid ideas, notions, and people. With countless examples grabbed from the headlines, Gutfeld provides readers with the enormous tally of what pisses us all off. For example:&lt;br /&gt;- The double standard: You can make fun of Christians, but God forbid Muslims. It's okay to call a woman any name imaginable, as long as she's a Republican. And no problem if you're a bigot, as long as you're politically correct about it. &lt;br /&gt;- The demonizing of the Tea Party and romanticizing of the Occupy Wall Streeters. &lt;br /&gt;- The media who are always offended (see MSNBC lineup)&lt;br /&gt;- How critics of Obamacare or illegal immigration are somehow immediately labeled racists. &lt;br /&gt;- The endless debate over the Ground Zero Mosque (which Gutfeld planned to open a Muslim gay bar next to). &lt;br /&gt;- As well as pretentious music criticism, slow-moving ceiling fans, and snotty restaurant hostesses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny and sarcastic to the point of being mean (but in a nice way), &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Hate&lt;/i&gt; points out the true jerks in this society and tells them all off.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;London, 1887&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After burying her spinster aunt, orphaned Veronica Speedwell is free to resume her world travels in pursuit of scientific inquiry—and the occasional romantic dalliance. As familiar with hunting butterflies as with fending off admirers, Veronica intends to embark upon the journey of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fate has other plans when Veronica thwarts her own attempted abduction with the help of an enigmatic German baron, who offers her sanctuary in the care of his friend Stoker, a reclusive and bad-tempered natural historian. But before the baron can reveal what he knows of the plot against her, he is found murdered—leaving Veronica and Stoker on the run from an elusive assailant as wary partners in search of the villainous truth.</description>

  <description>Petty Officer Bacon, a navy SEAL and ace sharpshooter, has been on the front lines of more than his fair share of dangerous ops. Yet when a minor injury relegates him to the beta team, he’s tasked with what may be his riskiest assignment yet: the silver fox journalist he’s babysitting is the hottest, most charismatic man he’s ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning journalist Spencer Bryant may have been named one of Pride magazine’s most eligible bachelors of the year, but he’s not looking to change his relationship status. He’s a consummate professional who won’t risk his ethics or impeccable reputation by getting involved with a source. Even a sexy-as-hell military man. But while Spencer can resist his physical attraction to Bacon, he has less control over his emotions—especially when the mission goes sideways and the two men are trapped alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting out of the jungle alive turns out to be easy compared to facing the truth about their feelings for one another back in the real world. And whether or not they can build a future is a different story altogether.</description>

  <description>Thoughtful, inspiring and often surprising, AND THE GOOD NEWS IS... traces Dana's unlikely journey through politics, the White House, and television. She has an uncanny ability for knowing what to say and how best to say it. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS... blends a candid self-portrait with advice for allowing your own grace, optimism, smarts and personality to shine through, emphasizing that dignity and civility are choices that only we can make for ourselves. A recurring theme in AND THE GOOD NEWS IS...is that planning has never worked for Dana; every time she has made a plan, something unexpected-and often better-has happened.</description>

  <description>Annabelle Castle is a rebel without a cause…until her stepsister, the head of the glamorous Castle Department store, offers her the chance of a lifetime. Too bad the opportunity to finally play a role in the Castle’s future comes with strings attached—the man who gets under her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former cop Johnny Darrow is head of security for the Texas-based Castles. He excels at his job and nothing gets to him…except Annabelle. Even as he dragged Annabelle out of many public relations disasters with the paparazzi, he knew there was so much more to her than the headline-grabbing, rich girl. Now that she’s matured and determined to turn over a new leaf, he finds her irresistible. She’s smart, creative, and makes him feel things he hasn’t after a personal tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Johnny’s assigned a job as Annabelle’s bodyguard, he must push his feelings aside. Can Johnny keep his focus to protect Annabelle or will his feelings for her put everything at risk?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Featuring New York Times bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries’ “hallmark humor, poignancy, and sensuality” (Romantic Times), this entry in the Sinful Suitors series inspires you to risk all for love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Anne is shocked when Captain Lord Hartley Corry—her former fiancé who left for India after her father forbade their marriage—returns to England and acts as if everything is all water under the bridge. He never fought for her hand or eloped with her as he promised and he thinks she’d still be willing to marry him? Not a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hartley is equally shocked to literally run into his past love upon arriving at his brother’s house. Though he yearns to take advantage of this second chance to woo his beloved, he can hardly admit that he is secretly a spy—at least not until he can be sure he trusts her. But convincing Lady Anne to let him prove his sincerity by courting her respectably all over again might be his undoing. Because all he wants is to show her how much of a rogue he can be when the right woman is in his arms…</description>

  <description>Everyone says opposites attract. And they must be right, because there’s no logical reason why I’m so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don’t usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I’m flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn’t help that he’s buddy-buddy with my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that his best friend has a crush on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that I just moved in with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I not mention we’re roommates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it doesn’t matter. Fitzy has made it clear he’s not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I’m not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I’m not about to start. I’ve got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he’s missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>A young adult fiction anthology of 15 stories featuring contemporary, historical, and futuristic stories featuring witchy heroines who are diverse in race, class, sexuality, religion, geography, and era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you a good witch or a bad witch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glinda the Good Witch. Elphaba the Wicked Witch. Willow. Sabrina. Gemma Doyle. The Mayfair Witches. Ursula the Sea Witch. Morgan le Fey. The three weird sisters from &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History tells us women accused of witchcraft were often outsiders: educated, independent, unmarried, unwilling to fall in line with traditional societal expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold. Powerful. Rebellious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bruja’s traditional love spell has unexpected results. A witch’s healing hands begin to take life instead of giving it when she ignores her attraction to a fellow witch. In a terrifying future, women are captured by a cabal of men crying witchcraft and the one true witch among them must fight to free them all. In a desolate past, three orphaned sisters prophesize for a murderous king. Somewhere in the present, a teen girl just wants to kiss a boy without causing a hurricane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From good witches to bad witches, to witches who are a bit of both, this is an anthology of diverse witchy tales from a collection of diverse, feminist authors. The collective strength of women working together—magically or mundanely--has long frightened society, to the point that women’s rights are challenged, legislated against, and denied all over the world. &lt;i&gt;Toil &amp;amp; Trouble&lt;/i&gt; delves deep into the truly diverse mythology of witchcraft from many cultures and feminist points of view, to create modern and unique tales of witchery that have yet to be explored.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;USA TODAY &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author LuAnn McLane’s sweet, sexy, and charming Heartthrob series comes to an end as the jokester of the Heart brothers gets serious when his dance skills are challenged by a sexy tango instructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meet the Heart Brothers: formerly the members of the cult-phenomenon boy band Heartbeat, now they're all grown up and back together for one last reunion tour. Trends may come and go, but a group of sexy brothers with a penchant for song and dance never goes out of style...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Heart is usually the life of the party, especially on the dance floor. So when he offers to be dancer Ava Mayor’s partner in a local fundraising competition for the Sea Breeze Performing Arts Center, he thinks it’s going to be a cakewalk. But hip-hop doesn’t exactly translate to tango—Ava’s area of expertise—and Jesse has trouble taking ballroom seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Jesse’s comedic antics get under Ava’s skin, the more time they spend together in rehearsal, the more they come to realize that they’re not so different after all. And with Ava’s passion for technicality and Jesse’s raw talent, it doesn’t take long for this couple to start dancing their way into each other’s arms... and hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Step Up&lt;/i&gt;, Backstreet Boys, and New Kids on the Block, this fun and sexy finale to the Heartthrob series will have you pulling your old boy band shirts out of your closet and dancing all night long.r.</description>

  <description>A deliciously creepy horror novel with a story line inspired by the Ripper murders and an unexpected, blood-chilling conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Audrey Rose Wadsworth was born a lord's daughter, with a life of wealth and privilege stretched out before her. But between the social teas and silk dress fittings, she leads a forbidden secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her stern father's wishes and society's expectations, Audrey often slips away to her uncle's laboratory to study the gruesome practice of forensic medicine. When her work on a string of savagely killed corpses drags Audrey into the investigation of a serial murderer, her search for answers brings her close to her own sheltered world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story's shocking twists and turns, augmented with real, sinister period photos, will make this debut from author Kerri Maniscalco impossible to forget.</description>

Except . . . she wasn't. The beautiful woman on his doorstep was anything but quiet, and when she stopped talking long enough to close her mouth, all he wanted to do was kiss her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eloise Bridgerton couldn't marry a man she had never met! But then she started thinking... and wondering... and before she knew it, she was in a hired carriage in the middle of the night, on her way to meet the man she hoped might be her perfect match. Except... he wasn't. Her perfect husband wouldn't be so moody and ill-mannered. And he certainly should have mentioned that he had two young - and decidedly unruly - children, as much in need of a mother as Phillip is in need of a wife.</description>

  <description>**NEW YORK TIMES &amp;amp; USATODAY Bestselling Series**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s optimistic. And there’s Jesse Walker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he wasn’t so charming, his sunny disposition and incessant grin would get old. Fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with the broken girl who had at first seemed immune to anything resembling love was the best thing to happen to Jesse since the Walkers adopted him when he was five. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jesse’s life continues at the ranch and Rowen begins making her mark in the Seattle art community, they wonder where the middle ground is. Or if there even is one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As push comes to shove, they’re forced to make choices neither are eager to make, and Jesse and Rowen have to face what their lives might look like without the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can two people with such tragic pasts and different presents expect a promising future together? Whatever the answer, they’ll need a lot more than love to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Recommended for mature readers due to moderate content and language.*</description>

  <description>It’s not every day that a beautiful naked woman falls out of the sky and lands face-first on grizzly shifter Berg Dunn’s hotel balcony. Definitely they don’t usually hop up and demand his best gun. Berg gives the lady a grizzly-sized t-shirt and his cell phone, too, just on style points. And then she’s gone, taking his XXXL heart with her. By the time he figures out she’s a honey badger shifter, it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Honey badgers are survivors. Brutal, vicious, ill-tempered survivors. Or maybe Charlie Taylor-MacKilligan is just pissed that her useless father is trying to get them all killed again, and won’t even tell her how. Protecting her little sisters has always been her job, and she’s not about to let some pesky giant grizzly protection specialist with a network of every shifter in Manhattan get in her way. Wait. He’s trying to help? Why would he want to do that? He’s cute enough that she just might let him tag along—that is, if he can keep up . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes you fall for Mr. Right. And sometimes for Mr. Right Now… &lt;br /&gt;May&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did you hear the one about the girl who walks into a bar and catches her live-in lover kissing someone else? No? You’re the only one in town who missed it. &lt;br /&gt;Luckily Alec is there to wrap me up in strong arms and carry me out the door before things get too ugly. And that’s not all Alec is good at. Our unexpected chemistry makes him the perfect rebound guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alec&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should know better than to hook up with my rival’s little sister, but the fiery look in May’s eyes really turns my crank. She needs cheering up, and I’m just the guy for the job. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not like I’ll fall in love. Not even after a string of scorching hot trysts, and the realization that we’re good at the same things: wild nights and familial disappointment. I don’t do love, never have, never will. So this is the perfect arrangement, for both of us. &lt;br /&gt;Nobody would approve, but nobody has to know…</description>

  <description>In a world of glamour, lies, and betrayal threatens to tear them apart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mable’s life as a model may be over after her agent drops her, but a chance encounter with a fashion photographer, Simon Rowe, revives her dream—and awakens desires she never imagined. Mable soon discovers there’s more to this sexy motorcyclist from down under. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her relationship with Simon flourishes so does her modeling career. Suddenly, Mable struggles to find a balance in her life in a world that keeps on trying to tear her down, forcing her to choose between the life of fame she always wanted and the man that, until now, she never knew she needed. In a world that’s a stage, can their love thrive under the lights?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyrical Lights is a charming, modern love story full of free-spirited characters and a story that’ll hook you from the very first page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How many coupons does it take to fall in love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flick Dalgetty knows what she wants and how to get it, which is why she’s about to start her dream job in Washington. Until then, she needs somewhere to crash, and Tom O’Connell’s place is her sole option. He’s a repressed, antisocial ogre…but man can he kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Tom, being around Flick is like being too close to the sun. Her untamed energy is overwhelming, and he’d spontaneously combust if he had to live with her long-term. Housemates with benefits—and an expiration date—suits him just fine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Flick gives Tom thirty coupons, each entitling him to one obligation-free activity, from bowling and bubble-bathing to morning delight, removing all the guesswork from being incompatible partners and shifting their fling into high gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the problem is their arrangement is drawing to a close, and they might be falling in love—and there wasn’t a coupon for that.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Most days Rebecca Lindt feels like an imposter...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world admires her as a survivor. But that impression would crumble if people knew her secret. She didn't deserve to be the one who got away. But nothing can change the past, so she's thrown herself into her work. She can't dwell if she never slows down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wes Garrett is trying to get back on his feet after losing his dream restaurant, his money, and half his damn mind in a vicious divorce. But when he intervenes in a mugging and saves Rebecca―the attorney who helped his ex ruin him―his simple life gets complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their attraction is inconvenient and neither wants more than a fling. But when Rebecca's secret is put at risk, both discover they could lose everything, including what they never realized they needed: each other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She laughed and kissed him. This morning she'd melted down. But somehow this man had her laughing and turned on only a few hours later. Everything inside her felt buoyed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She felt...light.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She'd forgotten what that felt like.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Liv's words cut off as Finn got closer. The man approaching was nothing like the boy she'd known. The bulky football muscles had streamlined into a harder, leaner package and the look in his deep green eyes held no trace of boyish innocence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been twelve years since tragedy struck the senior class of Long Acre High School. Only a few students survived that fateful night—a group the media dubbed The Ones Who Got Away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liv Arias thought she'd never return to Long Acre—until a documentary brings her and the other survivors back home. Suddenly her old flame, Finn Dorsey, is closer than ever, and their attraction is still white-hot. When a searing kiss reignites their passion, Liv realizes this rough-around-the-edges cop might be exactly what she needs...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Their love is forbidden, but their hearts aren't listening to rules and regulations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Dustin Strauss is a reformed man. No longer a twentysomething hell-raiser, he's his SEAL team's new XO-and a man with a secret. Or seven. He's kept his bisexual identity under wraps for years, along with his kinky side and a fondness for the military-themed semianonymous hookup website Joe4Joe. His latest chat buddy is more than a sexy online distraction-they're taking their very not-safe-for-work relationship into real time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petty Officer Wes Lowe has a smart mouth, a take-charge attitude and an uncanny ability for making things go boom. The life of an enlisted man isn't always enough to satisfy him, but one wild, no-questions-asked weekend with his online love comes close. When a transfer order comes in, Wes feels ready and centered. He'll make a good impression on his new SEAL team and keep his growing feelings for Dustin on the down low. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as they log more time online and some very real emotions surface, Dustin and Wes struggle to pretend they're just a harmless fling. And when his commander introduces Dustin to his team's newest member, they're in for the shock of a lifetime…and a crushing disappointment: their difference in ranks means even a friendship without &lt;i&gt;sexual&lt;/i&gt; contact could end their navy careers for good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their hearts on the line, Dustin and Wes may not survive their next mission, let alone find a way toward a future together.</description>

  <description>After trading the barracks for a fixer-upper rental, navy SEAL Zack Nelson wants peace, not a roommate—especially not Pike, who sees things about Zack he most wants to hide. Pike's flirting puts virgin Zack on edge. And the questions Pike's arrival would spark from Zack's teammates about his own sexuality? Nope. Not going there. But Zack can't refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pike Reynolds knows there won't be a warm welcome in his new home. What can he say? He's an acquired taste. But he needs this chance to get his life together. Also, teasing the uptight SEAL will be hella fun. Still, Pike has to tread carefully; he's had his fill of tourists in the past, and he can't risk his heart on another, not even one as hot, as built—and, okay, yeah, as adorable—as Zack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living with Pike crumbles Zack's restraint and fuels his curiosity. He discovers how well they fit together in bed…in the shower…in the hallway… He needs Pike more than he could have imagined, yet he doesn't know how to be the man Pike deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Approximate word count: 73,000&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A serialized story from Sarina Bowen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 1016 people in the freshman class at Harkness College. I can’t be the only socially awkward nerd girl virgin among them. Right?&lt;br /&gt;It’s time I learn to talk to guys without blushing and stammering. So I take a confidence-building job at the student tutoring center. Twelve bucks an hour, plus human interaction. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;A fun-loving French Canadian hockey hunk, that’s what.&lt;br /&gt;When Pepe Gerault sits down at my tutoring table, my brain shuts off and my mouth goes right into hyperdrive. Even the sound of my name on his lips—Josephine—gives me a mini orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;I want to hand him my V-card. But all I manage to hand him is…my thesaurus. And my dignity. All seems lost, until I hatch a plan to get him alone…&lt;br /&gt;Get it only in Sarina's newsletter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: If you sign up after the serialization has already begun, your first email will contain links to all the existing chapters. You won't miss a thing!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Winter King&lt;/i&gt; comes a breathtaking new tale of love and adventure set in the mystical land of Mystral...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He wasn't supposed to choose her...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seafaring prince Dilys Merimydion has been invited to court the three magical princesses of Summerlea. To eradicate the pirates threatening Calberna and to secure the power of the Sea Throne, Dilys vows to return home with a fierce warrior-queen as his bride. But politics has nothing to do with unexpected temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She didn't dare wed him...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A weathermage like her sisters, Gabriella Coruscate's gentleness exemplifies the qualities of her season name, Summer. Yet her quiet poise conceals dangerous powers she cannot begin to wield. Better to live without excitement, she reasons, than risk her heart and lose control— until an irresistible Sealord jolts her awake with a thunderclap of raw desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Until evil threatens everything they hold dear...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When pirates kidnap Summer and her sisters, Dilys is in a desperate quest to save the woman he loves. Only by combining his command of the seas with the unleashed fury of Summer's formidable gifts can they defeat their brutal enemies and claim the most priceless victory of all: true love.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had never read a fantasy romance so this was different for me. The mechanics of the world confused me the whole time-maybe if I read the first book it would be easier to understand. This also made some solutions to conflicts feel a little to easy. It was like "my magic can do anything even thou...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How to protect your heart: &lt;br /&gt;Let your bodyguard have it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Cobalt is an American princess. The loyal and painfully curious twenty-three-year-old has inherited immense pressure to preserve the Cobalt legacy. But for Jane — sex, love, and life have been a series of royal failures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a friends-with-benefits ended in disaster, she's sworn to a “no sex” hiatus for, well, eternity — and she has no intention of letting anyone in her bed and definitely not her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight-year-old Thatcher Moretti is painfully professional. As the stern 24/7 bodyguard to Jane, thinking about unbridled sex with his sweet client is a sin. One that he keeps committing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real act is a hard line he’d never cross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a family member betrays Jane's trust, the media becomes obsessed with matchmaking the perpetually “single” Jane Cobalt and unwanted attention suddenly compromises her safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thatcher would do anything to protect her, and one solution may level the threats: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become the fake boyfriend to an American princess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwined together with boiling chemistry, new “professional” parameters, and an oath, unsaid feelings threaten to rise and change everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;​​The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Like Us Series Reading Order:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Damaged Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow)&lt;br /&gt;2. Lovers Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow)&lt;br /&gt;3. Alphas Like Us (Maximoff &amp;amp; Farrow)&lt;br /&gt;4.

  <description>In a freezing world, where everyone knows the day they will die, three teens break all odds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Franny Bluecastle, a tough city teen, dreams of dying in opulence, to see wealth she’s never known. Like the entire world, she believes it’s impossible to dodge a deathday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day she does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Court Icecastle knows wealth. He also knows pain. Spending five years in Vorkter Prison, a fortress of ice and suffering, he dreams of life beyond the people that haunt him and the world that imprisoned him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mykal Kickfall fights for those he loves. The rugged Hinterlander shares a frustrating yet unbreakable connection with Court—which only grows more lawless and chaotic as their senses and emotions connect with Franny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the threat of people learning they’ve dodged their deathdays, they must flee their planet to survive. But to do so, all three will have to hide their shared bond as they vie for a highly sought after spot in the newest mission to space. Against thousands of people far smarter, who’ll live longer, and never fear death the way that they do.</description>

  <description>Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mark her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana won't approve of her feelings for her childhood friend--the handsome palace guard, Jacin. But Winter isn't as weak as Levana believes her to be and she's been undermining her stepmother's wishes for years. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that's been raging for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter defeat Levana and find their happily ever afters? Fans will not want to miss this thrilling conclusion to Marissa Meyer's national bestselling Lunar Chronicles series.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;History is on repeat…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seth never thought he’d have a future. But now he’s on the brink of having it all with Josie: A tomorrow. A family. A forever. And all that's standing between him and that forever is the Titans. If he helps Josie entomb them -- without killing them, a nearly impossible task for him -- everything he could ever want will be in reach. But he soon realizes that as a god, every little choice he makes can reshape the world for the better… or worse. And in meddling with the Titans, Seth may have just set into motion catastrophic consequences that will force the Olympians to enter the mortal realm and reshape the delicate balance of power that keeps the world from total collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A price must be paid…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entombing the Titans is Josie’s top priority. After all, it was what she was born to do. But the plans her father put into play to help her are no longer an option, and the odds she and Seth face in forging their own path are grim. The escalating violence between halfs and pures only increases the danger closing in on them and their friends. Josie knows their chances of succeeding in their task are slim at best -- and if they fail, they might lose everything. But she also knows she's not fighting just for herself -- she's fighting for the man she loves, for their future, for the world. Together with the Army of Awesome, Josie and Seth will face the unthinkable. And to win this war, the ultimate sacrifice must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For the end is here and the Prophecy will be fulfilled….&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A bloody path has been chosen… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war against the Titans continues, and they remain determined to wreak havoc on the world, but Seth has become something all gods fear. Now the most dangerous, most absolute power no longer resides in those who have been freed from their tombs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great War fought by the few is coming… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All may doubt and fear what Seth has become. All except the one woman who might be his final chance at redemption. Josie will do anything to prove that Seth is on their side, but fate has a nasty way of changing lives, of changing people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the sun will fall… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way they can save the future and save themselves is by facing the unknown together. It will take more than trust and faith. It will take love and the kind of strength not easily broken. No matter what, their lives will never be the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what the gods have feared has come to pass. The end of the old is here and the beginning of the new has been ushered in…</description>

  <description>Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.</description>

  <description>Edward (long live the king) is the King of England. He’s also dying, which is inconvenient, as he’s only sixteen and he’d much rather be planning for his first kiss than considering who will inherit his crown…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane (reads too many books) is Edward’s cousin, and far more interested in books than romance. Unfortunately for Jane, Edward has arranged to marry her off to secure the line of succession. And there’s something a little odd about her intended…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gifford (call him G) is a horse. That is, he’s an &lt;i&gt;Eðian&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;eth-y-un&lt;/i&gt;, for the uninitiated). Every day at dawn he becomes a noble chestnut steed—but then he wakes at dusk with a mouthful of hay. It’s all very undignified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot thickens as Edward, Jane, and G are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy. With the fate of the kingdom at stake, our heroes will have to engage in some conspiring of their own. But can they pull off their plan before it’s off with their heads?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/i&gt;Notable Book of 2017&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the great historian of the American Revolution, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling and Pulitzer-winning Gordon Wood, comes a majestic dual biography of two of America's most enduringly fascinating figures, whose partnership helped birth a nation, and whose subsequent falling out did much to fix its course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Jefferson and John Adams could scarcely have come from more different worlds, or been more different in temperament. Jefferson, the optimist with enough faith in the innate goodness of his fellow man to be democracy's champion, was an aristocratic Southern slaveowner, while Adams, the overachiever from New England's rising middling classes, painfully aware he was no aristocrat, was a skeptic about popular rule and a defender of a more elitist view of government. They worked closely in the crucible of revolution, crafting the Declaration of Independence and leading, with Franklin, the diplomatic effort that brought France into the fight. But ultimately, their profound differences would lead to a fundamental crisis, in their friendship and in the nation writ large, as they became the figureheads of two entirely new forces, the first American political parties. It was a bitter breach, lasting through the presidential administrations of both men, and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But late in life, something remarkable happened: these two men were nudged into reconciliation. What started as a grudging trickle of correspondence became a great flood, and a friendship was rekindled, over the course of hundreds of letters. In their final years they were the last surviving founding fathers and cherished their role in this mighty young republic as it approached the half century mark in 1826. At last, on the afternoon of July 4th, 50 years to the day after the signing of the Declaration, Adams let out a sigh and said, "At least Jefferson still lives." He died soon thereafter. In fact, a few hours earlier on that same day, far to the south in his home in Monticello, Jefferson died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably no relationship in this country's history carries as much freight as that of John Adams of Massachusetts and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. Gordon Wood has more than done justice to these entwined lives and their meaning; he has written a magnificent new addition to America's collective story.</description>

  <description>“Highly recommended reading for those hungry for surprise” (A.J. Jacobs, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author)—a rollicking collection of personal stories and essays on relationships, technology, and contemporary society from the news editor at &lt;i&gt;Funny or Die&lt;/i&gt; and former artistic director at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hilarious collection of essays spans a wide variety of topics. There’s the open letter to Charles Manson, a brave archeologist’s journey into a suburban man cave, and a long overdue, sternly worded letter from Leif Erikson to Christopher Columbus. Walt Whitman even teaches a spin class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nate Dern’s razor-sharp eye examines modern society and technology, man buns, dating apps, and juicing crazes. Anyone who’s ever scrunched their eyes at WiFi Terms &amp;amp; Conditions, listened to the reasons that led a vegetarian to give up meat, or looked on in horror at the evolving audacity of reality TV will appreciate Dern’s wicked and funny take on modern life. &lt;i&gt;Not Quite a Genius&lt;/i&gt; is fun, and funny, “a breath of fresh air that you can eat up bit by bit or all at once” (Abbi Jacobson, cocreator and star of &lt;i&gt;Broad City&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>Mackenzie "Mac" Nighthorse is a highly respected homicide detective and a career cop. There isn't a dangerous situation that can back him down. However, the personal becomes uncomfortably entangled in the professional when he goes undercover in a high class BDSM club as a male submissive to find a Dominatrix who is winning the trust and then murdering her chosen partners. When his path crosses Violet Siemanski's, he realizes he's found a Mistress willing to be his ally in finding the murderess. But Violet is also going to shatter Mac's shields and make him question who he is and what he wants, a challenge more disturbing than any case he's ever worked.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The child he didn't know he had . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Yates has come to a decision: it's time to stop sowing those oats and start a family. But searching for a bride isn't as simple as he'd hoped, and many of the respectable women of his acquaintance feel . . . lacking. Then beautiful, feisty Wilhelmina "Billie" Wells arrives at the family ranch with a toddler in her arms, claiming Drew is the father!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The woman he didn't know he loved . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billie had no choice but to show up at Destiny in search of Drew. For the sake of their child, she's willing to leave him with his father so the boy can have a better life, but then, before she can blink, she's saying "I do" in front of a preacher in a marriage of convenience. All Billie and Drew have in common is the heat that brought them together, but can their sizzling passion lead to an everlasting love?</description>

  <description>She's young, sassy, and heartbreakingly innocent. And her sensational career is headed for the stratosphere with a million-dollar movie deal and an explosive encounter with the man every woman in America wants. But long-hidden secrets surface with her waking passions, forcing her to flee her lover, her family—even her own fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a cloistered convent childhood in France to New York, from Hollywood to Paris and on through the squalid back streets of Europe, Fleur Savagar will set out in search of the woman she's yet to be... a woman willing to risk and dare… willing to face deception and betrayal... willing to learn the grown-up rules of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the poignant and ultimately triumphant story of a young woman determined to make her own way in a world glittering with money, ambition, and revenge.</description>

  <description>What happens when the kink between the pages leads to heat between the sheets?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Blake Crawford wants is to pass his creative writing course, get his university degree, and take over his dad’s ailing family business. What Amanda Newland wants is to graduate at the top of her class, as well as finally finish her novel and prove to her family that writing is a respectful career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Blake and Amanda don’t want is to be paired up with each other for their final project, but that’s exactly what they both get when they’re forced to collaborate on a writing piece. Since Amanda thinks Blake is a pushy asshole (with a panty-melting smirk and British accent) and Blake thinks Amanda has a stick up her ass (though it’s a brilliant ass), they fight tooth and nail until they discover they write well together. They also may find each other really attractive, but that’s neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their writing project turns out to be a success, the two of them decide to start up a secret partnership using a pen name, infiltrating the self-publishing market in the lucrative genre of erotica. Naturally, with so much heat and passion between the pages, it’s not long before their dirty words become a dirty reality. Sure, they still fight a lot, but at least there’s make-up sex now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even as they start to fall hard for each other, will their burgeoning relationship survive if their scandalous secret is exposed? Or are happily-ever-afters just a work of fiction?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy new standalone from USA Today bestseller Sarina Bowen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d think a billion dollars, a professional hockey team and a six-bedroom mansion on the Promenade would satisfy a guy. You’d be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seven years Rebecca has brightened my office with her wit and her smile. She manages both my hockey team and my sanity. I don’t know when I started waking in the night, craving her. All I know is that one whiff of her perfume ruins my concentration. And her laugh makes me hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rebecca gets hurt, I step in to help. It’s what friends do. But what friends don’t do is rip off each others’ clothes for a single, wild night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s avoiding me. She says we’re too different, and it can never happen again. So why can’t we keep our hands off each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>Twenty years ago, while riding in the back of a New York City taxicab, syndicated columnist and business consultant David J. Pollay had an awakening-and he converted the lesson he learned that day into a life philosophy: By letting other people's “garbage”-their negativity-simply “pass by,” and not dumping garbage on others, you can become happier and more successful, both personally and professionally. Since David published the “Law“ in his newspaper column three years ago, more than 1,000 blogs have posted it, millions more have read it, and organizations worldwide have adopted it. And the numbers keep growing. Translated into nearly 50 languages, people from more than 100 countries have taken David's “No Garbage Trucks! Pledge.” All over the world people remember the focusing metaphor of the garbage truck for what can be achieved in life by not staking success and happiness on the behavior of others. Powerful and easily understood, &lt;i&gt;The Law of the Garbage Truck&lt;/i&gt; will guide and inspire readers everywhere, every day.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The princess is dead. Long live the princess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries ago, the royal family of Adria was killed…or so everyone thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Grace Blakely knows the truth: There was one survivor, and that survivor’s blood runs through her veins. This simple fact could cause a revolution—which is why some people will stop at nothing to keep it from coming to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one way for Grace to save herself, save her family, and save the boy she loves. She must outmaneuver her foes, cut through the web of lies that has surrounded her for years, and go back to the source of all her troubles, despite the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she wins, she will inherit a throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if she loses, she will inherit the fate of all the dead princesses who came before her.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;One Dance with a Duke&lt;/i&gt;--the first novel in Tessa Dare's delightful new trilogy--secrets and scandals tempt the irresistible rogues of the Stud Club to gamble everything for love. &lt;br /&gt;A handsome and reclusive horse breeder, Spencer Dumarque, the fourth Duke of Morland, is a member of the exclusive Stud Club, an organization so select it has only ten members--yet membership is attainable to anyone with luck. And Spencer has plenty of it, along with an obsession with a prize horse, a dark secret, and, now, a reputation as the dashing "Duke of Midnight." Each evening he selects one lady for a breathtaking midnight waltz. But none of the women catch his interest, and nobody ever bests the duke--until Lady Amelia d'Orsay tries her luck. &lt;br /&gt;In a moment of desperation, the unconventional beauty claims the duke's dance and unwittingly steals his heart. When Amelia demands that Spencer forgive her scapegrace brother's debts, she never imagines that her game of wits and words will lead to breathless passion and a steamy proposal. Still, Spencer is a man of mystery, perhaps connected to the shocking murder of the Stud Club's founder. Will Amelia lose her heart in this reckless wager or win everlasting love?</description>

  <description>Guy Burgess is the most important, complex and fascinating of 'The Cambridge Spies' - the group of British men recruited to pass intelligence to the Soviets during World War Two and the Cold War. Burgess's story takes us from his student days in 1930s Cambridge, where he was first approached by Soviet scouts, through his daring infiltration of the BBC and the British government, to his final escape to Russia and lonely, tragic-comic exile there. In this definitive biography, Andrew Lownie uncovers the true depths of Burgess's penetration and betrayal of the British Intelligence Service. His close personal relationships with several high profile men and women are examined - including his friendship with Winston Churchill and his family. Through interviews with over 100 people who knew Burgess personally, many of whom have never spoken about him before, and the discovery of hitherto secret files on the Cambridge Spies, Andrew Lownie reveals a completely new and intriguing picture of Guy Burgess.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He puts the "screw" in screwball comedy...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRYNN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty-four, I’m reeling from a divorce. I don’t want to party or try to move on. I just want to stay home and post a new recipe on my blog: &lt;i&gt;Brynn’s Dips and Balls.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my friends aren’t having it. &lt;i&gt;Get out there again,&lt;/i&gt; they say. &lt;i&gt;It will be fun,&lt;/i&gt; they say. I’m still taking a hard pass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Free designer cocktails,&lt;/i&gt; they say. And that’s a game-changer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad my ex shows up with his new arm candy. That’s when I lose my mind. But when my besties dare me to leap on the first single man I see, they don't expect me to actually go through with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I need right now is some peace and quiet while my home renovation TV show is on hiatus. But when a curvy woman in a red wrap dress charges me like she’s a gymnast about to mount my high bar, all I can do is brace myself and catch her. What follows is the hottest experience of my adult life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a repeat, but my flying Cinderella disappears immediately afterward. She doesn’t leave a glass slipper, either—just a pair of panties with chocolate bunnies printed on them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; find her.</description>

  <description>(Originally appeared in the e-book anthology &lt;i&gt;Three Weddings and a Murder&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Eliza Cade is a lady in waiting. And waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of a foolish mistake in her youth, she's not allowed "out" in Society until her three older sisters are wed. But while she's trying to be good, she keeps bumping elbows—and, more distressingly, lips—with notorious rake Harry Wright. Every moment she spends with him, she risks complete ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensual passions he stirs in her are so wrong . . . but Eliza just can't resist Mr. Wright.</description>

  <description>A vampire aristocrat of the Glymera, Peyton is well aware of his duty to his bloodline: mate with an appropriate female of his class and carry on his family’s traditions. And he thought he’d found his perfect match in Paradise—until she fell in love with someone else. When his split-second decision in a battle with the enemy endangers the life of another trainee, Peyton has to face the idea that his future, and his heart, actually lie with another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novo, as a female in the Black Dagger Brotherhood’s training program, feels like she has to prove herself to everybody—and she has no interest in being distracted by falling in love. But when Peyton proves to be so much more than a rich playboy, she is forced to confront the tragedy that has broken her soul and closed her off from love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two grapple with Novo’s past and Peyton’s present, another couple must contend with an erotic connection that is unparalleled—and potentially scandalous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saxton, who has had his heart broken, discovers in himself a deep-seated attraction to Ruhn, a new member of the household. But will the other male explore the connection? Or will he close his mind and his heart to what could be true love . . . and cost Saxton everything?</description>

Both romances and all four POVs were well-developed and engaging. <br /><br />Going in I actually knew very little about this book.

  <description>Inside every secret, there’s a world of trouble. Step into Grace’s world with this exclusive bonus scene from Embassy Row, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Ally Carter’s new series of global proportions. Embassy Row Book 1, &lt;i&gt;All Fall Down&lt;/i&gt;, is available now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Blakely is absolutely certain of three things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. She is not crazy.&lt;br /&gt;2. Her mother was murdered.&lt;br /&gt;3. Someday she is going to find the killer and make him pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As certain as Grace is about these facts, nobody else believes her -- so there's no one she can completely trust. Not her grandfather, a powerful ambassador. Not her new friends, who all live on Embassy Row. Not Alexei, the Russian boy next door, who is keeping his eye on Grace for reasons she neither likes nor understands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody wants Grace to put on a pretty dress and a pretty smile, blocking out all her unpretty thoughts. But they can't control Grace -- no more than Grace can control what she knows or what she needs to do. Her past has come back to hunt her . . . and if she doesn't stop it, Grace isn't the only one who will get hurt. Because on Embassy Row, the countries of the world stand like dominoes, and one wrong move can make them all fall down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t miss this never-before-read scene from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Ally Carter’s brand-new series, Embassy Row.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She harbors a secret yearning.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lover of animals and nature, Beatrix Hathaway has always been more comfortable outdoors than in the ballroom. Even though she participated in the London season in the past, the classic beauty and free-spirited Beatrix has never been swept away or seriously courted... and she has resigned herself to the fate of never finding love. Has the time come for the most unconventional of the Hathaway sisters to settle for an ordinary man—just to avoid spinsterhood? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He is a world-weary cynic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Christopher Phelan is a handsome, daring soldier who plans to marry Beatrix's friend, the vivacious flirt Prudence Mercer, when he returns from fighting abroad. But, as he explains in his letters to Pru, life on the battlefield has darkened his soul—and it's becoming clear that Christopher won't come back as the same man. When Beatrix learns of Pru's disappointment, she decides to help by concocting Pru's letters to Christopher for her. Soon the correspondence between Beatrix and Christopher develops into something fulfilling and deep... and when Christopher comes home, he's determined to claim the woman he loves. What began as Beatrix's innocent deception has resulted in the agony of unfulfilled love—and a passion that can't be denied.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A woman who defies her time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Garrett Gibson, the only female physician in England, is as daring and independent as any man—why not take her pleasures like one? Yet she has never been tempted to embark on an affair, until now. Ethan Ransom, a former detective for Scotland Yard, is as gallant as he is secretive, a rumored assassin whose true loyalties are a mystery. For one exhilarating night, they give in to their potent attraction before becoming strangers again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A man who breaks every rule&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Ravenel by-blow spurned by his father, Ethan has little interest in polite society, yet he is captivated by the bold and beautiful Garrett. Despite their vow to resist each other after that sublime night, she is soon drawn into his most dangerous assignment yet. When the mission goes wrong, it will take all of Garrett's skill and courage to save him. As they face the menace of a treacherous government plot, Ethan is willing to take any risk for the love of the most extraordinary woman he's ever known.</description>

  <description>Having completed his sentence for the unintentional crime that derailed his youthful plans for fame and fortune, Levi Grant looks to start over in the town of Spencer, Texas. Spencer needs a blacksmith, a trade he learned at his father's knee, and he needs a place where no one knows his past. But small towns leave little room for secrets...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden Spencer has sworn off men, choosing instead to devote her time to the lending library she runs. When a mountain-sized stranger walks through her door and asks to borrow a book, she steels herself against the attraction he provokes. His halting speech and hesitant manner leave her doubting his intelligence. Yet as the mysteries of the town's new blacksmith unfold, Eden discovers hidden depths in him that tempt her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levi's renewed commitment to his faith leads Eden to believe she's finally found a man of honor and integrity, a man worthy of her love. But when the truth about his prodigal past comes to light, can this tarnished hero find a way to win back the librarian's affections?</description>

  <description>Book two of the dazzling Winner's Trilogy is a fight to the death as Kestrel risks betrayal of country for love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The engagement of Lady Kestrel to Valoria’s crown prince means one celebration after another. But to Kestrel it means living in a cage of her own making. As the wedding approaches, she aches to tell Arin the truth about her engagement... if she could only trust him. Yet can she even trust herself? For—unknown to Arin—Kestrel is becoming a skilled practitioner of deceit: an anonymous spy passing information to Herran, and close to uncovering a shocking secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Arin enlists dangerous allies in the struggle to keep his country’s freedom, he can’t fight the suspicion that Kestrel knows more than she shows. In the end, it might not be a dagger in the dark that cuts him open, but the truth. And when that happens, Kestrel and Arin learn just how much their crimes will cost them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s been a bad, bad rake—and it takes a governess to teach him a lesson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The accidental governess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her livelihood slips through her fingers, Alexandra Mountbatten takes on an impossible post: transforming a pair of wild orphans into proper young ladies. However, the girls don’t need discipline. They need a loving home. Try telling that to their guardian, Chase Reynaud: duke’s heir in the streets and devil in the sheets. The ladies of London have tried—and failed—to make him settle down. Somehow, Alexandra must reach his heart... without risking her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The infamous rake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-respecting libertine, Chase lives by one rule: no attachments. When a stubborn little governess tries to reform him, he decides to give her an education—in pleasure. That should prove he can’t be tamed. But Alexandra is more than he bargained for: clever, perceptive, passionate. She refuses to see him as a lost cause. Soon the walls around Chase’s heart are crumbling... and he’s in danger of falling, hard.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He is everything she wants to avoid...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, Catherine Marks has been a paid companion to the Hathaway sisters—a pleasant position, with one caveat. Her charges' older brother, Leo Hathaway, is thoroughly exasperating. Cat can hardly believe that their constant arguing could mask a mutual attraction. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful response—and even more so when Leo proposes a dangerous liaison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She is not at all what she seems...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo must marry and produce an heir within a year to save his family home. Catherine's respectable demeanor hides a secret that would utterly destroy her. But to Leo, Cat is intriguing and infernally tempting, even to a man resolved never to love again. The danger Cat tried to outrun is about to separate them forever—unless two wary lovers can find a way to banish the shadows and give in to their desires...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He was everything she'd sworn to avoid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Hathaway loves her unconventional family, though she longs for normalcy. Then fate leads to a meeting with Harry Rutledge, an enigmatic hotel owner and inventor with wealth, power, and a dangerous hidden life. When their flirtation compromises her own reputation, Poppy shocks everyone by accepting his proposal—only to find that her new husband offers his passion, but not his trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And she was everything he needed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry was willing to do anything to win Poppy—except to open his heart. All his life, he has held the world at arm’s length…but the sharp, beguiling Poppy demands to be his wife in &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; way that matters. Still, as desire grows between them, an enemy lurks in the shadows. Now if Harry wants to keep Poppy by his side, he must forge a true union of body and soul, once and for all...</description>
