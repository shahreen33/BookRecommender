  <description>&lt;b&gt;Danger lurks in the wilds of Grizzly Harbor this Christmas but it's love that has Alaska Force in the cross-hairs, from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sniper's Pride&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When straight-arrow, by-the-rules Alaskan State Trooper Kate Holiday is sent to investigate a local band of secretive commandos in remote Grizzly Harbor over the holidays, her least favorite time of year, her objective is clear: disband Alaska Force and arrest them. But Kate didn't count on the diabolical temptation of Templeton Cross. The former Army Ranger exudes charm and has absolutely no respect for the rules of law that govern Kate's life - too bad he also makes her mouth water and her knees weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Templeton has always been good at keeping his game face on and his emotions hidden, especially in combat. But working with Kate brings back memories of losses he prefers to keep locked up tight. As the pressure mounts - and Christmas draws closer - it’s a given that someone's going to get hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is, the more time he spends convincing his careful, wary trooper that there’s more to the holidays than her memories, the more he wants to keep her around. Forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But forever is the one thing a man like Templeton can't do. Not even at Christmas.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Only in my family could a professional hockey player earning seven million dollars a year be considered a slacker.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m at the height of my athletic career. Yet my arrogant brother is always trying to recruit me into the family business: a global security company so secretive that I don’t even know its name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass, thanks. I don’t need a summer job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the jerk ambushes me with a damsel in distress. That damsel is Alex, the competitive, sassy girl I knew when we were kids. Now she’s a drop-dead gorgeous woman in deep trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So guess who’s on a flight to Hawaii?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s going to be a long week in paradise. My job is keeping Alex safe, while her job is torturing me with her tiny bikinis. Or maybe we’re torturing each other. It’s all snark and flirting until the threat against Alex gets serious. And this jock must become her major league protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moonlighter is a stand-alone novel. No cliffhangers, no prior experience necessary. Contains: hackers, hockey players, and a hotel room with only one bed.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Love can take root where you least expect it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyson Yang never imagined that one day he’d be the de facto spokesperson for an illegal community garden. But when the once-rat-infested-but-now-thriving Harlem lot goes up for sale, Ty can’t just let all their hard work get plowed under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; irresistibly drawn to the lovely but infuriatingly stubborn real estate associate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magda Ferrer’s family is already convinced this new job will be yet another flop in her small but growing list of career path failures. But her student debt isn’t going anywhere, and selling her uncle’s historic town house and the lot nearby means a chance to get some breathing room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty is her charming rival, her incorrigible nemesis, the handsome roadblock to her success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one hot Harlem night blurs the hard line drawn between them, and the seeds of possibility in this rocky garden blossom into love…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 48,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Carina Press Romance Promise&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sam Brandis was Tate Jones’s first: Her first love. Her first everything. Including her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During a whirlwind two-week vacation abroad, Sam and Tate fell for each other in only the way that first loves do: sharing all of their hopes, dreams, and deepest secrets along the way. Sam was the first, and only, person that Tate—the long-lost daughter of one of the world’s biggest film stars—ever revealed her identity to. So when it became clear her trust was misplaced, her world shattered for good.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fourteen years later, Tate, now an up-and-coming actress, only thinks about her first love every once in a blue moon. When she steps onto the set of her first big break, he’s the last person she expects to see. Yet here Sam is, the same charming, confident man she knew, but even more alluring than she remembered. Forced to confront the man who betrayed her, Tate must ask herself if it’s possible to do the wrong thing for the right reason… and whether “once in a lifetime” &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; come around twice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Christina Lauren’s signature “beautifully written and remarkably compelling” (Sarah J. Maas, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author) prose and perfect for fans of Emily Giffin and Jennifer Weiner, &lt;i&gt;Twice in a Blue Moon &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable and moving novel of young love and second chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Unhoneymooners &lt;/i&gt;and the “delectable, moving” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;My Favorite Half-Night Stand &lt;/i&gt;comes a modern love story about what happens when your first love reenters your life when you least expect it…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Advertising executive Nick Wong enjoys living in Toronto. He loves late nights partying and taking women back to his penthouse. And so it is with great reluctance that he returns to his boring hometown of Mosquito Bay for Thanksgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, however, is even worse than usual. His interfering parents and grandparents, frustrated with the lack of weddings in the family, have invited blind dates for him and his three siblings. Nick’s brother Greg has been set up with Lily Tseng, who just so happens to be Nick’s latest one-night stand, the one he can’t get out of his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Nick has never been interested in settling down, Lily has him reconsidering. Perhaps he’s good for more than a single night of sex, dumplings, and bubble tea after all. But first, he has to get through this painful weekend with his family and convince her that she should be with him, not Greg…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jaci Burton celebrates the gift of love and the holiday season with a snowy Christmas wedding at the Bellini family vineyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stranded at the Red Moss Vineyard a week before her best friend's wedding, LA native and professional matchmaker Alice Weatherford is not pleased with her first trip to Oklahoma, or the epic snowstorm forcing her to stay. So much for Christmas cheer. What she needs is a project, something to distract her...and, oh, has she found one in neighboring rancher Clay Henry. Gorgeous, charming, and unlike any other man she's ever met, finding the right woman for Clay should be easy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Having grown up with the Bellini sisters, it's no hardship for Clay to ride out the storm at their cozy family vineyard, especially since that means spending time with their savvy and smart houseguest. But despite Alice’s best efforts, he's not the least bit interested in her matchmaking....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alice is the only woman Clay wants. Now he just has to convince the matchmaker herself to give love a chance.</description>

  <description>All's fair in love and...caffeine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Daniel jokingly appoints himself Customer of the Week at his favourite coffee shop, he has no idea he’s just fired the first salvo in what will swiftly become an epic battle of wills with a mysterious woman called Cassidy. As a committed coffee lover, Cassidy can’t let his self-appointed claim go uncontested - and so starts a clash for the ages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The city becomes captivated by their escalating antics via the magic of social media and Cassidy and Daniel become obsessed with one-upping each other’s next move, providing a much-needed distraction from everyday life. But as they keep upping the stakes, both of them start to wonder if there's more to this rivalry than meets the eye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But meeting IRL means letting go of their contest and facing reality. Their caffeine addiction has taken them this far...but will one of them blink and admit the real fix is the other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story that entertained the world, this light-hearted novella offers a window into a possible “what if?” for lovers of happy-ever-afters everywhere.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes the past just won’t stay buried.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 14 year old Brittany disappears one night, her parents are devastated, certain she has been taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can’t bear to think about who has done this and what might be happening to their precious girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, the police seem to see them as suspects, implying that they may have had a part in their own daughter’s disappearance. Only their neighbor, Taylor, is a rock. She organizes search parties, feeds the volunteers, works night and day to help them find Brittany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as this affluent California community becomes focused on the hunt for the missing girl, it slowly becomes clear that her disappearance is linked to terrible secrets from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets that must be kept hidden at all costs….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Neighbor is a gripping psychological thriller that twists and turns as it races towards its nerve-shredding climax. Perfect for fans of K. L. Slater, Teresa Driscoll and Mark Edwards. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Neighbor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘I don’t even know where to start! This book has &lt;strong&gt;left me speechless&lt;/strong&gt;. I love all of the &lt;strong&gt;mystery and drama&lt;/strong&gt; The Good Neighbor provided.’ – NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘The Good Neighbor is &lt;strong&gt;a thrilling read&lt;/strong&gt; that will have you &lt;strong&gt;gripped&lt;/strong&gt; right from the beginning till the final page. If you love a story that is &lt;strong&gt;full of secrets&lt;/strong&gt;, mystery, suspense with &lt;strong&gt;twists and turns,&lt;/strong&gt; then this is the book for you.’ – Onceaponatimebookblog.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Omg, this is a &lt;strong&gt;totally and utterly AMAZING book&lt;/strong&gt;. It's &lt;strong&gt;an intense tale&lt;/strong&gt; of manipulation, lies, suspicion, &lt;strong&gt;deception and secrets&lt;/strong&gt; that poses the question. Is it always best to do the right thing?’ – NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Wow! To say this book “&lt;strong&gt;packs a punch&lt;/strong&gt;” is such an understatement – it more ‘smacks you around the head with a 9 iron!’ There were &lt;strong&gt;twists and turns&lt;/strong&gt; around every corner all neatly packaged within this highly readable tale.’ – ReadandRated.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A great, &lt;strong&gt;can't put it down&lt;/strong&gt; suspense mystery novel.  Read it in one day! &lt;strong&gt;It is rare to be surprised &lt;/strong&gt;at how a story &lt;strong&gt;twists and turns&lt;/strong&gt; I highly recommend for a great take on a plot that isn't predictable.’ – NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘I &lt;strong&gt;loved the characters&lt;/strong&gt; in this book…The book &lt;strong&gt;developed a hold over me&lt;/strong&gt;…I was drawn into this story from the first word on the first page and Cathryn kept my attention throughout the book…a very well deserved &lt;strong&gt;5* out of 5*&lt;/strong&gt;.’ – gingerbookgeek.wordpress.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A &lt;strong&gt;fantastic&lt;/strong&gt; psychological thriller. &lt;strong&gt;Suspense filled &lt;/strong&gt;and a very exciting read. &lt;strong&gt;Loved it&lt;/strong&gt;. A good and &lt;strong&gt;exciting mystery&lt;/strong&gt;.’ – NetGalley Reviewer &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Following a year in the life of a twenty-something British woman who falls hard for her London flat mate, this clever, fun, and unforgettable romantic comedy is the perfect feel-good holiday read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two people. One house. A year that changes everything. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Jess is following her dream and moving to London. It’s December, and she’s taking a room in a crumbling, but grand, Notting Hill house-share with four virtual strangers. On her first night, Jess meets Alex, the guy sharing her floor, at a Christmas dinner hosted by her landlord. They don’t kiss, but as far as Jess is concerned the connection is clear. She starts planning how they will knock down the wall between them to spend more time together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jess returns from a two-week Christmas holiday, she finds Alex has started dating someone else—beautiful Emma, who lives on the floor above them. Now Jess faces a year of bumping into (hell, sharing a bathroom with) the man of her dreams…and the woman of his.</description>

  <description>Maddie and Theo have two things in common:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Alexa is their best friend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They hate each other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an “Oops, we made a mistake” kiss, neither one can stop thinking about the other. With Alexa’s wedding rapidly approaching, Maddie and Theo both share bridal party responsibilities that require more interaction with each other than they’re comfortable with. Underneath the sharp barbs they toss at each other is a simmering attraction that won’t fade. It builds until they find themselves sneaking off together to release some tension when Alexa isn’t looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as with any engagement with a nemesis, there are unspoken rules that must be abided by. First and foremost, don’t fall in love.</description>

      <![CDATA[I've really enjoyed Jasmine Guillory's previous work, but The Wedding Party fell short. Enemies-to-lovers is one of my favorite tropes, but Theo and Maddie just didn't have the chemistry, or at least I didn't believe it. The book is 95% about their short-term fling, but somehow lacks the heat and...]]>

  <description>As an adventurous send-off to her childhood, eighteen-year-old Tate Jones travels with her grandmother from their small town in Northern California to London. But the vacation of a lifetime is wonderfully derailed by the appearance of two charming Vermont farmers: grandfather Luther and his handsome grandson Sam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam and Tate fall hard and fast. For two glorious weeks, the couple share their hopes, dreams, and secrets. Sam admits he suspects his grandfather is dying and that this could be the last trip they take together, and Tate reveals that she is the hidden daughter of one of the biggest film stars in the world—a secret she’s never told anyone before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Tate is exposed by a crush of cameras and reporters, she knows she's been betrayed by the one person she thought she could trust. She is forced to decide whether she will return to her quiet life or embrace being in the public eye. So when Sam reappears in her world more than a decade later, can Tate forgive the past and rekindle the passion they shared on their magical trip abroad? And does she even want to?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Desire as we’ve never seen it before: a riveting true story about the sex lives of three real American women, based on nearly a decade of reporting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts and destroys our lives. It’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt;, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He burns for her. Lucky for him, she likes to play with fire. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Eddie Rosas, but everyone calls me Trouble. Since I got out of prison six months ago, I’ve had one goal: find my father, whatever the cost. My older brother says I need to move on. He also wants me to leave our gang, East Side Hollenbeck, and go straight, but I can’t—not until I uncover the truth about our family and its missing piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem? I’m distracted. My distraction’s name is Carmen Centeno. Smart, passionate, and tough as hell, Carmen is a woman from the neighborhood who’s built her career as one of the city’s top chefs. She’s a master of creating pleasure both in and out of bed. But when our connection deepens, how can I show her I’m not the trash everyone says I am?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure’s rising. Carmen deserves a man she can depend on. And when the ghosts of my past rise up, I’ll have to outsmart them—or lose my shot at a future with the only woman who believes in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rosas brothers will return in Tanked!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Five nights. Two adversaries. Only one bed in their hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm at the height of my hockey career. Yet my arrogant brother is always trying to recruit me into the family business: a global security company so secretive that I don't even know its name.&lt;br /&gt;Pass, thanks. I don't need a summer job.&lt;br /&gt;But the jerk ambushes me with a damsel in distress. That damsel is Alex, the competitive, sassy girl I knew when we were kids. Now she's a drop-dead gorgeous woman in deep trouble.&lt;br /&gt;So guess who's on a flight to Hawaii?&lt;br /&gt;It's going to be a long week in paradise. My job is keeping Alex safe, while her job is torturing me with her tiny bikinis. Or maybe we're torturing each other. It's all snark and flirting until the threat against Alex gets serious. And this jock must become her major league protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moonlighter is a stand-alone novel for Brooklyn Bruisers team member Eric Bayer. No cliffhangers, no prior experience necessary. Expect: a growly hero, a lady boss with no time for his attitude, and a war of wills and hormones. Bonus: a hunk wearing a baby in a sling.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEVER SAY NEVER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie Gold is ready to take her career to the next level with the role of a lifetime. Finally, she can shake her reputation as a pretty face with more wealth and connections than talent. But Sadie is not prepared for the wild turn her own life is about to take. The man in charge of training Sadie for her most demanding role yet is none other than her first real boyfriend—the one who took her heart and ran away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bo Ibarra is as good-looking and irresistible as ever. Maybe even more so, now that everything once worked against them—Sadie’s pampered and privileged upbringing and Bo’s childhood in a family struggling to make ends meet—is in the past. But the future is still unwritten…and getting there, together, means coming clean about painful secrets and slashing through nasty tabloid rumors while trying to control the attraction that crackles between them. Maybe it’s finally time for them to walk off into the sunset and into a true and lasting love?</description>

  <description>It started off as a battle of wits. Me: the ordinary girl with a big mouth against Him: the sexy bastard with a big...ego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I’d hit the jackpot when I was upgraded to first class on my flight to London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until HE sat next to me. Gabriel Scott: handsome as sin, cold as ice. Nothing and no one gets to him. Ever. He’s a legend in his own right, the manager of the biggest rock band in the world, and an arrogant ass who looks down his nose at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I’d give him hell for one, long flight. I didn’t expect to like him. I didn’t expect to want him. But the biggest surprise? He wants me too. Only in a way I didn’t see coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I accept his proposal, I leave myself open to falling for the one man I can’t manage. But I’m tempted to say yes. Because the real man beneath those perfect suits and that cool façade just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me. And I just might be the only one who can melt the ice around his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the battle begin…</description>

  <description>I hate ice cream. Ever since my fiancée left me at the altar and skewered me in her bestseller “Embrace Your Inner Ice Cream Sandwich: Finding the Positive You in a World of Negativity,” I haven’t been able to stomach the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my five-year-old niece is a budding foodie and her favorite place in the world is Ginger Scoops, a cutesy Asian ice cream shop. Since I’ve been looking after my niece a lot lately, I’ve spent too much time there, sipping black coffee, refusing to eat ice cream, and trying not to look at the owner, Chloe Jenkins. Chloe is obnoxiously cheerful, and I can’t stand her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I end up kissing her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I’ve sworn off women after the fiasco with my ex-fiancée, and I’m convinced I’m no good at relationships. Still, with Chloe I’m tempted to do the impossible: give love and ice cream another chance…</description>

  <description>In this warm and witty romance from acclaimed author Kate Clayborn, one little word puts one woman’s business—and her heart—in jeopardy . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meg Mackworth’s hand-lettering skill has made her famous as the Planner of Park Slope, designing beautiful custom journals for New York City’s elite. She has another skill too: reading signs that other people miss. Like the time she sat across from Reid Sutherland and his gorgeous fiancée, and knew their upcoming marriage was doomed to fail. Weaving a secret word into their wedding program was a little unprofessional, but she was sure no one else would spot it. She hadn’t counted on sharp-eyed, pattern-obsessed Reid . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, Reid has tracked Meg down to find out—before he leaves New York for good—how she knew that his meticulously planned future was about to implode. But with a looming deadline, a fractured friendship, and a bad case of creative block, Meg doesn’t have time for Reid’s questions—unless he can help her find her missing inspiration. As they gradually open up to each other about their lives, work, and regrets, both try to ignore the fact that their unlikely connection is growing deeper. But the signs are there—irresistible, indisputable, urging Meg to heed the messages Reid is sending her, before it’s too late . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Romance blossoms between two city planners posing as newlyweds in this first in a bright new series by acclaimed author Ruby Lang&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Oliver Huang expects to see on the historic Mount Morris home tour is longtime acquaintance Fay Liu bustling up and kissing him hello. He’s happy to playact being a couple to save her from a pushy admirer. Fay’s beautiful, successful and smart, and if he’s being honest, Oliver has always had a bit of a thing for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe more than a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geeking out over architectural details is Oliver and Fay’s shared love language, and soon they’re touring pricey real estate across Upper Manhattan as the terribly faux but terribly charming couple Darling and Olly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time since being laid off from the job he loved, Oliver has something to look forward to. And for the first time since her divorce, Fay’s having fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere between the light-filled living rooms and spacious closets they’ve explored, this faux relationship just may have sparked some very real feelings. For Oliver and Fay, home truly is where their hearts are.</description>

  <description>A richly crafted contemporary YA novel about family, community, and the importance of writing your own history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misa Sugiura is back with another smartly drawn coming-of-age novel that weaves riveting family drama, surprising humor, and delightful romance into a story that will draw you in from the very first page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katsuyamas never quit—but seventeen-year-old CJ doesn’t even know where to start. She’s never lived up to her mom’s type A ambition, and she’s perfectly happy just helping her aunt, Hannah, at their family’s flower shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t buy into Hannah’s romantic ideas about flowers and their hidden meanings, but when it comes to arranging the perfect bouquet, CJ discovers a knack she never knew she had. A skill she might even be proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then her mom decides to sell the shop — to the family who swindled CJ’s grandparents when thousands of Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps during WWII. Soon a rift threatens to splinter CJ’s family, friends, and their entire Northern California community; and for the first time, CJ has found something she wants to fight for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning debut for author Evie Dunmore and her Oxford Rebels, in which a fiercely independent vicar's daughter takes on a duke in a fiery love story that threatens to upend the British social order.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;England, 1879.&lt;/i&gt; Annabelle Archer, the brilliant but destitute daughter of a country vicar, has earned herself a place among the first cohort of female students at the renowned University of Oxford. In return for her scholarship, she must support the rising women's suffrage movement. Her charge: recruit men of influence to champion their cause. Her target: Sebastian Devereux, the cold and calculating Duke of Montgomery who steers Britain's politics at the Queen's command. Her challenge: not to give in to the powerful attraction she can't deny for the man who opposes everything she stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian is appalled to find a suffragist squad has infiltrated his ducal home, but the real threat is his impossible feelings for green-eyed beauty Annabelle. He is looking for a wife of equal standing to secure the legacy he has worked so hard to rebuild, not an outspoken commoner who could never be his duchess. But he wouldn't be the greatest strategist of the Kingdom if he couldn't claim this alluring bluestocking without the promise of a ring...or could he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked in a battle with rising passion and a will matching her own, Annabelle will learn just what it takes to topple a duke....</description>

  <description>Life is a mixed bag for Piper Calloway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, she’s a twenty-nine-year-old VP at her dad’s multibillion-dollar real estate development firm, and living the high single life with her two best friends in a swanky downtown penthouse. On the other hand, she’s considered a pair of sexy legs in a male-dominated world and constantly has to prove her worth. Plus, she’s stuck seeing her narcissistic ex-fiancé—a fellow VP—on the other side of her glass office wall every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things get exponentially more complicated for Piper when she runs into Kyle Miller—the handsome new security guard at Calloway Group Industries, and coincidentally the first love of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy she hasn’t seen or heard from since they were summer camp counsellors together. The guy from the wrong side of the tracks. The guy who &lt;i&gt;apparently&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t even remember her name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper may be a high-powered businesswoman now, but she soon realizes that her schoolgirl crush is not only alive but stronger than ever, and crippling her concentration. What’s more, despite Kyle’s distant attitude, she’s convinced their reunion isn’t at all coincidental, and that his feelings for her still run deep. And she’s determined to make him admit to them, no matter the consequences.</description>

  <description>Maxwell has finally met an opponent that he can't best in this new football romance from the author of Fumbled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Brynn Larson, Maxwell Lewis is more trouble than he's worth. She doesn't care if he's a football god with a rock-hard body that brings most women to their knees. After an encounter that ends poorly, she's not interested in giving him a second chance. The last thing Brynn expects is for him to turn up at her bar months later, hat in hand. It doesn't matter if he brings more customers to her business--she's still not going on a date with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maxwell knows he made a mistake. He'd been waiting to make his move on Brynn since the day he laid eyes on her and he was finally ready to go for it until he screwed up. He wishes he could tell her the truth about what happened that night, but he just can't. He can't tell anyone, so he'll make amends and hope she'll forgive him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brynn's not like other women, though. Playing for the Mustangs doesn't impress her and gifts make her scoff. Max will have to bring his A game if he hopes to win her over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DEFINITELY, MAYBE...OR LOVE, ACTUALLY? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English professor Bonnie Blythe expects her life to play out like her favorite novels, especially now that her long-term boyfriend has finally proposed. So when a shocking discovery leads Bonnie to end her engagement, she decides to close the book on love. But the plot thickens when a brand-new character enters the scene—and quickens Bonnie's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his brilliant blue eyes, sexy accent, and irresistible charm, Theo Wharton is like a romantic hero straight out of a Jane Austen novel. When fate places Bonnie in England for a summer—conveniently close to Theo—she realizes a hot friends-with-benefits fling is exactly what she needs to start a fresh chapter. Just as Bonnie begins to believe she's falling in love, an eye-opening revelation into Theo's life makes Bonnie feel like she's wandered into one of her favorite books. Will Bonnie have the courage to risk her heart and turn the page with the dashing Brit to find her true happy ending after all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;IT’S TIME TO FLIRT WITH A MAN IN A KILT &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie Crow, a pop-culture reporter for a TV talk show, is focused on becoming a “serious” journalist. But when she stumbles into a kilted Highlander with a killer accent, Cassie decides that taking one night off from work and spending it with a sexy Scot couldn’t hurt. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan Reid has built a career on his charm, hosting a series of off-the-wall hijinks on the Web. But when the Scottish prankster meets the all-American, equal parts intelligent and irresistible Cassie, Logan realizes that one night of fun won’t be enough. Could it be that this career-focused, commitment-phobic couple is finally ready to take a chance at true and lasting love?</description>

  <description>After four months of unemployment, former book editor Clara Montgomery is still stuck sleeping on her little brother’s ugly couch in Queens. Determined to keep her minuscule savings account intact, she takes a job clearing out abandoned storage units, but is in no way prepared for stumbling upon dead snakes or trying to identify exactly where the perpetual stench of beets is emanating from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clara comes across a unit that was once owned by an escort service, she finds the brothel “résumé” of a younger Caspian Tiddleswich… an astonishingly famous British actor. Her best friend thinks she should sell the gossip to a tabloid to fund her way off the couch from hell, but Clara instead manages to track down Caspian’s contact info, intending to reassure him that her lips are sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Caspian misinterprets Clara’s attempt at altruism and shows up on her doorstep, accusing her of blackmail. When the paparazzi capture a photo of them together, Caspian’s PR team sees an opportunity to promote his latest film—and if Clara wants to atone for her “crimes,” she’ll have to play along. Pretending to be Caspian’s girlfriend seems like it will be a tolerable, if somewhat daunting, penance… until their fake romance becomes something more than either of them expected.</description>

  <description>My name is Salvador Rosas. Back in the &lt;i&gt;barrio&lt;/i&gt;, my past is written on the walls: &lt;i&gt;ESHB&lt;/i&gt;. Short for East Side Hollenbeck, my father’s gang—my gang. Hell, it’s a family tradition, one that sent both my brothers away. They used to call me “Ghost” because I haunted people’s dreams. Now I’ve got nothing going for me except a hipster gringo mentoring me in a new career. An ex-con making craft beer? &lt;i&gt;No mames.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still, people in this neighborhood look out for one another. That’s how I became Vanessa Velasco’s unwelcome tenant. &lt;i&gt;Chiquita pero picosa.&lt;/i&gt; She’s little, but with curves so sweet they’re dangerous. I remember Vanessa from the old days, the straight-A student with big plans. Plans that were derailed by another kid stupid enough to think he was bulletproof. Now Vanessa knows better than to believe in empty promises. There’s fire in her . . . and if I touch her, I might get burned.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m trying everything I can to go straight. But when East Side Hollenbeck comes calling, I might have to risk it all to find out if there’s a future for Vanessa and me. Because she’s the only one who can quench my thirst for something real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rosas brothers will return in &lt;i&gt;Trashed&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Imagine that your husband has two other wives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ve never met the other wives. None of you know each other, and because of this unconventional arrangement, you can see your husband only one day a week. But you love him so much you don’t care. Or at least that’s what you’ve told yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day, while you’re doing laundry, you find a scrap of paper in his pocket—an appointment reminder for a woman named Hannah, and you just know it’s another of the wives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You thought you were fine with your arrangement, but you can’t help yourself: you track her down, and, under false pretenses, you strike up a friendship. Hannah has no idea who you really are. Then Hannah starts showing up to your coffee dates with telltale bruises, and you realize she’s being abused by her husband. Who, of course, is also &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; husband. But you’ve never known him to be violent, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who exactly is your husband, and how far would you go to find the truth? Would you risk your own life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And who is his mysterious third wife?</description>

  <description>4 hours, 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Satire meets slasher in this short, darkly funny hand grenade of a novel about a Nigerian woman whose younger sister has a very inconvenient habit of killing her boyfriends&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Femi makes three, you know. Three and they label you a serial killer."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Korede is bitter. How could she not be? Her sister, Ayoola, is many things: the favorite child, the beautiful one, possibly sociopathic. And now Ayoola's third boyfriend in a row is dead. Korede's practicality is the sisters' saving grace. She knows the best solutions for cleaning blood, the trunk of her car is big enough for a body, and she keeps Ayoola from posting pictures of her dinner to Instagram when she should be mourning her "missing" boyfriend. Not that she gets any credit.&lt;br /&gt; A kind, handsome doctor at the hospital where Korede works, is the bright spot in her life. She dreams of the day when he will realize they're perfect for each other. But one day Ayoola shows up to the hospital uninvited and he takes notice. When he asks Korede for Ayoola's phone number, she must reckon with what her sister has become and what she will do about it.&lt;br /&gt; Sharp as nails and full of deadpan wit, Oyinkan Braithwaite has written a deliciously deadly debut that's as fun as it is frightening.</description>

  <description>Talia Hibbert, one of contemporary romance’s brightest new stars, delivers a witty, hilarious romantic comedy about a woman who’s tired of being “boring” and recruits her mysterious, sexy neighbor to help her experience new things&lt;em&gt;—p&lt;/em&gt;erfect for fans of Sally Thorne, Jasmine Guillory, and Helen Hoang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe Brown is a chronically ill computer geek with a goal, a plan, and a list. After almost—but not quite—dying, she’s come up with seven directives to help her “Get a Life”, and she’s already completed the first: finally moving out of her glamourous family’s mansion. The next items?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy a drunken night out.&lt;br /&gt;Ride a motorcycle.&lt;br /&gt;Go camping.&lt;br /&gt;Have meaningless but thoroughly enjoyable sex.&lt;br /&gt;Travel the world with nothing but hand luggage.&lt;br /&gt;And... do something bad.&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not easy being bad, even when you’ve written step-by-step guidelines on how to do it correctly. What Chloe needs is a teacher, and she knows just the man for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redford ‘Red’ Morgan is a handyman with tattoos, a motorcycle, and more sex appeal than ten-thousand Hollywood heartthrobs. He’s also an artist who paints at night and hides his work in the light of day, which Chloe knows because she spies on him occasionally. Just the teeniest, tiniest bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she enlists Red in her mission to rebel, she learns things about him that no spy session could teach her. Like why he clearly resents Chloe’s wealthy background. And why he never shows his art to anyone. And what really lies beneath his rough exterior…</description>

      <![CDATA[Utterly delightful. Talia Hibbert delivers a persnickety woman who is unequivocally herself and finds her match in a man who loves her exactly as she is. Both Chloe and Red have their own relationship baggage to work out, which makes their love story refreshingly realistic. Highly recommended.<br...]]>

  <description>11 hours and 27 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the popular Black Dagger Brotherhood series comes a brand-new novel about arson investigator, Ann Ashburn, who is consumed by her troubled past, her family’s scorched legacy, and her current case: chasing a deadly killer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Ashburn is a woman consumed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her bitter family legacy, by her scorched career as a firefighter, by her obsession with department bad-boy Danny McGuire, and by a new case that pits her against a fiery killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong-willed Anne was fearless and loved the thrill of fighting fires, pushing herself to be the best. But when one risky decision at a warehouse fire changes her life forever, Anne must reinvent not only her job, but her whole self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shattered and demoralized, Anne finds her new career as an arson investigator a pale substitute for the adrenaline-fueled life she left behind. She doesn't believe she will ever feel that same all-consuming passion for her job again--until she encounters a string of suspicious fires setting her beloved city ablaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danny McGuire is a premiere fireman, best in the county, but in the midst of a personal meltdown. Danny is taking risks like never before and seems to have a death wish until he teams up with Anne to find the fire starter. But Danny may be more than a distraction, and as Anne narrows in on her target, the arsonist begins to target her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the creator of the bestselling Black Dagger Brotherhood, get ready for a new band of brothers. And a firestorm.</description>

      <![CDATA[Listened up to chapter 32. A little too much like watching an ensemble drama about firefighters. More focused on solving a batch of suspicious fires in warehouses than the relationships among the firefighters. <br /><br />I've enjoyed JR Ward's past work, but I don't feel compelled to finish this one.]]>

  <description>Katsuyamas never quit—but seventeen-year-old CJ doesn’t even know where to start. She’s never lived up to her mom’s type A ambition, and she’s perfectly happy just helping her aunt, Hannah, at their family’s flower shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t buy into Hannah’s romantic ideas about flowers and their hidden meanings, but when it comes to arranging the perfect bouquet, CJ discovers a knack she never knew she had. A skill she might even be proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then her mom decides to sell the shop—to the family who swindled CJ’s grandparents when thousands of Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps during WWII. Soon a rift threatens to splinter CJ’s family, friends, and their entire Northern California community; and for the first time, CJ has found something she wants to fight for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of the high-stakes tension of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestsellers &lt;i&gt;Luckiest Girl Alive &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, a razor-sharp page-turner about female ambition and what happens when fake violence draws real blood… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of struggling in the Chicago theater scene, ambitious actress Kira Rascher finally lands the role of a lifetime. The catch? Starring in &lt;i&gt;Temper&lt;/i&gt; means working with Malcolm Mercer, a mercurial director who’s known for pushing his performers past their limits—onstage and off.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kira’s convinced she can handle Malcolm, but the theater’s cofounder Joanna Cuyler is another story. Joanna sees Kira as a threat—to her own thwarted artistic aspirations, her twisted relationship with Malcolm, and the shocking secret she’s keeping about the upcoming production. But as opening night draws near, Kira and Joanna both start to realize that Malcolm’s dangerous extremes are nothing compared to what they're capable of themselves&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An edgy, addictive, and fiendishly clever tale of ambition, deceit, and power, &lt;i&gt;Temper &lt;/i&gt;is a timely, heart-in-your-throat psychological thriller that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The de Vincent brothers are back—and so is the intrigue that surrounds them—in&lt;/i&gt; New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout’s sizzling new novel...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicolette Bresson never thought she’d return to the de Vincents’ bayou compound. It’s where her parents work, where Nikki grew up... and where she got her heart broken by Gabriel de Vincent himself. Yet here she is, filling in for her sick mother. Avoiding Gabe should be easy, especially when so much of Nikki’s time is spent trying not to be stabbed in the back by the malicious hangers-on who frequent the mansion. But escaping memories of Gabe, much less his smoking-hot presence, is harder than expected—especially since he seems determined to be in Nikki’s space as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gabriel spent years beating himself up over his last encounter with Nikki. He’d wanted her then, but for reasons that were bad for both of them. Things have now changed. Gabe sees more than a girl he’s known forever; he sees a smart, talented, and heartbreakingly beautiful woman... one who’s being stalked from the shadows. Now, Gabe will do anything to keep Nikki safe—and to stop the de Vincent curse from striking again.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Tiffy and Leon share a flat&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy and Leon share a bed&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy and Leon have never met…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy Moore needs a cheap flat, and fast. Leon Twomey works nights and needs cash. Their friends think they’re crazy, but it’s the perfect solution: Leon occupies the one-bed flat while Tiffy’s at work in the day, and she has the run of the place the rest of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with obsessive ex-boyfriends, demanding clients at work, wrongly imprisoned brothers and, of course, the fact that they still haven’t met yet, they’re about to discover that if you want the perfect home you need to throw the rulebook out the window…</description>

  <description>ARYA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I can make you blush. &lt;br /&gt;It’s a weird claim to fame, but a perk of my dream job: being the voice of your favorite romance audio books. Laughter, hijinks, adventure. Passion. Sweet heaven, the passion. It’s everything I could ever want. Except… &lt;br /&gt;The problem with this fabulous life? &lt;br /&gt;It’s all just fantasy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picking between Chinese and Thai delivery doesn’t count as adventure. &lt;br /&gt;The bestie who always makes me laugh is thousands of miles away. &lt;br /&gt;As for the hunky hero? It’s not like he’s just going to come crashing into my apartment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the night a bearded stranger does exactly that… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GAVIN &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the job. Get the bad guy. Go home. &lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, don’t get involved. &lt;br /&gt;Those are the rules. The agency’s and mine. And they work. Even better, they give me the perfect excuse to keep my distance. &lt;br /&gt;The perfect escape from getting burned again. Except… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can’t I stop watching her? &lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t care more about what she’s doing than my target. &lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t let her distract me from the job. &lt;br /&gt;And I sure as hell shouldn’t fantasize about a woman I’ll never meet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until the night I surprise us both by kicking down her apartment door. Rules or no rules, it's true that... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, 425 Madison is the perfect place to fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each story in the series is completely standalone.</description>

Her path to escaping her shameful past certainly doesn’t include a gorgeous hockey player who believes in love at first sight. One night of sizzling heat and surprising tenderness is all she’s willing to give John Tucker, but sometimes, one night is all it takes for your entire life to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the game just got a whole lot more complicated...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucker believes being a team player is as important as being the star. On the ice, he’s fine staying out of the spotlight, but when it comes to becoming a daddy at the age of twenty-two, he refuses to be a bench warmer. It doesn’t hurt that the soon-to-be mother of his child is beautiful, whip-smart, and keeps him on his toes. The problem is, Sabrina’s heart is locked up tight, and the fiery brunette is too stubborn to accept his help. If he wants a life with the woman of his dreams, he’ll have to convince her that some goals can only be made with an assist.</description>

  <description>He knows how to score, on and off the ice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn’t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, she’s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck won’t include the king of one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’ll take more than flashy moves to win her over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girls…he’s a ladies man, all right, and he’s yet to meet a woman who’s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire world—and now she wants to be friends? Nope. It’s not over until he says it’s over. Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’s a player in more ways than one…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College junior John Logan can get any girl he wants. For this hockey star, life is a parade of parties and hook-ups, but behind his killer grins and easygoing charm, he hides growing despair about the dead-end road he’ll be forced to walk after graduation. A sexy encounter with freshman Grace Ivers is just the distraction he needs, but when a thoughtless mistake pushes her away, Logan plans to spend his final year proving to her that he’s worth a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now he’s going to need to up his game…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a less than stellar freshman year, Grace is back at Briar University, older, wiser, and &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; over the arrogant hockey player she nearly handed her V-card to. She’s not a charity case, and she’s not the quiet butterfly she was when they first hooked up. If Logan expects her to roll over and beg like all his other puck bunnies, he can think again. He wants her back? He’ll have to &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; for it. This time around, she’ll be the one in the driver’s seat…and she plans on driving him wild.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It takes a fearless woman to love the most scandalous man alive in New York Times Bestselling Author Jennifer L. Armentrout’s breathtaking novel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even a ghost hunter like Rosie Herpin couldn’t have foreseen the fateful meeting between two mourners that has brought her so intimately close to the notorious and seductive Devlin de Vincent. Everyone in New Orleans knows he’s heir to a dark family curse that both frightens and enthralls. To the locals, Devlin is the devil. To Rosie, he’s a man who’s stoking her wildest fantasies. When a brutal attack on her friend is linked to the de Vincents, he becomes a mystery she may be risking her life to solve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devlin knows what he wants from this sexy and adventurous woman. But what does Rosie want from him? It’s a question that becomes more pressing—and more dangerous—when he suspects her of prying into the shadows of his past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the legends surrounding the de Vincents may not be myths at all. But if she’s to discover the truth, she must follow them straight into the arms of the man she can’t resist—the handsome devil himself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bridget Jones’s Diary&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Americanah&lt;/i&gt; in this disarmingly honest, boldly political, and truly inclusive novel that will speak to anyone who has gone looking for love and found something very different in its place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queenie Jenkins is a 25-year-old Jamaican British woman living in London, straddling two cultures and slotting neatly into neither. She works at a national newspaper, where she’s constantly forced to compare herself to her white middle class peers. After a messy break up from her long-term white boyfriend, Queenie seeks comfort in all the wrong places…including several hazardous men who do a good job of occupying brain space and a bad job of affirming self-worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her..</description>

  <description>At the news of her mother's death, Natalie Tan returns home. The two women hadn't spoken since Natalie left in anger seven years ago, when her mother refused to support her chosen career as a chef. Natalie is shocked to discover the vibrant neighborhood of San Francisco's Chinatown that she remembers from her childhood is fading, with businesses failing and families moving out. She's even more surprised to learn she has inherited her grandmother's restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neighborhood seer reads the restaurant's fortune in the leaves: Natalie must cook three recipes from her grandmother's cookbook to aid her struggling neighbors before the restaurant will succeed. Unfortunately, Natalie has no desire to help them try to turn things around--she resents the local shopkeepers for leaving her alone to take care of her agoraphobic mother when she was growing up. But with the support of a surprising new friend and a budding romance, Natalie starts to realize that maybe her neighbors really have been there for her all along.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes lady luck shakes your hand, and sometimes she smacks your face. Sometimes she does both on the same day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago I met the most amazing girl in the world. We were both down on our luck. Then I got that call—the one that tells you to get your buns on a plane to go meet your destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the girl was left behind. I didn’t have her phone number, and she didn’t know my real name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I became a professional hockey player, she became a superstar, with platinum records and legions of fans. And a slick, music producer boyfriend who treated her badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fate wasn’t done with us yet. When Delilah turns up at a hockey game, I can’t resist making contact. The internet swoons when I ask her out on a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not remember me. But her jerkface ex does. He’ll do anything to keep us apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing athletes never give up. This time I’m playing for keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information at &lt;a href="https://www.sarinabowen.com/brooklynbruisers" rel="nofollow"&gt;SarinaBowen.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>9 hours, 24 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Alafair Burke - New York Times best-selling author of the runaway hit The Wife - comes another twisty tale of domestic noir. When a prominent Manhattan lawyer is murdered, two estranged sisters - one the dead man’s widow, the other his ex - must set aside mistrust and old resentments...but can they escape their past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Chloe was the younger of the two Taylor sisters, she always seemed to be in charge. She was the honor-roll student with big dreams and an even bigger work ethic. Nicky was always restless...and more than a little reckless - the opposite of her ambitious little sister. She floated from job to job and man to man and stayed close to home in Cleveland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while, it seemed like both sisters had found happiness. Chloe earned a scholarship to an Ivy League school and moved to New York City, where she landed a coveted publishing job. Nicky married promising young attorney Adam Macintosh and gave birth to a baby boy they named Ethan. The Taylor sisters became virtual strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, more than 15 years later, their lives are drastically different - and Chloe is married to Adam. When he’s murdered by an intruder at the couple’s East Hampton beach house, Chloe reluctantly allows her teenaged stepson’s biological mother - her estranged sister, Nicky - back into her life. But when the police begin to treat Ethan as a suspect in his father’s death, the two sisters are forced to unite...and to confront the truth behind family secrets they have tried to bury in the past.</description>

  <description>The Wright family is in ruins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sue Ellen Wright has what she thinks is a close-to-perfect life. A terrific job as a Classics professor, a loving husband, and a son who is just about to safely leave the nest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then disaster strikes. She learns that her husband is cheating, and that her son has made a complete mess of his life. So, when the opportunity to take her family to a Greek island for a month presents itself, she jumps at the chance. This sunlit Aegean paradise, with its mountains and beaches is, after all, where she first fell in love with both a man and with an ancient culture. Perhaps Sue Ellen’s past will provide the key to her and her family’s salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his signature style of biting wit, hilarious characters, and deep emotion, Grant Ginder’s Honestly, We Meant Well is a funny, brilliant novel proving that with family, drama always comes with comedy.</description>

  <description>9 hours, 3 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six, but nobody knows the reason behind their split at the absolute height of their popularity . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast List:&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Jones, read by Jennifer Beals &lt;br /&gt;Billy Dunne, read by Pablo Schreiber&lt;br /&gt;Graham Dunne, read by Benjamin Bratt&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Loving, read by Fred Berman&lt;br /&gt;Warren Rhodes, read by Ari Fliakos&lt;br /&gt;Karen Karen, read by Judy Greer&lt;br /&gt;Camila Dunne, read by January LaVoy&lt;br /&gt;Simone Jackson, read by Robinne Lee&lt;br /&gt;Narrator / Author, read by Julia Whelan&lt;br /&gt;Jim Blades, read by Jonathan Davis&lt;br /&gt;Rod Reyes, read by Henry Leyva&lt;br /&gt;Artie Snyder, read by Oliver Wyman&lt;br /&gt;Elaine Chang, read by Nancy Wu&lt;br /&gt;Freddie Mendoza, read by P.J.

  <description>All Dr. Sloan Copeland needed was someone to watch her kids. What she found was the man of her dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a nasty divorce and a thousand mile move, Dr. Sloan Copeland and her twin daughters are finally getting the hang of their new life in Los Angeles. When their live-in nanny bails with no warning, Sloan is left scrambling to find a competent caretaker to wrangle her smart, sensitive girls. Nothing less will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Rafe Whitcomb. He's all of those things, not to mention good-natured and one heck of a whiz in the kitchen. He's also tall, and handsome, and bearded, and ripped, and tatted, wrist to neck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't take long for the Copelands to invite Rafe into their home. Just as quickly, both Sloan and Rafe find themselves succumbing to a heady mutual attraction, neither of them wants to deny. With every minute they spend under the same roof, this working mom can't help but wonder if Rafe can handle all her needs...</description>

  <description>Mona Lisa St. James made a deathbed promise that she would do anything to save her mother's art gallery. Unfortunately, not only is The Red painted red, but it's in the red. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as she realizes she has no choice but to sell it, a mysterious man comes in after closing time and makes her an offer: He will save The Red if she agrees to submit to him for the period of one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man is handsome, English, and terribly tempting...but surely her mother didn't mean for Mona to sell herself to a stranger. Then again, she did promise to do anything to save The Red...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Red is a standalone novel of erotic fantasy from Tiffany Reisz, international bestselling author of The Bourbon Thief and the Original Sinners series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bridget Jones’s Diary&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Americanah&lt;/i&gt; in this disarmingly honest, boldly political, and truly inclusive novel that will speak to anyone who has gone looking for love and found something very different in its place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queenie Jenkins is a 25-year-old Jamaican British woman living in London, straddling two cultures and slotting neatly into neither. She works at a national newspaper, where she’s constantly forced to compare herself to her white middle class peers. After a messy break up from her long-term white boyfriend, Queenie seeks comfort in all the wrong places…including several hazardous men who do a good job of occupying brain space and a bad job of affirming self-worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With “fresh and honest” (Jojo Moyes) prose, &lt;i&gt;Queenie&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkably relatable exploration of what it means to be a modern woman searching for meaning in today’s world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tiffy and Leon share an apartment. Tiffy and Leon have never met.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bad breakup, Tiffy Moore needs a place to live. Fast. And cheap. But the apartments in her budget have her wondering if astonishingly colored mold on the walls counts as art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperation makes her open minded, so she answers an ad for a flatshare. Leon, a night shift worker, will take the apartment during the day, and Tiffy can have it nights and weekends. He’ll only ever be there when she’s at the office. In fact, they’ll never even have to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiffy and Leon start writing each other notes – first about what day is garbage day, and politely establishing what leftovers are up for grabs, and the evergreen question of whether the toilet seat should stay up or down. Even though they are opposites, they soon become friends. And then maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But falling in love with your roommate is probably a terrible idea…especially if you've never met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if your roommate is your soul mate? A joyful, quirky romantic comedy, Beth O'Leary's &lt;i&gt;The Flatshare &lt;/i&gt;is a feel-good novel about finding love in the most unexpected of ways.</description>

  <description>Charlotte Gorman loves her job as an elementary school librarian, and is content to experience life through the pages of her books. Which couldn’t be more opposite from her identical twin sister. Ginny, an Instagram-famous beauty queen, has been chasing a crown since she was old enough to say "world peace," and she’s not giving up until she wins Miss American Treasure. But when Ginny has a face-altering allergic reaction the night before competition, Charlotte suddenly finds herself in a switcheroo the twins haven’t successfully pulled off in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woefully unprepared for the glittery world of hair extensions, false eyelashes, and push-up bras, Charlotte realizes, after walking a mile in her twin's sky-high stilettos, there might be more to the pageant circuit than just a sparkly crown . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Wedding from Hell, Part 3: Exclusive Excerpt of Consumed&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; is the final part of J.R. Ward’s &lt;i&gt;The Wedding From Hell&lt;/i&gt; ebook serialization. Don’t miss this exclusive teaser to her upcoming standalone suspense, &lt;i&gt;Consumed&lt;/i&gt; (available in October 2018). See why “&lt;i&gt;Consumed &lt;/i&gt;takes it to a whole new level” (Lisa Gardner, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the creator of the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Black Dagger Brotherhood series, get ready for a new band of brothers. And a firestorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anne Ashburn is a woman consumed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By her bitter family legacy, by her scorched career as a firefighter, by her obsession with department bad-boy Danny McGuire, and by a new case that pits her against a fiery killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Strong-willed Anne was fearless and loved the thrill of fighting fires, pushing herself to be the best. But when one risky decision at a warehouse blaze changes her life forever, Anne must reinvent not only her job, but her whole self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Shattered and demoralized, Anne finds her new career as an arson investigator a pale substitute for the adrenaline-fueled life she left behind. She doesn't believe she will ever feel that same all-consuming passion for her job again—until she encounters a string of suspicious fires setting her beloved city ablaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Danny McGuire is a premiere fireman, best in the commonwealth, but in the midst of a personal meltdown. Danny is taking risks like never before and seems to have a death wish until he teams up with Anne to find the fire starter. But Danny may be more than a distraction, and as Anne narrows in on her target, the arsonist begins to target her.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A brand new ebook-only story from bestselling author J. R. Ward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you ready for The Wedding From Hell?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a classic recipe for disaster: Take one bridesmaid who thinks pink is the root of all evil. Mix with a best man who's hotter than a four-alarm fire. Add in their explosive sexual attraction, a nightmare bridezilla, two catfights, and an emergency call, and you have the wedding from hell! Come get to know Anne and Danny, the hero and heroine of Consumed, and see their relationship go from friends with innuendo to holy-&amp;amp;*#-did-that-just-happen?! Is this the start of something good for them? Or just an erotic one-night stand that rocks them both but is never to be repeated? Only their hearts know the answer to that, much as their minds might disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Reading,&lt;br /&gt;J.R. Ward&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Author Tiffany Reisz returns to the world of The Red with an imaginative sequel full of lust and magic, and the dangers unleashed when the two are combined… &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day of Lia’s university graduation party, her parents—wealthy art collectors with friends in high places—gift her a beautiful wine cup, a rare artifact decorated with roses. It’s a stunning gift, and one that August Bowman, a friend of her parents and a guest at Lia’s party, also has his eye on. The cup, August tells her, is known as the Rose &lt;i&gt;kylix&lt;/i&gt;, and it’s no ordinary cup. It was used in the temple ceremonies of Eros, Greek god of erotic love, and has the power to bring the most intimate sexual fantasies to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lia is skeptical of August’s claims of the cup’s mythology and magic—after all, he’s a collector himself, and she suspects he just wants to get his hands on this impressive piece of art. So he dares her to try it for herself, and when Lia drinks from the Rose &lt;i&gt;kylix&lt;/i&gt; she is suddenly immersed in an erotic myth so vivid it seems real—as though she’s living out the most sensual fantasy with August by her side…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing the true power of this ancient and dangerous relic, Lia is even more wary of giving it up, though August insists it is only safe with him. He’s willing to pay the full value of the cup, but Lia has another type of trade in mind. One that finds them more tangled up in each other—and in fantasy—than either was prepared for.</description>

      <![CDATA[<i>ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley</i><br /><br />Adored it. Tiffany Reisz weaves a lush and entrancing tale mixing mythology, erotica and magical realism. Be prepared to be swept away by Lia and August's relationship. If The Rose doesn't inspire you to revisit Greek mythology, I don't know what will!]]>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt;’s “Books Coming Out This Summer That You Need to Seriously Read” * One of &lt;i&gt;Bustle&lt;/i&gt;’s “New Romance Novels to Make Your Spring Reading Even Dreamier Than You Imagined” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A charming romantic comedy about three sisters who are struggling to keep the family wedding planning business afloat—all the while trying to write their own happily-ever-afters in the process. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All’s fair in love and business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The de la Rosa family and their wedding planning business have been creating happily ever afters in the Washington, DC area for years, making even the most difficult bride’s day a fairytale. But when their parents announce their retirement, the sisters—Marisol, Janelyn, and Pearl—are determined to take over the business themselves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the sisters quickly discover that the wedding business isn’t all rings and roses. There are brides whose moods can change at the drop of a hat; grooms who want to control every part of the process; and couples who argue until their big day. As emotions run high, the de la Rosa sisters quickly realize one thing: even when disaster strikes—whether it’s a wardrobe malfunction or a snowmageddon in the middle of a spring wedding—they’ll always have each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of the witty and engaging novels of Amy E. Reichert and Susan Mallery, &lt;i&gt;The Key to Happily Ever After&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh romantic comedy that celebrates the crucial and profound power of sisterhood.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to rise again…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hilarious new heartbreaker from Mhairi McFarlane!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there’s one thing worse than being fired from the grottiest restaurant in town, it’s coming home early to find your boyfriend in bed with someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from the indignity of a double dumping on the same day, Georgina snatches at the next job that she’s offered – barmaid in a newly opened pub, which just so happens to run by the boy she fell in love with at school: Lucas McCarthy. And whereas Georgina (voted Most Likely to Succeed in her school yearbook) has done nothing but dead-end jobs in the last twelve years, Lucas has not only grown into a broodingly handsome man, but also has turned into an actual grown-up with a business and a dog along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting Lucas again not only throws Georgina’s rackety present into sharp relief, but also brings a dark secret from her past bubbling to the surface. Only she knows the truth about what happened on the last day of school, and why she’s allowed it to chase her all these years…</description>

  <description>Zandy Lynch never planned on going to grad school a virgin. So when her professor father finds her a job abroad as a research assistant the summer before she starts her master’s program, she sees her chance. She’s got one night in London to lose her V-card to a Mr. Darcy lookalike before she has to join some ancient professor in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver Graeme is not looking forward to having some American co-ed hovering around while he’s trying to work, but he owes her father the favor, and besides, his office is an untidy mess of uncatalogued research. He needs the help. Still, he decides to take the edge off his frustration while visiting a colleague in London, and winds up having the sexiest, sweetest night of his life with a stranger, who vanishes in the morning without a trace…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Zandy’s shock when she arrives at Professor Graeme’s house a day later, the door isn’t opened by a fussy old scholar, but by the wild, passionate man she met in London. Cold and reserved by day, Oliver is ferociously greedy with her at night, and it’s not long before Zandy finds herself falling for both versions of him—the aloof professor and the generous, rough lover. The trouble is that summer only lasts so long, and Zandy already has a plane ticket waiting to take her home…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Misadventures is a romantic series of spicy standalone novels, each written or co-written by some of the best names in romance. The stories are scandalous, refreshing, and, of course, incredibly sexy. They’re the perfect bedside read, a ‘quick blush’ for the reader who loves a page-turning romance.</description>

  <description>A STANDALONE second chance, enemies-to-lovers romance set in the cutthroat world of sports management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They're two sharks in a fish tank...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;JARED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a dollar for every time Banner Morales made my heart skip a beat...&lt;br /&gt;The heart everyone assumes is frozen over.&lt;br /&gt;Her anger is... arousing.&lt;br /&gt;Every glare from those fire-spitting eyes, every time she grits her teeth, gets me... well, you know.&lt;br /&gt;If I had a dollar for every time she's put me in my place, I'd be an even richer man.&lt;br /&gt;I'm a successful sports agent because I assume "no" means you'll think about it.&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure what you meant to say is "Coming right up.”&lt;br /&gt;They say even rich men don't always get what they want, but those men don't know how to play the game. The trick is to keep them guessing.&lt;br /&gt;Take Banner. She assumes she's winning, but this game? &lt;br /&gt;She doesn't even know how to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BANNER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a dollar for every time Jared Foster broke my heart, I’d have exactly one dollar.&lt;br /&gt;One night. One epic fail. One dollar... and I'm out.&lt;br /&gt;I've moved on.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve found success in a field ruled by men. &lt;br /&gt;Anything they can do, I have done better.&lt;br /&gt;They can keep the field while I call the shots, blocking them when I have to.&lt;br /&gt;And Jared has the nerve to think he gets a second chance?&lt;br /&gt;Boy, please. Go sit down. Have &lt;i&gt;several&lt;/i&gt; seats.&lt;br /&gt;I'll just be over here ignoring the man carved from my fantasies with a lust-tipped chisel.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I didn't say the struggle wasn't real.&lt;br /&gt;But I've got that one dollar, and Jared won't have me.</description>

  <description>The new must-read standalone crime thriller from the author of &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Widow&lt;/i&gt;, and the Richard &amp;amp; Judy No. 1 bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Child&lt;/i&gt; - featuring unforgettable journalist, Kate Waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The police belonged to another world – the world they saw on the television or in the papers. Not theirs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two eighteen-year-old girls go missing on their gap year in Thailand, their families are thrust into the international spotlight: desperate, bereft and frantic with worry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Kate Waters always does everything she can to be first to the story, first with the exclusive, first to discover the truth – and this time is no exception. But she can’t help but think of her own son, who she hasn’t seen in two years since he left home to go traveling. This time it’s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the case of the missing girls unfolds, they will all find that even this far away, danger can lie closer to home than you might think . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Christina Lauren and Lauren Layne comes a delightfully sassy and sexy romance about a campaign manager who reluctantly works with the local Lothario to help revamp his image for the upcoming mayoral elections, only to discover that he’s hiding something that can turn both their lives upside down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s a campaign manager’s worst nightmare? A smooth-talking charmer who’s never met a scandal that he didn’t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emmanuelle Peroni’s father—and mayor of her town—asks her to help rehab Cooper Endicott’s image, she’s horrified. Cooper drives her crazy in every way possible. But he’s also her father’s protégé, and she can’t say no to him without him finding out the reason why: Cooper and her have a messy past. So Emmanuelle reluctantly launches her father’s grand plan to get this Casanova someone to settle down with and help him lose his lothario reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooper Endicott wanted to run for Mayor, but he never wanted the drama that went with it. Now that he’s on the political hamster wheel, the other candidates are digging up everything from his past. Even though he’s doing all the right things, his colorful love life is the sticking point for many of the conservative voters. He wants to win, badly, and he knows that if he wants any chance of getting a vote from the female population, he needs to change his image. The only problem? He might just be falling in love with the one person he promised not to pursue: the Mayor’s off-limits daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect blend of humor and heart, &lt;i&gt;On the Corner of Love and Hate&lt;/i&gt; is the first in a new series from &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nina Bocci.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Sophie Kinsella, an irresistible story of love and empowerment about a young woman with a complicated family, a handsome man who might be “the one,” and an IOU that changes everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixie Farr has always lived by her father’s motto: “Family first.” But since her dad passed away, leaving his charming housewares store in the hands of his wife and children, Fixie spends all her time picking up the slack from her siblings instead of striking out on her own. The way Fixie sees it, if she doesn’t take care of her father’s legacy, who will? It’s simply not in her nature to say no to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a handsome stranger in a coffee shop asks her to watch his laptop for a moment, Fixie not only agrees—she ends up saving it from certain disaster. Turns out the computer’s owner is an investment manager. To thank Fixie for her quick thinking, Sebastian scribbles an IOU on a coffee sleeve and attaches his business card. But Fixie laughs it off—she’d never actually claim an IOU from a stranger. Would she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Fixie’s childhood crush, Ryan, comes back into her life and his lack of a profession pushes all of Fixie’s buttons. She wants nothing for herself—but she’d love Seb to give Ryan a job. And Seb agrees, until the tables are turned once more and a new series of IOUs between Seb and Fixie—from small favors to life-changing moments—ensues. Soon Fixie, Ms. Fixit for everyone else, is torn between her family and the life she really wants. Does she have the courage to take a stand? Will she finally grab the life, and love, she really wants?</description>

  <description>In a small town in Maine, recently widowed Eveleth "Evvie" Drake rarely leaves her house. Everyone in town, including her best friend, Andy, thinks grief keeps her locked inside, and she doesn't correct them. In New York, Dean Tenney, former major-league pitcher and Andy's childhood friend, is struggling with a case of the "yips": he can't throw straight anymore, and he can't figure out why. An invitation from Andy to stay in Maine for a few months seems like the perfect chance to hit the reset button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dean moves into an apartment at the back of Evvie's house, the two make a deal: Dean won't ask about Evvie's late husband, and Evvie won't ask about Dean's baseball career. Rules, though, have a funny way of being broken--and what starts as an unexpected friendship soon turns into something more. But before they can find out what might lie ahead, they'll have to wrestle a few demons: the bonds they've broken, the plans they've changed, and the secrets they've kept. They'll need a lot of help, but in life, as in baseball, there's always a chance--right up until the last out.</description>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alisha Rai returns with the first book in her sizzling new &lt;i&gt;Modern Love&lt;/i&gt; series, in which two rival dating app creators find themselves at odds in the boardroom but in sync in the bedroom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhiannon Hunter may have revolutionized romance in the digital world, but in real life she only swipes right on her career—and the occasional hookup. The cynical dating app creator controls her love life with a few key rules: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nude pics are by invitation only &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If someone stands you up, block them with extreme prejudice &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Protect your heart &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only there aren't any rules to govern her attraction to her newest match, former pro-football player Samson Lima. The sexy and seemingly sweet hunk woos her one magical night... and disappears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhi thought she'd buried her hurt over Samson ghosting her, until he suddenly surfaces months later, still big, still beautiful—and in league with a business rival. He says he won't fumble their second chance, but she's wary. A temporary physical partnership is one thing, but a merger of hearts? Surely that’s too high a risk…</description>

  <description>Can a romcom-obssessed romantic finally experience the meet-cute she always dreamed of or will reality never compare to fiction, in this charming debut adult novel from Kerry Winfrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Cassidy dreams of being the next Nora Ephron. She spends her days writing screenplays, rewatching Sleepless in Seattle, and waiting for her movie-perfect meet-cute. If she could just find her own Tom Hanks—a man who’s sweet, sensitive, and possibly owns a houseboat—her problems would disappear and her life would be perfect. But Tom Hanks is nowhere in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a movie starts filming in her neighborhood and Annie gets a job on set, it seems like a sign. Then Annie meets the lead actor, Drew Danforth, a cocky prankster who couldn’t be less like Tom Hanks if he tried. Their meet-cute is more of a meet-fail, but soon Annie finds herself sharing some classic rom-com moments with Drew. Her Tom Hanks can’t be an actor who’s leaving town in a matter of days...can he?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Crush: a strong and often short-lived infatuation, particularly for someone beyond your reach…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darcy Barrett has undertaken a global survey of men. She’s travelled the world, and can categorically say that no one measures up to Tom Valeska, whose only flaw is that Darcy’s twin brother Jamie saw him first and claimed him forever as his best friend. Despite Darcy’s best efforts, Tom’s off limits and loyal to her brother, 99%. That’s the problem with finding her dream man at age eight and peaking in her photography career at age twenty—ever since, she’s had to learn to settle for good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Darcy and Jamie inherit a tumble-down cottage from their grandmother, they’re left with strict instructions to bring it back to its former glory and sell the property. Darcy plans to be in an aisle seat halfway across the ocean as soon as the renovations start, but before she can cut and run, she finds a familiar face on her porch: house-flipper extraordinaire Tom’s arrived, he’s bearing power tools, and he’s single for the first time in almost a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Darcy’s considering sticking around to make sure her twin doesn’t ruin the cottage’s inherent magic with his penchant for grey and chrome. She’s definitely not staying because of her new business partner’s tight t-shirts, or that perfect face that's inspiring her to pick up her camera again. Soon sparks are flying—and it’s not the faulty wiring. It turns out one percent of Tom’s heart might not be enough for Darcy anymore. This time around, she’s switching things up. She’s going to make Tom Valeska 99 percent hers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A collection of 130 easy, flavor-forward recipes from beloved chef Yotam Ottolenghi.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Ottolenghi Simple&lt;/i&gt;, powerhouse author and chef Yotam Ottolenghi presents 130 streamlined recipes packed with his signature Middle Eastern-inspired flavors. Each dish can be made in 30 minutes or less, with 10 or fewer ingredients, in a single pot, using pantry staples, or prepared ahead of time for brilliantly, deliciously simple meals. Brunch gets a make-over with Braised Eggs with Leeks and Za'atar; Cauliflower, Pomegranate, and Pistachio Salad refreshes the side-dish rotation; Lamb and Feta Meatballs bring ease to the weeknight table; and every sweet tooth is sure to be satisfied by the spectacular Fig and Thyme Clafoutis. With more than 130 photographs, this is elemental Ottolenghi for everyone.</description>

  <description>Now that her cousin has tied the knot, Iris Chin—structural engineer, party girl, and queen of kitchen disasters—is the last single grandchild. Her mother and grandmother are desperate to play matchmaker, though Iris doesn’t understand why. They had miserable marriages, and she doesn’t want to be like them. She enjoys her independence, thank you very much. One-night stands are more her style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, she soon discovers that she’s working on a project with her latest one-night stand, Alex Kwong, a construction supervisor. She’s determined to stay professional on the construction site, but things get off to a bad start when Alex lets slip to a co-worker that they slept together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, Iris is now living with her grandmother, who keeps stealthily setting her up on dates and sticking her nose where it doesn’t belong, and her mother is just as bad. But more than anything, it’s her unwanted feelings for Alex that are derailing her plans to have an exciting single life…</description>

  <description>Natalie Chin-Williams might be a cranky professor of climatology who thinks the world is doomed, but she believes in lasting love…just not for herself. She has a long history of failed relationships, plus the men she dates inevitably want children and she doesn’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now thirty-six and single, Natalie expects endless comments about her love life when she attends her baby sister's wedding. Worse, weddings are always drama-filled disasters in her family. She needs emotional support to get through the weekend, so she enlists the help of her friend Connor Douglas, the dependable family doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wedding reception goes south when a drunk aunt announces a family secret that sends Natalie reeling and shakes her faith in love. Luckily, she has her long-time friend to lean on—a man she somehow ends up kissing. But there’s no way this could turn into anything lasting, is there? That’s impossible for her, especially now…</description>

  <description>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

But she can't help but think of her own son, whom she hasn't seen in two years, since he left home to go travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the case of the missing girls unfolds, they will all find that even this far away, danger can lie closer to home than you might think...</description>

  <description>Kristen Petersen doesn't do drama, will fight to the death for her friends, and has no room in her life for guys who just don't get her. She's also keeping a big secret: facing a medically necessary procedure that will make it impossible for her to have children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Planning her best friend's wedding is bittersweet for Kristen—especially when she meets the best man, Josh Copeland. He's funny, sexy, never offended by her mile-wide streak of sarcasm, and always one chicken enchilada ahead of her hangry. Even her dog, Stuntman Mike, adores him. The only catch: Josh wants a big family someday. Kristen knows he'd be better off with someone else, but as their attraction grows, it's harder and harder to keep him at arm's length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friend Zone&lt;/i&gt; will have you laughing one moment and grabbing for tissues the next as it tackles the realities of infertility and loss with wit, heart, and a lot of sass.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What's a girl to do when a man who's countless shades of wrong feels oh-so-right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ambitious book editor Asha Tate is a hopeless romantic. Despite her mediocre track record with men, she believes in swooning, sighing, and the everlasting love of true soul mates. Sure, sex is okay, but she’s not someone who’s ever been driven by her animal urges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Asha stumbles upon the scorching hot Instagram feed of someone calling himself Professor Feelgood, she falls in lust for the first time. Not only is she left panting over the professor’s insane body, but his angst-filled poetry about losing his one true love speaks straight to her soul.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperately in need of a bestseller for her struggling publishing company, Asha knows the professor’s potential to sell to his millions of loyal followers could be the lifeline her bosses need. However, the ink is barely dry on a book deal before she realizes she’s made a terrible mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In real life, the man behind the persona is intense and infuriating, and sparks fly between the pair when ghosts from their shared past take them down paths that have previously been ripped up and paved over.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asha tells herself she doesn't want him. She swears up and down that she doesn't need him. And when their connection gets too powerful to ignore, she tries to convince herself she doesn’t love him. But repeating lies, even those you truly want to believe, will never make them true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A compelling tale of love, hate, and reluctant soul mates, from the international bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bad Romeo&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;Broken Juliet.</description>

  <description>Talk about an embarrassing introduction. On her first day of law school, Kailyn ran - quite literally - into the actor she crushed on as a teenager, ending with him sprawled on top of her. Mortified to discover &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Daxton Hughes was also a student in her class, her embarrassment over their meet-cute quickly turned into a friendship she never expected. Of course, she never saw his betrayal coming either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, eight years later, Dax is in her office asking for legal advice. Despite her anger, Kailyn can't help feeling sorry for the devastated man who just became sole guardian to his thirteen-year-old sister. But when her boss gets wind of Kailyn's new celebrity client, there's even more at stake than Dax's custody issues: if she gets Dax to work at their firm, she'll be promoted to partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more time Kailyn spends with Dax and his sister, the more she starts to feel like a family, and the more she realizes the chemistry they had all those years ago is as fresh as ever. But will they be able to forgive the mistakes of the past, or will one betrayal lead to another?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Everyone knows the girl is off limits. But it's so good to be bad. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this girl...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heidi and I have been trading hungry looks all year, and everything she does makes me smile. But I don't do girlfriends, and I certainly can't get involved with the league commissioner's daughter. I need shots on goal, not a hookup and a widely misunderstood paparazzi photo.&lt;br /&gt;Can I resist her, though? The way she teases me should be a game penalty for interference with my libido.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's this guy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason wants me, but he won't admit it. That man looks at me the way a hockey player eyes the lunch buffet after practice--and I love it. &lt;br /&gt;But when victory is finally within my grasp, I blow it and humiliate myself. Even then I can't even avoid him--as the team intern, I'm in constant view of his hard body and cocky smile. &lt;br /&gt;I need another chance. Jason Castro is about to learn the true meaning of an overnight sensation.</description>

  <description>Skye Copeland is on paid leave from her broadcasting job after accidentally drawing a pecker on the traffic map. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let that sink in. Like it’s her fault the traffic pattern that day created a perfect schlong? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Skye isn’t laughing. She needs this job. And that’s the only reason she’s agreed to chase down a story in her least favorite place—that hell on earth known as Vermont. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A quick trip. In and out. Much like - never mind. Skye can sneak into the town that once tried to break her, get the story and get back into the good graces of her producer. Easy peasy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except things go sideways even as she sets foot over the county line. Her step-sister is on the run from a violent drug dealer. And the cop on the case is none other than Benito Rossi, the man who broke her teenage heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His dark brown eyes still tear her apart. And even as she steels herself to finally tell him off after twelve years, the old fireworks are still there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things are about to go boom.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Get ready for your next favorite romantic comedy, THE REAL DEAL!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April Hamilton wants you to know she hasn't been on Craigslist since that time she sold her futon after college. She doesn't even spend &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; much time online. And even if she did, she would not be looking up personal ads. But going home alone for her family's summer reunion is an invitation for every single relative to butt into her personal life. She simply can't handle another blind date with the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker from her hometown. So when she finds the Craigslist ad for a boyfriend-for-hire, she's ready to pay to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Heading Home and Need a Buffer? I'm the REAL DEAL.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Banks has been running from the past for years. He's &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;close to finally settling all his debts, and one more job as a boyfriend-for-hire will do the trick. He's no gigolo. &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt;. He's something of an actor, and he knows how to slip into any role, including pretending to be April's new beau -- the bad boy with the heart of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it means sleeping in close quarters in that tiny little bed in her parents' inn. Even if it means spinning tales of a romance that starts to feel all too true. What neither one of them counts on is that amid the egg toss, the arm wrestling, and a fierce game of Lawn Twister that has them tangled up together, they might be feeling the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She only wanted to show her family once and for all that she had no need to settle down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn't expect to have the time of his life at her parent's home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn't plan on loving every single second of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can a masterful game of pretend result in true love?</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This sweet, savory, and satisfying novel—perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Coincidence of Coconut Cake&lt;/i&gt; by Amy Reichert—follows a smart, ambitious woman making her way in the male-dominated world of beer brewing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Williams is used to being the only woman in a room full of men, but she isn’t used to being instantly drawn to someone she’s in business with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After working long hours brewing in her garage, Piper is determined to prove herself—and to ignore the chemistry she has with Blake Reed, owner of Minnesota’s newest gastropub who is going to stock four of her brews. She wants her craft beer to stand on its own merits and knows that the tight-knit male-dominated brewer community will assume the worst if she starts anything with one of her vendors. No way she’ll risk everything she’s invested in her budding business on a guy who might not stick—no matter how charmingly handsome and funny he is, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Blake has a conflict of his own—his haughty family wants him to ditch the gastropub and support his father’s political campaign. Well, that, and the fact that he knows Piper’s snark and sass is the perfect blend of crisp and refreshing for him. So Blake and Piper make a pact: she’ll go out with him if, and only if, two additional pubs start carrying her beer. Sticking to the pact proves harder than either of them expected—especially since the attraction is off the charts between quirky, independent Piper and smart, charming Blake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Piper gets a once-in-a-lifetime offer that could launch her company to the next level—and take her away from Blake. Are she and Blake just drunk in love, or do they have something real that’s worth risking her dreams for?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;One devoted modern girl + a meddlesome, traditional grandmother = a heartwarming multicultural romantic comedy about finding love where you least expect it&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raina Anand may have finally given in to family pressure and agreed to let her grandmother play matchmaker, but that doesn't mean she has to like it--or that she has to play by the rules. Nani always took Raina's side when she tried to push past the traditional expectations of their tight-knit Indian-immigrant community, but now she's ambushing Raina with a list of suitable bachelors. Is it too much to ask for a little space? Besides, what Nani doesn't know won't hurt her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Raina's life spirals into a parade of Nani-approved bachelors and disastrous blind dates, she must find a way out of this modern-day arranged-marriage trap without shattering her beloved grandmother's dreams.</description>

Because she ran, vanished, before I had a chance to explain.&lt;br /&gt;Before I had a chance to tell her the one thing that could’ve saved us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s back and I’m determined to make up for all the years we lost.&lt;br /&gt;Determined to win back the woman who’s always been mine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consequences be damned.</description>

  <description>John Okada was born in Seattle, Washington in 1923. He attended the University of Washington and Columbia University. He served in the US Army in World War II, wrote one novel and died of a heart attack at the age of 47. John Okada died in obscurity believing that Asian America had rejected his work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this work, Okada gives the perspective of a no-no boy, a Japanese-American man who would neither denounce his Japanese heritage nor fight for the U.S. Army during WWII. This novel takes place after the main character spent two years in a Japanese internment camp, and two years in prison after saying no when asked to join the U.S. Army. Okada's novel No-No Boy shows the internal and external struggles fought by Japanese-Americans in that time period, be they no-no boys or not.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A second chance doesn't guarantee a touchdown in this new contemporary romance from the author of &lt;i&gt;Intercepted&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single-mother Poppy Patterson moved across the country when she was sixteen and pregnant to find a new normal. After years of hard work, she's built a life she loves. It may include a job at a nightclub, weekend soccer games, and more stretch marks than she anticipated, but it's all hers, and nobody can take that away. Well, except for one person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TK Moore, the starting wide receiver for the Denver Mustangs, dreamt his entire life about being in the NFL. His world is football, parties, and women. Maybe at one point he thought his future would play out with his high school sweetheart by his side, but Poppy is long gone and he's moved on.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Poppy and TK cross paths in the most unlikely of places, emotions they've suppressed for years come rushing back. But with all the secrets they never told each other lying between them, they'll need more than a dating playbook to help them navigate their relationship.</description>

  <description>As CEO of Fong Investments, I’m a busy man. In fact, my family claims I’m an obsessive workaholic, and when they force me to take two weeks off, I have no idea what to do with myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While brooding over an espresso, I meet Courtney Kwan, a biomedical researcher who savors the little things in life. And, suddenly, an idea strikes me—I will pay this woman to teach me how to enjoy my vacation from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, I find myself doing crazy things like baking cookies, reading for pleasure, buying a phallic cactus, and falling in love. But Courtney is dealing with some serious issues of her own, and I fear that when I return to work, I won’t be able to give her what she needs, and I’ll lose her forever…</description>

  <description>In the last day of summer, Grace Fairchild, the beautiful young wife of real estate mogul Allister Calloway, vanished from the family’s lake house without a trace, leaving behind her seven-year old daughter, Charlie, and a slew of unanswered questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, seventeen-year-old Charlie still struggles with the dark legacy of her family name and the mystery surrounding her mother. Determined to finally let go of the past, she throws herself into life at Knollwood, the prestigious New Englandschool she attends. Charlie quickly becomes friends with Knollwood’s “it” crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie has also been tapped by the A’s—the school’s elite secret society well known for terrorizing the faculty, administration, and their enemies. To become a member of the A’s, Charlie must play The Game, a semester-long, diabolical high-stakes scavenger hunt that will jeopardize her friendships, her reputation, even her place at Knollwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the dark events of past and present converge, Charlie begins to fear that she may not survive the terrible truth about her family, her school, and her own life.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, &lt;b&gt;Rachael West&lt;/b&gt; chose not to move to Sydney with high-school sweetheart &lt;b&gt;Matthew&lt;/b&gt;. Instead she stayed on the family wheat farm, caring for her seriously ill mother and letting go of her dreams. Now, Matthew is marrying someone else. And Rachael is invited to the wedding, a lavish affair in Paris, courtesy of the flamboyant family of Matthew's fiancée - a once-in-a-lifetime celebration at someone else's expense in Europe's most romantic city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is utterly unprepared for what the week brings. Friendships will be upended, secrets will be revealed - and on the eve of the wedding, Rachael is faced with an impossible dilemma: should she give up on the promise of love, or destroy another woman's life for a chance at happiness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you enjoy reading Rachael Treasure and Rachael Johns, you'll fall in love with this deliciously poignant story about family and friends, and love lost and found.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A series of chance encounters leads to a sizzling new romance from the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of the On Dublin Street series. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The universe is conspiring against Ava Breevort. As if flying back to Phoenix to bury a childhood friend wasn't hell enough, a cloud of volcanic ash traveling from overseas delayed her flight back home to Boston. Her last ditch attempt to salvage the trip was thwarted by an arrogant Scotsman, Caleb Scott, who steals a first class seat out from under her. Then over the course of their journey home, their antagonism somehow lands them in bed for the steamiest layover Ava's ever had. And that's all it was--until Caleb shows up on her doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When pure chance pulls Ava back into Caleb's orbit, he proposes they enjoy their physical connection while he's stranded in Boston. Ava agrees, knowing her heart's in no danger since a) she barely likes Caleb and b) his existence in her life is temporary. Not long thereafter Ava realizes she's made a terrible error because as it turns out Caleb Scott isn't quite so unlikeable after all. When his stay in Boston becomes permanent, Ava must decide whether to fight her feelings for him or give into them. But even if she does decide to risk her heart on Caleb, there is no guarantee her stubborn Scot will want to risk his heart on her....</description>

  <description>How hard would you fight for the one you love?&lt;br /&gt;Taryn Landry was there that awful night fourteen years ago when Long Acre changed from the name of a town to the title of a national tragedy. Everyone knows she lost her younger sister. No one knows it was her fault. Since then, psychology professor Taryn has dedicated her life's work to preventing something like that from ever happening again. Falling in love was never part of the plan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaw Miller has spent more than a decade dealing with the fallout of his brother's horrific actions. After losing everything―his chance at Olympic gold, his family, almost his sanity―he's changed his name, his look, and he's finally starting a new life. As long as he keeps a low profile and his identity secret, everything will be okay, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the world and everyone you know defines you by one catastrophic tragedy...&lt;br /&gt;How do you find your happy ending?</description>

  <description>Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions—like grief. And love. He thinks he’s defective. His family knows better—that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can’t turn it down, thinking this could be the break her family needs. Seducing Khai, however, doesn’t go as planned. Esme’s lessons in love seem to be working…but only on herself. She’s hopelessly smitten with a man who’s convinced he can never return her affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Esme’s time in the United States dwindling, Khai is forced to understand he’s been wrong all along. And there’s more than one way to love.</description>

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>I'm a pretty simple guy. When I'm not writing a science fiction novel, I'm watching a good movie or reading a book. Alone. I like my reclusive life. That is, until my only friend asks for a favor—pretend to be his baby sister's boyfriend on a couples' getaway. Her ex is going to be there and she needs me as a buffer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should have said no, but Naomi is bubbly, energetic, and beautiful. She also means everything to her brother. But now, our fake romance is starting to feel all too real, and I find myself stuck between the promise I made to my friend and risking my heart to the one woman who might actually get me…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes you fall for Mr. Right. And sometimes for Mr. Right Now… &lt;br /&gt;May&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did you hear the one about the girl who walks into a bar and catches her live-in lover kissing someone else? No? You’re the only one in town who missed it. &lt;br /&gt;Luckily Alec is there to wrap me up in strong arms and carry me out the door before things get too ugly. And that’s not all Alec is good at. Our unexpected chemistry makes him the perfect rebound guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alec&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should know better than to hook up with my rival’s little sister, but the fiery look in May’s eyes really turns my crank. She needs cheering up, and I’m just the guy for the job. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not like I’ll fall in love. Not even after a string of scorching hot trysts, and the realization that we’re good at the same things: wild nights and familial disappointment. I don’t do love, never have, never will. So this is the perfect arrangement, for both of us. &lt;br /&gt;Nobody would approve, but nobody has to know…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;We’ve been waiting for an hour.&lt;/i&gt; That’s what Audrey says. She states it with a little bit of an edge, her words just bordering on cursive. That’s the thing I think first. Not: Audrey Hepburn is at my birthday dinner, but Audrey Hepburn is annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point or another, we’ve all been asked to name five people, living or dead, with whom we’d like to have dinner. Why do we choose the people we do? And what if that dinner was to actually happen? These are the questions Rebecca Serle contends within her utterly captivating novel, &lt;i&gt;The Dinner List&lt;/i&gt;, a story imbued with the same delightful magical realism as &lt;i&gt;One Day,&lt;/i&gt; and the life-changing romance of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sabrina arrives at her thirtieth birthday dinner she finds at the table not just her best friend, but also three significant people from her past, and well, Audrey Hepburn. As the appetizers are served, wine poured, and dinner table conversation begins, it becomes clear that there’s a reason these six people have been gathered together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicious but never indulgent, sweet with just the right amount of bitter, &lt;i&gt;The Dinner List&lt;/i&gt; is a romance for our times. Bon appetit.</description>

  <description>Set amidst the breathtaking beauty of Oxford, this sparkling debut novel tells the unforgettable story about a determined young woman eager to make her mark in the world and the handsome man who introduces her to an incredible love that will irrevocably alter her future—perfect for fans of JoJo Moyes and Nicholas Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Ella Durran has had the same plan for her life since she was thirteen: Study at Oxford. At 24, she’s finally made it to England on a Rhodes Scholarship when she’s offered an unbelievable position in a rising political star’s presidential campaign. With the promise that she’ll work remotely and return to DC at the end of her Oxford year, she’s free to enjoy her Once in a Lifetime Experience. That is until a smart-mouthed local who is too quick with his tongue and his car ruins her shirt and her first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella discovers that her English literature course will be taught by none other than that same local, Jamie Davenport, she thinks for the first time that Oxford might not be all she’s envisioned. But a late-night drink reveals a connection she wasn’t anticipating finding and what begins as a casual fling soon develops into something much more when Ella learns Jamie has a life-changing secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, Ella is faced with a seemingly impossible decision: turn her back on the man she’s falling in love with to follow her political dreams or be there for him during a trial neither are truly prepared for. As the end of her year in Oxford rapidly approaches, Ella must decide if the dreams she’s always wanted are the same ones she’s now yearning for.</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>A serialized story from Sarina Bowen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 1016 people in the freshman class at Harkness College. I can’t be the only socially awkward nerd girl virgin among them. Right?&lt;br /&gt;It’s time I learn to talk to guys without blushing and stammering. So I take a confidence-building job at the student tutoring center. Twelve bucks an hour, plus human interaction. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;A fun-loving French Canadian hockey hunk, that’s what.&lt;br /&gt;When Pepe Gerault sits down at my tutoring table, my brain shuts off and my mouth goes right into hyperdrive. Even the sound of my name on his lips—Josephine—gives me a mini orgasm.&lt;br /&gt;I want to hand him my V-card. But all I manage to hand him is…my thesaurus. And my dignity. All seems lost, until I hatch a plan to get him alone…&lt;br /&gt;Get it only in Sarina's newsletter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: If you sign up after the serialization has already begun, your first email will contain links to all the existing chapters. You won't miss a thing!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mixing business and pleasure is a dangerous game...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tyrell Ransom, the new men's basketball coach, is ready to whip his team into shape and start winning some games. But when compromising photos of his soon-to-be-ex-wife with one of his players go viral, everything comes crashing down. With reporters thick on the ground, Ty and his team need some serious damage control―now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When public relations guru Millie Jensen arrives in her leopard-print cape to save the day, things really heat up... Soon they're going to have to work double time to keep their white-hot chemistry out of the headlines.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A lady does not smoke cheroot. She does not ride astride. She does not fence or attend duels. She does not fire a pistol, and she never gambles at a gentlemen's club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Calpurnia Hartwell has always followed the rules, rules that have left her unmarried—and more than a little unsatisfied. And so she's vowed to break the rules and live the life of pleasure she's been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to dance every dance, to steal a midnight kiss—to do those things, Callie will need a willing partner. Someone who knows everything about rule-breaking. Someone like Gabriel St. John, the Marquess of Ralston—charming and devastatingly handsome, his wicked reputation matched only by his sinful smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she's not careful, she'll break the most important rule of all—the one that says that pleasure-seekers should never fall hopelessly, desperately in love . . .</description>

  <description>Kate Snyder scored her first national championship in her undergrad days at Wolcott University, and now she’s a coaching legend. The last thing she wants is to work beside a washed-up coach escaping scandal, but the University hands her Danny McMillan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danny was hoping his transition at Wolcott University would go smoothly, but clashing with snarky Kate has made things difficult. Even as she finally lightens up towards him, a local reporter can’t get enough of their verbal fireworks on camera. What the cameras don’t know is that the sparks are even hotter behind the scenes…</description>

  <description>A powerful story of two people who spend years denying their scientifically-proven chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny spends her afternoons sitting outside a sandwich shop, surrounded by ghosts. Fourteen years ago, this shop was her childhood dance studio... Now she’s a suburban housewife, dreading the moment her son departs for MIT, leaving her with an impeccably decorated McMansion and a failing marriage. She had her chance at wild, stars-in-her-eyes happiness, but that was a lifetime ago. After The Kiss. Before The Decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kiss was soulful. Magical. Earth-shattering, And it was all for a free gift card. Asked to participate in a psych study that posed the question, “Can you have sexual chemistry without knowing what the other person looks like?” Penny agreed to be blindfolded, make polite conversation with a total stranger, and kiss him. She never expected The Kiss to change her life forever and introduce her to Gavin: tattooed, gorgeous, and spontaneous enough to ask her out seconds after the blindfolds came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a year, they danced between friendship and romance—until Penny made The Decision that forced them to settle for friendship. Now, fourteen years later, both of their lives are about to radically change—and it’s his turn to decide what will become of their once-in-a-lifetime connection."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Happiness for Beginners&lt;/i&gt; comes an unforgettable love story about finding joy even in the darkest of circumstances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Jacobsen has a bright future ahead of her: a fiancé she adores, her dream job, and the promise of a picture-perfect life just around the corner. Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in one tumultuous moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Margaret must figure out how to move forward on her own terms while facing long-held family secrets, devastating heartbreak, and the idea that love might find her in the last place she would ever expect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Walk Away&lt;/i&gt; is Katherine Center at her very best: an utterly charming, hopeful, and romantic novel that will capture reader’s hearts with every page.</description>

  <description>What does it mean to lose your roots—within your culture, within your family—and what happens when you find them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Chung was born severely premature, placed for adoption by her Korean parents, and raised by a white family in a sheltered Oregon town. From early childhood, she heard the story of her adoption as a comforting, prepackaged myth. She believed that her biological parents had made the ultimate sacrifice in the hopes of giving her a better life; that forever feeling slightly out of place was simply her fate as a transracial adoptee. But as she grew up—facing prejudice her adoptive family couldn’t see, finding her identity as an Asian American and a writer, becoming ever more curious about where she came from—she wondered if the story she’d been told was the whole truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With warmth, candor, and startling insight, Chung tells of her search for the people who gave her up, which coincided with the birth of her own child. &lt;i&gt;All You Can Ever Know&lt;/i&gt; is a profound, moving chronicle of surprising connections and the repercussions of unearthing painful family secrets—vital reading for anyone who has ever struggled to figure out where they belong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finalist, National Book Critics Circle Award for Autobiography / Longlisted for the PEN Open Book Award / Named a Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post, NPR, The Boston Globe, TIME, Newsday, Library Journal, BuzzFeed, Real Simple, Paste Magazine, Chicago Public Library, Seattle Public Library, Goodreads, Shelf Awareness, Electric Literature, and more&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>An enlightening narrative history—an entertaining fusion of Tom Wolfe and Michael Pollan—that traces the colorful origins of once unconventional foods and the diverse fringe movements, charismatic gurus, and counterculture elements that brought them to the mainstream and created a distinctly American cuisine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food writer Jonathan Kauffman journeys back more than half a century—to the 1960s and 1970s—to tell the story of how a coterie of unusual men and women embraced an alternative lifestyle that would ultimately change how modern Americans eat. Impeccably researched, &lt;em&gt;Hippie Food&lt;/em&gt; chronicles how the longhairs, revolutionaries, and back-to-the-landers rejected the square establishment of President Richard Nixon’s America and turned to a more idealistic and wholesome communal way of life and food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the mystical rock-and-roll cult known as the Source Family and its legendary vegetarian restaurant in Hollywood to the Diggers’ brown bread in the Summer of Love to the rise of the co-op and the origins of the organic food craze, Kauffman reveals how today’s quotidian whole-foods staples—including sprouts, tofu, yogurt, brown rice, and whole-grain bread—were introduced and eventually became part of our diets. From coast to coast, through Oregon, Texas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Vermont, Kauffman tracks hippie food’s journey from niche oddity to a cuisine that hit every corner of this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slick mix of gonzo playfulness, evocative detail, skillful pacing, and elegant writing, &lt;em&gt;Hippie Food&lt;/em&gt; is a lively, engaging, and informative read that deepens our understanding of our culture and our lives today.</description>

  <description>Marlee thought she scored the man of her dreams only to be scorched by a bad breakup. But there's a new player on the horizon, and he's in a league of his own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marlee Harper is the perfect girlfriend. She's definitely had enough practice by dating her NFL-star boyfriend for the last ten years. But when she discovers he has been tackling other women on the sly, she vows to never date an athlete again. There's just one problem: Gavin Pope, the new hotshot quarterback and a fling from the past, has Marlee in his sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin fights to show Marlee he's nothing like her ex. Unfortunately, not everyone is ready to let her escape her past. The team's wives, who never led the welcome wagon, are not happy with Marlee's return. They have only one thing on their minds: taking her down. But when the gossip makes Marlee public enemy number one, she worries about more than just her reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between their own fumbles and the wicked wives, it will take a Hail Mary for Marlee and Gavin's relationship to survive the season.</description>

  <description>Millie Morris has always been one of the guys. A UC Santa Barbara professor, she’s a female-serial-killer expert who’s quick with a deflection joke and terrible at getting personal. And she, just like her four best guy friends and fellow professors, is perma-single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a routine university function turns into a black tie gala, Mille and her circle make a pact that they’ll join an online dating service to find plus-ones for the event. There’s only one hitch: after making the pact, Millie and one of the guys, Reid Campbell, secretly spend the sexiest half-night of their lives together, but mutually decide the friendship would be better off strictly platonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But online dating isn’t for the faint of heart. While the guys are inundated with quality matches and potential dates, Millie’s first profile attempt garners nothing but dick pics and creepers. Enter “Catherine”—Millie’s fictional profile persona, in whose make-believe shoes she can be more vulnerable than she’s ever been in person. Soon “Catherine” and Reid strike up a digital pen-pal-ship...but Millie can’t resist temptation in real life, either. Soon, Millie will have to face her worst fear—intimacy—or risk losing her best friend, forever.</description>

  <description>Chinese food is more popular than any other cuisine and yet it often intimidates North American home cooks. Chinese Soul Food draws cooks into the kitchen with recipes that include sizzling potstickers, stir-fries that are&lt;br /&gt;unbelievably easy to make, saucy braises, and soups that bring comfort with a sip. These are dishes that feed the belly and speak the universal language of "mmm!" You'll find approachable recipes and plenty of tips for favorite homestyle Chinese dishes, such as red-braised pork belly, dry-fried green beans, braised-beef noodle soup, green onion pancakes, garlic eggplant, and the author's famous potstickers, which consistently sell out her cooking classes in Seattle. You will also find helpful tips and techniques, such as caring for and using a wok and how to cook rice properly, as well as a basic Chinese pantry list that also includes acceptable substitutions, making it even simpler for the busiest among us to cook their favorite Chinese dishes at home. Recipes are streamlined to minimize the fear factor of unfamiliar ingredients and techniques, and home cooks are gently guided toward becoming comfortable cooking satisfying Chinese meals. Any kitchen can be a Chinese kitchen!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love, loss, friendship, and the betrayals of the past all collide in this first women’s fiction novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 international bestselling author Christina Lauren (&lt;i&gt;Autoboyography, Dating You / Hating You&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the heart can never be unwritten.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macy Sorensen is settling into an ambitious if emotionally tepid routine: work hard as a new pediatrics resident, plan her wedding to an older, financially secure man, keep her head down and heart tucked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she runs into Elliot Petropoulos—the first and only love of her life—the careful bubble she’s constructed begins to dissolve. Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy’s entire world—growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother...only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more—spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favorite words, and talking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy’s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.</description>

  <description>In Grace Luther’s world, morality is physically enforced. Those who are "good" are blessed with beauty, while those who are not suffer horrifying consequences—disfigurement, or even death. When the cleric’s daughter stumbles onto information that proves her world is more complicated than it seems, she finds herself at the center of an epic battle where good and evil are not so easily distinguished. Despite all her efforts to live a normal teenage life, Grace is faced with a series of decisions that will risk the lives of everyone she loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Most days Rebecca Lindt feels like an imposter...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world admires her as a survivor. But that impression would crumble if people knew her secret. She didn't deserve to be the one who got away. But nothing can change the past, so she's thrown herself into her work. She can't dwell if she never slows down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wes Garrett is trying to get back on his feet after losing his dream restaurant, his money, and half his damn mind in a vicious divorce. But when he intervenes in a mugging and saves Rebecca―the attorney who helped his ex ruin him―his simple life gets complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their attraction is inconvenient and neither wants more than a fling. But when Rebecca's secret is put at risk, both discover they could lose everything, including what they never realized they needed: each other&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She laughed and kissed him. This morning she'd melted down. But somehow this man had her laughing and turned on only a few hours later. Everything inside her felt buoyed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She felt...light.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She'd forgotten what that felt like.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;New York Times &lt;em&gt;bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout delivers the unforgettable story of a woman whose new life has just begun—but may end in murder... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Hughes has always played it safe until she learned a very painful lesson. Now Julia’s starting over with a job in the Louisiana bayou—and a scorching encounter with a stranger, only to discover he’s Lucian de Vincent... her new employer. The de Vincent brothers share a massive fortune and a dark reputation. Julia cares for their troubled sister, but a menacing presence in the mansion—and the ever-present temptation of Lucian—prove dangerously distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucian’s grandmother claimed de Vincent men fall in love once—and hard. Apparently, it’s Lucian’s turn. Julia’s compassionate care of his twin makes Lucian want to lay himself bare. But some secrets are better for Julia not to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recent “suicide” of Lucian’s father is the latest in a string of deaths on the estate. Someone is eliminating the de Vincents. And the best way to get to Lucian may be through Julia...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Date &lt;/i&gt;serves up a novel about what happens when a public proposal doesn't turn into a happy ending, thanks to a woman who knows exactly how to make one on her own...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When someone asks you to spend your life with him, it shouldn't come as a surprise--or happen in front of 45,000 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game with her actor boyfriend, his man bun, and his bros, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't the hard part--they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media blows up--in a bad way. Nik knows that in the wilds of LA, a handsome doctor like Carlos can't be looking for anything serious, so she embarks on an epic rebound with him, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, one of them has to be smart enough to put on the brakes...</description>

  <description>Nigella Lawson is a champion of the home cook and her new book celebrates the food she loves to cook for friends and family. The recipes are warming, comforting, and inspirational, from new riffs on classic dishes – including Chicken Fricassee and Sticky Toffee Pudding – to adventures in a host of new dishes and ingredients, from Aubergine Fattet to White Miso Hummus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AT MY TABLE includes dishes to inspire all cooks and eaters, from Hake with Bacon, Peas and Cider to Indian-Spiced Chicken and Potato Traybake and Chilli Mint Lamb Cutlets; plus a host of colourful vegetable dishes, like Eastern Mediterranean Chopped Salad and Carrots and Fennel with Harissa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Nigella cookbook would be complete without sweet treats, and AT MY TABLE is no exception, with Emergency Brownies, White Chocolate Cheesecake and a Victoria Sponge with Cardamom, Marmalade and Crème Fraiche set to become family favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nigella writes, ‘happiness is best shared’ and the food in this book will be served and savoured at your own kitchen table just as it is at hers.</description>

  <description>Living among the ones and zeros of California's Silicon Valley—the coders and big-bucks brainiacs—the group of lower middle-class friends in this tale are trying to fashion futures out of whatever opportunities they can find. The group includes a would-be chef, a flirtatious (and unfaithful) waitress, a single mother with a tattoo of Bart Simpson on her shoulder, and an easy-going young man who must make some hard choices. Their story is about fortune cookies, class warfare, disease-fighting neuropeptides, strawberry rhubarb pie, and what it will take to be happy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Major Motion Picture Already in Development with Temple Hill Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set amidst the breathtaking beauty of Oxford, this sparkling debut novel tells the unforgettable story about a determined young woman eager to make her mark in the world and the handsome man who introduces her to an incredible love that will irrevocably alter her future—perfect for fans of JoJo Moyes and Nicholas Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Ella Durran has had the same plan for her life since she was thirteen: Study at Oxford. At 24, she’s finally made it to England on a Rhodes Scholarship when she’s offered an unbelievable position in a rising political star’s presidential campaign. With the promise that she’ll work remotely and return to DC at the end of her Oxford year, she’s free to enjoy her Once in a Lifetime Experience. That is, until a smart-mouthed local who is too quick with his tongue and his car ruins her shirt and her first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ella discovers that her English literature course will be taught by none other than that same local, Jamie Davenport, she thinks for the first time that Oxford might not be all she’s envisioned. But a late-night drink reveals a connection she wasn’t anticipating finding and what begins as a casual fling soon develops into something much more when Ella learns Jamie has a life-changing secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, Ella is faced with a seemingly impossible decision: turn her back on the man she’s falling in love with to follow her political dreams or be there for him during a trial neither are truly prepared for. As the end of her year in Oxford rapidly approaches, Ella must decide if the dreams she’s always wanted are the same ones she’s now yearning for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </description>

  <description>If there was one man in the world Grace Fitzgerald never wanted to see again, it was Mark Donovan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sinfully handsome and notoriously cocky, as a guest at her luxury hotel, Mark was impossible. As the new owner, he’s become a nightmare. The kind that wakes Grace in the middle of the night wishing she could forget how right his lips felt against her own, or how tempting his fingers were on her skin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite all the challenges Mark and Grace face working together, it’s impossible to ignore the attraction that flares every time they fight for control. Or the secrets that refuse to stay hidden in the luxury of the Seven Winds Resort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re engaged in a battle of wills. But the real war begins when Mark and Grace realize just how much they have to lose. When mistakes from their pasts threaten everything they’re working for, they have to decide: admit defeat or join forces to save the hotel and each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A steamy, enemies-to-lovers standalone romance from Katy Ames, author of After the Island.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A new kind of love story about flipping houses, taking risks, and landing that special someone who’s move-in ready…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE’S GOT CURB APPEAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rian Sutter grew up with the finer things in life. Spending summers in The Hamptons was a normal occurrence for her until her parents lost everything years ago. Now Rian and her sister are getting their life, and finances, back on track through real estate. Not only do they buy and sell houses to the rich and famous, but they finally have the capital to flip their very own beachfront property. But when she inadvertently catches the attention of a sexy stranger who snaps up every house from under her, all bets are off…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HE’S A FIXER UPPER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pierce Whitfield doesn’t normally demo kitchens, install dry wall, or tear apart a beautiful woman’s dreams. He’s just a down-on-his-luck lawyer who needed a break from the city and agreed to help his brother work on a few homes in the Hamptons. When he first meets Rian, the attraction is undeniable. But when they start competing for the same pieces of prime real estate, the early sparks turn into full-blown fireworks. Can these passionate rivals turn up the heat on their budding romance—without burning down the house?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I FLIPPING LOVE YOU, set in the Shacking Up world, follows two people, both working in real estate, who find themselves vying for the same properties in the Hamptons, leading to a sometimes-not-so-friendly competition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is it love, or is she just his good luck charm?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Helena Hunting absolutely delights with this witty and fun standalone contemporary romance.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lilah isn't sure what hurt worse: the day Ethan left her to focus on his hockey career, or the day he came back eight years later. He might think they can pick up just where they left off, but she's no longer that same girl and never wants to be again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan Kane wants his glory days back. And that includes having Lilah by his side. With her, he was magic. They were magic. All he has to do is make her see that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Lilah might finally be ready to let him in, though, she finds out their reunion has nothing to do with her and everything to do with his game. But Ethan's already lost her once, and even if it costs him his career, he'll do anything to keep from losing her again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Everybody’s talking about the hot new app reviewing New York’s most eligible bachelors. But why focus on prince charming when you can read the latest dirt on the lowest-ranked “Bad Bachelors”—NYC’s most notorious bad boys.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one more person mentions Bad Bachelors to Reed McMahon, someone’s gonna get hurt. A PR whiz, Reed is known as an ‘image fixer’ but his womanizing ways have caught up with him. What he needs is a PR miracle of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Reed strolls into Darcy Greer’s workplace offering to help save the struggling library, she isn’t buying it. The prickly Brooklynite knows Reed is exactly the kind of guy she should avoid. But the library does need his help. As she reluctantly works with Reed, she realizes there’s more to a man than his reputation. Maybe, just maybe, Bad Bachelor #1 is THE one for her.</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Brazilian Acacia Santos excels at her job as concierge at the prestigious Hotel Victoire in Paris. When her senior colleague is attacked and sent to the hospital, she is tasked with serving one of the hotel’s most mysterious and attractive guests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas Cassirer checks into the hotel under an assumed name every three months. Usually, he stays in the penthouse suite with a beautiful female companion but on this occasion, he arrives alone and is displeased in having to deal with someone new. A match of wits ensues as he tests Acacia’s expertise with a series of almost impossible demands. Her intelligence and creativity rise to the challenge, earning his respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They strike a tenuous accord until Acacia discovers a famous stolen painting in his suite. Compelled to report her discovery, she contacts a former boyfriend who works for the elite BRB, a unit of French law enforcement that deals with stolen art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas is questioned by police and released when it is revealed the painting is a reproduction. Irked with her behavior, Acacia’s supervisor demotes her, threatening dismissal and the cancellation of her work permit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Acacia has already attracted Nicholas’s attention. Remorseful that she may lose her job on his account, he offers her a choice—she can wait until her supervisor dismisses her, or she can leave the city of lights behind and become his personal assistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acacia initially refuses his offer, but Nicholas is persistent. He reveals himself as a man who quietly acquires stolen art in order to restore it to its rightful owners. Faced with mounting familial debts and the possibility of dismissal and deportation, she agrees to work for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas opens up a whole new world of beauty and intrigue to Acacia as they travel the globe. Soon the line between employer and assistant is blurred, and the two lonely people embark on a passionate relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets and danger abound as Nicholas and Acacia try to solve the mystery of a piece of stolen art. But Acacia may prove to be the most dangerous mystery of all.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

So when his cousin buys a Caribbean resort and offers him a job away from the family firm, Tristan jumps at the chance to leave behind his intolerable father and the life he barely lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tessa Armstrong has a plan and moving to a tropical island isn’t part of it. But when she lands the position of head pastry chef at a luxury hotel, she can’t pass it up. A new country, a new kitchen. And a fresh start far away from the secrets that are becoming harder to ignore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On an island where neither expected to end up, Tessa and Tristan discover something they’ve always wanted: a safe haven. And when friendship becomes something more, they think they’ve landed in paradise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there’s a storm coming, and the secrets they’ve worked so hard to escape aren’t far behind. And with them, a truth that has the power to wash away a love they never dreamed to find. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A standalone contemporary romance from the author of After the Island and After the Fall. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After being together for ten years, Sylvie and Dan have all the trimmings of a happy life and marriage; they have a comfortable home, fulfilling jobs, beautiful twin girls, and communicate so seamlessly, they finish each other’s sentences. However, a trip to the doctor reveals they could live another 68 years together… and panic sets in. They never expected ‘until death do us part’ to mean seven decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of marriage survival, they quickly concoct a plan to keep their relationship fresh and exciting: they will create little surprises for each other so that their (extended) years together will never become boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in their pursuit to execute Project Surprise Me, mishaps arise and secrets are uncovered that start to threaten the very foundation of their unshakeable bond. When a scandal from the past is revealed that questions some important untold truths, they begin to wonder if they ever really knew each other after all…</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A billion-dollar fashion empire, and it’s about to be mine…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've worked a decade for this. I've sold my soul and my reputation. I've lived a lie, smiled for the cameras, and hated myself, all for this inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then … she pops up. A mysterious heir with a rap sheet, combat boots, and a mouth that I want to pin shut with my—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t matter. I’ve played this game for a decade. I can continue the charade a little longer, keep my hands to myself and her body out of my mind. I can keep my secret until the ink dries and everything is mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or not.</description>

  <description>At Twin Oaks Country Club, there are the fortunate ones, and then there are the rest of us: the waiters, the caddies, the valets, and in my case, the cabana girls. Most days, I’m poolside in a pleated skirt, dishing out margaritas to tycoons and titans. It’s not exactly my dream job, but it does come with one perk…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Ashwood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s my silver lining in a custom black suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being a legacy member at the club, he’s a tech mogul and Austin’s most eligible bachelor. Oh, and those dimples? &lt;i&gt;Yeah&lt;/i&gt;, they make my stomach dip too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On good days, I catch his sleek Porsche winding down the tree-lined drive. On better days, I steal a glimpse of his handsome profile as we pass in the hall. And on the absolute best day, I find him alone at the bar, looking for company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Come have a seat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those four little words set me down a path I never could have imagined. Private planes, penthouse suites, and temptations around every corner make it impossible to keep my distance. His world feels decadent and wild—but overindulgence comes with a cost. Every kiss comes with strings. Every erotic encounter is a promise I’m not ready to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pump the brakes, he hits the gas. James doesn’t want to go slow—he wants a commitment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the thing about the fortunate ones?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re used to getting what they want.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groomsman and his last-minute guest are about to discover if a fake date can go the distance in a fun and flirty debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to go to a wedding with a guy she gets stuck with in an elevator is something Alexa Monroe wouldn't normally do. But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff. Too bad they can't stop thinking about the other... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're just two high-powered professionals on a collision course toward the long distance dating disaster of the century--or closing the gap between what they think they need and what they truly want...</description>

  <description>Deb Perelman, award-winning blogger and New York Times best-selling author of The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook, understands that a happy discovery in the kitchen has the ability to completely change the course of your day. Whether we’re cooking for ourselves, for a date night in, for a Sunday supper with friends, or for family on a busy weeknight, we all want recipes that are unfussy to make with triumphant results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deb thinks that cooking should be an escape from drudgery. Smitten Kitchen Every Day: Triumphant and Unfussy New Favorites presents more than one hundred impossible-to-resist recipes—almost all of them brand-new, plus a few favorites from her website—that will make you want to stop what you’re doing right now and cook. These are real recipes for real people—people with busy lives who don’t want to sacrifice flavor or quality to eat meals they’re really excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll want to put these recipes in your Forever Files: Sticky Toffee Waffles (sticky toffee pudding you can eat for breakfast), Everything Drop Biscuits with Cream Cheese, and Magical Two-Ingredient Oat Brittle (a happy accident). There’s a (hopelessly, unapologetically inauthentic) Kale Caesar with Broken Eggs and Crushed Croutons, a Mango Apple Ceviche with Sunflower Seeds, and a Grandma-Style Chicken Noodle Soup that fixes everything. You can make Leek, Feta, and Greens Spiral Pie, crunchy Brussels and Three Cheese Pasta Bake that tastes better with brussels sprouts than without, Beefsteak Skirt Steak Salad, and Bacony Baked Pintos with the Works (as in, giant bowls of beans that you can dip into like nachos). &lt;br /&gt;And, of course, no meal is complete without cake (and cookies and pies and puddings): Chocolate Peanut Butter Icebox Cake (the icebox cake to end all icebox cakes), Pretzel Linzers with Salted Caramel, Strawberry Cloud Cookies, Bake Sale Winning-est Gooey Oat Bars, as well as the ultimate Party Cake Builder—four one-bowl cakes for all occasions with mix-and-match frostings (bonus: less time spent doing dishes means everybody wins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with Deb’s trademark humor and gorgeously illustrated with her own photographs, Smitten Kitchen Every Day is filled with what are sure to be your new favorite things to cook.</description>

  <description>From James Beard Best Chef-nominee Rachel Yang, &lt;i&gt;My Rice Bowl&lt;/i&gt; is a cookbook with 75 recipes based on her deeply comforting Korean fusion cuisine, inspired by cultures from around the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As co-owner of the popular Seattle restaurants, Joule, Trove, and Revel, and Portland's Revelry, chef Rachel Yang delights with her unique Korean fusion--think noodles, dumplings, pickles, pancakes, and barbecue. Along with her husband, Seif Chirchi, Yang serves food that exemplifies cross-cultural cooking at its most gratifying. In the cookbook you'll find the restaurants' kimchi recipe, of course, but there's so much more--seaweed noodles with crab and creme fraiche, tahini-garlic grilled pork belly, fried cauliflower with miso bagna cauda, chipotle-spiked pad thai, Korean-taco pickles, and the ultimate Korean fried chicken (served with peanut brittle shards for extra crunch). There are rice bowls too--with everything from lamb curry to charred shiitake mushrooms--but this book goes way beyond &lt;i&gt;bibimbap&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; In many ways, the book, like Yang's restaurants, is analogous to a rice bowl; underpinning everything is Yang's strict childhood in Korea and the food memories it engrained in her. But on top you'll taste a mosaic of flavors from across the globe, plus a dash of her culinary alma maters, Per Se and Alain Ducasse. This is the authentic, cutting-edge fusion food of a Korean immigrant who tried everything she could to become an American, but only became one when she realized that her culture--among many--is what makes America so delicious today.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Emperor’s Children&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The House of Mirth,&lt;/i&gt; the forgotten granddaughter of one of New York’s wealthiest men is reunited with her family just as she comes of age—and once she’s had a glimpse of their glittering world, she refuses to let it go without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Laila Lawrence becomes an orphan at twenty-three, the sudden loss unexpectedly introduces her to three glamorous cousins from New York who show up unannounced at her mother’s funeral. The three siblings are scions of the wealthy family from which Laila’s father had been estranged long before his own untimely demise ten years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, Laila has left behind her quiet life in Grosse Point, Michigan to move to New York City, landing her smack in the middle of her cousins’ decadent world. As the truth about why Laila’s parents became estranged from the family patriarch becomes clear, Laila grows ever more resolved to claim what’s rightfully hers. Caught between longing for the love of her family and her relentless pursuit of the lifestyle she feels she was unfairly denied, Laila finds herself reawakening a long dead family scandal—not to mention setting off several new ones—as she becomes further enmeshed in the lives and love affairs of her cousins. But will Laila ever, truly, belong in their world? Sly and sexy, &lt;i&gt;She Regrets Nothing &lt;/i&gt;is a sharply observed and utterly seductive tale about family, fortune, and fate—and the dark side of wealth.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Being bad never felt so good, in the third novel in Alisha Rai’s sexy Forbidden Hearts series!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well-behaved women don’t lust after men who love to misbehave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heiress Evangeline Chandler knows how to keep a secret . . . like her life-long crush on the tattooed hottie who just happens to be her big brother’s friend. She’s a Chandler, after all, and Chandlers don’t hook up with the help. Then again, they also don’t disobey their fathers and quit their respectable jobs, so good-girl rules may no longer apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Hunter hides the pain of his past behind a smile, but he can’t hide his sudden attraction to his friend’s sheltered little sister. Eve is far too sweet to accept anything less than forever and there’s no chance of a future between the son of a housekeeper and the town’s resident princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a wedding party forces Eve and Gabe into tight quarters, keeping their hands off each other will be as hard as keeping their clothes on. The need that draws them together is stronger than the forces that should shove them apart . . . but their sparks may not survive the explosion when long-buried secrets are finally unearthed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love, loss, friendship, and the betrayals of the past all collide in this first fiction novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 international bestselling author Christina Lauren (&lt;i&gt;Autoboyography, Dating You / Hating You&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story of the heart can never be unwritten.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macy Sorensen is settling into an ambitious if emotionally tepid routine: work hard as a new pediatrics resident, plan her wedding to an older, financially secure man, keep her head down and heart tucked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she runs into Elliot Petropoulos—the first and only love of her life—the careful bubble she’s constructed begins to dissolve. Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy’s entire world—growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother...only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more—spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favorite words, and talking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy’s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.</description>

  <description>Four years ago, I lied. I stood in front of the police, my friends and family, and made up a story, my best one yet. And all of them believed me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't surprised. Telling stories is what made me famous. Fifteen bestsellers. Millions of fans. Fame and fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have one last story to write. It'll be my best one yet, with a jaw-dropping twist that will leave them stunned and gasping for breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say that sticks and stones will break your bones, but this story? It will be the one that kills me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; This book is not a romance. It is contemporary fiction, but very suspenseful in nature. It is about a famous romance author and a dark secret she keeps. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groomsman and his last-minute guest are about to discover if a fake date can go the distance in a fun and flirty debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to go to a wedding with a guy she gets stuck with in an elevator is something Alexa Monroe wouldn't normally do. But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff. Too bad they can't stop thinking about the other... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're just two high-powered professionals on a collision course toward the long distance dating disaster of the century--or closing the gap between what they think they need and what they truly want...</description>

  <description>Born with a silver spoon in her mouth, Manhattan upper-cruster Cecily Sinclair now uses that pricey utensil to dish up fancy French fare on her cooking show, Serving Romance. When there’s an executive shake-up at the network, she’s not worried. Not much anyway. Her show’s a hit after all. Why would the new CEO want to mess with success?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The driving force behind several buzzed-about networks, Devlin Hayes is considered to be a wunderkind in the television industry. Although his plans to rebrand CuisineTV and make Serving Romance more Millennial-friendly don’t thrill Cecily, her charming, blue-eyed boss is a hard man to say “no” to and she really wants to keep her job—even if that means sharing screen time with a loathsome blast from her past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercurial Italian chef Dante Marchetti a.k.a. “Il Duce” was once Cecily’s boss, and she has the PTSD to prove it. Now the owner of one of the hottest restaurants in town, Dante’s egomania knows no bounds and his constant attempts to provoke and upstage Cecily make her want to conk him on the head with a sauté pan. She thinks they’re toxic together, but viewers love their chemistry and clamor for more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Cecily battles to maintain the integrity of her show, she finds herself scheming and manipulating right along with Dante and Devlin. Is she fighting a lost cause? Does she really belong on TV, or would her culinary talent be better served elsewhere? And could one of the men who makes Cecily’s blood boil ignite a passion in her for something other than food?</description>

  <description>He wasn’t supposed to fall in love with his brother’s widow…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accused of a crime he didn’t commit, Jackson Kane fled his home, his name, and his family. Ten years later, he’s come back to town: older, wiser, richer, tougher—and still helpless to turn away the one woman he could never stop loving, even after she married his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadia Ahmed can’t deal with the feelings her mysterious former brother-in-law stirs, but she also can’t turn down his offer of help with the cafe she’s inherited. While he heats up her kitchen, she slowly discovers that the boy she adored has grown into a man she’s simply unable to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An affair is unthinkable, but their desire is undeniable. As secrets and lies are stripped away, Sadia and Jackson must decide if they’re strong enough to face the past...and step into a future together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The most beautiful man I've ever seen is the one who can ruin everything...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I lay eyes on Callan Walker, I know he’ll be trouble. With his smug grin, hot Aussie accent and thousand dollar shoes, he’s just the kind of rich guy who always gets what he wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he wants two things: a night of sin, and my cooperation as he outmaneuvers his powerful mother to take control of his uncle’s estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t afford either one. I’m the only thing standing between my little sister and the foster care system. He may have money and charm on his side, but I have something even more powerful -- pure desperation. This temp job at his mother’s company can become a full time job for me. It has to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Callan’s eyes rake over my body, sometimes I forget my obligations. His piercing gaze finds the fun, optimistic girl I used to be and not the tired person I’ve become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works--if only for a moment. Our night together was a mistake. I can't afford to get sucked into his high-powered family’s treachery. But the closer I get to Callan, the more layers I find beneath those expensive clothes. Though I can’t forget this is temporary. He’s temporary. I have too much to lose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad my foolish heart didn’t get the memo...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Liv's words cut off as Finn got closer. The man approaching was nothing like the boy she'd known. The bulky football muscles had streamlined into a harder, leaner package and the look in his deep green eyes held no trace of boyish innocence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been twelve years since tragedy struck the senior class of Long Acre High School. Only a few students survived that fateful night—a group the media dubbed The Ones Who Got Away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liv Arias thought she'd never return to Long Acre—until a documentary brings her and the other survivors back home. Suddenly her old flame, Finn Dorsey, is closer than ever, and their attraction is still white-hot. When a searing kiss reignites their passion, Liv realizes this rough-around-the-edges cop might be exactly what she needs...</description>

  <description>Amalie Whitfield is the picture of a blushing bride during her wedding reception ― but for all the wrong reasons. Instead of proclaiming his undying love, her husband can be heard, by Amalie and their guests, getting off with someone else. She has every reason to freak out, and in a moment of insanity, she throws herself at the first hot-blooded male she sees. But he’s not interested in becoming her revenge screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mortified and desperate to escape the post-wedding drama, Amalie decides to go on her honeymoon alone, only to find the man who rejected her also heading to the same tiny island for work. But this time he isn’t holding back. She should know better than to sleep with someone she knows, but she can’t seem to resist him. They might agree that what happens on the island should stay on the island, but neither one can deny that their attraction is more than just physical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Filled with hilariously scandalous situations and enough sexual chemistry to power an airplane from New York City to the South Pacific, &lt;i&gt;Hooking Up&lt;/i&gt; is the next standalone, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy from Helena Hunting, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the &lt;i&gt;Pucked&lt;/i&gt; series and &lt;i&gt;Shacking Up&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Listening length: 7 hours, 45 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Chen just wants a degree and a job, so her parents never have to worry about making rent again. She has no time for Blake Reynolds, the sexy billionaire who stands to inherit Cyclone Technology. But when he makes an off-hand comment about what it means to be poor, she loses her cool and tells him he couldn’t last a month living her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her shock, Blake offers her a trade: She’ll get his income, his house, his car. In exchange, he’ll work her hours and send money home to her family. No expectations; no future obligations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before long, they’re trading not just lives, but secrets, kisses, and heated nights together. No expectations might break Tina’s heart...but Blake’s secrets could ruin her life.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Tanner Scott’s family relocated from California to Utah, a move that nudged the bisexual teen temporarily back into the closet. Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High’s prestigious Seminar—where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester—Tanner can’t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class. And it takes less than a month for Tanner to fall completely in love with him.</description>

  <description>When Solène Marchand, the thirty-nine-year-old owner of a prestigious art gallery in Los Angeles, takes her daughter, Isabelle, to meet her favorite boy band, she does so reluctantly and at her ex-husband’s request. The last thing she expects is to make a connection with one of the members of the world-famous August Moon. But Hayes Campbell is clever, winning, confident, and posh, and the attraction is immediate. That he is all of twenty years old further complicates things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as a series of clandestine trysts quickly evolves into a passionate relationship. It is a journey that spans continents as Solène and Hayes navigate each other’s disparate worlds: from stadium tours to international art fairs to secluded hideaways. And for Solène, it is as much a reclaiming of self, as it is a rediscovery of happiness and love. When their romance becomes a viral sensation, and both she and her daughter become the target of rabid fans and an insatiable media, Solène must face how her new status has impacted not only her life, but the lives of those closest to her.</description>

  <description>Rae Wallace would rather drown in a vat of pinot greezh and be eaten by her own beagle than make another trip down the aisle--even if it is her best friend's wedding. She's too busy molding the minds of first graders and polishing that ol' novel in the drawer to waste time on any man, unless it's Jason Segel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her best friends stage an intervention, Rae is forced to give in. After all, they've hatched a plan to help her find love the 21st century way: online. She's skeptical of this electronic chlamydia catcher, but she's out to prove she hasn't been too picky with men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when a familiar fella's profile pops up--the dangerously hot substitute teacher from work (Nick)--Rae swipes herself right into a new problem...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Should you ever go back?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been ten years since Abby Williams left home and scrubbed away all visible evidence of her small town roots. Now working as an environmental lawyer in Chicago, she has a thriving career, a modern apartment, and her pick of meaningless one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a new case takes her back home to Barrens, Indiana, the life Abby painstakingly created begins to crack. Tasked with investigating Optimal Plastics, the town's most high-profile company and economic heart, Abby begins to find strange connections to Barrens’ biggest scandal from more than a decade ago involving the popular Kaycee Mitchell and her closest friends—just before Kaycee disappeared for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby knows the key to solving any case lies in the weak spots, the unanswered questions. But as Abby tries to find out what really happened to Kaycee, she unearths an even more disturbing secret—a ritual called “The Game,” which will threaten the reputations, and lives, of the community and risk exposing a darkness that may consume her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With tantalizing twists, slow-burning suspense, and a remote, rural town of just five claustrophobic miles, &lt;i&gt;Bonfire&lt;/i&gt; is a dark exploration of the question: can you ever outrun your past?</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Alice and Jake are a picture-perfect couple. Alice, once a singer in a well-known rock band, is now a successful lawyer. Jake is a partner in an up-and-coming psychology practice. Their life together holds endless possibilities. After receiving an enticing wedding gift from one of Alice’s prominent clients, they decide to join an exclusive and mysterious group known only as The Pact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of The Pact seems simple: to keep marriages happy and intact, and most of its rules make sense: Always answer the phone when your spouse calls. Exchange thoughtful gifts monthly. Plan a trip together once per quarter. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mention The Pact to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice and Jake are initially seduced by the glamorous parties, the sense of community, their widening social circle of like-minded couples--and then one of them breaks the rules. The young lovers are about to discover that for adherents to The Pact, membership, like marriage, is for life, and The Pact will go to any lengths to enforce that rule. For Jake and Alice, the marriage of their dreams is about to become their worst nightmare.</description>

  <description>One night. No one will know. &lt;p&gt;That was the deal. Every year, Livvy Kane and Nicholas Chandler would share one perfect night of illicit pleasure. The forbidden hours let them forget the tragedy that haunted their pasts—and the last names that made them enemies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the night she didn’t show up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Nicholas has an empire to run. He doesn’t have time for distractions and Livvy’s sudden reappearance in town is a major distraction. She’s the one woman he shouldn’t want . . . so why can’t he forget how right she feels in his bed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livvy didn’t come home for Nicholas, but fate seems determined to remind her of his presence—and their past. Although the passion between them might have once run hot and deep, not even love can overcome the scandal that divided their families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being together might be against all the rules . . . but being apart is impossible. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this stunning and provocative domestic drama about a sweet sixteen birthday party that goes horribly awry, a wealthy family in San Francisco finds their picture-perfect life unraveling, their darkest secrets revealed, and their friends turned to enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One invitation. A lifetime of regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet sixteen. It’s an exciting coming of age, a milestone, and a rite of passage. Jeff and Kim Sanders plan on throwing a party for their daughter, Hannah—a sweet girl with good grades and nice friends. Rather than an extravagant, indulgent affair, they invite four girls over for pizza, cake, movies, and a sleepover. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things do go wrong, horrifically so. After a tragic accident occurs, Jeff and Kim’s flawless life in a wealthy San Francisco suburb suddenly begins to come apart. In the ugly aftermath, friends become enemies, dark secrets are revealed in the Sanders’ marriage, and the truth about their perfect daughter, Hannah, is exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harkening to Herman Koch’s The Dinner, Christos Tsiolkas’s The Slap, and Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies, The Party takes us behind the façade of the picture-perfect family, exposing the lies, betrayals, and moral lapses that neighbors don’t see—and the secrets that children and parents keep from themselves and each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From subway to Broadway to happily ever after. Modern love in all its thrill, hilarity, and uncertainty has never been so compulsively readable as in New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren’s romantic novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriages of convenience are so...inconvenient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Holland Bakker has invented excuses to descend into the subway station near her apartment, drawn to the captivating music performed by her street musician crush. Lacking the nerve to actually talk to the gorgeous stranger, fate steps in one night in the form of a drunken attacker. Calvin Mcloughlin rescues her, but quickly disappears when the police start asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the only resource she has to pay the brilliant musician back, Holland gets Calvin an audition with her uncle, Broadway’s hottest musical director. When the tryout goes better than even Holland could have imagined, Calvin is set for a great entry into Broadway—until his reason for disappearing earlier becomes clear: he’s in the country illegally, his student visa having expired years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that her uncle needs Calvin as much as Calvin needs him, a wild idea takes hold of her. Impulsively, she marries the Irishman, her infatuation a secret only to him. As their relationship evolves and Calvin becomes the darling of Broadway—in the middle of the theatrics and the acting-not-acting—will Holland and Calvin to realize that they both stopped pretending a long time ago?</description>

  <description>Young PR star Rose Reed is thrown into the big leagues when her boss leaves town the day of the firm's meeting with Archie Fox, a young, hot, internationally famous British singer-songwriter. The meeting is going badly until Rose suggests a staged romance with up-and-coming, young indie star Raya. He'll do it, but only if Rose becomes his publicist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the faux-mance begins to rehabilitate Archie's faltering career, Rose finds his herself having unexpected, inconvenient and definitely unprofessional feelings for the crooner. But do late night texts and impromptu burrito binges mean he feels the same? In the end, Rose will have to decide whether to let her fantasy crush go, or to risk her reputation to be with the charming, handsome, scoundrel-y but sweet pop star she's grown to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy new standalone from USA Today bestseller Sarina Bowen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’d think a billion dollars, a professional hockey team and a six-bedroom mansion on the Promenade would satisfy a guy. You’d be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seven years Rebecca has brightened my office with her wit and her smile. She manages both my hockey team and my sanity. I don’t know when I started waking in the night, craving her. All I know is that one whiff of her perfume ruins my concentration. And her laugh makes me hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rebecca gets hurt, I step in to help. It’s what friends do. But what friends don’t do is rip off each others’ clothes for a single, wild night together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s avoiding me. She says we’re too different, and it can never happen again. So why can’t we keep our hands off each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Baseball has never been sexier in an all-new novel by &lt;i&gt;New York Times Bestselling Author&lt;/i&gt;, K. Bromberg.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton Wylder is baseball royalty. The game is his life. His passion. &lt;i&gt;His everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, when an injury threatens to end Easton’s season early, the team calls in the renowned physical therapist, Doc Dalton, to oversee his recovery. Except it’s not Doc who greets Easton for his first session, but rather his daughter, Scout. She may be feisty, athletic, defiant, and &lt;i&gt;gorgeous&lt;/i&gt;, but Easton is left questioning whether she has what it takes to help him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scout Dalton’s out to prove a female can handle the pressure of running the physical therapy regimen of an MLB club. And that proof comes in the form of getting phenom Easton Wylder back on the field. But getting him healthy means being hands-on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with a man as irresistible as Easton, being hands-on can only lead to one thing, &lt;i&gt;trouble&lt;/i&gt;. Because the more she touches him, the more she wants him, and &lt;i&gt;she can’t want him&lt;/i&gt;. Not when it’s her job to side in the club’s best interest if he’s ready to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when sparks fly and fine lines are crossed, can they withstand the heat or is one of them bound to get burned?</description>

  <description>When Tate Collins meets airline pilot Miles Archer, she knows it isn’t love at first sight. They wouldn’t even go so far as to consider themselves friends. The only thing Tate and Miles have in common is an undeniable mutual attraction. Once their desires are out in the open, they realize they have the perfect set-up. He doesn’t want love, she doesn’t have time for love, so that just leaves the sex. Their arrangement could be surprisingly seamless, as long as Tate can stick to the only two rules Miles has for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never ask about the past.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t expect a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They think they can handle it, but realize almost immediately they can’t handle it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hearts get infiltrated.&lt;br /&gt;Promises get broken.&lt;br /&gt;Rules get shattered.&lt;br /&gt;Love gets ugly.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Voss family is anything but normal. They live in a repurposed church, newly baptized Dollar Voss. The once cancer-stricken mother lives in the basement, the father is married to the mother’s former nurse, the little half-brother isn’t allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there’s Merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn’t earned and secrets her family forces her to keep. While browsing the local antiques shop for her next trophy, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her—until she discovers that he’s completely unavailable. Merit retreats deeper into herself, watching her family from the sidelines when she learns a secret that no trophy in the world can fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up with the lies, Merit decides to shatter the happy family illusion that she’s never been a part of before leaving them behind for good. When her escape plan fails, Merit is forced to deal with the staggering consequences of telling the truth and losing the one boy she loves.</description>

  <description>Nicholas Arthur Frederick Edward Pembrook, Crowned Prince of Wessco, aka His Royal Hotness, is wickedly charming, devastatingly handsome, and unabashedly arrogant; hard not to be when people are constantly bowing down to you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one snowy night in Manhattan, the prince meets a dark haired beauty who doesn't bow down. Instead, she throws a pie in his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas wants to find out if she tastes as good as her pie, and this heir apparent is used to getting what he wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dating a prince isn't what waitress Olivia Hammond ever imagined it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a disapproving queen, a wildly inappropriate spare heir, relentless paparazzi, and brutal public scrutiny. While they've traded in horse drawn carriages for Rolls Royces, and haven't chopped anyone's head off lately, the royals are far from accepting of this commoner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to Olivia, Nicholas is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas grew up with the whole world watching, and now Marriage Watch is in full force. In the end, Nicholas has to decide who he is and, more importantly, who he wants to be: a King... or the man who gets to love Olivia forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Max Riley is the man of your dreams. Or at least he will be, for a price.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As his alter-ego Mister Romance, Max is a drop-dead gorgeous escort who makes romantic fantasies come to life. No sex, just swoon-worthy dates to die for, and the cream of New York's socialites can't get enough.  Whether they want a dominating billionaire, bad boy with a heart of gold, hot geek, sexy biker, or best friend who loves them from afar, Max can make it all happen, but he's careful to keep his real identity a secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter investigative journalist Eden Tate. Having caught wind of the urban legend of Mister Romance from a lovestruck client, Eden is determined to publish a scathing expose on Max and his ability to swindle lonely society women out of their fortunes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to protect his anonymity and his clients, Max challenges Eden to give him three dates. If she doesn't fall in love with him, she can run her story with his blessing. If she succumbs to his charms, the story dies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cynical Eden has no doubt she can resist his fake romance personas, but when the real Max admits he’s falling for her, she has to decide if the professional liar is telling the truth, or if the passionate man with the mysterious past is just one more character designed to con her out of her career-making story. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t miss this sizzling new standalone from the internationally best selling author of Bad Romeo, Broken Juliet, and Wicked Heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Hannah—knee-deep in nailing down catering plans and floral arrangements for her upcoming nuptials—is ready for some R&amp;amp;R. Stealing off to a quiet, secluded island off the coast of Washington state for good wine and fresh air with her four best friends seems like the perfect way to spend her bachelorette weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the island may have other ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway through the trip, the bride-to-be mysteriously disappears, leaving the bridesmaids confused and increasingly panicked. To make matters worse, there’s something…amiss about the house they’re staying in. As the tension rises, personalities clash, secrets spill out, and the girls begin seeing and hearing things they can’t explain. While Hannah’s friends desperately try to discover what has happened to her, an ominous storm rolls in that could trap them on the island indefinitely. Now the girls who came to celebrate with Hannah begin to wonder, is she going to make it to the wedding? Is she going to make it home at all?</description>

  <description>May Fredericks hates New York. Which is fair enough, since New York seems to hate her back. Just weeks after moving from Wisconsin to Manhattan, she receives the world's worst marriage proposal, stabs her boyfriend with a shrimp fork in a very public venue, and accidentally becomes notorious. And that’s before she gets mugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At her wit's end, May washes up at a Packers bar in Greenwich Village, where she meets a surly, unhelpful guy who hates her shoes and calls her ex a douche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His name is Ben. He used to be a chef. Now he's a rooftop beekeeper with anger management issues. She wouldn't even like him, but he reminds her of home … and he knows where to find all the best food in the Village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She makes him laugh. He buys her tacos and cowboy boots. The longer they’re stuck together, the better May and Ben get along … and the harder they fall. TRULY is a quirky, modern New York love story unlike any you've read before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;About the Serialization&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRULY, the first novel in Ruthie Knox’s forthcoming New York Series, will be serialized in its entirety on Wattpad. Look for chapters every Monday from September 3 through November 4! Once completed, the full Wattpad version of TRULY will be pulled, so be sure to read it while it's still available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRULY will be published by Loveswept/Random House in Fall 2014. Two sequels — MADLY and COMPLETELY — will follow.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Maggie Stiefvater, a gripping tale of darkness, miracles, and family. Saints. Miracles. Family. Romance. Death. Redemption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here is a thing everyone wants: &lt;b&gt;A miracle&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here is a thing everyone fears:&lt;br /&gt;What it takes to get one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Any visitor to Bicho Raro, Colorado is likely to find a landscape of dark saints, forbidden love, scientific dreams, miracle-mad owls, estranged affections, one or two orphans, and a sky full of watchful desert stars.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the heart of this place you will find the Soria family, who all have the ability to perform unusual miracles.

But the miracles of Bicho Raro are never quite what you expect.</description>

      <![CDATA[Maggie Stiefvater is a masterful storyteller. All the Crooked Saints is a wonderful, strangely beautiful story with rich imagery, and a compelling message about the role we play in our own miracles. I tend to think of Maggie's past works as having an urgency about them, but this is one that won't...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A goalie has to trust his instincts, even when taking a shot to the heart…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Beacon is a champion at defending the net, but off the ice, he’s not so lucky. A widower and a single father, he’s never forgotten Lauren Williams, the ex who gave him the best year of his life. When Lauren reappears in the Bruisers office during the playoffs, Beacon sees his chance to make things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren hates that she’s forced to travel with the team she used to work for and the man who broke her heart. There’s still undeniable sexual tension running between her and Mike, but she won’t go down that road again. She’s focused on her plans for the future—she doesn’t need a man to make her dreams of motherhood come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren plays her best defensive game, but she’s no match for the dark-eyed goalie. When the field of play moves to Florida, things heat up on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Mike’s biggest fans doesn’t approve—his teenage daughter. But a true competitor knows not to waste the perfect shot at love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Crush: a strong and often short-lived infatuation, particularly for someone beyond your reach…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darcy Barrett has undertaken a global survey of men. She’s travelled the world, and can categorically say that no one measures up to Tom Valeska, whose only flaw is that Darcy’s twin brother Jamie saw him first and claimed him forever as his best friend. Despite Darcy’s best efforts, Tom’s off limits and loyal to her brother, 99%. That’s the problem with finding her dream man at age eight and peaking in her photography career at age twenty—ever since, she’s had to learn to settle for good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Darcy and Jamie inherit a tumble-down cottage from their grandmother, they’re left with strict instructions to bring it back to its former glory and sell the property. Darcy plans to be in an aisle seat halfway across the ocean as soon as the renovations start, but before she can cut and run, she finds a familiar face on her porch: house-flipper extraordinaire Tom’s arrived, he’s bearing power tools, and he’s single for the first time in almost a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Darcy’s considering sticking around to make sure her twin doesn’t ruin the cottage’s inherent magic with his penchant for grey and chrome. She’s definitely not staying because of her new business partner’s tight t-shirts, or that perfect face that's inspiring her to pick up her camera again. Soon sparks are flying—and it’s not the faulty wiring. It turns out one percent of Tom’s heart might not be enough for Darcy anymore. This time around, she’s switching things up. She’s going to make Tom Valeska 99 percent hers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Heart of Paris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to La Maison des Sorcieres. Where the window display is an enchanted forest of sweets, a collection of conical hats delights the eye and the habitues nibble chocolate witches from fanciful mismatched china. While in their tiny blue kitchen, Magalie Chaudron and her two aunts stir wishes into bubbling pots of heavenly chocolat chaud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no amount of wishing will rid them of interloper Philippe Lyonnais, who has the gall to open one of his world famous pastry shops right down the street. Philippe’s creations seem to hold a magic of their own, drawing crowds of beautiful women to their little isle amidst the Seine, and tempting even Magalie to venture out of her ivory tower and take a chance, a taste…a kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parisian princesses, chocolate witches, patissier princes and sweet wishes—an enchanting tale of amour et chocolat.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Paris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathtakingly beautiful, the City of Light seduces the senses, its cobbled streets thrumming with possibility. For American Cade Corey, it's a dream come true, if only she can get one infuriating French chocolatier to sign on the dotted line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chocolate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melting, yielding yet firm, exotic, its secrets are intimately known to Sylvain Marquis. But turn them over to a brash American waving a fistful of dollars? &lt;i&gt;Jamais!&lt;/i&gt; Not unless there's something much more delectable on the table...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stolen Pleasure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether confections taken from a locked shop or kisses in the dark, is there anything sweeter?</description>

  <description>Julie Otsuka's commanding debut novel paints a portrait of the Japanese internment camps unlike any we have ever seen. With crystalline intensity and precision, Otsuka uses a single family to evoke the deracination "both physical and emotional" of a generation of Japanese Americans. In five chapters, each flawlessly executed from a different point of view "the mother receiving the order to evacuate; the daughter on the long train ride to the camp; the son in the desert encampment; the family's return to their home; and the bitter release of the father after more than four years in captivity" she has created a small tour de force, a novel of unrelenting economy and suppressed emotion. Spare, intimate, arrestingly understated, &lt;i&gt;When the Emperor Was Divine&lt;/i&gt; is a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and an unmistakably resonant lesson for our times. It heralds the arrival of a singularly gifted new novelist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The debut cookbook from Joshua McFadden, a chef with the soul of a farmer and the palate of a visionary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joshua McFadden, chef and owner of renowned trattoria Ava Gene’s in Portland, Oregon, is a vegetable whisperer. After years racking up culinary cred at New York City restaurants like Lupa, Momofuku, and Blue Hill, he managed the trailblazing Four Season Farm in coastal Maine, where he developed an appreciation for every part of the plant and learned to coax the best from vegetables at each stage of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Six Seasons, McFadden channels both farmer and chef, highlighting the evolving attributes of vegetables throughout their growing seasons—an arc from spring to early summer to midsummer to the bursting harvest of late summer, then ebbing into autumn and, finally, the earthy, mellow sweetness of winter. Each chapter begins with recipes featuring raw vegetables at the start of their season. As weeks progress, McFadden turns up the heat—grilling and steaming, then moving on to sautés, pan roasts, braises, and stews. His ingenuity is on display in 225 revelatory recipes that celebrate flavor at its peak.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - Part love story, part workplace drama, this sharply observed novel is a witty critique of the false judgments we make in a social-media-obsessed world. &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sophie Kinsella has written her most timely novel yet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere Katie Brenner looks, someone else is living the life she longs for, particularly her boss, Demeter Farlowe. Demeter is brilliant and creative, lives with her perfect family in a posh townhouse, and wears the coolest clothes. Katie's life, meanwhile, is a daily struggle--from her dismal rental to her oddball flatmates to the tense office politics she's trying to negotiate. No wonder Katie takes refuge in not-quite-true Instagram posts, especially as she's desperate to make her dad proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, just as she's finding her feet--not to mention a possible new romance--the worst happens. Demeter fires Katie. Shattered but determined to stay positive, Katie retreats to her family's farm in Somerset to help them set up a vacation business. London has never seemed so far away--until Demeter unexpectedly turns up as a guest. Secrets are spilled and relationships rejiggered, and as the stakes for Katie's future get higher, she must question her own assumptions about what makes for a truly meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Kinsella is celebrated for her vibrant, relatable characters and her great storytelling gifts. Now she returns with all of the wit, warmth, and wisdom that are the hallmarks of her bestsellers to spin this fresh, modern story about presenting the perfect life when the reality is far from the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in a sexy new series featuring the hockey players of the Brooklyn Bruisers and the women who win their hearts—from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Ivy Years series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In high school they were the perfect couple—until the day Georgia left Leo in the cold...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey player Leo Trevi has spent the last six years trying to do two things: get over the girl who broke his heart, and succeed in the NHL. But on the first day he’s called up to the newly franchised Brooklyn Bruisers, Leo gets checked on both sides, first by the team’s coach—who has a long simmering grudge, and then by the Bruisers’ sexy, icy publicist—his former girlfriend Georgia Worthington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying goodbye to Leo was one of the hardest things Georgia ever had to do—and saying hello again isn’t much easier. Georgia is determined to keep their relationship strictly professional, but when a press conference microphone catches Leo declaring his feelings for her, things get really personal, really fast....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ISBN13: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48845486-the-hating-game" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780062439604&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm not usually a gushy reviewer, but wow, I loved the Hating Game. LOVED IT. I made the mistake of starting it about 7:30 pm last night and then read myself into needing 2 lattes this morning. Full review soon, once I can form a coherent thought beyond, "OMG, it was so good."]]>

Outwardly, she appears resilient and tenacious, but inwardly, she's losing hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Will Cooper: The attractive, 21-year-old new neighbor with an intriguing passion for slam poetry and a unique sense of humor. Within days of their introduction, Will and Layken form an intense emotional connection, leaving Layken with a renewed sense of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long after an intense, heart-stopping first date, they are slammed to the core when a shocking revelation forces their new relationship to a sudden halt. Daily interactions become impossibly painful as they struggle to find a balance between the feelings that pull them together, and the secret that keeps them apart.</description>

  <description>The only purebred vampire left on the planet and the leader of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who killed his parents centuries ago. But when his most trusted fighter is killed—orphaning a half-breed daughter unaware of her heritage or her fate—Wrath must put down his dagger and usher the beautiful female into another world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racked by a restlessness in her body that wasn’t there before, Beth Randall is helpless against the dangerously sexy man who comes to her at night with shadows in his eyes. His tales of the Brotherhood and blood frighten her. Yet his touch ignites a dawning new hunger—one that threatens to consume them both…</description>

  <description>From #1 "New York Times" bestselling author Sylvia Day comes the provocative masterstroke of abandon and obsession that redefined the meaning of desire and became a global phenomenon... &lt;br /&gt; "Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness."&lt;br /&gt; ""&lt;br /&gt; He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily &lt;br /&gt; Gideon "knew." He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each others most private wounds and desires. &lt;br /&gt; The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart "</description>

  <description>A star quarterback and a feisty detective play for keeps in this sporty, sexy, sassy novel—a long-awaited new entry in the beloved, award-winning, New York Times bestselling author’s fan-favorite Chicago Stars football series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Dove is a woman with a dream—to become the best detective in the city of Chicago. First job? Trail former Chicago Stars quarterback, Cooper Graham. Problem? Graham’s spotted her, and he’s not happy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why a good detective needs to think on her feet. “The fact is...I’m your stalker. Not full-out barmy. Just...mildly unhinged.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper soon finds herself working for Graham himself, although not as the bodyguard he refuses to admit he so desperately needs. Instead, he’s hired her to keep an eye on the employees at his exclusive new nightclub. But Coop’s life might be in danger, and Piper’s determined to protect him, whether he wants it or not. (Hint: Not!) If only she weren’t also dealing with a bevy of Middle Eastern princesses, a Pakistani servant girl yearning for freedom, a teenager who just wants to fit in, and an elderly neighbor demanding Piper find her very dead husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Cooper Graham himself, a legendary sports hero who always gets what he wants—even if what he wants is a feisty detective hell bent on proving she’s as tough as he is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bustling streets of Chicago to a windswept lighthouse on Lake Superior to the glistening waters of Biscayne Bay, two people who can’t stand to lose will test themselves and each other to discover what matters most.</description>

  <description>Jeanne Wakatsuki was seven years old in 1942 when her family was uprooted from their home and sent to live at Manzanar internment camp—with 10,000 other Japanese Americans. Along with searchlight towers and armed guards, Manzanar ludicrously featured cheerleaders, Boy Scouts, sock hops, baton twirling lessons and a dance band called the Jive Bombers who would play any popular song except the nation's #1 hit: "Don't Fence Me In."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Farewell to Manzanar&lt;/i&gt; is the true story of one spirited Japanese-American family's attempt to survive the indignities of forced detention—and of a native-born American child who discovered what it was like to grow up behind barbed wire in the United States.</description>

  <description>Nell is twenty-six and has never been to Paris. She's never even been on a romantic weekend away--to anywhere--before. Traveling abroad isn't really her thing. But when Nell's boyfriend fails to show up for their mini-vacation, she has the opportunity to prove everyone--including herself--wrong. Alone in Paris, Nell finds a version of herself she never knew existed: independent and intrepid. Could this turn out to be the most adventurous weekend of her life? Funny, charming, and irresistible, &lt;i&gt;Paris for One&lt;/i&gt; is quintessential Jojo Moyes--as are the other stories that round out the collection.</description>

  <description>Sloan will go through hell and back for those she loves. &lt;br /&gt;And she does, every single day. &lt;br /&gt;After finding herself stuck in a relationship with the dangerous and morally corrupt Asa Jackson, Sloan will do whatever it takes to get by until she's able to find a way out. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing will get in her way. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing except Carter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloan is the best thing to ever happen to Asa. And if you ask Asa, he'd say he's the best thing to ever happen to Sloan. Despite Sloan's disapproval of Asa's sinister lifestyle, he does exactly what he needs to do in order to stay a step ahead in his business. He also does exactly what he needs to do in order to stay a step ahead of Sloan. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing will get in his way. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing except Carter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times bestselling author, Colleen Hoover, writing as C. Hoover. &lt;br /&gt;This book was originally written as a side project by the author. It previously appeared on other platforms under the same title, but has since been slightly edited from its original content and formatted specifically for kindle. Please note that the content of this book is more graphic than the content of other books written by this author, hence the distinction between the names. This title is recommended for mature audiences only due to extreme graphic content. Recommended for readers 18+. &lt;br /&gt;Warning: For readers who might be triggered by sensitive subject matter, this book contains scenes which depict rape, murder and other graphic violence.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;What he wants he gets...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knox Masters is a quarterback's worst nightmare. Warrior. Champion. And...virgin. Knox knows what he wants--and he gets it. All American Football player? Check. NFL pros scouting him? Check. Now, he's set his sight on two things. The national title. And Ellie Campbell. Sure, she's the sister of his fellow teammate, but that's not going to stop him. Especially not when he’s convinced Ellie is the one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;...but he's never met her before.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ellie isn't as sure. She's trying to start a new life and she's not interested in a relationship...with anyone. Beside it's not just her cardinal rule of never dating her brother's teammates that keeps her away, but Ellie has a dark secret that would jeopardize everything Knox is pursuing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knox has no intention of losing. Ellie has no intention of giving in.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;He’s a fighter in the rink, but he’s about to learn that playing nice can help you score...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As team captain and enforcer, Patrick O'Doul puts the bruise in the Brooklyn Bruisers. But after years of hard hits, O'Doul is feeling the burn, both physically and mentally. He conceals his pain from his coach and trainers, but when his chronic hip injury becomes too obvious to ignore, they send him for sessions with the team’s massage therapist.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After breaking up with her long-term boyfriend, Ari Bettini is in need of peace of mind. For now, she’s decided to focus on her work: rehabilitating the Bruisers’ MVP. O'Doul is easy on the eyes, but his reaction to her touch is ice cold. Ari is determined to help O'Doul heal, but as the tension between them turns red hot, they both learn that a little TLC does the body good...</description>

  <description>Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All’s fair in love and work. The first standalone romance by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 international bestselling author Christina Lauren (&lt;i&gt;Beautiful Bastard&lt;/i&gt;) is a sexy, compulsively readable romantic comedy that dives headlong into the thrill and doubt of modern love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the odds against them from an embarrassing meet-awkward at a mutual friend’s Halloween party, Carter and Evie immediately hit it off. Even the realization that they’re both high-powered agents at competing firms in Hollywood isn’t enough to squash the fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when their two agencies merge—causing the pair to vie for the same position—all bets are off. What could have been a beautiful, blossoming romance turns into an all-out war of sabotage. Carter and Evie are both thirtysomething professionals—so why can’t they act like it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Carter stop trying to please everyone and see how their mutual boss is really playing the game? Can Evie put aside her competitive nature long enough to figure out what she really wants in life? Can their actor clients just be something close to human? Whether these two Hollywood love/hatebirds get the storybook Hollywood ending or just a dramedy of epic proportions, you will get to enjoy Christina Lauren’s heartfelt, raucous, and hilarious romance style at its finest.</description>

  <description>Lexie Bellamy can handle a boardroom. Relationships, however, are a minefield that always blow up. When a business trip takes her to Spain, Lexie knows she'll have no problem closing the deal. But spending uninterrupted one-on-one time with her crazy-hot coworker might be more than she can take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the office, Lexie gets to call the shots. But this trip is the perfect opportunity for Dane Huntley to show his gorgeous boss how good it can feel when someone else takes charge... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles away from home, giving in to Dane's naughty commands feels so easy. But when the trip is over, Lexie's determined to go back to their professional relationship. Dane, though, has other ideas. He'll have to prove that what they've found together is real... and he has no intention of letting go.</description>

  <description>Clara Morgan is living the dream, if you can call rebranding hotels that are desperate for a new life and running any kind of marathon a dream. Which she does. But the career she loves and the endurance races that keep her adrenaline pumping have kept her too busy to put down any roots. Growing up in foster care, she’s never been able to establish traditions of her own, which may be why she’s fascinated by the rituals that generations-old family resorts are known for. She’s especially interested in the Bryant Mountain House, and not just for their secret recipe for the yummy, gooey, can’t-get-enough-of Hot Cross Buns….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archie Bryant, the man with the Buns, is fifth generation and one-day-owner of the charming yet run-down Bryant Mountain House in Bailey Falls, New York. He’s determined to save his family’s legacy from the wrecking ball the old-fashioned way—by gritting his teeth and doing what needs to be done. There’s no way Archie will be influenced by the new hotel branding expert his father brought in to turn one hundred and fifty years of tradition on its head just to attract a faster, younger, slicker crowd. But when some of Clara’s ideas start bringing in new, paying customers, Archie can’t deny that she may have just given him a shot at keeping his resort open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s sticky, it’s messy, it’s sweet, it’s &lt;i&gt;Buns&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Baby, it's cold outside . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Tis the night before Christmas Eve and Holly wishes she hadn't volunteered to work the night shift. The weather is frightful and getting worse by the minute, and the same old annoying carols are blasting from the bookstore's speakers. But Holly's holiday spirit returns when the store's sexy new assistant manager arrives to keep her company. He has muscled arms, baby blue eyes, and a sweet pair of lips she wouldn't mind meeting under the mistletoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam is glad the snow is keeping away customers-it gives him a chance to get close to his favorite employee. Holly has always been a mystery to Sam, like a beautiful present he'd love to unwrap. When they're trapped by a full-blown blizzard, Holly breaks into the Christmas cookie display. Sam busts out a bottle of vodka from the boss's office. Soon the two are trading heated kisses-as well as secrets neither has ever felt safe enough to tell before. What started out as one naughty night together turns into something so much more.</description>

      <![CDATA[Loved it. I'm usually eyerolly about holiday romances, but Let it Snow is a fantastic short read to get you into the holiday spirit. <br /><br />There's enough complexity in both Sam and Holly's backstories that this isn't just a superficial retail romance hookup. These two have had their eyes on each other...]]>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Katy Evans comes a sizzling new contemporary romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's won the hearts of millions. But is he willing to lose his?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I met the president’s son when we were both young. Matthew Hamilton was handsome, polished, and intelligent. I’d never met a guy like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He promised me that he’d never run for president. I promised that if he did, I’d be by his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three terms later, an invitation to join Matthew Hamilton’s campaign is the most exhilarating opportunity I’ve ever experienced. I'm determined to make a difference; he is determined to win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focused on his goal, Matt is steadfast, ruthless, and disarming. All eyes are on him and his popularity is surging. But soon, the next possible president of the United States is possessing me in more ways than one—and despite the risks, I'm helpless to resist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're stealing touches, stealing moments, and stealing away at night. But our chemical connection is quickly becoming dangerously combustive, putting not only my heart, but Matt's chance at the presidency on the line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning will take everything. Walking away will be the hardest thing of all.</description>

      <![CDATA[TLDR: Good premise and timing with the 2016 election, but highly questionable re: social media and points off for two identical descriptions of Matt's hotness at 39% and 61%. Yeah, nitpicky, but even I caught it. Will I read book 2? Sigh, probably.<br /><br />*******<br />With the election right...]]>

  <description>Kate Reid's whirlwind romance with billionaire playboy Rylan Bellamy complicated her life in ways she'd worked to avoid. She'd fallen hard for his flirtatious charm and given him the one thing no other man had: her trust. Just as Kate began to imagine a future with Rylan, everything fell apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's starting over in New York...but even the glittering streets of Manhattan can't erase the memory of Rylan knocking her off her feet and sweeping her into the most erotic, unforgettable week of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been months, and Rylan still can't forget Kate. Months since he bared his soul at her feet. Months since he drove away the only woman to ever make him &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt;. Kate changed his world and now Rylan is determined to win her back-no matter what it takes. After crossing an ocean to reach her, he makes a deal with Kate: One more week, for one more chance. Now it's up to Rylan to show Kate &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the ways they fit together . . . and prove that this player has met his perfect match.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Jeanette Grey has become a must-read voice in romance. &lt;i&gt;Seven Nights to Surrender&lt;/i&gt; is lyrical, stunningly sexy, and brings swoons for days."&lt;br /&gt; --- Christina Lauren, &lt;i&gt;New York Times bestselling author&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day, he'll show her a side of Paris not found in any guidebook. By night, he'll introduce her to a passion beyond her wildest dreams. In this sensuous story of indulgence and desire, Jeanette Grey delivers one of the most romantic reads of the year and proves why she is fast becoming a must-read star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SEVEN NIGHTS TO SURRENDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate arrives in Paris hoping to find inspiration. Instead she finds Rylan. In a swirl of stolen kisses and hot, tangled sheets, Kate is quickly swept away by the sexy stranger, longing to surrender to his expert touch. With Rylan, nothing is forbidden-except the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An American ex-pat worth millions, Rylan never flaunts his fortune. Rather, he guards his identity from everyone, especially women. No strings, no commitments, no complications. But the second his lips taste Kate's soft, sweet skin, everything changes. For the first time, Rylan has found someone to share his every want and need. Yet he knows that secrets stand between them. To keep her, he'll need to confess the truth before it's too late . . . even if doing so could mean losing Kate forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four consecutive weeks on the New York Times and #1 in Romance. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out like any other morning on the train.&lt;br /&gt;Until I became mesmerized by the guy sitting across the aisle.&lt;br /&gt;He was barking at someone on his phone like he ruled the world.&lt;br /&gt;Who did the stuck-up suit think he was...God?&lt;br /&gt;Actually, he looked like a God. That was about it.&lt;br /&gt;When his stop came, he got up suddenly and left. So suddenly, he dropped his phone on the way out.&lt;br /&gt;I might have picked it up.&lt;br /&gt;I might have gone through all of his photos and called some of the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;I might have held onto the mystery man's phone for days―until I finally conjured up the courage to return it.&lt;br /&gt;When I traipsed my ass across town to his fancy company, he refused to see me.&lt;br /&gt;So, I left the phone on the empty desk outside the arrogant jerk's office.&lt;br /&gt;I might have also left behind a dirty picture on it first though.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't expect him to text back.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't expect our exchanges to be hot as hell.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't expect to fall for him―all before we even met.&lt;br /&gt;The two of us couldn't have been any more different.&lt;br /&gt;Yet, you know what they say about opposites.&lt;br /&gt;When we finally came face to face, we found out opposites sometimes do more than attract―we consumed each other.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing could have prepared me for the ride he took me on. And I certainly wasn't prepared for where I'd wind up when the ride was over.&lt;br /&gt;All good things must come to an end, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Except our ending was one I didn't see coming.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Elegant, brutal, and profound, this magnificent debut captures the grit and glory of modern Hawai'i with breathtaking force and accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a stunning collection that announces the arrival of an incredible talent, Kristiana Kahakauwila travels the islands of Hawai'i, making the fabled place her own. Exploring the deep tensions between local and tourist, tradition and expectation, façade and authentic self, &lt;i&gt;This Is Paradise&lt;/i&gt; provides an unforgettable portrait of life as it’s truly being lived on Maui, Oahu, Kaua'i and the Big Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the gut-punch of “Wanle,” a beautiful and tough young woman wants nothing more than to follow in her father’s footsteps as a legendary cockfighter. With striking versatility, the title story employs a chorus of voices—the women of Waikiki—to tell the tale of a young tourist drawn to the darker side of the city’s nightlife. “The Old Paniolo Way” limns the difficult nature of legacy and inheritance when a patriarch tries to settle the affairs of his farm before his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Exquisitely written and bursting with sharply observed detail, Kahakauwila’s stories remind us of the powerful desire to belong, to put down roots, and to have a place to call home.</description>

  <description>It's the most annoying question and they just can't help asking you:&lt;p&gt;Why are you single?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a brisk October morning in New York, Julie Jenson, a single thirty-eight-year-old book publicist, gets a hysterical phone call from her friend Georgia. Reeling from her husband's announcement that he is leaving her for a samba teacher, Georgia convinces a reluctant Julie to organize a fun girls' night out with all of their single friends to remind her why it is so much fun not to be tied down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the night becomes a wake-up call for Julie because none of her friends seem to be having much fun: Alice, a former legal aid attorney has recently quit her job to start dating for a living; Serena, who is so busy becoming a fully realized person that she can't find time to look for a mate; and Ruby, a curvy and compassionate woman, has been mourning the death of her cat for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed up being single in Manhattan, Julie sets off to find out how women around the world deal with this dreaded phenomenon. From Paris to Rio to Sydney, Bali, Beijing, Mumbai, and Reykjavik, Julie falls in love, gets her heart broken, sees the world, and learns more than she ever dreamed possible. Written in Liz Tuccillo's pitch-perfect, hilarious, and relatable voice, &lt;i&gt;How to Be Single&lt;/i&gt; is the ultimate novel for the adventurer in us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A genius novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;Where'd You Go, Bernadette&lt;/i&gt;, about a day in the life of Eleanor Flood, forced to abandon her small ambitions when she awakes to a strange, new future unfolding. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor knows she's a mess. But today, she will tackle the little things. She will shower and get dressed. She will have her poetry and yoga lessons after dropping off her son, Timby. She won't swear. She will initiate sex with her husband, Joe. But before she can put her modest plan into action-life happens. Today, it turns out, is the day Timby has decided to fake sick to weasel his way into his mother's company. It's also the day Joe has chosen to tell his office-but not Eleanor-that he's on vacation. Just when it seems like things can't go more awry, an encounter with a former colleague produces a graphic memoir whose dramatic tale threatens to reveal a buried family secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TODAY WILL BE DIFFERENT is a hilarious, heart-filled story about reinvention, sisterhood, and how sometimes it takes facing up to our former selves to truly begin living.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J. R. Ward s thrilling finale of the Bourbon Kings series, the Bradford family dynasty teeters on the edge of collapse after the murder of their patriarch and a shocking arrest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the death of William Baldwine, the head of the Bradford family, was ruled a suicide. But then his eldest son and sworn enemy, Edward, came forward and confessed to what was, in fact, a murder. Now in police custody, Edward mourns not the disintegration of his family or his loss of freedom . . . but the woman he left behind. His love, Sutton Smythe, is the only person he has ever truly cared about, but as she is the CEO of the Bradford Bourbon Company s biggest competitor, any relationship between them is impossible. And then there s the reality of the jail time that Edward is facing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane Baldwine was supposed to remain in his role of playboy, forever in his big brother Edward s shadow. Instead he has become the new head of the family and the company. Convinced that Edward is covering for someone else, Lane and his true love, Lizzie King, go on the trail of a killer only to discover a secret that is as devastating as it is game-changing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lane rushes to discover the truth, and Sutton finds herself irresistibly drawn to Edward in spite of his circumstances, the lives of everyone at Easterly will never be the same again. For some, this is good; for others, it could be a tragedy beyond imagining. Only one thing s for certain: Love survives all things. Even murder.</description>

      <![CDATA[Strong finish! J.R. Ward wraps up The Bourbon Kings' series with equal parts crazytown and happily ever after for our friends in Charlemont, Kentucky. <br /><br />What I have always loved about this series is that it has so much of that Dynasty-esque family saga vibe...with the added color of J.R.
