  <description>The year is 1988. The place, Baja California. Private Investigator Philip Marlowe – now in his seventy-second year – has been living out his retirement in the terrace bar of La Fonda hotel. Sipping margaritas, playing cards, his silver-tipped cane at the ready. When in saunter two men dressed like undertakers. With a case that has his name written all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last Marlowe is back where he belongs. His mission is to investigate Donald Zinn – supposedly drowned off his yacht, leaving a much younger and now very rich wife. Marlowe’s speciality. But is Zinn actually alive? Are the pair living off the spoils?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set between the border and badlands of Mexico and California, Lawrence Osborne’s resurrection of the iconic Marlowe is an unforgettable addition to the Raymond Chandler canon.</description>

  <description>In a forgotten patch of French countryside, a woman is battling her demons embracing exclusion yet wanting to belong, craving freedom whilst feeling trapped, yearning for family life but at the same time wanting to burn the entire house down. Given surprising leeway by her family for her increasingly erratic behaviour, she nevertheless feels ever more stifled and repressed. Motherhood, womanhood, the banality of love, the terrors of desire, the inexplicable brutality of another person carrying your heart forever &lt;i&gt;Die, My Love&lt;/i&gt; faces all this with a raw intensity. It's not a question of if a breaking point will be reached, but rather when and how violent a form will it take?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Wally Lamb weaves an evocative, deeply affecting tapestry of one Baby Boomer's life—Felix Funicello, introduced in &lt;em&gt;Wishin’ and Hopin’&lt;/em&gt;—and the trio of unforgettable women who have changed it, in this radiant homage to the resiliency, strength, and power of women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Take You There&lt;/em&gt; centers on Felix, a film scholar who runs a Monday night movie club in what was once a vaudeville theater. One evening, while setting up a film in the projectionist booth, he’s confronted by the ghost of Lois Weber, a trailblazing motion picture director from Hollywood’s silent film era. Lois invites Felix to revisit—and in some cases relive—scenes from his past as they are projected onto the cinema’s big screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these magical movies, the medium of film becomes the lens for Felix to reflect on the women who profoundly impacted his life. There’s his daughter Aliza, a Gen Y writer for &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; who is trying to align her post-modern feminist beliefs with her lofty career ambitions; his sister, Frances, with whom he once shared a complicated bond of kindness and cruelty; and Verna, a fiery would-be contender for the 1951 Miss Rheingold competition, a beauty contest sponsored by a Brooklyn-based beer manufacturer that became a marketing phenomenon for two decades. At first unnerved by these ethereal apparitions, Felix comes to look forward to his encounters with Lois, who is later joined by the spirits of other celluloid muses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against the backdrop of a kaleidoscopic convergence of politics and pop culture, family secrets, and Hollywood iconography, Felix gains an enlightened understanding of the pressures and trials of the women closest to him, and of the feminine ideals and feminist realities that all women, of every era, must face.</description>

  <description>From the author of the Man Booker–shortlisted His Bloody Project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The methodical but troubled Chief Inspector Georges Gorski visits the wife of a lawyer killed in a road accident, the accident on the A35. The case is unremarkable, the visit routine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mme Barthelme—alluring and apparently unmoved by the news—has a single question: where was her husband on the night of the accident? The answer might change nothing, but it could change everything. And Gorski sets a course for what can only be a painful truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the dead man’s reticent son is also looking for answers. And his search will have far more devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Accident on the A35 is the spellbinding follow-up to Graeme Macrae Burnet’s debut noir novel The Disappearance of Adèle Bedeau.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'What a writer he was; he could flip over a sentence so gently, and showthe underbelly in a heartbeat. His work is always quietly compassionate'&lt;/b&gt; Elizabeth Strout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this final collection of ten exquisite, perceptive and profound stories, William Trevor probes into the depths of the human spirit. Here we encounter a tutor and his pupil, whose lives are thrown into turmoil when they meet again years later; a young girl who discovers the mother she believed dead is alive and well; and a piano-teacher who accepts her pupil's theft in exchange for his beautiful music. These gorgeous stories - the last that Trevor wrote before his death - affirm his place as one of the world's greatest storytellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Trevor is a master of both language and storytelling'&lt;/b&gt; Hilary Mantel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'He is one of the great short-story writers, at his best the equal of Chekhov'&lt;/b&gt; John Banville&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'The greatest living writer of short stories in the English language'&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Available for the first time from Riverhead—the debut novel from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Moth Smoke&lt;/i&gt;, Mohsin Hamid’s deftly conceived first novel, immediately marked him as an uncommonly gifted and ambitious young literary talent to watch when it was published in 2000. It tells the story of Daru Shezad, who, fired from his banking job in Lahore, begins a decline that plummets the length of Hamid’s sharply drawn, subversive tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-paced and unexpected, &lt;i&gt;Moth Smoke &lt;/i&gt;was ahead of its time in portraying a contemporary Pakistan far more vivid and complex than the exoticized images of South Asia then familiar to the West. It established Mohsin Hamid as an internationally important writer of substance and imagination and the premier Pakistani author of our time, a promise he has amply fulfilled with each successive book. This debut novel, meanwhile, remains as compelling and deeply relevant to the moment as when it appeared more than a decade ago.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NOMINATED FOR THE EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST FIRST NOVEL&lt;/b&gt; Vivian is a cosmopolitan Taiwanese-American tourist who often escapes her busy life in London through adventure and travel. Johnny is a 15-year-old Irish teenager, living a neglected life on the margins of society. He has grown up in a family where crime is customary, violence is a necessity, and everything--and anyone--can be yours for the taking.&lt;br /&gt; As Vivian looks to find her calling professionally, she delights in exploring foreign countries, rolling hillsides, and new cultures. And as a young, single woman, she has grown used to experiencing life on her own. But all of that changes when, on one bright spring afternoon in West Belfast, Vivian's path collides with Johnny and culminates in a horrifying act of violence. &lt;br /&gt; In the aftermath of the incident, both Johnny and Vivian are forced to confront the chain of events that led to the attack. Vivian must struggle to recapture the woman that she was and the woman she aspired to be, while dealing with a culture and judicial system that treats assault victims as less than human. Johnny, meanwhile, flees to the sanctity of his transitory Irish clan. But when he is finally brought to reckon for his crimes, Vivian learns that justice is not always as swift or as fair as she would hope. Inspired by true events, DARK CHAPTER is both a literary masterpiece and a riveting novel of suspense about of the dark chapters and chance encounters that can irrevocably determine the shape of our lives.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five years after her classic &lt;i&gt;On Photography&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Sontag returns to the subject of visual representations of war and violence in our culture today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the spectacle of the sufferings of others (via television or newsprint) affect us? Are viewers inured--or incited--to violence by the depiction of cruelty? &lt;i&gt;In Regarding the Pain of Others&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Sontag takes a fresh look at the representation of atrocity--from Goya's The Disasters of War to photographs of the American Civil War, lynchings of blacks in the South, and the Nazi death camps, to contemporary horrific images of Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Israel and Palestine, and New York City on September 11, 2001.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Regarding the Pain of Others&lt;/i&gt; Susan Sontag once again changes the way we think about the uses and meanings of images in our world, and offers an important reflection about how war itself is waged (and understood) in our time.</description>

  <description>Twenty-two years old and in the grip of a massive addiction, Patrick Melrose is forced to fly to New York to collect his father’s ashes. Over the course of a weekend, Patrick’s remorseless search for drugs on the avenues of Manhattan, haunted by old acquaintances and insistent inner voices, sends him into a nightmarish spiral. Alone in his room at the Pierre Hotel, he pushes body and mind to the very edge – desperate always to stay one step ahead of his rapidly encroaching past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad News was originally published, along with Never Mind and Some Hope, as part of a three book omnibus also called Some Hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How To Be Both&lt;/i&gt; is a novel all about art's versatility. Borrowing from painting's fresco technique to make an original literary double-take, it's a fast-moving genre-bending conversation between forms, times, truths and fictions. There's a renaissance artist of the 1460s. There's the child of a child of the 1960s. Two tales of love and injustice twist into a singular yarn where time gets timeless, structural gets playful, knowing gets mysterious, fictional gets real - and all life's givens get given a second chance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;LAPD Detective Renée Ballard teams up with Harry Bosch in the new thriller from #1 NYT bestselling author Michael Connelly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renée Ballard is working the night beat again, and returns to Hollywood Station in the early hours only to find a stranger rifling through old file cabinets. The intruder is retired detective Harry Bosch, working a cold case that has gotten under his skin. Ballard kicks him out, but then checks into the case herself and it brings a deep tug of empathy and anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bosch is investigating the death of fifteen-year-old Daisy Clayton, a runaway on the streets of Hollywood who was brutally murdered and her body left in a dumpster like so much trash. Now, Ballard joins forces with Bosch to find out what happened to Daisy and finally bring her killer to justice.</description>

  <description>The first one-volume hardcover edition of the eleven autobiographical stories that were closest to Updike's heart. With full-cloth binding and a silk ribbon marker. EVERYMAN'S POCKET CLASSICS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an interview, Updike once said, "If I had to give anybody one book of me, it would be the &lt;i&gt;Olinger Stories.&lt;/i&gt;" These stories were originally published in &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; and then in various collections before Vintage first put them together in one volume in 1964, as a paperback original. They follow the life of one character from the age of ten through manhood, in the small Pennsylvania town of Olinger (pronounced, according to Updike, with a long O and a hard G), which was loosely based on Updike's own hometown. "All the stories draw from the same autobiographical well," Updike explained, "the only child, the small town, the grandparental home, the move in adolescence to a farm." The selection was made and arranged by Updike himself, and was prefaced by a lovely 1,400-word essay by the author that has never been reprinted in full elsewhere until now.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never Mind&lt;/i&gt;, the first installment in Edward St. Aubyn’s wonderful, wry, and profound Patrick Melrose Cycle, follows five-year-old Patrick through a single day, as the Melrose family awaits the arrival of guests. Bright and imaginative, young Patrick struggles daily to contend with the searing cruelty of his father and the resignation of his embattled mother. But on this day he must endure an unprecedented horror—one that splits his world in two. In &lt;i&gt;Never Mind&lt;/i&gt;, St. Aubyn renders this vivid tragedy with profound grace and precision, and introduces us to the unforgettable, complex figure of Patrick Melrose.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Where I Find Myself&lt;/em&gt; is the first major single book retrospective of one of America's leading photographers. It is organized in inverse chronological order and spans the photographer's whole career to date: from Joel Meyerowitz's most recent picture all the way back to the first photograph he ever took. The book covers all of Joel Meyerowitz's great projects: his work inspired by the artist Morandi, his work on trees, his exclusive coverage of Ground Zero, his trips in the footsteps of Robert Frank across the US, his experiments comparing color and black and white pictures, and of course his iconic street photography work. Joel Meyerovitz is incredibly eloquent and candid about how photography works or doesn't, and this should be an inspiration to anyone interested in photography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The view from here 2017-2012 --&lt;br /&gt;Elemental 2010-2001 --&lt;br /&gt;Cities 2008-1976 --&lt;br /&gt;Portraits 2017-1980 --&lt;br /&gt;The world upside down 1990-1976 --&lt;br /&gt;Letting go of the catch 1976-1968 --&lt;br /&gt;American in the time of Vietnam 1972-1968 --&lt;br /&gt;On the road 1967-1964 --&lt;br /&gt;The colour question 1968-1963 --&lt;br /&gt;Out into the street 1964-1962 --&lt;br /&gt;Coda.</description>

  <description>Loudon Wainwright III, the son of esteemed Life magazine columnist Loudon Wainwright, Jr., is the patriarch of one of America’s great musical families. He is the former husband of Kate McGarrigle and Suzzy Roche, and father of Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Lucy Wainwright Roche, and Lexie Kelly Wainwright. With a career spanning more than four decades, Wainwright has established himself as one of the most enduring singer-songwriters who emerged from the late 1960s. Not only does he perform regularly across America and in Europe, but he is a sought-after actor, having appeared in many movies and TV series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is probably no singer-songwriter who has so blatantly inserted himself into his songs. The songs can be laugh-out-loud funny, but they also can cut to the bone. In this memoir, Wainwright details the family history his lyrics have referenced and the fractured relationships among generations: the alcoholism, the infidelities, the competitiveness—as well as the closeness, the successes, and the joy. Wainwright reflects on the experiences that have influenced his work, including boarding school, the music business, swimming, macrobiotics, sex, incarceration, and something he calls Sir Walter Raleigh Syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wainwright writes poignantly about being a son—a status that dominates many of his songs—but also about being a parent, a brother, and a grandfather. His lyrics are featured throughout the book, amplifying his prose and showing the connections between the songs and real life. Wainwright also includes selections from his father’s brilliant Life magazine columns—and, in so doing, reestablishes his father as a major essayist of his era. A funny and insightful meditation on family, inspiration, and art, Liner Notes will thrill fans, readers, and anyone who appreciates the intersection of music and life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An extraordinary work of long fiction from the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright — a tour de force of memory, mystery, death, and life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Shepard's searing, evocative narrative opens with a man in his house at dawn, surrounded by aspens and by coyotes cackling far away as he quietly navigates the distance between present and past. More and more, memory is overtaking him: in his mind he sees himself in a movie-set trailer, his young face staring back at him in a mirror surrounded by lightbulbs. In his dreams and in visions he sees his late father — sometimes in miniature, sometimes flying planes, sometimes at war. By turns, he sees the bygone America of his childhood — the farmland and the feedlots, the rail yards and the diners — and, most hauntingly, his father's young girlfriend, with whom he also became involved, setting into motion a tragedy that has stayed with him. His complex interiority is filtered through views of mountains and deserts as he drives across the country, propelled by jazz, Benzedrine, rock and roll, and a restlessness born out of exile. The rhythms of theater, the language of poetry, and a flinty humor combine in this stunning meditation on the nature of experience, at once celebratory, surreal, poignant, and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An essential overview of the problems of our world today -- and how we should prepare for tomorrow -- from the world's leading public intellectual&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have two choices. We can be pessimistic, give up, and help ensure that the worst will happen. Or we can be optimistic, grasp the opportunities that surely exist, and maybe help make the world a better place. Not much of a choice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From peerless political thinker Noam Chomsky comes an exploration of rising neoliberalism, the refugee crisis in Europe, the Black Lives Matter movement, the dysfunctional US electoral system, and the prospects and challenges of building a movement for radical change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including four up-to-the-minute interviews on the 2016 American election campaign and global resistance to Trump, this Penguin Special is a concise introduction to Chomsky's ideas and his take on the state of the world today.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Norwegian by Night,&lt;/i&gt; and Short Listed for the 2017 CWA Gold Dagger Award, a novel about two men on a misbegotten quest to save the girl they failed to save decades before&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1991. Near Checkpoint Zulu, one hundred miles from the Kuwaiti border, Thomas Benton meets Arwood Hobbes. Benton is a British journalist who reports from war zones in part to avoid his lackluster marriage and a daughter he loves but cannot connect with; Arwood is a mid-western American private who might be an insufferable ignoramus, or might be a genuine lunatic with a death wish--it's hard to tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desert Storm is over, peace has been declared, but as they argue about whether it makes sense to cross the nearest border in search of an ice cream, they become embroiled in a horrific attack in which a young local girl in a green dress is killed as they are trying to protect her. The two men walk away into their respective lives. But something has cracked for them both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-two years later, in another place, in another war, they meet again and are offered an unlikely opportunity to redeem themselves when that same girl in green is found alive and in need of salvation. Or is she?</description>

  <description>As someone who has spent forty years in psychology with a long-standing interest in evolution, I'll just assimilate Howard Bloom's accomplishment and my amazement.-DAVID SMILLIE, Visiting Professor of Zoology, Duke University In this extraordinary follow-up to the critically acclaimed The Lucifer Principle, Howard Bloom-one of today's preeminent thinkers-offers us a bold rewrite of the evolutionary saga. He shows how plants and animals (including humans) have evolved together as components of a worldwide learning machine. He describes the network of life on Earth as one that is, in fact, a ""complex adaptive system,"" a global brain in which each of us plays a sometimes conscious, sometimes unknowing role. and he reveals that the World Wide Web is just the latest step in the development of this brain. These are theories as important as they are radical. Informed by twenty years of interdisciplinary research, Bloom takes us on a spellbinding journey back to the big bang to let us see how its fires forged primordial sociality. As he brings us back via surprising routes, we see how our earliest bacterial ancestors built multitrillion-member research and development teams a full 3.5 billion years ago. We watch him unravel the previously unrecognized strands of interconnectedness woven by crowds of trilobites, hunting packs of dinosaurs, feathered flying lizards gathered in flocks, troops of baboons making communal decisions, and adventurous tribes of protohumans spreading across continents but still linked by primitive forms of information networking. We soon find ourselves reconsidering our place in the world. Along the way, Bloom offers us exhilarating insights into the strange tricks of body and mind that have organized a variety of life forms: spiny lobsters, which, during the Paleozoic age, participated in communal marching rituals; and bees, which, during the age of dinosaurs, conducted collective brainwork. This fascinating tour continues on to the sometimes brutal subculture wars that have spurred the growth of human civilization since the Stone Age. Bloom shows us how culture shapes our infant brains, immersing us in a matrix of truth and mass delusion that we think of as reality.&lt;br /&gt;Global Brain is more than just a brilliantly original contribution to the ongoing debate on the inner workings of evolution. It is a ""grand vision,"" says the eminent evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, a work that transforms our very view of who we are and why.</description>

  <description>One of Poland's most imaginative and lyrical writers, Olga Tokarczuk presents us with a detective story with a twist in DRIVE YOUR PLOW OVER THE BONES OF THE DEAD. After her two dogs go missing and members of the local hunting club are found murdered, teacher and animal rights activist Janina Duszejko becomes involved in the ensuing investigation. Part magic realism, part detective story, DRIVE YOUR PLOW OVER THE BONES OF THE DEAD is suspenseful and entertaining reimagining of the genre interwoven with poignant and insightful commentaries on our perceptions of madness, marginalised people and animal rights.</description>

  <description>Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves &amp;amp; each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war &amp;amp; revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked &amp;amp; comforted. They have enriched lives &amp;amp; destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals &amp;amp; visionaries whose ideas shook civilization &amp;amp; helped make us who we are. Elegant, insightful &amp;amp; startlingly modern, the philosophy of Lucretius deeply influenced the course of European thought; here, he provides one of the first accounts of atomic theory, argues that there can be no life of the soul after death &amp;amp; explores the sickness that we call love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SHORTLISTED FOR THE BAILEYS WOMEN'S PRIZE FOR FICTION &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman arrives in Athens in the height of summer to teach a writing course. Once there, she becomes the audience to a chain of narratives as the people she meets tell her one after another the stories of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the neighbouring passenger on the flight out and his tales of fast boats and failed marriages, the storytellers talk of their loves and ambitions and pains, their anxieties, their perceptions and daily lives. In the stifling heat and noise of the city the sequence of voices begins to weave a complex human tapestry: the experience of loss, the nature of family life, the difficulty of intimacy and the mystery of creativity itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHORTLISTED FOR THE FOLIO PRIZE, THE GOLDSMITHS PRIZE AND LONGLISTED FOR THE IMPAC PRIZE&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Cows can love, play games, bond and form strong, life-long friendships. They can sulk, hold grudges, and they have preferences and can be vain. All these characteristics and more have been observed, documented, interpreted and retold by Rosamund Young based on her experiences looking after the family farm's herd on Kite's Nest Farm in Worcestershire, England. Here the cows, sheep, hens and pigs all roam free. There is no forced weaning, no separation of young from siblings or mother. They seek and are given help when they request it and supplement their own diets by browsing and nibbling leaves, shoots, flowers and herbs. Rosamund Young provides a fascinating insight into a secret world - secret because many modern farming practices leave no room for displays of natural behavior yet, ironically, a happy herd produces better quality beef and milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foreword by Alan Bennett</description>

A pleasure to bathe in a knowledgeable person's view of animals we ignorantly take for granted, shinning some enlightenment about their behavior and interactions.]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Laura Lippman returns with a superb novel of psychological suspense about a pair of lovers with the best intentions and the worst luck: two people locked in a passionate yet uncompromising game of cat and mouse. But instead of rules, this game has dark secrets, forbidden desires, inevitable betrayals—and cold-blooded murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;One is playing a long game. But which one?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They meet at a local tavern in the small town of Belleville, Delaware. Polly is set on heading west. Adam says he’s also passing through. Yet she stays and he stays—drawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him. Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair. Still, each holds something back from the other—dangerous, even lethal, secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then someone dies. Was it an accident, or part of a plan? By now, Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each other’s lives and lies that neither one knows how to get away—or even if they want to. Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something—or someone—has to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which one will it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by James M. Cain’s masterpieces &lt;em&gt;The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indemnity,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mildred Pierce&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sunburn &lt;/em&gt;is a tantalizing modern noir from the incomparable Laura Lippman.</description>

  <description>Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525–1569) was the greatest Dutch draftsman of the sixteenth century, his drawings highly valued in his lifetime, sold both as originals and through copperplate prints. Though he drew on a long pictorial tradition, he invested his drawings with powerful new subjects and forms, presenting a complicated visual world that was humorous and earthy, yet also astute and deeply critical of the society around him.&lt;br /&gt;            &lt;br /&gt; This lavishly illustrated catalog examines Bruegel’s artistic origins and provides an overview of his entire body of work, setting him in the context of forebears such as Hieronymous Bosch while also making a strong case for Bruegel’s many innovations in genres as widely diverse as landscape art and social satire.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Video games, conspiracy theories, breakdown, murder: Everything’s gonna be all right—until it isn’t...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How many hours of sleep did you get last night? Rate your overall mood from 1 to 5, 1 being poor. Rate your stress level from 1 to 5, 5 being severe. Are you experiencing depression or thoughts of suicide? Is there anything in your personal life that is affecting your duty?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sabrina disappears, an airman in the U.S. Air Force is drawn into a web of suppositions, wild theories, and outright lies. He reports to work every night in a bare, sterile fortress that serves as no protection from a situation that threatens the sanity of Teddy, his childhood friend and the boyfriend of the missing woman. Sabrina’s grieving sister, Sandra, struggles to fill her days as she waits in purgatory. After a videotape surfaces, we see devastation shown through a cinematic lens, as true tragedy is distorted when fringe thinkers and conspiracy theorists begin to interpret events to fit their own narratives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The follow-up to Nick Drnaso’s &lt;i&gt;Beverly&lt;/i&gt;, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, &lt;i&gt;Sabrina&lt;/i&gt; depicts a modern world devoid of personal interaction and responsibility, where relationships are stripped of intimacy through glowing computer screens. Presenting an indictment of our modern state, Drnaso contemplates the dangers of a fake-news climate. Timely and articulate, &lt;i&gt;Sabrina&lt;/i&gt; leaves you gutted, searching for meaning in the aftermath of disaster.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A comedy/tragedy of manners. The new novel from the Man Booker-shortlisted author of The Sisters Brothers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Price – tart widow, possessive mother and Upper East Side force of nature – is in dire straits, beset by scandal. Her adult son Malcolm is no help, mired in a permanent state of arrested development. And then there's their cat, who Frances believes houses the spirit of her late husband, an infamously immoral world-class cad whose gruesome tabloid death rendered Frances and Malcolm social outcasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curious trio head for the exit, escape pariahdom and land in Paris – a backdrop for self-destruction and economic ruin, and peopled by a number of singular characters: a bashful private investigator, an aimless psychic and Mme. Reynard, aggressive houseguest and friendly American expat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with pathos and wit, French Exit is a one-of-a-kind tragedy of manners, a riotous send-up of high society and a moving story of mothers and sons.</description>

  <description>With an introduction from the New York Times by Joel Lovell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Saunders’ most wryly hilarious and disturbing collection yet, Tenth of December illuminates human experience and explores figures lost in a labyrinth of troubling preoccupations. A family member recollects a backyard pole dressed for all occasions; Jeff faces horrifying ultimatums and the prospect of DarkenfloxxTM in some unusual drug trials; and Al Roosten hides his own internal monologue behind a winning smile that he hopes will make him popular. With dark visions of the future riffing against ghosts of the past and the ever-settling present, this collection sings with astonishing charm and intensity.</description>

  <description>One of the world's most celebrated scholars, Stephen Greenblatt has crafted both an innovative work of history and a thrilling story of discovery, in which one manuscript, plucked from a thousand years of neglect, changed the course of human thought and made possible the world as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, &lt;em&gt;On the Nature of Things&lt;/em&gt;, by Lucretius—a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The copying and translation of this ancient book—the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age—fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson.</description>

  <description>A blockbuster thriller from No.1 Sunday Times bestselling author Sam Bourne, in which Maggie Costello uncovers an assassination plot to kill the tyrannical new president.&lt;br /&gt;If a president is out of control&lt;br /&gt;Who will take the ultimate step?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unthinkable has happened. The United States has elected a volatile demagogue as president, backed by his ruthless chief strategist, Crawford Mac’ McNamara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a war of words with the North Korean regime spirals out of control and the President comes perilously close to launching a nuclear attack, it's clear someone has to act, or the world will be reduced to ashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Maggie Costello, a seasoned Washington operator and avowed liberal, discovers an inside plot to kill the president and faces the ultimate moral dilemma. Should she save the president and leave the free world at the mercy of an increasingly crazed would-be tyrant or commit treason against her Commander in Chief and risk plunging the country into a civil war?</description>

  <description>What are the consequences if the people given control over our government have no idea how it works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The election happened," remembers Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, then deputy secretary of the Department of Energy. "And then there was radio silence." Across all departments, similar stories were playing out: Trump appointees were few and far between; those that did show up were shockingly uninformed about the functions of their new workplace. Some even threw away the briefing books that had been prepared for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Lewis’s brilliant narrative takes us into the engine rooms of a government under attack by its own leaders. In Agriculture the funding of vital programs like food stamps and school lunches is being slashed. The Commerce Department may not have enough staff to conduct the 2020 Census properly. Over at Energy, where international nuclear risk is managed, it’s not clear there will be enough inspectors to track and locate black market uranium before terrorists do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willful ignorance plays a role in these looming disasters. If your ambition is to maximize short-term gains without regard to the long-term cost, you are better off not knowing those costs. If you want to preserve your personal immunity to the hard problems, it’s better never to really understand those problems. There is upside to ignorance, and downside to knowledge. Knowledge makes life messier. It makes it a bit more difficult for a person who wishes to shrink the world to a worldview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are dangerous fools in this book, there are also heroes, unsung, of course. They are the linchpins of the system—those public servants whose knowledge, dedication, and proactivity keep the machinery running. Michael Lewis finds them, and he asks them what keeps them up at night.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An extraordinary story of love and hope from the bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war, Saeed and Nadia share a cup of coffee, and their story begins. It will be a love story but also a story about war and a world in crisis, about how we live now and how we might live tomorrow. Before too long, the time will come for Nadia and Saeed to leave their homeland. When the streets are no longer useable and all options are exhausted, this young couple will join the great outpouring of those fleeing a collapsing city, hoping against hope, looking for their place in the world . . .</description>

  <description>From Roald Dahl, the master of the sting in the tail, a newly collected book of his darkest stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;'There is a pleasure sure in being mad, which none but madmen know'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our greatest fear is of losing control - of our lives, but, most of all, of ourselves.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A classic portrait of America's vast frontier that inspired the Western genre in fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published more than fifty years ago, &lt;i&gt;The Big Sky&lt;/i&gt; is the first of A. B. Guthrie Jr.'s epic adventure novels set in the American West. Here he introduces Boone Caudill, Jim Deakins, and Dick Summers: traveling the Missouri River from St. Louis to the Rockies, these frontiersmen live as trappers, traders, guides, and explorers. The story centers on Caudill, a young Kentuckian driven by a raging hunger for life and a longing for the blue sky and brown earth of big, wild places. Caught up in the freedom and savagery of the wilderness, Caudill becomes an untamed mountain man, whom only the beautiful daughter of a Blackfoot chief dares to love.</description>

      <![CDATA[Read about this novel in an essay and decided to have a squint and, although published in the 1940s, a masterwork, and in theme and treatment a progenitor of Cormac McCarthy's Western novels, sans biblical overtones. Very few novelists can describe nature that wraps the mind in sensation, and Gut...]]>

  <description>A stunningly original debut collection, &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Shot Out My Eye Is Dead&lt;/em&gt; is about lives across history marked by violence and longing. In ten stories of impressive range, Chanelle Benz displays a staggering command of craft as she crisscrosses through time and space to create a complex mosaic of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “The Diplomat’s Daughter,” a woman disappears and resurfaces across the world as a deadly force of nature with many names. “West of the Known” tells of a brother and sister who turn outlaw in a wild and brutal landscape. “James III” lays bare the struggle of a young Philadelphia boy who must contend with the contradictions of privilege, violence, and the sway of an incarcerated father. In “That We May Be All One Sheepefolde,” a sixteenth-century English monk suffers the dissolution of his monastery and the loss of all that he held sacred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters in Benz’s wildly imaginative collection are as varied as any in recent literature, subverting boundaries of race, gender, and class, but they share a thirst for adventure that sends them rushing toward moral crossroads, becoming victims and perpetrators along the way. Riveting, visceral, and heartbreaking, Benz’s stories of identity, abandonment, and fierce love come together in a daring, arresting vision. Benz emerges on the scene as an indomitable talent and a brilliant new literary force.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartstopping, beautifully written debut, telling the story of one girl’s search for freedom.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘You think you’re invincible. You think you won’t ever miss. We need to put the fear on you. You need to surrender yourself to death before you ever begin, and accept your life as a state of grace, and then and only then will you be good enough.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 14, Turtle Alveston knows the use of every gun on her wall; That chaos is coming and only the strong will survive it; That her daddy loves her more than anything else in this world. And he’ll do whatever it takes to keep her with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t know why she feels so different from the other girls at school; Why the line between love and pain can be so hard to see; Why making a friend may be the bravest and most terrifying thing she has ever done. And what her daddy will do when he finds out …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes strength is not the same as courage.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes leaving is not the only way to escape.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes surviving isn't enough. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1970, one of Mississippi s more colorful weekly newspapers, &lt;u&gt;The&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Ford County Times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; went bankrupt. To the surprise and dismay of many, ownership was assumed by a 23-year-old college dropout, named Willie Traynor. The future of the paper looked grim until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. Willie Traynor reported all the gruesome details, and his newspaper began to prosper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi. The trial came to a startling and dramatic end when the defendant threatened revenge against the jurors if they convicted him. Nevertheless, they found him guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in Mississippi in 1970, life didn't necessarily mean life, and nine years later Danny Padgitt managed to get himself paroled. He returned to Ford County, and the retribution began.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When in 1999 I began writing for &lt;/i&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;i&gt; ... my stance became that of the ingenuous Martian who had just landed on a gorgeous &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;alien planet ... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Montaigne's &lt;/i&gt;que sais-je&lt;i&gt;. A little light, a little wonder, some skepticism, some awe, some squinting, some &lt;/i&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;i&gt;. Pick a thing up, study it, shake it, skip it across a still surface to see how much felt and lively life got baked into it. Does it sail? Observe. See what can be done.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorrie Moore has been writing criticism for over thirty years, and her forensically intelligent, witty, and engaging essays are collected together here for the first time. Whether writing on &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;, Margaret Atwood, or &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt;, her pieces always offer elegant and surprising insights into multiple forms of art. Crucially, Moore is a practitioner who writes criticism; her discussion of other people's work is based on her understanding of what it really takes to make something out of nothing: of what it takes to make art. This lends her encounters with books, films, and paintings the uniquely intimate quality which has made them so immensely popular with readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sparkling, articulate prose - studded with frequently hilarious insights - Moore's meditations are a rare opportunity to witness a brilliant mind thinking things through and figuring things out on the page.</description>

  <description>Help your Dad win his next dinner table debate this Father’s day with Fantasyland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You don't have to be mad to live here, but it helps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to understand Trump's America, how the lines between reality and illusion have become dangerously blurred, you have to go back to the very beginning and take a dizzying road trip across five centuries of crackpot delusion and make-believe from Salem to Scientology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Pilgrim Fathers onward, America has been a place where renegades and freaks came in search of freedom to create their own realities with little objectively regulated truth standing in their way. To invent and believe what the hell you like is in some ways an unwritten constitutional right. Every citizen is more than ever gloriously free to construct and promote any vision of the world he or she devoutly believes to be true. That do-your-own-thing freedom - run amok since the individualism and relativism of the 1960s and later the unprecedented free-for-all world of the Internet, is the driving credo of America's current transformation where the difference between opinion and fact is rapidly crumbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fantasyland&lt;/i&gt; is a journey that joins the dots between the disparate crazed franchises of true believers – America’s endless homespun rebooting of Christianity from Mormons to charismatics, medicine shows to new age quacks, conspiracy theorists of every stripe, showmen hucksters from P T Barnum to Trump himself, Creationists to climate change deniers, extra-terrestrial obsessives to gun-toting libertarians, anti-Government paranoia, pseudoscience, survivalists and satanic panic. Along the way Kurt Andersen has created a unique and raucous history of America and a new paradigm for understanding our post-factual world.</description>

  <description>Before Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich begins a summer job at a law firm in Louisiana, working to help defend men accused of murder, she thinks her position is clear. The child of two lawyers, she is staunchly anti-death penalty. But the moment convicted murderer Ricky Langley’s face flashes on the screen as she reviews old tapes―the moment she hears him speak of his crimes―she is overcome with the feeling of wanting him to die. Shocked by her reaction, she digs deeper and deeper into the case. Despite their vastly different circumstances, something in his story is unsettlingly, uncannily familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crime, even the darkest and most unsayable acts, can happen to any one of us. As Alexandria pores over the facts of the murder, she finds herself thrust into the complicated narrative of Ricky’s childhood. And by examining the details of Ricky’s case, she is forced to face her own story, to unearth long-buried family secrets, and reckon with a past that colors her view of Ricky's crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But another surprise awaits: She wasn’t the only one who saw her life in Ricky’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An intellectual and emotional thriller that is also a different kind of murder mystery, &lt;i&gt;The Fact Of a Body&lt;/i&gt; is a book not only about how the story of one crime was constructed―but about how we grapple with our own personal histories. Along the way it tackles questions about the nature of forgiveness, and if a single narrative can ever really contain something as definitive as the truth. This groundbreaking, heart-stopping work, ten years in the making, shows how the law is more personal than we would like to believe―and the truth more complicated, and powerful, than we could ever imagine.</description>

  <description>'I seem to have banged on this year rather more than usual. I make no apology for that, nor am I nervous that it will it make a jot of difference. I shall still be thought to be kindly, cosy and essentially harmless. I am in the pigeon-hole marked 'no threat' and did I stab Judi Dench with a pitchfork I should still be a teddy bear.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan Bennett's third collection of prose Keeping On Keeping On follows in the footsteps of the phenomenally successful Writing Home and Untold Stories, each published ten years apart. This latest collection contains Bennett's peerless diaries 2005 to 2015, reflecting on a decade that saw four premieres at the National Theatre (The Habit of Art, People, Hymn and Cocktail Sticks), a West End double-bill transfer, and the films of The History Boys and The Lady in the Van.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a provocative sermon on private education given before the University at King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and 'Baffled at a Bookcase' offers a passionate defence of the public library. This is an engaging, humane, sharp, funny and unforgettable record of life according to the inimitable Alan Bennett.</description>

  <description>Céleste Albaret was Marcel Proust's housekeeper in his last years, when he retreated from the world to devote himself to&lt;i&gt; In Search of Lost Time&lt;/i&gt;. She could imitate his voice to perfection, and Proust himself said to her, "You know everything about me." Her reminiscences of her employer present an intimate picture of the daily life of a great writer, who was also a deeply peculiar man, while Madame Albaret herself proves to be a shrewd and engaging companion.</description>

  <description>The prize-winning, bestselling tale of love, loss, family and the lives we live moment by moment, from a stunning new voice in European fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom's heavily pregnant girlfriend Karin is rushed to hospital with severe flu. While the doctors are able to save the baby, they are helpless in the face of what transpires to be acute Leukemia, and in a moment as fleeting as it is cruel Tom gains a daughter but loses his soul-mate. In Every Moment is the story of a year that changes everything, as Tom must reconcile the fury of bereavement with the overwhelming responsibility of raising his daughter, Livia, alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns tragic and redemptive, meditative and breathless, achingly poignant and darkly funny, this heavily autobiographical novel has been described in its native Sweden as 'hypnotic', 'impossible to resist' and 'one of the most powerful books about grief ever written'.</description>

  <description>Master prose stylist Julian Barnes presents a collection of stories whose characters are growing old and facing the end of their lives -- some with bitterness, some with resignation and others with raging defiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Life is just a premature reaction to death,” was what Viv’s husband used to say. Once her lover and friend, he is now Viv’s semi-helpless charge, who is daily sinking ever deeper into dementia. In “Appetite,” Viv has found a way to reach her husband: by reading aloud snippets of recipe books until he calls out indelible -- and sometimes unfortunate -- scenes locked away in his brain. In “The Things You Know,” two elderly friends enjoy their monthly breakfast meetings that neither would ever think of missing. Of course, all they really have in common is a fondness for flat suede shoes and a propensity for thinking spiteful, unspoken thoughts about one another’s dead husbands. “The Fruit Cage” is narrated by a middle-aged man whose seemingly orderly upbringing is harrowingly undone when he discovers that his parents’ old age is not necessarily a time of serenity but actually an age of aroused, perhaps violent, passions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these stories, Julian Barnes displays the erudition, wit and uncanny insight into the human mind that mark him as one of today’s great writers, one whose intellect and humour never obscure a genuine affection for his characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>As dusk approaches a small Dublin suburb in the summer of 1984, mothers begin to call their children home. But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox—his partner and closest friend—find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richly atmospheric and stunning in its complexity, &lt;i&gt;In the Woods&lt;/i&gt; is utterly convincing and surprising to the end.</description>

There, a trying, enlightening slog....]]>

When he later inherited the 'netsuke', they unlocked a story far larger and more dramatic than he could ever have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;From a burgeoning empire in Odessa to &lt;i&gt;fin de siecle&lt;/i&gt; Paris, from occupied Vienna to Tokyo, Edmund de Waal traces the netsuke's journey through generations of his remarkable family against the backdrop of a tumultuous century.</description>

  <description>Harry Bosch is back as a volunteer working cold cases for the San Fernando Police Department and is called out to a local drug store where a young pharmacist has been murdered. Bosch and the town's 3-person detective squad sift through the clues, which lead into the dangerous, big business world of pill mills and prescription drug abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, an old case from Bosch's LAPD days comes back to haunt him when a long-imprisoned killer claims Harry framed him, and seems to have new evidence to prove it. Bosch left the LAPD on bad terms, so his former colleagues aren't keen to protect his reputation. He must fend for himself in clearing his name and keeping a clever killer in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two unrelated cases wind around each other like strands of barbed wire. Along the way Bosch discovers that there are two kinds of truth: the kind that sets you free and the kind that leaves you buried in darkness.</description>

  <description>He will not admit it to Rhea and Lars - never, of course not - but Sheldon can't help but wonder what it is he's doing here..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighty-two years old, and recently widowed, Sheldon Horowitz has grudgingly moved to Oslo, with his grand-daughter and her Norwegian husband. An ex-Marine, he talks often to the ghosts of his past - the friends he lost in the Pacific and the son who followed him into the US Army, and to his death in Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sheldon witnesses the murder of a woman in his apartment complex, he rescues her six-year-old son and decides to run. Pursued by both the Balkan gang responsible for the murder, and the Norwegian police, he has to rely on training from over half a century before to try and keep the boy safe. Against a strange and foreign landscape, this unlikely couple, who can't speak the same language, start to form a bond that may just save them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extraordinary debut, featuring a memorable hero, Norwegian by Night is the last adventure of a man still trying to come to terms with the tragedies of his life. Compelling and sophisticated, it is both a chase through the woods thriller and an emotionally haunting novel about ageing and regret.</description>

  <description>Hello, Im Stephen Fry. Now time for the first outing of a brand, spanking new feature here on The Incomplete Utter History of Classical Music putting some unsuspecting figure in music under the spotlight. In his Incomplete Utter History of Classical Music, Stephen Fry presents a potted and brilliantly rambling 700-year history of classical music and the world as we know it. Along this musical journey he casually throws in references to pretty much whatever takes his fancy, from the Mongol invasion of Russia and Mr. Khan (Genghis to his friends), the founding of the MCC, the Black Death (which once again became the new black in England), to the heady revolutionary atmosphere of Mozarts Don Giovanni and the deep doo-doo that Louis XVI got into (or du-du as the French would say). Its all here. Ambrose and early English plainsong, Bach, Mozart (beloved of mobile phones everywhere), Beethoven, Debussy, Wagner (the old romantic), right up to the present day. Entertaining and brilliantly written, this is a pretty reckless romp of a history through classical music and much much more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;PERFECT for fans of Roald Dahl.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think you know Dahl? Think again. There's still a whole world of Dahl to discover in a newly collected book of his deliciously dark tales for adults . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;'Cruelty has a human heart&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; . . .'&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when we mean to be kind we can sometimes be cruel. We each have a streak of nastiness inside us. In these ten tales of cruelty master storyteller Roald Dahl explores how and why it is we make others suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among others, you'll read the story of two young bullies and the boy they torment, the adulterous wife who uncovers her husband's secret, the man with a painting tattooed on his back whose value he doesn't appreciate and the butler and chef who run rings around their obnoxious employer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roald Dahl reveals even more about the darker side of human nature in seven other centenary editions: &lt;i&gt;Lust, Madness, Deception, Innocence, Trickery, War &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Fear&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Have never read much of Dahl because, unlike millions, I don't particularly enjoy his prose. HIghly efficient, smooth as butter, but there often seems to be a gimmick behind his tales, of which this book is a selection of. Semi-pleasant, if, like me, you read one every few weeks and draw it out....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Pema Chödrön's perennially best-selling classic on overcoming life's difficulties cuts to the heart of spirituality and personal growth--now in a newly designed 20th-anniversary edition with a new afterword by Pema--makes for a perfect gift and addition to one's spiritual library. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we live our lives when everything seems to fall apart—when we are continually overcome by fear, anxiety, and pain? The answer, Pema Chödrön suggests, might be just the opposite of what you expect. Here, in her most beloved and acclaimed work, Pema shows that moving toward painful situations and becoming intimate with them can open up our hearts in ways we never before imagined. Drawing from traditional Buddhist wisdom, she offers life-changing tools for transforming suffering and negative patterns into habitual ease and boundless joy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Michael Connelly, a new thriller introducing a driven young detective trying to prove herself in the LAPD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renée Ballard works the night shift in Hollywood, beginning many investigations but finishing none as each morning she turns her cases over to day shift detectives. A once up-and-coming detective, she's been given this beat as punishment after filing a sexual harassment complaint against a supervisor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one night she catches two cases she doesn't want to part with: the brutal beating of a prostitute left for dead in a parking lot and the killing of a young woman in a nightclub shooting. Ballard is determined not to give up at dawn. Against orders and her own partner's wishes, she works both cases by day while maintaining her shift by night. As the cases entwine they pull her closer to her own demons and the reason she won't give up her job no matter what the department throws at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>No one burned hotter than Eve Babitz. Possessing skin that radiated “its own kind of moral laws,” spectacular teeth, and a figure that was the stuff of legend, she seduced seemingly everyone who was anyone in Los Angeles for a long stretch of the 1960s and ’70s. One man proved elusive, however, and so Babitz did what she did best, she wrote him a book. &lt;i&gt;Slow Days, Fast Company&lt;/i&gt; is a full-fledged and full-bodied evocation of a bygone Southern California that far exceeds its mash-note premise. In ten sun-baked, Santa Ana wind–swept sketches, Babitz re-creates a Los Angeles of movie stars distraught over their success, socialites on three-day drug binges holed up in the Chateau Marmont, soap-opera actors worried that tomorrow’s script will kill them off, Italian femmes fatales even more fatal than Babitz. And she even leaves LA now and then, spending an afternoon at the house of flawless Orange County suburbanites, a day among the grape pickers of the Central Valley, a weekend in Palm Springs where her dreams of romance fizzle and her only solace is Virginia Woolf. In the end it doesn’t matter if Babitz ever gets the guy—she seduces us.</description>

  <description>Alfred Hayes is one of the secret masters of the twentieth century novel, a journalist, scriptwriter and poet who possessed an immaculate ear and who wrote with razorsharp intelligence about passion and its payback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Face for the World to See&lt;/i&gt; is set in Hollywood, where the tonic for anonymity is fame and you’re only as real as your image. At a party, the narrator, a screenwriter, rescues a young woman who staggers with drunken determination into the Pacific. He is living far from his wife in New York and long ago shed any illusions about the value of his work. He just wants to be left alone. And yet without really meaning to, he gets involved with the young woman, who has, it seems, no illusions about love, especially with married men. She’s a survivor, even if her beauty is a little battered from years of not quite making it in the pictures. She’s just like him, he thinks, and as their casual relationship takes on an increasingly troubled and destructive intensity, it seems that might just be true, only not in the way he supposes.</description>

  <description>Iry Paret's done his time -- two years for manslaughter in Louisiana's Angola State Penitentiary. Now the war vet and blues singer is headed to Montana, where he hopes to live clean working on a ranch owned by the father of his prison pal, Buddy Riordan. In prison, Iry tinkered with a song -- "The Lost Get-Back Boogie" -- that never came out quite right. Now, the Riordan family's problems hand him a new kind of trouble, with some tragic consequences. And Iry must get the tune right at last, or pay a fateful price.</description>

  <description>Discover the secrets of Hollywood storytelling in this fascinating collection, in which fifty screenwriters share the inside scoop about how they surmounted incredible odds to break into the business, how they transformed their ideas into box-office blockbusters, how their words helped launch the careers of major stars, and how they earned accolades and Academy Awards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entertaining, informative, and sometimes startling, &lt;em&gt;Tales from the Script&lt;/em&gt; features exclusive interviews with film's top wordsmiths, including John Carpenter (&lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt;), Nora Ephron (&lt;em&gt;Julie &amp;amp; Julia&lt;/em&gt;), John August (&lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;), and David hayter (&lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;). Read along as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Darabont explains why he sacrificed his salary to preserve the integrity of his hard-hitting adapta-tion of Stephen King's novella &lt;em&gt;The Mist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Goldman reveals why he's never had any interest in directing movies, despite having won Oscars for writing &lt;em&gt;All the President's Men&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Shelton explains why he nearly cut the spectacular speech that helped cement Kevin Costner's stardom in &lt;em&gt;Bull Durham&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Friedman describes the bizarre experience of getting hired by Steven Spielberg to adapt H. G. Wells's classic novel &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;—even though Spielberg hated Friedman's take on the material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Schrader (&lt;em&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/em&gt;) analyzes his legendary relationship with Martin Scorsese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane Black (&lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt;) reveals why the unrelenting hype around his multimillion-dollar script sales caused him to retreat from public life for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tales from the Script&lt;/em&gt; is a must for movie buffs who savor behind-the-scenes stories—and a master class for all those who dream of writing the Great American Screenplay, taught by those who made that dream come true.</description>

  <description>Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly original papers that invented the field of behavioral economics. One of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, Kahneman and Tversky’s extraordinary friendship incited a revolution in Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. In &lt;em&gt;The Undoing Project,&lt;/em&gt; Lewis shows how their Nobel Prize–winning theory of the mind altered our perception of reality.</description>

  <description>From one of our most acclaimed writers: a collection of tales set mainly in the American West, written with the terse lyricism, cinematic detail, and wry humor that have become Sam Shepard’s trademarks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A man traveling down Highway 90 West gets trapped alone overnight inside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, where he is tormented by an endless loop of Shania Twain songs. A wandering actor returns to his hometown and runs into an old friend, who recounts their teenage days of stealing cars, buying Benzedrine, and sleeping with whores in Tijuana. A Minnesota couple and their children, traveling south for vacation, are so caught up in the ordinary dramas of family life that they remain oblivious to the beauty of the Yucatan peninsula. Stunning, inventive, and powerful, these stories are Shepard at his flinty-eyed, unwavering best.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'A strange, dazzling novel, as audacious as it is lyrical, that hauls up insight, sorrow, and even - somehow - wit from the well of American history.' EMMA DONOGHUE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'A vivid, disturbing book, able to subvert itself in half a line, constantly challenging the reader's expectations. Its ghost map is quickly established in the reader's head, and as the characters fade into the margin of the final page, it is as if an inner landscape has altered. It is mature, accomplished, impressive.' HILARY MANTEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;You can’t tell me you haven’t heard.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Heard what?’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘About the lynching over in Marvel.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘The what?’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Ottie Lee Henshaw. Quick of mind and pleasing to the eye, she navigates a stifling marriage, a lecherous boss, and on one day in the summer of 1920, an odyssey across the countryside to witness a dark and fearful celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Calla Destry. A young black woman desperate to escape a place where the stench of violence hangs heavy in the air, and to find the lover who has promised her a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every road leads to the bedlam of Marvel. There are buses laid on and Klan members gathering. On the road lives will collide and be changed forever. &lt;i&gt;The Evening Road&lt;/i&gt; is the story of two remarkable women on the move through an America riven by fear and hatred, eager to flee the secrets they have left behind.</description>

  <description>A twelve-year-old girl and her younger brother go on the run in the woods of North Idaho, pursued by four men they have just watched commit murder---four men who know exactly who William and Annie are, and who know exactly where their desperate mother is waiting for news of her children’s fate. Retired cops from Los Angeles, the killers easily persuade the inexperienced sheriff to let them lead the search for the missing children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William and Annie’s unexpected savior comes in the form of an old-school rancher teetering on the brink of foreclosure. But as one man against four who will stop at nothing to silence their witnesses, Jess Rawlins needs allies, and he knows that one word to the wrong person could seal the fate of the children or their mother. In a town where most of the ranches like his have turned into acres of ranchettes populated by strangers, finding someone to trust won’t be easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With true-to-life, unforgettable characters and a ticking-clock plot that spans just over forty-eight hours, C.J. Box has created a thriller that delves into issues close to the heart: the ruthless power of greed over broken ideals, the healing power of community where unlikely heroes find themselves at the crossroads of duty and courage, and the truth about what constitutes a family. In a setting whose awesome beauty is threatened by those who want a piece of it, &lt;i&gt;Blue Heaven&lt;/i&gt; delivers twists and turns until its last breathtaking page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue Heaven&lt;/i&gt; is the winner of the 2009 Edgar Award for Best Novel.</description>

  <description>From the Emmy, PEN, Peabody, Critics' Choice, and Golden Globe Award-winning creator of the TV show Fargo comes the thriller of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a foggy summer night, 11 people - 10 privileged, one down-on-his-luck painter - depart Martha's Vineyard on a private jet headed for New York. Sixteen minutes later the unthinkable happens: The plane plunges into the ocean. The only survivors are Scott Burroughs - the painter - and a four-year-old boy who is now the last remaining member of an immensely wealthy and powerful media mogul's family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With chapters weaving between the aftermath of the crash and the backstories of the passengers and crew members - including a Wall Street titan and his wife, a Texan-born party boy just in from London, a young woman questioning her path in life, and a career pilot - the mystery surrounding the tragedy heightens. As the passengers' intrigues unravel, odd coincidences point to a conspiracy. Was it merely by dumb chance that so many influential people perished? Or was something far more sinister at work? Events soon threaten to spiral out of control in an escalating storm of media outrage and accusations. And while Scott struggles to cope with fame that borders on notoriety, the authorities scramble to salvage the truth from the wreckage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid pulse-quickening suspense, the fragile relationship between Scott and the young boy glows at the heart of this stunning novel, raising questions of fate, human nature, and the inextricable ties that bind us together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sweeping narrative history of a terrifying serial killer--America's first--who stalked Austin, Texas in 1885&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1800s, the city of Austin, Texas was on the cusp of emerging from an isolated western outpost into a truly cosmopolitan metropolis. But beginning in December 1884, Austin was terrorized by someone equally as vicious and, in some ways, far more diabolical than London's infamous Jack the Ripper. For almost exactly one year, the Midnight Assassin crisscrossed the entire city, striking on moonlit nights, using axes, knives, and long steel rods to rip apart women from every race and class. At the time the concept of a serial killer was unthinkable, but the murders continued, the killer became more brazen, and the citizens' panic reached a fever pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before it was all over, at least a dozen men would be arrested in connection with the murders, and the crimes would expose what a newspaper described as "the most extensive and profound scandal ever known in Austin." And yes, when Jack the Ripper began his attacks in 1888, London police investigators did wonder if the killer from Austin had crossed the ocean to terrorize their own city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With vivid historical detail and novelistic flair, &lt;i&gt;Texas Monthly&lt;/i&gt; journalist Skip Hollandsworth brings this terrifying saga to life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A world-renowned media and cultural critic offers an insightful analysis of serial TV drama and the modern art of the small screen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Television and TV viewing are not what they once were—and that’s a good thing, according to award-winning author and critic Clive James. Since serving as television columnist for the &lt;i&gt;London Observer&lt;/i&gt; from 1972 to 1982, James has witnessed a radical change in content, format, and programming, and in the very manner in which TV is watched. Here he examines this unique cultural revolution, providing a brilliant, eminently entertaining analysis of many of the medium’s most notable twenty-first-century accomplishments and their not always subtle impact on modern society—including such acclaimed serial dramas as &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad, The West Wing, Mad Men,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Sopranos, &lt;/i&gt;as well as the comedy &lt;i&gt;30 Rock&lt;/i&gt;. With intelligence and wit, James explores a television landscape expanded by cable and broadband and profoundly altered by the advent of Netflix, Amazon, and other “cord-cutting” platforms that have helped to usher in a golden age of unabashed binge-watching.</description>

  <description>A bullet shot through the window of Weldon Sonnier's house propels Dave Robicheaux back into the lives of a family he's not sure he wants to be reacquainted with. Weldon Sonnier's CIA-influenced past has led to dangerous connections and commitments, including debts to local mob boss Joey 'Meatballs' Gouza. As Weldon puts himself in the line of fire Lyle Sonnier, television evangelist and faith healer, reveals to Dave a violent family history that intersects menacingly with Dave's own. But overshadowing the manoeuvres of Gouza's gang is the spectre of racial politics and it is former Klansman Bobby Earl who will prove to be Dave Robicheaux's most elusive enemy.</description>

  <description>The New York Times bestseller from Academy award-winning actor Jeff Bridges and Zen leader and author of Bearing Witness, Bernie Glassman.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zen master Bernie Glassman compares Jeff Bridges’s iconic role in The Big Lebowski to a Lamed-Vavnik: one of the men in Jewish mysticism who “are simple and unassuming, and so good that, on account of them, God lets the world go on.” His buddy Jeff puts it another way. The wonderful thing about the Dude, he says, is that he’d always rather hug it out than slug it out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For more than a decade, Academy Award–winning actor Jeff Bridges and his buddhist teacher, renowned Roshi Bernie Glassman, have been close friends. Inspiring and often hilarious, The Dude and the Zen Master captures their freewheeling dialogue about life, laughter, and the movies with a charm and bonhomie that never fail to enlighten and entertain. Throughout, their remarkable humanism reminds us of the importance of doing good in a difficult world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Manifestos and immodest proposals from China's most famous artist and activist, culled from his popular blog, shut down by Chinese authorities in 2009.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2006, even though he could barely type, China's most famous artist started blogging. For more than three years, Ai Weiwei turned out a steady stream of scathing social commentary, criticism of government policy, thoughts on art and architecture, and autobiographical writings. He wrote about the Sichuan earthquake (and posted a list of the schoolchildren who died because of the government's "tofu-dregs engineering"), reminisced about Andy Warhol and the East Village art scene, described the irony of being investigated for "fraud" by the Ministry of Public Security, made a modest proposal for tax collection. Then, on June 1, 2009, Chinese authorities shut down the blog. This book offers a collection of Ai's notorious online writings translated into English--the most complete, public documentation of the original Chinese blog available in any language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New York Times called Ai "a figure of Warholian celebrity." He is a leading figure on the international art scene, a regular in museums and biennials, but in China he is a manifold and controversial presence: artist, architect, curator, social critic, justice-seeker. He was a consultant on the design of the famous "Bird's Nest" stadium but called for an Olympic boycott; he received a Chinese Contemporary Art "lifetime achievement award" in 2008 but was beaten by the police in connection with his "citizen investigation" of earthquake casualties in 2009. &lt;i&gt;Ai Weiwei's Blog &lt;/i&gt;documents Ai's passion, his genius, his hubris, his righteous anger, and his vision for China.</description>

  <description>A contemporary noir,&lt;em&gt; Already Dead &lt;/em&gt;is the tangled story of Nelson Fairchild Jr., disenfranchised scion to a northern California land fortune. A relentless failure, Nelson has botched nearly every scheme he's attempted to pull off. Now his future lies in a potentially profitable marijuana patch hidden in the lush old-growth redwoods on the family land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nelson has some serious problems. His marriage has fallen apart, and he may lose his land, cash and crop in the divorce. What's more, in need of some quick cash, he had foolishly agreed to smuggle $90,000 worth of cocaine through customs for Harry Lally, a major player in a drug syndicate. Chickening out just before bringing the drugs through, he flushed the powder. Now Lally wants him dead, and two goons are hot on his trail. Desperate, terrified and alone, for Nelson, there may be only one way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Denis Johnson's biggest and most complex book to date, and it perfectly showcases his signature themes of fate, redemption and the unraveling of the fabric of today's society. &lt;em&gt;Already Dead,&lt;/em&gt; with its masterful narrative of overlapping and entwined stories, will further fuel the acclaim that surrounds one of today's most fascinating writers.</description>

  <description>Inspector Erlendur returns in this gripping Icelandic thriller When a skeleton is discovered half-buried in a construction site outside of Reykjavík, Inspector Erlendur finds himself knee-deep in both a crime scene and an archeological dig. Bone by bone, the body is unearthed, and the brutalizing history of a family who lived near the building site comes to light along with it. Was the skeleton a man or a woman, a victim or a killer, and is this a simple case of murder or a long-concealed act of justice? As Erlendur tries to crack this cold case, he must also save his drug-addicted daughter from self destruction and somehow glue his hopelessly fractured family back together.</description>

  <description>In 1869, a brutal triple murder in the remote Wester Ross village of Culduie leads to the arrest of a seventeen-year-old crofter, Roderick Macrae. There is no question of Macrae’s guilt, but it falls to the country’s most eminent legal and psychiatric minds to uncover what drove him to his bloody deeds. Ultimately, the young man’s fate hinges on one key question: is he insane?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story ingeniously unfolds through a series of found documents, including police statements; the accused’s prison memoir; the account of renowned psychiatrist, J. Bruce Thomson; and a report of the trial, compiled from contemporary newspapers.</description>

  <description>7 hours, 46 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called "disgraceful," "third-rate," and "not nice" by Donald Trump, NBC News correspondent Katy Tur reported on—and took flak from—the most captivating and volatile presidential candidate in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tur lived out of a suitcase for a year and a half, following Trump around the country, powered by packets of peanut butter and kept clean with dry shampoo. She visited forty states with the candidate, made more than 3,800 live television reports, listened to endless loops of Elton John’s "Tiny Dancer"—a Trump rally playlist staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From day 1 to day 500, Tur documented Trump’s inconsistencies, fact-checked his falsities, and called him out on his lies. In return, Trump repeatedly singled out Tur. He tried to charm her, intimidate her, and shame her. At one point, he got a crowd so riled up against her, Secret Service agents had to walk her to her car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of it worked. Facts are stubborn. So was Tur. She was part of the first women-led politics team in the history of network news. The Boys on the Bus became the Girls on the Plane--but the circus remained. Through all the long nights, wild scoops, naked chauvinism, dodgy staffers, and fevered debates, no one had a better view than Tur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unbelievable&lt;/i&gt; is her darkly comic, fascinatingly bizarre, and often scary story of how America sent a former reality show host to the White House. It’s also the story of what it was like for Tur to be there as it happened, inside a no-rules world where reporters were spat on, demeaned, and discredited. Tur was a foreign correspondent who came home to her most foreign story of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FROM THE RECIPIENT OF THE  2017 Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>It is April 1975, and Saigon is in chaos. At his villa, a general of the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights out of the country. The general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles, unaware that one among their number, the captain, is secretly observing and reporting on the group to a higher-up in the Viet Cong. &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; is the story of this captain: a man brought up by an absent French father and a poor Vietnamese mother, a man who went to university in America, but returned to Vietnam to fight for the Communist cause. A gripping spy novel, an astute exploration of extreme politics, and a moving love story, &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; explores a life between two worlds and examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the wars we fight today.</description>

  <description>As a novelist, essayist, and cultural historian, John Berger is a writer of dazzling eloquence and arresting insight whose work amounts to a subtle, powerful critique of the canons of our civilization. In &lt;i&gt;About Looking&lt;/i&gt; he explores our role as observers to reveal new layers of meaning in what we see. How do the animals we look at in zoos remind us of a relationship between man and beast all but lost in the twentieth century? What is it about looking at war photographs that doubles their already potent violence? How do the nudes of Rodin betray the threats to his authority and potency posed by clay and flesh? And how does solitude inform the art of Giacometti? In asking these and other questions, Berger alters the vision of anyone who reads his work.</description>

  <description>29 avril-4 mai 1992.Pendant six jours, l’acquittement des policiers coupables d’avoir passé à tabac Rodney King met Los Angeles à feu et à sang.Pendant six jours, dix-sept personnes sont prises dans le chaos.Pendant six jours, Los Angeles a montré au monde ce qui se passe quand les lois n’ont plus cours.&lt;br /&gt;Le premier jour des émeutes, en plein territoire revendiqué par un gang, le massacre d’un innocent, Ernesto Vera, déclenche une succession d’événements qui vont traverser la ville.&lt;br /&gt;Dans les rues de Lynwood, un quartier éloigné du foyer central des émeutes, qui attirent toutes les forces de police et les caméras de télévision, les tensions s’exacerbent. Les membres de gangs chicanos profitent de la désertion des représentants de l’ordre pour piller, vandaliser et régler leurs comptes.&lt;br /&gt;Au cœur de ce théâtre de guerre urbaine se croisent sapeurs pompiers, infirmières, ambulanciers et graffeurs, autant de personnages dont la vie est bouleversée par ces journées de confusion et de chaos.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six jours &lt;/em&gt;est un roman choral magistral, une sorte de &lt;em&gt;The Wire &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Sur Écoute&lt;/em&gt;) transposé sur la côte Ouest, un texte provocant à la croisée de &lt;em&gt;Short Cuts &lt;/em&gt;et &lt;em&gt;Boyz N the Hood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Un récit épique fascinant, une histoire de violence, de vengeance et de loyautés.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Another country: How the Farm Security Administration introduced America to Americans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the ravages of the Great Depression, the United States &lt;strong&gt;Farm Security Administration&lt;/strong&gt; (FSA) was first founded in 1935 to address the country s rural poverty. Its efforts focused on improving the lives of sharecroppers, tenants, and very poor landowning farmers, with resettlement and collectivization programs, as well as modernized farming methods. In a parallel documentation program, the FSA hired a number of photographers and writers to record the lives of the rural poor and introduce America to Americans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book records the full reach of the FSA program from &lt;strong&gt;1935 to 1943&lt;/strong&gt;, honoring its &lt;strong&gt;vigor and commitment across subjects, states, and stylistic preferences&lt;/strong&gt;. The photographs are arranged into four broad regional sections but otherwise allowed to speak for themselves to provide individual impressions as much as they cumulatively build an &lt;strong&gt;indelible survey of a nation&lt;/strong&gt;. Through color and black-and-white images, we meet &lt;strong&gt;convicts, cotton workers, kids on the street, and relocated workers on the road&lt;/strong&gt;. We see subjects victim to the elements of nature and the timeless rituals of human life, as much as to the vagaries of the global economic market. We meet &lt;strong&gt;Dorothea Lange s iconic &lt;em&gt;Migrant Mother&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, weather-beaten and worn, with two children leaning on her shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unites all of the pictures is a &lt;strong&gt;commitment to the individuality and dignity of each subject&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as to the witness they bear to this particular period of the American past and to universal cycles of growing, playing, eating, aging, ailing, and dying. Through the lenses of such perceptive, sensitive photographers as &lt;strong&gt;Dorothea Lange, Jack Delano, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Walker Evans, &lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ben Shahn&lt;/strong&gt;, subjects are entrenched in the hardships of their historical lot, caught in the loop of humanity, and yet face the viewer with what is utterly their own: a unique, irreplaceable, often unforgettable presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the series: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bibliotheca Universalis&lt;/em&gt; Compact cultural companions celebrating the eclectic TASCHEN universe at an unbeatable, democratic price&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;Since we started our work as cultural archaeologists in 1980, the name TASCHEN has become synonymous with accessible, open-minded publishing. &lt;em&gt;Bibliotheca Universalis&lt;/em&gt; brings together nearly 100 of our all-time favorite titles in a neat new format so you can curate your own affordable library of art, anthropology, and aphrodisia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookworm s delight never bore, always excite&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Text in English, French, and German"</description>

  <description>Like everything Bennett does, these stories are playful, witty and painfully observant of ordinary people's foibles. They all have brilliant twists, are immensely entertaining and highly moral. And all are modern classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Laying on of Hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The painfully observant account of a memorial service for a masseur to the famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clothes They Stood Up In&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comic tale of an elderly couple's trials after their flat is stripped completely bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father! Father! Burning Bright&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The savage satire on the family of a dying man who rules over them from his hospital bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lady in the Van&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true story of the eccentric old woman who is invited to live in a homeowner's front garden. She stays there, in her van, for fifteen years. The home is Alan Bennett's. It became a West End hit and a major film, starring Maggie Smith.</description>

  <description>A routine assignment transporting two death-row prisoners to their executions goes fatally wrong, leaving Dave Robicheaux brutally wounded and his partner dead. Obsessed with revenge, Dave is persuaded by the DEA to go undercover into the torrid sleepy depths of New Orleans, a volatile world of Mafia drug-running and Cajun voodoo magic. He becomes irrevocably snarled in the nightmarish web surrounding Mafia don Tony Cardo and must put himself against his own worst fears in order to survive.</description>

  <description>Zeroville begins in 1969 on Hollywood Boulevard, when a Greyhound bus drops off a film-obsessed ex-seminarian with images of Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift tattooed on his head. Vikar Jerome steps into the vortex of a cultural transformation: rock ’n’ roll, sex, drugs, and — far more important to him — the decline of the movie studios and the rise of the independent director. Jerome will become a film editor of astonishing vision. Then through encounters with former starlets, burglars, political guerillas, punk musicians, and veteran filmmakers, he discovers the astonishing secret that lies in every movie ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Joe Pickett is the new game warden in Twelve Sleep, Wyoming, a town where nearly everyone hunts and the game warden--especially one like Joe who won't take bribes or look the other way--is far from popular. When he finds a local hunting outfitter dead, splayed out on the woodpile behind his state-owned home, he takes it personally. There had to be a reason that the outfitter, with whom he's had run-ins before, chose his backyard, his woodpile to die in. Even after the "outfitter murders," as they have been dubbed by the local press after the discovery of the two more bodies, are solved, Joe continues to investigate, uneasy with the easy explanation offered by the local police.As Joe digs deeper into the murders, he soon discovers that the outfitter brought more than death to his backdoor: he brought Joe an endangered species, thought to be extinct, which is now living in his woodpile. But if word of the existence of this endangered species gets out, it will destroy any chance of InterWest, a multi-national natural gas company, building an oil pipeline that would bring the company billions of dollars across Wyoming, through the mountains and forests of Twelve Sleep. The closer Joe comes to the truth behind the outfitter murders, the endangered species and InterWest, the closer he comes to losing everything he holds dear.</description>

  <description>A biting satire about a young man's isolated upbringing and the race trial that sends him to the Supreme Court, Paul Beatty's The Sellout showcases a comic genius at the top of his game. It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality―the black Chinese restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in the "agrarian ghetto" of Dickens―on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles―the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: "I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake." Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident―the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins―he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.</description>

  <description>When the body of a young girl is found hanging from a tree, the only clue the police have is an airline tag around her neck. It reads ‘I’m travelling alone’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response, police investigator Holger Munch is immediately charged with assembling a special homicide unit. But to complete the team, he must track down his former partner, Mia Krüger – a brilliant but troubled detective – who has retreated to a solitary island with plans to kill herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewing the file, Mia finds something new – a thin line carved into the dead girl’s fingernail: the number 1. She knows that this is only the beginning. To save other children from the same fate, she must find a way to cast aside her own demons and stop this murderer from becoming a serial killer.</description>

  <description>It’s 1983 and Reaganomics is in full swing. But beneath the facade of junk bonds and easy money, New York remains a gritty metropolis offering Nirvana with one hand and desolation with the other. Moe Prager, ex-NYPD cop turned reluctant P.I. is too busy reeling from a family tragedy to see what’s coming. He’s about to be sucked into a case that might deliver him what he’s always wanted or plunge him into purgatory. &lt;p&gt; Two years earlier, Moira Heaton, a young intern for an up-and-coming politico, vanished without a trace. Although there is no evidence supporting her boss’s involvement, rumors and whispers have conspired to stall his once-promising career. Now, in a last- ditch effort to clear his name, state senator Steven Brightman, with the clout of a wealthy backer, enlists Moe’s help. With twists and turns galore and Moe’s inimitable voice, &lt;i&gt;The James Deans&lt;/i&gt; is an absorbing page- turner that will add to the burgeoning reputation of one of today’s most promising writers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;- &lt;/b&gt;Pourquoi reunir le temps d'une exposition Ferdinand Hodler, Claude Monet et Edvard Munch ? Parce que ce sont des peintres essentiels de la modernite europeenne, entre impressionnisme, post-impressionnisme et symbolisme. Parce que leurs oeuvres s'avancent dans le XXe siecle - jusqu'en 1918 pour Hodler, 1926 pour Monet et 1944 pour Munch - et qu'elles ont exerce une influence determinante dans l'histoire de l'art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mais, plus encore, parce qu'ils ont, tous les trois, affronte des questions de peinture en apparence insurmontables, avec la meme constance et au risque d'etre incompris. Comment peindre de face l'eclat eblouissant du soleil, avec de simples couleurs sur une simple toile ? Comment peindre la neige ? Comment suggerer les mouvements et les variations de la lumiere sur l'eau ou sur le tronc d'un arbre, malgre l'immobilite de la peinture ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;J'ai repris encore des choses impossibles a faire: de l'eau avec de l'herbe qui ondule dans le fond... c'est admirable a voir, mais c'est a rendre fou de vouloir faire ca.&lt;/em&gt; Ces mots sont de Monet, mais ils pourraient etre ceux du peintre qui, jusqu'a sa mort, s'obstine a etudier l'horizon des Alpes depuis sa terrasse, de l'aube au crepuscule - Hodler. Ou de celui qui revient inlassablement - jusqu'a la depression - sur les memes motifs colores, une maison rouge, des marins dans la neige, le couchant - Munch. Tous trois ont mis la peinture a l'epreuve de l'impossible. Coedition Editions Hazan/Musee Marmottan Monet. Ouvrage bilingue anglais/francais.</description>

Salinger.&lt;/b&gt; It&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is the story of a young LA gang member named East, who is sent by his uncle along with some other teenage boys--including East's hothead younger brother--to kill a key witness hiding out in Wisconsin. The journey takes East out of a city he's never left and into an America that is entirely alien to him, ultimately forcing him to grapple with his place in the world and decide what kind of man he wants to become. &lt;br /&gt;Written in stark and unforgettable prose and featuring an array of surprising and memorable characters rendered with empathy and wit, &lt;i&gt;Dodgers &lt;/i&gt;heralds the arrival of a major new voice in American fiction.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Mind Change&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;Susan Greenfield discusses the all-pervading technologies that now surround us, and from which we derive instant information, connected identity, diminished privacy and exceptionally vivid here-and-now experiences. In her view they are creating a new environment, with vast implications, because our minds are physically adapting: being rewired. What could this mean, and how can we harness, rather than be harnessed by, our new technological milieu to create better alternatives and more meaningful lives? Using the very latest research, &lt;i&gt;Mind&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Change&lt;/i&gt; is intended to incite debate as well as yield the way forward. There is no better person to explain the situation in a way we can understand, and to offer new insights on how to improve our mental capacities and well being.</description>

  <description>‘Language is a body, a living creature ... and this creature's home is the inarticulate as well as the articulate.’ John Berger's work has revolutionized the way we understand visual language. In this new book he writes about language itself, and how it relates to thought, art, song, storytelling and political discourse today. Also containing Berger's own drawings, notes, memories and reflections on everything from Albert Camus to global capitalism, Confabulations takes us to what is ‘true, essential and urgent’.</description>

  <description>Coloured by poverty and horrifying brutality, Gorky's childhood equipped him to understand - in a way denied to a Tolstoy or a Turgenev - the life of the ordinary Russian. After his father, a paperhanger and upholsterer, died of cholera, five-year-old Gorky was taken to live with his grandfather, a polecat-faced tyrant who would regularly beat him unconscious, and with his grandmother, a tender mountain of a woman and a wonderful storyteller, who would kneel beside their bed (with Gorky inside it pretending to be asleep) and give God her views on the day's happenings, down to the last fascinating details. She was, in fact, Gorky's closest friend and the epic heroine of a book swarming with characters and with the sensations of a curious and often frightened little boy. &lt;i&gt;My Childhood&lt;/i&gt;, the first volume of Gorky's autobiographical trilogy, was in part an act of exorcism. It describes a life begun in the raw, remembered with extraordinary charm and poignancy and without bitterness. Of all Gorky's books this is the one that made him 'the father of Russian literature'.</description>

  <description>The key to living a happier, healthier life is inside us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our gut is almost as important to us as our brain or our heart, yet we know very little about how it works. In Gut, Giulia Enders shows that rather than the utilitarian and — let’s be honest — somewhat embarrassing body part we imagine it to be, it is one of the most complex, important, and even miraculous parts of our anatomy. And scientists are only just discovering quite how much it has to offer; new research shows that gut bacteria can play a role in everything from obesity and allergies to Alzheimer’s.&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the personal experience of illness that inspired her research, and going on to explain everything from the basics of nutrient absorption to the latest science linking bowel bacteria with depression, Enders has written an entertaining, informative health handbook. Gut definitely shows that we can all benefit from getting to know the wondrous world of our inner workings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this charming book, young scientist Giulia Enders takes us on a fascinating tour of our insides. Her message is simple — if we treat our gut well, it will treat us well in return. But how do we do that? And why do we need to? Find out in this surprising, and surprisingly funny, exploration of the least understood of our organs.</description>

  <description>In James Lee Burke's last novel featuring Billy Bob Holland, &lt;i&gt;Bitterroot,&lt;/i&gt; the former Texas Ranger left his home state to help a friend threatened by the most dangerous sociopath Billy Bob had ever faced. After vanquishing a truly iniquitous collection of violent individuals, Billy moved his family to west Montana and hung out a shingle for his law practice. But in &lt;i&gt;In the Moon of Red Ponies,&lt;/i&gt; he discovers that jail cells have revolving doors and that the government he had sworn to serve may have become his enemy. &lt;p&gt; His first client in Missoula is Johnny American Horse, a young activist for land preservation and the rights of Native Americans. Johnny is charged with the murder of two mysterious men -- who seem to have recently tried to kill Johnny themselves, or at least scare him off his political causes. As Billy Bob investigates, he discovers a web of intrigue surrounding the case and its players: Johnny's girlfriend, Amber Finley, as reckless as she is defiant -- and the daughter of one of Montana's U.S. senators; Darrel McComb, a Missoula police detective who is obsessed with Amber; and Seth Masterson, an enigmatic government agent whose presence in town makes Billy Bob wonder why Washington has become so concerned with an obscure murder case on the fringes of the Bitterroot Mountains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As complications mount and the dead bodies multiply, Billy Bob is drawn closer to the truth behind Johnny American Horse's arrest -- and discovers a greater danger to himself and to his whole family. How Billy Bob strikes back at evil and protects his kin is the masterful triumph of &lt;i&gt;In the Moon of Red Ponies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Hard to find a better literary crime thriller. Some of Burke's novels can be variations of a previous novel, where you feel his having to meet an annual quota, while others, like this one, fire on all cylinders.

  <description>The acclaimed National Book Award finalist — "one of the United States' finest writers," according to Joshua Ferris, "full of wit, humanity, and fearless curiosity" — now gives us a novel that will join the short list of classics about children caught up in the Holocaust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aron, the narrator, is an engaging if peculiar and unhappy young boy whose family is driven by the German onslaught from the Polish countryside into Warsaw and slowly battered by deprivation, disease, and persecution. He and a handful of boys and girls risk their lives by scuttling around the ghetto to smuggle and trade contraband through the quarantine walls in hopes of keeping their fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters alive, hunted all the while by blackmailers and by Jewish, Polish, and German police, not to mention the Gestapo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his family is finally stripped away from him, Aron is rescued by Janusz Korczak, a doctor renowned throughout prewar Europe as an advocate of children’s rights who, once the Nazis swept in, was put in charge of the Warsaw orphanage. Treblinka awaits them all, but does Aron manage to escape — as his mentor suspected he could — to spread word about the atrocities? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Shepard has masterfully made this child's-eye view of the darkest history mesmerizing, sometimes comic despite all odds, truly heartbreaking, and even inspiring. Anyone who hears Aron's voice will remember it forever.</description>

  <description>'This is one of the sparest, most elegant spy novels I have come across in a long time ...Written in glistening prose - with not a word wasted - it proves Steinhauer truly is John le Carre's rightful heir.' Daily Mail Celia used to lie for a living. Henry still does. Can they ever trust each other? Six years ago, Henry and Celia were lovers and colleagues, working for the CIA station in Vienna, until terrorists hijacked a plane at the airport. A rescue attempt, staged from the inside, went terribly wrong. Everyone on board was killed. That night has continued to haunt all of those involved; for Henry and Celia, it brought to an end their relationship. Celia decided she'd had enough; she left the agency, married and had children, and is now living an ordinary life in the Californian suburbs. Henry is still a CIA analyst, and has travelled to the US to see her one more time, to relive the past, maybe, or to put it behind him once and for all. But neither of them can forget that question: had their agent been compromised, and how? And each of them also wonders what role their lunch companion might have played in the way things unfolded...All the Old Knives is Olen Steinhauer's most intense, most thrilling and most unsettling novel to date - from the New York Times bestselling author deemed by many to be John le Carre's heir apparent.</description>

  <description>Harry Bosch is California's newest private investigator. He doesn't advertise, he doesn't have an office, and he's picky about who he works for, but it doesn't matter. His chops from thirty years with the LAPD speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon one of Southern California's biggest moguls comes calling. The reclusive billionaire is nearing the end of his life and is haunted by one regret. When he was young, he had a relationship with a Mexican girl, his great love. But soon after becoming pregnant, she disappeared. Did she have the baby? And if so, what happened to it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to know whether he has an heir, the dying magnate hires Bosch, the only person he can trust. With such a vast fortune at stake, Harry realizes that his mission could be risky not only for himself but for the one he's seeking. But as he begins to uncover the haunting story--and finds uncanny links to his own past--he knows he cannot rest until he finds the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, unable to leave cop work behind completely, he volunteers as an investigator for a tiny cash-strapped police department and finds himself tracking a serial rapist who is one of the most baffling and dangerous foes he has ever faced.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;NOT ALL ANGELS ARE HEAVEN SENT.&lt;br /&gt;I AM ONE SUCH ANGEL, AND I HAVE COME&lt;br /&gt;TO PASS JUDGEMENT ON THE LIVING,&lt;br /&gt;AND THE DEAD...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A report of a rare and unusual gun - a type favoured by assassins - being smuggled into the country sparks Detective Harry Hole's interest. Then a former WW2 Nazi sympathiser is found with his throat cut. Next, Harry's former partner is murdered. Why had she been trying to reach Harry on the night she was killed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Harry's investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that the killer is hell-bent on serving his own justice. And while the link between the cases remains a mystery, one thing is certain: he must be stopped.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-Texas Ranger Billy Bob Holland makes his third appearance (after &lt;a href="http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0440224012&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;" rel="nofollow"&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Heartwood&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; and the Edgar Award-winning &lt;a href="http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0786889306&amp;lt;br%20/&amp;gt;" rel="nofollow"&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Cimarron Rose&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;) in James Lee Burke's dark, sorrowful, appropriately titled new novel, &lt;i&gt;Bitterroot&lt;/i&gt;. This time out, Burke takes Holland out of the familiar environs of Deaf Smith, Texas, and moves him to Montana, where he becomes enmeshed in an interlocking series of brutal -- and brutalizing -- events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ostensibly, Bill Bob Has come to Montana for an extended fishing vacation with long-time friend Tobin "Doc" Voss, a widowed Vietnam vet and a man of strong, if contradictory, principles. Voss, an impassioned environmentalist, has lobbied publicly against the incursions of a local mining corporation and has made some powerful enemies, a fact that becomes clear when a trio of drug-addled bikers are sent to rape and terrorize his teenaged daughter, Maisey. In the aftermath of that rape, the leader of the bikers is found burned to death in his bed. Doc, of course, emerges as the primary suspect, and finds himself arrested for premeditated murder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy Bob Holland's subsequent investigation begins with Maisey's rape and moves steadily outward, encompassing pedophilia, organized crime, right-wing extremism, and virtually every possible combination of personal and institutional corruption, all of which stand in stark contrast to the pristine, vulnerable beauty of the Montana landscape. Participants in this grim complex of narratives include an alcoholic mystery novelist, an embittered federal agent, a psychopathic ex-con with a very personal agenda, an undercover informant with a hidden motive for murder, and a local physician who has lost both her husband and son, and whose life has collapsed beneath her insupportable grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of all this is Billy Bob Holland himself, a fundamentally decent man who is literally haunted by a specter from his past, and who must constantly confront his "abiding anger" and his extreme capacity for violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Dave Robichaux, Burke's other series hero, he is both a witness to and participant in the moral crises of the age. In &lt;i&gt;Bitterroot&lt;/i&gt;, his urgent, eloquent narrative voice is as compelling as ever, lending depth and credibility to this disturbing, beautifully crafted book. &lt;i&gt;(Bill Sheehan)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bill Sheehan reviews horror, suspense, and science fiction for&lt;/i&gt; Cemetery Dance, The New York Review of Science Fiction, &lt;i&gt;and other publications. His book-length critical study of the fiction of &lt;a href="http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?author_last=Straub&amp;amp;author_first=Peter&amp;amp;match=exact&amp;amp;options=and" rel="nofollow"&gt;Peter Straub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=1892284774" rel="nofollow"&gt;At the Foot of the Story Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;has been published by Subterranean Press (&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.subterraneanpress.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.subterraneanpress.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Eleanor Rigby &lt;/i&gt;is the story of Liz, a self-described drab, overweight, crabby, and friendless middle-aged woman, and her unlikely reunion with the charming and strange son she gave up for adoption. His arrival changes everything, and sets in motion a rapid-fire plot with all the twists and turns we expect of Coupland. By turns funny and heartbreaking, &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Rigby&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced read and a haunting exploration of the ways in which loneliness affects us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; meets &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Second Machine Age &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;in this stunning and optimistic tour de force on the promise and peril of the digital economy, from one of the most brilliant social critics of our time.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity, but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids, making it harder for people and businesses to keep up. Social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining, while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our 401ks alike--all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary. Instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability, we have doubled down on growth as its core command. We have reached the limits of this approach. We must escape the growth trap, once and for all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Media scholar and technology author Douglas Rushkoff--one of today's most original and influential thinkers--argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner-take-all system the growth trap leaves in its wake. Drawing on sources both contemporary and historical, Rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm, from central currency to debt to corporations and labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, he offers a series of practical steps for businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out--and prosper along the way. Instead of boycotting Wal-Mart or overtaxing the wealthy, we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves. From our currency to our labor to the corporation, every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspiring and challenging, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus provides a pragmatic, optimistic, and human-centered model for economic progress in the digital age.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jim Harrison is one of our most beloved and acclaimed writers, adored by both readers and critics. In &lt;i&gt;The Ancient Minstrel&lt;/i&gt;, Harrison delivers three novellas that highlight his phenomenal range as a writer, shot through with his trademark wit and keen insight into the human condition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrison has tremendous fun with his own reputation in the title novella, about an aging writer in Montana who spars with his estranged wife, with whom he still shares a home, weathers the slings and arrows of literary success, and tries to cope with the sow he buys on a whim and the unplanned litter of piglets that follow soon after. In &lt;i&gt;Eggs&lt;/i&gt;, a Montana woman reminisces about staying in London with her grandparents, and collecting eggs at their country house. Years later, having never had a child, she attempts to do so. And in &lt;i&gt;The Case of the Howling Buddhas&lt;/i&gt;, retired Detective Sunderson—a recurring character from Harrison’s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Great Leader&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Big Seven&lt;/i&gt;—is hired as a private investigator to look into a bizarre cult that achieves satori by howling along with howler monkeys at the zoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, incisive, and endlessly entertaining, with moments of both profound wisdom and sublime humor, &lt;i&gt;The Ancient Minstrel&lt;/i&gt; is an exceptional reminder of why Jim Harrison is one of the most cherished and important writers at work today.</description>

  <description>Part history, part fiction, part memoir,  &lt;i&gt;Levels of Life&lt;/i&gt;  is a powerfully personal and unforgettable book, and an immediate classic on the subject of grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Levels of Life&lt;/i&gt; opens in the nineteenth century with balloonists, photographers, and Sarah Bernhardt, whose adventures lead seamlessly into an entirely personal account of the author's own great loss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "You put together two things that have not been put together before. And the world is changed..." Julian Barnes's new book is about ballooning, photography, love and grief; about putting two things, and two people, together, and about tearing them apart. One of the judges who awarded him the 2011 Man Booker Prize described Barnes as "an unparalleled magus of the heart." This book confirms that opinion.</description>

  <description>Beloved for his epic agony, brilliantly discerning eye, and hilarious and constantly self-questioning tone, David Foster Wallace was heralded by both critics and fans as the voice of a generation. BOTH FLESH AND NOT gathers 15 essays never published in book form, including Federer Both Flesh and Not, considered by many to be his nonfiction masterpiece; The (As it Were) Seminal Importance of Terminator 2, which deftly dissects James Cameron's blockbuster; and Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young, an examination of television's effect on a new generation of writers.A sweeping, exhilarating collection of the author's most emotionally immediate work, BOTH FLESH AND NOT spans almost 20 years of Wallace's career and reminds us why A.O. Scott called him The Best Mind of His Generation (New York Times).</description>

  <description>On the outskirts of Paris, a prostitute is found murdered in a vacant lot. In a seedy apartment house nearby lives pasty, fat Mr. Hire. Mr. Hire, who earns his living through a petty postal scam, is a convicted pornographer, a peeping Tom, and, once a week, the unlikely star of a Parisian bowling club, where people think he works for the police. He is a faceless man of regular habits who keeps to himself and gives his neighbors the creeps. After the murder, Mr. Hire s concierge points a finger at him: he was out late the night of the crime. The police have the suspect under 24-hour surveillance. They are only waiting for him to make the inevitable mistake and give himself away. &lt;br /&gt;Except that creepy Mr. Hire is in fact an innocent man, whose only mistake is to have fallen head-over-heels in love with the wrong girl. &lt;br /&gt;One of the most chilling and compassionate of Simenon s extraordinary psychological novels, The Engagement explores the mystery of a blameless heart in a compromised soul."</description>

  <description>“My predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved. I have been given much and I have given something in return. Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure.” &lt;br /&gt;—Oliver Sacks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No writer has succeeded in capturing the medical and human drama of illness as honestly and as eloquently as Oliver Sacks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the last few months of his life, he wrote a set of essays in which he movingly explored his feelings about completing a life and coming to terms with his own death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is the fate of every human being,” Sacks writes, “to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, these four essays form an ode to the uniqueness of each human being and to gratitude for the gift of life.</description>

  <description>The long-awaited and beguiling second novel from Alain de Botton that tracks the beautifully complicated arc of a romantic partnership, from the internationally bestselling author of On Love and How Proust Can Change Your Life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know the headiness and excitement of the early days of love. But what comes after? In Edinburgh, a couple, Rabih and Kirsten, fall in love. They get married, they have children—but no long-term relationship is as simple as “happily ever after.” The Course of Love is a novel that explores what happens after the birth of love, what it takes to maintain love, and what happens to our original ideals under the pressures of an average existence. You experience, along with Rabih and Kirsten, the first flush of infatuation, the effortlessness of falling into romantic love, and the course of life thereafter. Interwoven with their story and its challenges is an overlay of philosophy—an annotation and a guide to what we are reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a romantic novel in the true sense, one interested in exploring how love can survive and thrive in the long term. The result is a sensory experience—fictional, philosophical, psychological—that urges us to identify deeply with these characters, and to reflect on his and her own experiences in love. Fresh, visceral, and utterly compelling, The Course of Love is a provocative and life-affirming novel for everyone who believes in love.</description>

  <description>As a teenage girl, Ginny marries Linus Lancaster, her mother's second cousin, and moves to his Kentucky pig farm "ninety miles from nowhere." In the shadows of the lush Kentucky landscape, Ginny discovers the empty promises of Linus' "paradise"—a place where the charms of her husband fall away to reveal a troubled man and cruel slave owner. Ginny befriends the young slaves Cleome and Zinnia who work at the farm—until Linus' attentions turn to them, and she finds herself torn between her husband and only companions. The events that follow Linus' death change all three women for life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunting, chilling, and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;Kind One&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful tale of redemption and human endurance in antebellum America.</description>

  <description>Francoise Gilot was a young painter in Paris when she first met Picasso - he was sixty-two and she was twenty-one. During the following ten years they were lovers, worked closely together and she became mother to two of his children, Claude and Paloma. &lt;i&gt;Life with Picasso&lt;/i&gt;, her account of those extraordinary years, is filled with intimate and astonishing revelations about the man, his work, his thoughts and his friends - Matisse, Braque, Gertrude Stein and Giacometti, among others. Francois Gilot paints a compelling portrait of her turbulent life with the temperamental (and even abusive) genius that was Picasso. As one of the few intimate witnesses to Picasso as a human being and as an artist, her account of him is invaluable for assessing him on both counts.</description>

  <description>From the highly acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Edisto&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Interrogative Mood&lt;/i&gt;, Padgett Powell’s new collection of stories, &lt;i&gt;Cries for Help, Various,&lt;/i&gt; follows his mentor Donald Barthelme’s advice that “wacky mode” must “break their hearts.” The surrealistic and comical terrain of most of the forty-four stories here is grounded by a real preoccupation with longing, fear, work, loneliness, and cultural nostalgia. These universal concerns are given exhilarating life by way of Powell’s “wit, his . . . dazzling turns of phrase” (Scott Spencer). In “Joplin and Dickens,” the musician and writer meet as emotionally needy students in an American grade school; in “Change of Life,” a father ponders whether getting new clothes for the family or the patriotic purchase of a “new Government Cookie Flyer” would be more meaningful. In “The Imperative Mood,” giving orders to others—“Fall back and regroup”—leads less to power than to rumination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Padgett Powell’s language is both lofty and low-down, his tone cranky and heartfelt, exuberant and inconsolable. His characters rebel against convention and ambition, hoping to maintain their very sanity by doing so. Even the most hilarious or fantastical stories in &lt;i&gt;Cries for Help, Various&lt;/i&gt; ring gloriously, poignantly, true.</description>

  <description>Late spring, 1943. The world is at war but the American mob is in its heyday. Former crime boss Joe Coughlin now works as a consigliere to the infamous Bartolo Crime Family, effortlessly handling its interests in Tampa, Boston, and Cuba. In the decade since he lost his wife in a cascade of bullets, Joe has made a home for himself and his son, and once again forged everything out of nothing: money, power, a relationship with a beautiful woman, and a privileged place in Tampa's shadowy underworld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a rumor surfaces that someone wants Joe dead. And he has only days to figure out who, or he will die. And then there's the ghost—a young boy who appears on the fringes of Joe's vision and seems to be trying to tell him something. Racing against time and fate, Joe hurtles through a violent yet intoxicating world on the brink of total collapse or epic triumph, a world on the cusp of reinvention and rebirth—where the old codes, the old sins, and the old dreams may soon be swept away once and for all.</description>

  <description>A national bestseller from one of our most renowned and popular authors, &lt;i&gt;The Big Seven&lt;/i&gt; finds Detective Sunderson settling into a hunting cabin in a remote area of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where he soon realizes that his neighbors may be as dangerous as any maniac he faced in his cop days. A family of outlaws, armed to the teeth, the Ameses have local law enforcement too intimidated to take them on. Then Sunderson’s cleaning lady, a comely young Ames woman, is murdered, and black sheep brother Lemuel Ames seeks Sunderson’s advice on a crime novel he’s writing which may not be fiction. Sunderson must struggle with the evil within himself and the greater, more expansive evil of his neighbor.</description>

  <description>A young and ambitious writer named Jerome David Salinger set his goals very high very early in his career. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He almost desperately wished to publish his early stories in The New Yorker magazine, the pinnacle, he felt, of America’s literary world. But such was not to be for several long years and the length of one long world war. The New Yorker, whose tastes in literary matters were and remain notoriously prim and fickle, was not quite ready for this brash and over-confident newcomer with the cynical worldview and his habit of slangy dialogue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other magazines were quick to recognize a new talent, a fresh voice at a time when the world verged on madness. Story magazine, an esteemed and influential small circulation journal devoted exclusively to the art of the short story and still active and respected today, was the first publication to publish the name J.D. Salinger and the story “The Young Folks” in 1940, an impressive view of New York’s cocktail society and two young people talking past one another, their conversation almost completely meaningless and empty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His next short story was published in a college journal, The University of Kansas City Review. “Go See Eddie” is a tale of quiet menace as an unsavory male character gradually turns up the pressure on a young lady to see a man named Eddie. Also published in 1940, the story is notable for the backstory that is omitted — a technique that Hemingway used to great effect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years later toward the end of Salinger’s war experience saw the publication of “Once A Week Won’t Kill You,” again in Story magazine. Ostensibly about a newly minted soldier trying to tell an aging aunt he is going off to war, some may see the story as a metaphor for preparing one’s family for the possibility of wartime death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devault-Graves Digital Editions, a publisher that specializes in reprinting the finest in American period literature, is proud to bring you this anthology by one of America’s most innovative and inspiring authors.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Jack Reacher Novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Why is this town called Mother’s Rest?”&lt;/i&gt; That’s all Reacher wants to know. But no one will tell him. It’s a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and there’s something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long he’s plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the way—right back to where he started, in Mother’s Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Walking away would have been easier. But as always, Reacher’s rule is: If you want me to stop, you’re going to have to make me.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling novelist and author of The Invention of Solitude, a moving and highly personal meditation on the body, time, and language itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"That is where the story begins, in your body, and everything will end in the body as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing his sixty-third winter, internationally acclaimed novelist Paul Auster sits down to write a history of his body and its sensations—both pleasurable and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years after the publication of The Invention of Solitude, in which he wrote so movingly about fatherhood, Auster gives us a second unconventional memoir in which he writes about his mother's life and death. Winter Journal is a highly personal meditation on the body, time, and memory, by one of our most intellectually elegant writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A compelling look at Jackson Pollock's vibrant, quintessentially American art and the turbulent life that gave rise to it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson Pollock (1912–1956) not only put American art on the map with his famous "drip paintings," he also served as an inspiration for the character of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams's &lt;em&gt;A Streetcar Named Desire&lt;/em&gt;—the role that made Marlon Brando famous. Like Brando, Pollock became an icon of rebellion in 1950s America, and the brooding, defiant persona captured in photographs of the artist contributed to his celebrity almost as much as his notorious paintings did. In the years since his death in a drunken car crash, Pollock's hold on the public imagination has only increased. He has become an enduring symbol of the tormented artist—our American van Gogh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this highly engaging book, Evelyn Toynton examines Pollock's itinerant and poverty-stricken childhood in the West, his encounters with contemporary art in Depression-era New York, and his years in the run-down Long Island fishing village that, ironically, was transformed into a fashionable resort by his presence. Placing the artist in the context of his time, Toynton also illuminates the fierce controversies that swirled around his work and that continue to do so. Pollock's paintings captured the sense of freedom and infinite possibility unique to the American experience, and his life was both an American rags-to-riches story and a darker tale of the price paid for celebrity, American style.</description>

  <description>The second novel featuring Spero Lucas, a young Iraq vet working as a PI in Washington DC but with a sideline in finding lost items - the kind of items the owners can't go to the police about. This time Spero is trying to find a painting belonging to a sexy young woman who was scammed out of it by a super-smooth con artist, part of a team of ruthless thugs. Spero tracks the painting down but the woman is brutally attacked to warn him off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spero goes on the attack and takes the gang out one by one in their isolated house in the woods - prompting the question: have his experiences in Iraq turned him into an amoral killer no better than the crooks he's up against? It's this question that gives the book its dark edge, and moral ambiguity, with a hero we're not quite sure we should like.</description>

  <description>Miracle Boy and Other Stories represents a body of work eighteen years in the making. Benedict's last short story collection was the critically acclaimed The Wrecking Yard, published in 1992 by Nan A. Talese. That collection was followed by the Steinbeck Award-winning crime novel Dogs of God, also from Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, in 1994, which Marilyn Stasio said was written "in a vein of rare, wild beauty .... with the lyrical exactitude of Henry Thoreau on a metaphysical field trip to hell." Miracle Boy and Other Stories is a collection of fourteen stories. many of which earned appearances in The O.Henry Awards, New Stories from the South: The Year's Best, The Pushcart Prize: The Best of Small Presses, The Best of Tin House, and Mammoth Book of Best New Horror. Elizabeth Strout, winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Olive Kittridge, says, "These are amazing stories. They contain the exquisite beauty of poetry and the dense muscularity of a language that takes the reader to breathtaking heights. Never complaining, or flinching, Pinckney Benedict presses us right against the variety of human experience in ways I've never seen before. There is not a story here that is not the real thing."</description>

  <description>Casting light on the most serious of problems and at the same time saying not one serious sentence; being fascinated by the reality of the contemporary world and at the same time completely avoiding realism - that's The Festival of Insignificance. Readers who know Kundera's earlier books know that the wish to incorporate an element of the 'unserious' in a novel is not at all unexpected of him. In Immortality, Goethe and Hemingway stroll through several chapters together talking and laughing. And in Slowness, Vera, the author's wife, says to her husband: 'you've often told me you meant to write a book one day that would have not a single serious word in it ... I warn you: watch out. Your enemies are lying in wait.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, far from watching out, Kundera is finally and fully realizing his old aesthetic dream in this novel that we could easily view as a summation of his whole work. A strange sort of summation. Strange sort of epilogue. Strange sort of laughter, inspired by our time, which is comical because it has lost all sense of humor. What more can we say? Nothing. Just read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Enchanting ... it explores all aspects of a declining civilisation without taking any of them too seriously ... In this novel of Flaubertian seduction, free of blame and guilt, insignificance is the very essence of life.' La Repubblica</description>

  <description>Since ancient times humans have felt intuitively that emotions and health are linked, and recently there has been much popular speculation about this notion. But until now, without compelling evidence, it has been impossible to say for sure that such a connection really exists and especially how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that evidence has been discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thrilling scientific detective story,&lt;i&gt; The Balance Within&lt;/i&gt; tells how researchers finally uncovered the elusive mind-body connection and what it means for our health. In this beautifully written book, Dr. Esther Sternberg, whose discoveries were pivotal in helping to solve this mystery, provides first hand accounts of the breakthrough experiments that revealed the physical mechanisms - the nerves, cells, and hormones - used by the brain and immune system to communicate with each other. She describes just how stress can make us more susceptible to all types of illnesses, and how the immune system can alter our moods. Finally, she explains how our understanding of these connections in scientific terms is helping to answer such crucial questions as "Does stress make you sick?" "Is a positive outlook the key to better health?" and "How do our personal relationships, work, and other aspects of our lives affect our health?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fascinating, elegantly written portrait of this rapidly emerging field with enormous potential for finding new ways to treat disease and cope with stress, &lt;i&gt;The Balance Within&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading for anyone interested in making their body and mind whole again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Soon enough, nobody will remember life before the Internet. What does this unavoidable fact mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For future generations, it won't mean anything very obvious. They will be so immersed in online life that questions about the Internet's basic purpose or meaning will vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those of us who have lived both with and without the crowded connectivity of online life have a rare opportunity. We can still recognize the difference between Before and After. We catch ourselves idly reaching for our phones at the bus stop. Or we notice how, mid-conversation, a fumbling friend dives into the perfect recall of Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this eloquent and thought-provoking book, Michael Harris argues that amid all the changes we're experiencing, the most interesting is the one that future generations will find hardest to grasp. That is the end of absence-the loss of lack. The daydreaming silences in our lives are filled; the burning solitudes are extinguished. There's no true "free time" when you carry a smartphone. Today's rarest commodity is the chance to be alone with your own thoughts.</description>

  <description>Detective Dave Robicheaux has fought too many battles: in Vietnam, with killers and hustlers, with police brass, and with the bottle. Lost without his wife's love, Robicheaux's haunted soul mirrors the intensity and dusky mystery of New Orleans' French Quarter -- the place he calls home, and the place that nearly destroys him when he becomes involved in the case of a young prostitute whose body is found in a bayou. Thrust into the world of drug lords and arms smugglers, Robicheaux must face down a subterranean criminal world and come to terms with his own bruised heart in order to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bit Rot&lt;/i&gt;, a new collection from Douglas Coupland that explores the different ways 20th-century notions of the future are being shredded, is a gem of the digital age. Reading &lt;i&gt;Bit Rot&lt;/i&gt; feels a lot like bingeing on Netflix... you can't stop with just one. "Bit rot" is a term used in digital archiving to describe the way digital files can spontaneously and quickly decompose. As Coupland writes, "Bit rot also describes the way my brain has been feeling since 2000, as I shed older and weaker neurons and connections and enhance new and unexpected ones."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bit Rot&lt;/i&gt; explores the ways humanity tries to make sense of our shifting consciousness. Coupland, just like the Internet, mixes forms to achieve his ends. Short fiction is interspersed with essays on all aspects of modern life. The result is addictively satisfying for Coupland's legion of fans hungry for his observations about our world. For almost three decades, his unique pattern recognition has powered his fiction, and his phrase-making. Every page of &lt;i&gt;Bit Rot&lt;/i&gt; is full of wit, surprise and delight.</description>

He has grabbed onto an aging male voice of verse, insight, fun, lust, longing, love of nature, making many trips a high pleasure (although certain repetitions slip in this one - exact phrases/insights coming round at least three times).]]>

  <description>How much can go wrong in a day? How much can go wrong in a life? In this chronicle of a year of things going wrong (and just occasionally right), the author of the acclaimed The Smoking Diaries meets with triumph and disaster and treats those two impostors just the same - which is to say with the mixture of wit, anger, vexation and candour that has made Simon Gray one of Britain's greatest writers of comedy - including the comedy that lurks in tragedy.</description>

  <description>'What makes me saddest, is the double silence of her being. Language has packed its bags and jumped over the railing of the capsizing ship, but there is also another silence in her or around her. I can no longer hear the music of her soul.' One day, the author's mother no longer remembers the word for 'book'. This seemingly innocuous moment of distraction is the first sign of the slow disintegration of her mind. As Alzheimer's disease sets in and language increasingly escapes her, her son attempts to gather the fragments of what she has become, writing a moving, loving chronicle of the gradual descent into dementia of someone who 'no longer knows who she is, where she is or what will happen'.</description>

  <description>In 2010, Clive James was diagnosed with terminal leukemia. Deciding that “if you don’t know the exact moment when the lights will go out, you might as well read until they do,” James moved his library to his house in Cambridge, where he would “live, read, and perhaps even write.” James is the award-winning author of dozens of works of literary criticism, poetry, and history, and this volume contains his reflections on what may well be his last reading list. A look at some of James’s old favorites as well as some of his recent discoveries, this book also offers a revealing look at the author himself, sharing his evocative musings on literature and family, and on living and dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As thoughtful and erudite as the works of Alberto Manguel, and as moving and inspiring as Randy Pausch’s &lt;i&gt;The Last Lecture&lt;/i&gt; and Will Schwalbe’s &lt;i&gt;The End of Your Life Book Club,&lt;/i&gt; this valediction to James’s lifelong engagement with the written word is a captivating valentine from one of the great literary minds of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'Flaubert believed that it was impossible to explain one art form in terms of another, and that great paintings required no words of explanation. Braque thought the ideal state would be reached when we said nothing at all in front of a painting. But we are very far from reaching that state. We remain incorrigibly verbal creatures who love to explain things, to form opinions, to argue... It is a rare picture which stuns, or argues, us into silence. And if one does, it is only a short time before we want to explain and understand the very silence into which we have been plunged.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julian Barnes began writing about art with a chapter on Géricault's &lt;i&gt;The Raft of the Medusa&lt;/i&gt; in his 1989 novel &lt;i&gt;A History of the World in 10½ Chapters&lt;/i&gt;. Since then he has written a series of remarkable essays , chiefly about French artists, for a variety of journals and magazines. Gathering them for this book, he realised that he had unwittingly been retracing the story of how art made its way from Romanticism to Realism and into Modernism.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Harry Bosch crosses the line to team up with Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Harry Bosch has retired from the LAPD, but his half-brother, defense attorney Mickey Haller, needs his help. A woman has been brutally murdered in her bed and all evidence points to Haller's client, a former gang member turned family man. Though the murder rap seems ironclad, Mickey is sure it's a setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bosch doesn't want anything to do with crossing the aisle to work for the defense. He feels it will undo all the good he's done in his thirty years as a homicide cop. But Mickey promises to let the chips fall where they may. If Harry proves that his client did it, under the rules of discovery, they are obliged to turn over the evidence to the prosecution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it goes against all his instincts, Bosch reluctantly takes the case. The prosecution's file just has too many holes and he has to find out for himself: if Haller's client didn't do it, then who did? With the secret help of his former LAPD partner Lucy Soto, Harry starts digging. Soon his investigation leads him inside the police department, where he realizes that the killer he's been tracking has also been tracking him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrilling, fast-paced, and impossible to put down, The Crossing shows without a shadow of doubt that Connelly is "a master of building suspense" (Wall Street Journal).</description>

  <description>Part fiction, part travelogue, the narrator of this compelling masterpiece pursues his solitary, eccentric course from England to Italy and beyond, succumbing to the vertiginous unreliability of memory itself. What could possibly connect Stendhal's unrequited love, the artistry of Pisanello, a series of murders by a clandestine organisation, a missing passport, Casanova, the suicide of a dinner companion, stale apple cake, the Great Fire of London, a story by Kafka about a doomed huntsman and a closed-down pizzeria in Verona?</description>

  <description>'Brutally compelling serial killer thriller... told at blistering pace' — DAILY MAIL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'This novel breaks brilliant' — Jeffery Deaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Unbelievably good...this one has it all' — Lee Child&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serial killer is on the loose, and three years into his career the authorities are no nearer to catching him. The remains of his victims turn up all over the US, linked only by the bizarre objects he leaves buried in their mutilated bodies. But are the objects clues—or the killer’s joke at the police’s expense? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Francisco Homicide Detective Valerie Hart has been working the case too long. Haunted by demons of her own, drifting into a serious drink problem and close to complete burn-out, she’s on the edge of losing her job and her sanity - until the reappearance of an old lover provides a crucial breakthrough, and Valerie is pitched into a race to save the life of what will be the killer’s next victim: a ten-year-old girl, trapped in a remote cabin in the snow-bound Coloradan wilderness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this extraordinary, pulse-pounding debut, Saul Black takes us deep into the mind of a psychopath, and into the troubled hearts and souls of the ordinary men and women tasked with stopping him.</description>

  <description>Jim Harrison is one of this country's most beloved writers, a muscular, brilliantly economic stylist with a salty wisdom. For more than twenty years, he has also been writing some of the best essays on food around, now collected in a volume that caused the Santa Fe New Mexican to exclaim: "To read this book is to come away convinced that Harrison is a flat-out genius -- one who devours life with intensity, living it roughly and full-scale, then distills his experiences into passionate, opinionated prose. Food, in this context, is more than food: It is a metaphor for life." From his legendary Smart and Esquire columns, to present-day pieces including a correspondence with French gourmet Gerard Oberle, fabulous pieces on food in France and America for Men's Journal, and a paean to the humble meatball, &lt;i&gt;The Raw and the Cooked&lt;/i&gt; is a nine-course meal that will satisfy every appetite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Our 'poet laureate of appetite' [Harrison] may be, but the collected essays here reflect much more." -- John Gamino, &lt;i&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[A] culinary combo plate of Hunter S. Thompson, Ernest Hemingway, Julian Schnabel, and Sam Peckinpah...." -- Jane and Michael Stern, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Jim Harrison is the Henry Miller of food writing. His passion is infectious." -- Jeffrey Trachtenberg, &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Spent a leisurely 6 months reading these bits and pieces, and smiling, and giving a wink and a nod many times to different pages. But all good things come to an end, or, rather, the last page. Bravo, Jim.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some cases aren’t as cold as you’d think&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kurt Wallander’s life looks like it has taken a turn for the better when his offer on a new house is accepted, only for him to uncover something unexpected in the garden – the skeleton of a middle-aged woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As police officers comb the property, Wallander attempts to get his new life back on course by finding the woman’s killer with the aid of his daughter, Linda. But when another discovery is made in the garden, Wallander is forced to delve further back into the area's past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A treat for fans and new readers alike, this is a never before published Kurt Wallander novella&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A chilling Inspector Maigret mystery set on the Belgian border&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“She wasn't an ordinary supplicant. She didn't lower her eyes. There was nothing humble about her bearing. She spoke frankly, looking straight ahead, as if to claim what was rightfully hers. ‘If you don't agree to look at our case, my parents and I will be lost, and it will be the most hateful legal error...’”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maigret is asked to the windswept, rainy border town of Givet by a young woman desperate to clear her family of murder. But their well-kept shop, the sleepy community and its raging river all hide their own mysteries.</description>

  <description>Texas attorney and former Texas Ranger Billy Bob Holland has many secrets in his dark past. Among them is Vernon Smothers's son Lucas, a now-teenaged boy about whom only Vernon and Billy Bob know the truth. Lucas is really Billy Bob's illegitimate son, and when Lucas is arrested for murder, Billy Bob knows that he has no choice but to confront the past and serve as the boy's criminal attorney. Billy Bob's son is a country musician, abused by his stepfather, and haunted by the possibility that he killed his girlfriend, who was thought to be pregnant. But Billy Bob knows the propensity of the town, Deaf Smith, Texas, to make scapegoats out of the innocent and to exploit and sexually use those who are without power. The East Enders, the children of the wealthy and effete, were with Billy Bob's son and the murdered girl the night of her death. During Lucas's trial, Billy Bob realizes that he will have to bring injury upon Lucas as well as himself in order to save his son. And as a result, Billy Bob incurs enemies that are far more dangerous than any he faced as a Texas Ranger.</description>

  <description>From the creator of the hit HBO series &lt;i&gt;True Detective&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful, gleaming-dark thriller rich with Southern atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy Cady is by his own admission 'a bad man', with a snow flurry of cancer in his lungs and no one to live for. Following a fling with his boss's lover, he's sent on a routine assignment he knows is a death trap. Yet after a smoking spasm of violence, Roy's would-be killers are mostly dead and he is mostly alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Roy makes his getaway, he finds a beaten-up woman in the apartment, and sees something in her frightened, defiant eyes. Together they go on the run from New Orleans to Galveston, Texas, entwining their fates along a highway of seedy bars and fleabag hotels, treacherous drifters and ashed-out hopes, with death just a car-length behind.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A deeply rendered self-portrait of a lifelong surfer by the acclaimed&lt;i&gt; New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;writer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barbarian Days&lt;/i&gt; is William Finnegan’s memoir of an obsession, a complex enchantment. Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. &lt;i&gt;Barbarian Days&lt;/i&gt; takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barbarian Days &lt;/i&gt;is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan’s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;My imagination is always skulking about in a wrong place." And now Doyle Redmond, thirty-five-year-old nowhere writer, has crossed the line between imagination and real live trouble. On the lam in his soon-to-be ex-wife's Volvo, he's running a family errand back in his boyhood home of West Table, Missouri--the heart of the red-dirt Ozarks. The law wants his big brother, Smoke, on a felony warrant, and Doyle's supposed to talk him into giving up. But Smoke is hunkered down in the hills with his partner, Big Annie, and her nineteen-year-old daughter, Niagra, making other plans: they're about to harvest a profitable patch of homegrown marijuana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doyle takes just one look at Niagra's flattering red boots before joining his brother's scheme. Of course it means dealing with the law and maybe worse--the Dollys. A legendary clan of largely criminal persuasion, the Dollys have been feuding with the Redmonds for generations. Now they want a piece of Smoke's cash crop, even if it means killing to get it. Doyle is fast realizing that yes, you can always put the country back in the boy...but sometimes that's not smart.</description>

  <description>In The Keeper of Lost Causes, Jussi Adler-Olsen introduced Detective Carl Mørck, a deeply flawed, brilliant detective newly assigned to run Department Q, the home of Copenhagen’s coldest cases. The result wasn’t what Mørck—or readers—expected, but by the opening of Adler-Olsen’s shocking, fast-paced follow-up, Mørck is satisfied with the notion of picking up long-cold leads. So he’s naturally intrigued when a closed case lands on his desk: A brother and sister were brutally murdered two decades earlier, and one of the suspects—part of a group of privileged boarding-school students—confessed and was convicted. But once Mørck reopens the files, it becomes clear that all is not what it seems. Looking into the supposedly solved case leads him to Kimmie, a woman living on the streets, stealing to survive. Kimmie has mastered evading the police, but now they aren’t the only ones looking for her. Because Kimmie has secrets that certain influential individuals would kill to keep buried . . . as well as one of her own that could turn everything on its head.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows the basics of punctuation, surely? Aren't we all taught at school how to use full stops, commas and question marks? And yet we see ignorance and indifference everywhere. "Its Summer!" says a sign that cries out for an apostrophe, "ANTIQUE,S," says another, bizarrely. "Pansy's ready," we learn to our considerable interest ("Is she?"), as we browse among the bedding plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Eats, Shoots &amp;amp; Leaves&lt;/i&gt;, Lynne Truss dares to say that, with our system of punctuation patently endangered, it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them for the wonderful and necessary things they are. If there are only pendants left who care, then so be it. "Sticklers unite" is her rallying cry. "You have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion - and arguably you didn't have much of that to begin with."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the book for people who love punctuation and get upset about it. From the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to Sir Roger Casement "hanged on a comma"; from George Orwell shunning the semicolon to Peter Cook saying Nevile Shute's three dots made him feel "all funny", this book makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.&lt;br /&gt;--front flap</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The world of dead babies is a silent and shuttered place. You do not know it exists until you find yourself there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alice Jolly's second child was stillborn and all subsequent attempts to have another baby failed, she began to consider every possible option, no matter how unorthodox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dead Babies and Seaside Towns&lt;/i&gt; is a savagely personal account of the search for an alternative way to create a family. As she battles through miscarriage, IVF and failed adoption attempts, Alice's only solace from the pain is the faded charm of Britain's crumbling seaside towns. Finally, this search leads her and her husband to a small town in Minnesota, and two remarkable women who offer to make the impossible possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this beautiful book, shot through with humour and full of hope, Alice Jolly describes with a novelist's skill events that woman live through every day – even if many feel compelled to keep them hidden. Her decision not to hide but to share them, without a trace of sentiment or self-pity, turns &lt;i&gt;Dead Babies and Seaside Towns&lt;/i&gt; into a universal story: one that begins in tragedy but ends in joy.</description>

  <description>In this remarkable blend of memoir and criticism, James Wood has written a master class on the connections between fiction and life. He argues that, of all the arts, fiction has a unique ability to describe the shape of our lives, and to rescue the texture of those lives from death and historical oblivion. The act of reading is understood here as the most sacred and personal of activities, and there are brilliant discussions of individual works – among others, Chekhov’s story ‘The Kiss’, W. G. Sebald’s &lt;i&gt;The Emigrants&lt;/i&gt;, and Fitzgerald’s &lt;i&gt;The Blue Flower&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wood reveals his own intimate relationship with the written word: we see the development of a provincial boy growing up in a charged Christian environment, the secret joy of his childhood reading, the links he makes between reading and blasphemy, or between literature and music. The final section discusses fiction in the context of exile and homelessness. &lt;i&gt;The Nearest Thing to Life&lt;/i&gt; is not simply a brief, tightly argued book by a man commonly regarded as our finest living critic – it is also an exhilarating personal account that reflects on, and embodies, the fruitful conspiracy between reader and writer (and critic), and asks us to re-consider everything that is at stake when we read and write fiction.</description>

  <description>Cats have been popular household pets for thousands of years, and their numbers only continue to rise. Today there are three cats for every dog on the planet, and yet cats remain more mysterious, even to their most adoring owners. Unlike dogs, cats evolved as solitary hunters, and, while many have learned to live alongside humans and even feel affection for us, they still don’t quite get us” the way dogs do, and perhaps they never will. But cats have rich emotional lives that we need to respect and understand if they are to thrive in our company. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Cat Sense&lt;/i&gt;, renowned anthrozoologist John Bradshaw takes us further into the mind of the domestic cat than ever before, using cutting-edge scientific research to dispel the myths and explain the true nature of our feline friends. Tracing the cat’s evolution from lone predator to domesticated companion, Bradshaw shows that although cats and humans have been living together for at least eight thousand years, cats remain independent, predatory, and wary of contact with their own kind, qualities that often clash with our modern lifestyles. Cats still have three out of four paws firmly planted in the wild, and within only a few generations can easily revert back to the independent way of life that was the exclusive preserve of their predecessors some 10,000 years ago. Cats are astonishingly flexible, and given the right environment they can adapt to a life of domesticity with their owners—but to continue do so, they will increasingly need our help. If we’re to live in harmony with our cats, Bradshaw explains, we first need to understand their inherited quirks: understanding their body language, keeping their environments—however small—sufficiently interesting, and becoming more proactive in managing both their natural hunting instincts and their relationships with other cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-read for any cat lover, &lt;i&gt;Cat Sense&lt;/i&gt; offers humane, penetrating insights about the domestic cat that challenge our most basic assumptions and promise to dramatically improve our pets’ lives—and ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In this utterly remarkable novel Karl Ove Knausgaard writes with painful honesty about his childhood and teenage years, his infatuation with rock music, his relationship with his loving yet almost invisible mother and his distant and unpredictable father, and his bewilderment and grief on his father's death. When he becomes a father himself, he must balance the demands of caring for a young family with his determination to write great literature. A Death in the Family is a Proustian exploration of his past, in which Knausgaard creates a universal story of the struggles u great and small u that we all face in our lives. A Death in the Family is a profoundly serious, gripping and hugely readable work written as if the author's very life were at stake.</description>

  <description>Inspired by D.H. Lawrence, Chekhov, and Hemingway, Bukowski's writing is passionate, extreme and has attracted a cult following, while his life was as weird and wild as the tales he wrote. This collection of short stories gives an insight into the dark, dangerous lowlife of Los Angeles that Bukowski inhabited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From prostitutes to classical music, Bukowski ingeniously mixes high and low culture in his 'tales of ordinary madness'. These are angry yet tender, humorous and haunting portrayals of life in the underbelly of Los Angeles.</description>

  <description>Marshall McLuhan, the celebrated social theorist who defined the culture of the 1960s, is remembered now primarily for the aphoristic slogan he coined to explain the emerging new world of global communication: “The medium is the message.” Half a century later, McLuhan’s predictions about the end of print culture and the rise of “electronic inter-dependence” have become a reality—in a sense, the reality—of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglas Coupland, whose iconic novel Generation X was a “McLuhanesque” account of our culture in fictional form, has written a compact biography of the cultural critic that interprets the life and work of his subject from inside. A fellow Canadian, a master of creative sociology, a writer who supplied a defining term, Coupland is the ideal chronicler of the uncanny prophet whose vision of the global village—now known as the Internet—has come to pass in the 21st century.</description>

  <description>An unfaithful husband goes out to buy flowers for his wife, while across town a new couple, both survivors of difficult childhoods, find comfort together in other people's apartments. On the edge of a university campus, a group of students are brought together by their ageing drama professor, whose predilection for pot and crush on his star pupil threaten to tip their performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream into a surreal and dangerous farce. And in the title story, a bereaved art teacher drives into the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia intending to throw away his ex-girlfriend's paintings. Exquisitely composed and executed with great empathy, Antrim's richly detailed fictional worlds explore the joy and emotional chaos of life as we live it.</description>

  <description>Beloved artist Richard Diebenkorn (1922–1993) is best known for paintings that powerfully evoke the California coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles. A West Coast native, Diebenkorn captured the light and color of the land and sea in a way that resonates with anyone who has spent time there. This volume contains a biographical introduction by Sarah C. Bancroft, an essay on Diebenkorn’s influences by Steven Nash, and an essay on Diebenkorn’s works on paper by Edith Devaney. Together these bring the artist’s rich, four-decade-long career into focus. The book covers Diebenkorn’s three distinct periods, which saw him gain recognition as a leading Abstract Expressionist in the early 1950s, then turn to figurative painting, before embarking on a highly successful period of abstract paintings and drawings— the Ocean Park Series. It is the perfect introduction to the work of this seminal California artist.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;All Our Names&lt;/i&gt; is the story of two young men who come of age during an African revolution, drawn from the safe confines of the university campus into the intensifying clamor of the streets outside. But as the line between idealism and violence becomes increasingly blurred, the friends are driven apart—one into the deepest peril, as the movement gathers inexorable force, and the other into the safety of exile in the American Midwest. There, pretending to be an exchange student, he falls in love with a social worker and settles into small-town life. Yet this idyll is inescapably darkened by the secrets of his past: the acts he committed and the work he left unfinished. Most of all, he is haunted by the beloved friend he left behind, the charismatic leader who first guided him to revolution and then sacrificed everything to ensure his freedom.</description>

  <description>Michael Lewis is back with Flash Boys, the headline-grabbing, game-changing international bestseller exposing the underworld of global finance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you thought Wall Street was about alpha males standing in trading pits hollering at each other, think again. That world is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the world's money is traded by computer code, inside black boxes in heavily guarded buildings. Even the experts entrusted with your cash don't know what's happening to it. And the very few who do aren't about to tell - because they're making a killing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a market that's rigged, out of control and out of sight; a market in which the chief need is for speed; and in which traders would sell their grandmothers for a microsecond. Blink, and you'll miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Flash Boys, Michael Lewis tells the explosive story of how one group of ingenious oddballs and misfits set out to expose what was going on. It's the story of what it's like to declare war on some of the richest and most powerful people in the world. It's about taking on an entire system. And it's about the madness that has taken hold of the financial markets today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won't believe it until you've read it.</description>

  <description>For decades, the backbone of film criticism has been the hatchet job -- the entertaining trashing of a film by professional reviewers, seen by many as cynical snobs. But with the arrival of the internet, have the critics finally fallen under the axe? With movie posters now just as likely to be adorned by Twitter quotes as fusty reviewer recommendations, has the rise of enthusiastic amateurism sounded the death knell of a profession? Are the democratic opportunities of the internet any more reliable than the old gripes and prejudices of the establishment? Can editing really be done by robots? And what kind of films would we have if we listened to what the audience thinks it wants? Starting with the celebrated TV fight between film-maker Ken Russell and critic Alexander Walker (the former hit the latter with a rolled-up copy of his Evening Standard review on live television) and ending with his own admission to Steven Spielberg of a major error of judgement, Mark Kermode takes us on a journey across the modern cinematic landscape. Like its predecessor, The Good, The Bad and The Multiplex, Hatchet Job blends historical analysis with trenchant opinion, bitter personal prejudices, autobiographical diversions and anecdotes, and laugh-out-loud acerbic humour. It's the perfect book for anyone who's ever expressed an opinion about a movie.</description>

  <description>En smuk vinterdag forsvinder den unge, fremadstormende folketingspolitiker Merete Lynggaard sporløst. Medierne kaster sig over historien, og overskrifterne gætter på alt fra mord og selvmord til frivillig forsvinden. Politiet sætter straks en storstilet eftersøgning i gang, men uden resultat. Merete Lynggaard er som sunket i jorden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Først da den hårdt prøvede vicekriminalkommissær Carl Mørck sættes i spidsen for politiets nyoprettede afdeling for ´Sager under særlig bevågenhed´, sker der et afgørende skred i efterforskningen. Og snart er Carl Mørck og hans assistent Assad på sporet af en hensynsløs forbryder, som drevet af had har lagt en helt afsindig plan. Spørgsmålet er, om Carl Mørck og Assad kan nå at forpurre den, eller om de selv vil blive ofre for den.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime. So when a man succumbs to complications from being shot by a stray bullet nine years earlier, Bosch catches a case in which the body is still fresh, but any other evidence is virtually nonexistent.&lt;p&gt;Now Bosch and his new partner, rookie Detective Lucia Soto, are tasked with solving what turns out to be a highly charged, politically sensitive case. Starting with the bullet that's been lodged for years in the victim's spine, they must pull new leads from years-old information, which soon reveals that this shooting may have been anything but random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this gripping new thriller, Michael Connelly shows once again why Harry Bosch is "one of the greats of crime fiction" (New York Daily News).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she's only watched from afar. Now they'll see; she's much more than just the girl on the train...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You can leave the army, but the army doesn’t leave you. Not always. Not completely&lt;/b&gt;, notes Jack Reacher—and sure enough, the retired military cop is soon pulled back into service. This time, for the State Department and the CIA.&lt;p&gt;Someone has taken a shot at the president of France in the City of Light. The bullet was American. The distance between the gunman and the target was exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile with total confidence? Very few, but John Kott—an American marksman gone bad—is one of them. And after fifteen years in prison, he’s out, unaccounted for, and likely drawing a bead on a G8 summit packed with enough world leaders to tempt any assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone can stop Kott, it’s the man who beat him before: Reacher. And though he’d rather work alone, Reacher is teamed with Casey Nice, a rookie analyst who keeps her cool with Zoloft. But they’re facing a rough road, full of ruthless mobsters, Serbian thugs, close calls, double-crosses—and no backup if they’re caught. All the while Reacher can’t stop thinking about the woman he once failed to save. But he won’t let that that happen again. Not this time. Not Nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reacher never gets too close. But now a killer is making it personal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jim Harrison's latest collection of two novellas is Harrison at his most memorable: two men, one young and one older, confronting lost and new love, possibilities, endings, and the encroachment of civilization on nature. In The Land of Unlikeness, Clive, a failed artist, divorced and grappling with aging, returns to his Michigan family's farmhouse to spell his sister's caregiving of their mother for a month. The return to familiar ground provides a groundswell of upheaval in Clive's 20-years long life patterns. In The River Swimmer, Thad, an Upper Peninsula island farm boy struggles to cope with life out of the water, and coming of age on dry land. The River Swimmer is a porrait of two striking and richly drawn characters, written with Harrison's wit, and revelatory insight into the human condition.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“In &lt;/i&gt;Genesis&lt;i&gt;, my camera allowed nature to speak to me. And it was my privilege to listen.&lt;/i&gt;” —Sebastião Salgado&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On a very fortuitous day in 1970, 26-year-old &lt;b&gt;Sebastião Salgado&lt;/b&gt; held a camera for the first time. When he looked through the viewfinder, he experienced a revelation: suddenly life made sense. From that day onward—though it took years of hard work before he had the experience to earn his living as a photographer—the camera became his tool for interacting with our world. Salgado, who “always preferred the chiaroscuro palette of black-and-white images,” shot very little color in his early career before giving it up completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Raised on a farm in Brazil, Salgado possessed a deep love and respect for nature; he was also particularly sensitive to the ways in which human beings are affected by their often devastating socio-economic conditions. Of the myriad works Salgado has produced in his acclaimed career,&lt;b&gt; three long-term projects &lt;/b&gt;stand out: &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Workers&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(1993), documenting the vanishing way of life of manual laborers across the world, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Migrations&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(2000), a tribute to mass migration driven by hunger, natural disasters, environmental degradation and demographic pressure, and&lt;b&gt; this new opus, &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt;, the result of an epic eight-year expedition to rediscover the mountains, deserts and oceans, the animals and peoples that have so far escaped the imprint of modern society&lt;/b&gt;—the land and life of a still-pristine planet. “Some 46% of the planet is still as it was in the time of genesis,” Salgado reminds us. “We must preserve what exists.” The &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt; project, along with the Salgados’ Instituto Terra, are dedicated to showing the beauty of our planet, reversing the damage done to it, and preserving it for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over 30 trips—travelled by foot, light aircraft, seagoing vessels, canoes, and even balloons, through extreme heat and cold and in sometimes dangerous conditions—&lt;b&gt;Salgado created a collection of images showing us nature&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;animals&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;and indigenous peoples in breathtaking beauty&lt;/b&gt;. Mastering the monochrome with an extreme deftness to rival the virtuoso Ansel Adams, Salgado brings black-and-white photography to a new dimension; the tonal variations in his works, the contrasts of light and dark, recall the works of Old Masters such as Rembrandt and Georges de La Tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What does one discover in &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt;? The animal species and volcanoes of the Galápagos; penguins, sea lions, cormorants, and whales of the Antarctic and South Atlantic; Brazilian alligators and jaguars; African lions, leopards, and elephants; the isolated Zo’é tribe deep in the Amazon jungle; the Stone Age Korowai people of West Papua; nomadic Dinka cattle farmers in Sudan; Nenet nomads and their reindeer herds in the Arctic Circle; Mentawai jungle communities on islands west of Sumatra; the icebergs of the Antarctic; the volcanoes of Central Africa and the Kamchatka Peninsula; Saharan deserts; the Negro and Juruá rivers in the Amazon; the ravines of the Grand Canyon; the glaciers of Alaska... and beyond. Having dedicated so much time, energy, and passion to the making of this work, Salgado likens &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt; to “my love letter to the planet.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whereas the limited Collector’s Edition is conceived like a large-format portfolio that meanders across the planet, &lt;b&gt;this unlimited book presents a selection of photographs arranged in five chapters geographically: Planet South, Sanctuaries, Africa, Northern Spaces, Amazonia and Pantanal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each in its own way, this book and the Collector’s edition—both edited and designed by Lélia Wanick Salgado—pay homage to Salgado’s triumphant and unparalleled &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt; project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The world premiere of &lt;i&gt;Sebastião Salgado: Genesis &lt;/i&gt;will open at the Natural History Museum in London on April 11, 2013&lt;/b&gt;. The exhibition builds on the Museum’s reputation as the home of the planet’s best nature photography. For further information and to book tickets please go to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/salgado" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.nhm.ac.uk/salgado&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, from May 14th, a special portfolio of plantinum prints from &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt; will be shown at Phillips Howick Place gallery in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Worldwide venues for the &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt; exhibition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Natural History Museum, London, UK - April 11 through September 8, 2013 The Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada - May 2 through September 2, 2013 Ara Pacis Museum, Rome, Italy - May 15 through September 15, 2013 Jardim Botânico, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil - May 28 through August 25, 2013 Musée de l’Elysée, Lausanne, Switzerland - September 21, 2013 through January 12, 2014 La Maison Européenne de la Photographie (MEP), Paris, France - September 25, 2013 through January 5, 2014 SESC Belenzinho, São Paulo, SP, Brazil - September 9 - November 2013</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fatal Vision &lt;/i&gt;is the electrifying true story of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, the handsome, Princeton-educated physician convicted of savagely slaying his young pregnant wife and two small children, murders he vehemently denies committing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Joe McGinniss chronicles every aspect of this horrifying and intricate crime, and probes the life and psyche of the magnetic, all-American Jeffrey MacDonald, a golden boy who seemed destined to have it all. The result is a penetration to the heart of darkness that enshrouded one of the most complex criminal cases ever to capture the attention of the American public. It is a haunting, stunningly suspenseful work that no reader will be able to forget.</description>

  <description>As you read this, thousands of remote computers are refining secret models of who you are, using the information to make huge fortunes for a few people. Does the future have to be this way? How can we change it? In this visionary book Jaron Lanier imagines an alternative, where economic power is given back to creators. Drawing on sources ranging from ancient philosophy to the latest technology, he proposes a radical system that truly rewards endeavour - whether it's in the media or manufacturing - and ultimately preserves human dignity.</description>

  <description>A darkly comic novel of twenty-first-century domestic life and the possibility of personal transformation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harold Silver has spent a lifetime watching his younger brother, George, a taller, smarter, and more successful high-flying TV executive, acquire a covetable wife, two kids, and a beautiful home in the suburbs of New York City. But Harry, a historian and Nixon scholar, also knows George has a murderous temper, and when George loses control the result is an act of violence so shocking that both brothers are hurled into entirely new lives in which they both must seek absolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry finds himself suddenly playing parent to his brother’s two adolescent children, tumbling down the rabbit hole of Internet sex, dealing with aging parents who move through time like travelers on a fantastic voyage. As Harry builds a twenty-first-century family created by choice rather than biology, we become all the more aware of the ways in which our history, both personal and political, can become our destiny and either compel us to repeat our errors or be the catalyst for change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;May We Be Forgiven&lt;/i&gt; is an unnerving, funny tale of unexpected intimacies and of how one deeply fractured family might begin to put itself back together.</description>

  <description>Rapturously received by critics and enthusiastically embraced by readers, &lt;i&gt;The Great Leader&lt;/i&gt; is an enthralling, blackly comic take on the detective story that follows a retired detective in hilarious and bold pursuit of a sinister cult leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Sunderson is on the verge of retirement when he begins to investigate a hedonistic cult that has set up camp near his home in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. At first, the self-declared Great Leader seems merely a harmless oddball, but as Sunderson and his unlikely sixteen-year-old sidekick dig deeper, they find him more intelligent and sinister than they realized. Recently divorced and frequently pickled in alcohol, Sunderson tracks his quarry from the woods of Michigan to a town in Arizona, filled with professional and criminal border-crossers, and on to Nebraska where the Great Leader’s most recent recruits have gathered to glorify his questionable religion. But Sunderson’s demons are also in pursuit of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich with character, unexpected twists, and Harrison’s trademark wry wit, &lt;i&gt;The Great Leader&lt;/i&gt; is at once a gripping American odyssey and the poignant story of a man grappling with age, lost love, and his own darker nature.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>On an October evening in South Pasadena, a horrifying wave of flame swept through a large home improvement center, snuffing out the lives of four innocent people, including a two-year-old boy. Firefighters rushed to the scene, even as a pair of equally suspicious fires broke out in two nearby stores. Silently watching the raging inferno in the midst of the heat, smoke, and chaos was a man respected as one of California's foremost arson investigators, a captain in the Glendale Fire Department ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Joseph Wambaugh, the critically acclaimed,nationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Onion Field&lt;/em&gt;, comes the astonishing true story of a nightmarish obsession -- and the hunt for a brilliant psychopath who lived a double life filled with professional tributes and terrifying secrets.</description>

  <description>Riktor doesn’t like the way the policeman comes straight into the house without knocking. He doesn’t like the arrogant way he observes his home.The policeman doesn’t tell him why he’s there, and Riktor doesn’t ask. Because he knows he’s guilty of a terrible crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it turns out that the policeman isn’t looking for a missing person. He is accusing Riktor of something totally unexpected. Riktor doesn’t have a clear conscience, but this is a crime he certainly didn’t commit.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2014 Duff Cooper Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2015 Welsh Book of the Year Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortlisted for the 2015 James Tait Black Memorial Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortlisted for the 2015 PEN Ackerley prize &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longlisted for the 2014 Thwaites Wainwright Prize &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disarming, eloquent and illuminating, this meditation on place, time and memory, could only have been written by a poet, or a novelist, or a professor. Happily, Patrick McGuinness is all three, and &lt;i&gt;Other People's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Countries&lt;/i&gt; is a marvel: a stunning piece of lyrical writing, rich in narrative and character – full of fresh ways of looking at how we grow up, how we start to make sense of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book evolved out of stories the author told his children: stories about the Belgian border town of Bouillon, where his mother came from, and where he has been going three times a year since he was a child – first with his parents and now with his son and daughter. This town of eccentrics, of charm, menace and wonder, is re-created beautifully – 'Most of my childhood,' he says, 'feels more real to me now than it did then'. For all its sharp specifics, though, this is a book about the common, universal concerns of childhood and the slowly developing deep sense of place that is the bedrock for our memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alert and affectionate, full of great curiosity and humour, &lt;i&gt;Other People's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Countries&lt;/i&gt; has all the depth and complexity of its own subject – memory – and is an unfashionably distilled, resonant book: unusual and exquisite.</description>

  <description>The Office of the Public Defender is not known as a training ground for bright young litigators. Clay Carter has been there too long, and, like most of his colleagues, dreams of a better job in a real firm. When he reluctantly takes the case of a young man charged with a random street killing, he assumes it is just another of the many senseless murders that hit Washington D.C. every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he digs deeper into his client's background, Clay stumbles upon a conspiracy too horrible to believe. He suddenly finds himself in the middle of a complex case against one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, looking at an enormous settlement that would totally change his life &lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt; a settlement that would make him, almost overnight, the legal profession's newest king of torts...</description>

  <description>From a cutting-edge cultural commentator, a bold and brilliant challenge to cherished notions of the Internet as the great leveler of our age&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internet has been hailed as an unprecedented democratizing force, a place where all can be heard and everyone can participate equally. But how true is this claim? In a seminal dismantling of techno-utopian visions, "The People's Platform" argues that for all that we "tweet" and "like" and "share," the Internet in fact reflects and amplifies real-world inequities at least as much as it ameliorates them. Online, just as off-line, attention and influence largely accrue to those who already have plenty of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we have seen so far, Astra Taylor says, has been not a revolution but a rearrangement. Although Silicon Valley tycoons have eclipsed Hollywood moguls, a handful of giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook remain the gatekeepers. And the worst habits of the old media model--the pressure to seek easy celebrity, to be quick and sensational above all--have proliferated online, where "aggregating" the work of others is the surest way to attract eyeballs and ad revenue. When culture is "free," creative work has diminishing value, and advertising fuels the system. The new order looks suspiciously like the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can do better, Taylor insists. The online world does offer a unique opportunity, but a democratic culture that supports diverse voices and work of lasting value will not spring up from technology alone. If we want the Internet to truly be a people's platform, we will have to make it so.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Place in the Country&lt;/i&gt; is a window into the brilliant mind of W. G. Sebald.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When W. G. Sebald travelled to Manchester in 1966, he packed in his bags certain literary favourites which would remain central to him throughout the rest of his life and during the years when he was settled in England. In &lt;i&gt;A Place in the Country, &lt;/i&gt;he reflects on six of the figures who shaped him as a person and as a writer, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Jan Peter Tripp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusing biography and essay, and finding, as ever, inspiration in place - as when he journeys to the Ile St. Pierre, the tiny, lonely Swiss island where Jean-Jacques Rousseau found solace and inspiration - Sebald lovingly brings his subjects to life in his distinctive, inimitable voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A fascinating volume that confirms Sebald as one of Europe's most mysterious and best-loved literary imaginations' &lt;i&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Sebald was in possession of the uncanny ability to make his own intellectual obsessions, immediately, compulsively his reader's' &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Irresistible . . . an intimate anatomy of the pathos, absurdity and perverse splendour of trying to find patterns in the chaos of the world' &lt;i&gt;Independent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;W . G. Sebald was born in Wertach im Allgäu, Germany, in 1944 and died in December 2001. He studied German language and literature in Freiburg, Switzerland and Manchester. In 1996 he took up a position as an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester and settled permanently in England in 1970. He was Professor of European Literature at the University of East Anglia and is the author of The Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn, Vertigo, Austerlitz, After Nature, On the Natural History of Destruction, Campo Santo, Unrecounted and a selection of poetry, Across the Land and the Water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Catling taught German for a number of years alongside W. G. Sebald at the University of East Anglia, where she is currently a senior lecturer in the School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing.</description>
