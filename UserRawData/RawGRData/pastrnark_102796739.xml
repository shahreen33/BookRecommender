  <description>The headline could write itself:&lt;br /&gt;Matthew Hawkins, star defensive end, comes out of retirement to play for the Washington Wolves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is perfectly fine by Ava Baker—it makes her job as publicist for the team easier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only two problems. This particular football player was her first crush. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bigger problem: Matthew Hawkins was once engaged to her older sister. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Ava has seen Matthew. He’s bigger, better looking, and best of all—completely single. Despite his history with her sister, the attraction between Ava and Matthew isn’t so one-sided anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s hot enough to burn down the entire city of Seattle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this headline is far more complicated to write. And not just for the press or what it means for her family— because once her heart is involved, there’s no predicting the ending.</description>

  <description>Liliana Scuderi has been in love with Romero from the moment she first saw him. After her sisters were married off for tactical reasons, she hopes she might be allowed to choose a husband for herself, but when her father promises her to a man more than twice her age that hope is crushed. No begging can make him change his mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romero has always ignored Lily’s flirting. Her age and status made her off-limits but even someone as dutiful as him has only so much control. Wanting her when she’s supposed to marry another man could mean war between New York and the Chicago Outfit, and Romero has always put the Famiglia first. Lily suspects her sisters and Romero would risk everything for her, but is her happiness worth that much? Is love worth a war between the New York Famiglia and the Chicago Outfit?</description>

  <description>Allie Sutton just got a new job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one she wants, and definitely not one she's prepared for. She hadn't seen her dad in years, so the last thing she expects upon his sudden death is to inherit the thing he loved more than anything (or anyone) ... the professional football team he owned for the last twenty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Pierson does not want a new boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he wants is to be a good father to his daughter, the best quarterback possible for his teammates. What he doesn't need is a blonde bombshell ruining the team's chances at another championship. Especially when that bombshell turns out to be his new neighbor. The neighbor he was a complete jerk to the first time they met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the sake of the team, they treat each other like complete professionals. In public, at least. Behind closed doors, it's a different story. And the fallout of giving in to that heat is something neither one of them can see coming.</description>

  <description>When Gianna watched her sister Aria getting married to a man she barely knew, she promised herself she wouldn’t let the same thing happen to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matteo – The Blade – Vitiello set his eyes on Gianna the moment he saw her on his brother Luca’s wedding, and Rocco Scuderi is more than willing to give his daughter to him, but Gianna has no intention of marrying for any other reason than love. A few months before the wedding, Gianna escapes her bodyguards and runs away. She has enough money to flee to Europe and begin a new life. But staying undetected when the mob is searching for her is a challenge that takes everything, especially as one of their best hunters and assassins is after her: Matteo Vitiello. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months on the run, Gianna finally settles into a tentative routine in Munich, but then Matteo and a couple of her father’s soldiers find her with another man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her pleads they kill her boyfriend, and Gianna is forced to marry Matteo. Her emotions alternating between guilt over having dragged an innocent into her world and hatred toward Matteo, Gianna is determined to make life hell for her husband. But Matteo is a master at mind games and their struggle for power soon turns into hate-fueled nights of passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book three in the &lt;b&gt;Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;. This book can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Law of Henna and Bodhi: &lt;br /&gt;When love breaks, fall inward, fall together, and fall hard. Then let time pick up the pieces. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything feels temporary when you’ve experienced tragedy—until Henna Lane meets Bodhi at a music festival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Young and spontaneous, they have a lust for seizing the moment, falling hard and fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Bodhi is forced to leave without a goodbye, Henna thinks she’ll never get over him. But then she meets Mr. Malone, her sexy, new guidance counselor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are reckless. &lt;br /&gt;They are forbidden. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When their secret is discovered, Henna has to choose between finishing school—banned from seeing Mr. Malone—or dropping out to follow her nomad dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Henna chooses her dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over time, she learns that life is not a destination or a journey, some things are more than temporary, and the forbidden can never be ignored. But if she returns for him, will he still be hers? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Place Without You is an emotional story of young love, shattered dreams, and impossible decisions.</description>

  <description>From: LilyNBlack@Gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;To: JosephineKeller@VogueMagazine.com&lt;br /&gt;Subject: You're a flippin' idiot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good morning my dear, &lt;i&gt;naive&lt;/i&gt; friend, I hope you're enjoying a breakfast of regret and sorrow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you sent me to work for Dean Harper, aka a control freak in a tailor-made suit. Sure he owns the trendiest restaurants in NYC, but c'mon Jo, his ego makes Kanye West look like the Dalai Lama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's the type of guy that only hears the word "no" when it's followed by "don't stop."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working for Dean Harper would be like selling my soul to the devil... and before you say anything, I don't care if the devil has punch-you-in-the-gut brown eyes and an ass to match. My soul isn't for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regretfully yours, Lily</description>

  <description>Dante – The Boss – Cavallaro’s wife died four years ago. On the verge of becoming the youngest head in the history of the Chicago mafia, Dante needs a new wife and Valentina was chosen for the role. &lt;br /&gt;Valentina lost her husband, too, but her first marriage had always been for show. When she was eighteen, she agreed to marry Antonio in order to hide the truth: that he was gay and in love with an outsider. Even after his death, she kept his secret, not only to preserve the honor of a dead man, but also to protect herself. But now that she’s about to marry Dante, her castle of lies threatens to crash. Dante is only thirty-six but already feared and respected in the Outfit, and he’s notorious for always getting what he wants. Valentina is terrified of the wedding night that might reveal her secret, but her worries prove unfounded when Dante shows her the cold shoulder. Soon her fear is replaced by confusion and indignation. Valentina is tired of being ignored. She’s determined to get Dante’s attention and desire, even if she can’t get his heart that still belongs to his dead wife.</description>

  <description>Born into one of the leading Mob families in Chicago, Aria Scuderi struggles to find her own path in a world where no choices are given. Aria was only fifteen when her parents betrothed her to Luca – The Vice – Vitiello, the oldest son of the head of the New York Cosa Nostra to ensure peace between the two families. &lt;br /&gt;Now with eighteen, the day Aria has been dreading for years is looming dangerously: her wedding to Luca. &lt;br /&gt;Aria is terrified of marrying a man she hardly knows, especially someone like Luca who got his nickname ‘the Vice’ for crushing a man’s throat with his bare hands. Luca might be one of the most sought after men in New York thanks to his good looks, wealth and predator-like charisma that radiates power, but the society girls throwing themselves at him don’t know what Aria does: that the bad boy aura isn’t just a game; blood and death lurk beneath Luca’s striking gray eyes and arrogant smile.&lt;br /&gt;In her world a handsome exterior often hides the monster within; a monster who can just as easily kill as kiss you.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to escape the marriage to Luca would be to run away and leave everything she’s ever known behind but Aria can’t bear the thought of never seeing her family again. &lt;br /&gt;Despite her fear, she decides to go through with the marriage; Aria has grown up among predators like Luca and knows that even most cold-hearted bastards have a heart and she has every intention of working her way into Luca’s.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I was issued a warning: stay away from Ben Rosenberg.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clifton Cove’s resident “king”, he thinks he’s entitled to anyone and anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, I’ve spent my whole life following the rules and playing it safe. I know what it feels like to be the good girl. I’m the police chief’s daughter and a librarian—&lt;i&gt;for adorable children&lt;/i&gt;, no less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-nighter with a fictional hunk is about as exciting as my life gets until one day, fate decides to take pity on me and shove me straight into the path of Mr. Off-Limits himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as I suspected, every inch of him promises to be my demise. Up close, he’s tall, menacing—a lawyer who looks like he’ll bite. A well-behaved girl would do as she’s told and avoid him at all costs, but I’m overdue for a little rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ignore the warning and throw caution to the wind. But Ben doesn’t just nudge me out of my comfort zone—he thrusts me into a dark corner and presses his hard body against mine, covering my mouth with his hand to ensure we don’t get caught sneaking around. In that moment, I finally understand why everyone thinks he’s going to ruin me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To him, this is all a game. &lt;br /&gt;He wants to tempt me with his dares and taunt me with his words. &lt;br /&gt;I should play along. After all, I asked him to make me bad. I just never thought he’d take his job quite so seriously...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand-new standalone novel in the New York Times bestselling Briar U series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned after last year’s distractions cost my hockey team our entire season? No more screwing up. No more screwing, period. As the new team captain, I need a new philosophy: hockey and school now, women later. Which means that I, Hunter Davenport, am officially going celibate…no matter how hard that makes things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s nothing in the rulebook that says I can’t be &lt;i&gt;friends&lt;/i&gt; with a woman. And I won’t lie—my new classmate Demi Davis is one cool chick. Her smart mouth is hot as hell, and so is the rest of her, but the fact that she’s got a boyfriend eliminates the temptation to touch her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except three months into our friendship, Demi is single and looking for a rebound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she’s making a play for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoiding her is impossible. We’re paired up on a yearlong school project, but I’m confident I can resist her. We’d never work, anyway. Our backgrounds are too different, our goals aren’t aligned, and her parents hate my guts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooking up is a very bad idea. Now I just have to convince my body—and my heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even for a top-gun banker, temptation this hot is quite a gamble, in a sexy Wall Street romp from New York Times bestselling author Lauren Layne.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alpha among the wolves of Wall Street, Kennedy Dawson rose to the top of the pack by striking the right contracts at the right times. But there’s one deal that’s been giving him a run for his money—a pact to never again let his assistant, Kate, get under his skin. She may be smart, gorgeous, and sharp as a whip, but she’s definitely off-limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Henley isn’t a banker, but she knows a thing or two about risk management—specifically, about &lt;i&gt;managing&lt;/i&gt; her attraction to her smolderingly sexy boss. She already fell once, and Kennedy showed no sign of paying a return on her investment. So when Kennedy’s brother starts pursuing her, Kate figures she has the best of both worlds. Jack is charming, rich, very attentive, and the spitting image of his older brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also making Kennedy think twice. But to win Kate’s heart, he’ll have to broker the deal of a lifetime…and prove he’s worth the risk.</description>

After half a lifetime of watching Colin Bridgerton from afar, she thinks she knows everything about him, until she stumbles across his deepest secret... and fears she doesn't know him at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colin Bridgerton is tired of being thought nothing but an empty-headed charmer, tired of everyone's preoccupation with the notorious gossip columnist Lady Whistledown, who can't seem to publish an edition without mentioning him in the first paragraph. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Colin returns to London from a trip aboard, he discovers nothing in his life is quite the same, especially Penelope Featherington, the girl haunting his dreams! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when he discovers that Penelope has secrets of her own, this elusive bachelor must decide... is she his biggest threat, or his promise of a happy ending?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;1814 promises to be another eventful season, but not, this author believes, for Anthony Bridgerton, London's most elusive bachelor, who has shown no indication that he plans to marry.&lt;br /&gt;And in truth, why should he? When it comes to playing the consummate rake, nobody does it better...&lt;br /&gt;—Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, &lt;/i&gt;April 1814&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time, the gossip columnists have it wrong. Anthony Bridgerton hasn't just decided to marry—he's even chosen a wife! The only obstacle is his intended's older sister, Kate Sheffield—the most meddlesome woman ever to grace a London ballroom. The spirited schemer is driving Anthony mad with her determination to stop the betrothal, but when he closes his eyes at night, Kate is the woman haunting his increasingly erotic dreams...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Kate is quite sure that reformed rakes do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; make the best husbands—and Anthony Bridgerton is the most wicked rogue of them all. Kate is determined to protect her sister—but she fears her own heart is vulnerable. And when Anthony's lips touch hers, she's suddenly afraid she might not be able to resist the reprehensible rake herself...</description>

  <description>Mr. Fisk Centers has it made: a personal fortune of three million dollars enables him, at the tender ages of 50, to take an early retirement and enjoy all the comforts 21st-century Earth has to offer. Then he gets a call from Mars Ltd. offering him a real-estate deal that sounds too good to be true. It is. Now penniless and unemployed, Centers will do anything to make a buck. . . .

  <description>A tyrant by day, a playboy by night. That is the reputation that precedes Richard VanRyan. He lives life the way he wants, no concern for the opinion of others. He cares for no one, is completely unrepentant, and he has no desire to change his ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katharine Elliott works under Richard as his PA. She despises him and his questionable ethics, but endures all the garbage he sends her way, because she needs the job. Her end goal is far more important than the daily abuse and demands she tolerates from her nasty tyrant of a boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day, he asks her for something she never expected. A new role with a personal contract — fiancée instead of PA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when two people who loathe each other, have to live together and act as though they are madly in love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the power of love really change a person?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they survive the contract?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do when the one person you hate the most becomes the one person you can’t live without?</description>

  <description>Dr. Russell has a bad reputation around our hospital. The scrub techs say he’s cold-blooded, the nurses say he’s too cocky for his own good, and the residents say he’s the best surgeon in the world—&lt;i&gt;really, just a swell guy!&lt;/i&gt;—on the off chance he’s within earshot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to avoid him and his temper at all costs. It’s just as easy to admire his sexy, grip-it-while-he’s ravishing-you hair and chiseled jaw from a healthy distance, preferably from the other end of the hallway half-hidden behind a plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my plan crumbles when my trusty ol’ boss decides to swap his white coat for a Hawaiian shirt. His retirement leaves me with two terrible options: switch specialties and spend months retraining, or take an open position as Dr. Russell’s surgical assistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means I have to stand near him in the OR for hours on end and anticipate his every need without letting his biting words and bad attitude intimidate me. Oh, and as if that’s not difficult enough, my silly crush on him—the one I’ve tried to stomp on until it disappears—might just be &lt;i&gt;reciprocated&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m fine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my job seriously. There will be no smoldering bedroom eyes across the operating table, no angry almost-kisses in the storage closet. (Well, no &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; of those.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s the phrase? An apple a day keeps the doctor away?&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should go for a whole damn bushel.</description>

  <description>When your life is a hot mess at twenty, it’s cute. At twenty-seven… well, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s just that my lofty dreams—making it as a real estate agent, paying rent on time, showering daily—have stayed just that: &lt;i&gt;dreams&lt;/i&gt;. Oh, and love? I’ve decided love might be a little ambitious for me at the moment. Instead, I’ve settled for the two guys who will never leave me: Ben &amp;amp; Jerry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until Dr. Adam Foxe takes up residence as the town’s new vet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his strong jaw, easy confidence, and form-fitting scrubs, it’s not long before every housewife in Hamilton is dragging neglected tomcats in for weekly checkups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else, I’m intrigued. Even after I spoil my chance at a good first impression, he still offers me a proposition I can’t refuse: play his girlfriend at a family function and he’ll hire me as his real estate agent. &lt;i&gt;Welcome to love in the 21st century.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s too bad I underestimated Adam’s irresistible charm and the undeniable attraction that burns between us. The day he pins me to the wall and silences me with a kiss, the line between reality and ruse begins to blur. Every teasing touch brings me to my knees. Every kiss promises more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like my hot mess of a life is about to get a little &lt;i&gt;hotter&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Can there be any greater challenge to London’s Ambitious Mamas than an unmarried duke?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers, April 1813&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all accounts, &lt;b&gt;Simon Basset&lt;/b&gt; is on the verge of proposing to his best friend’s sister, the lovely—and almost-on-the-shelf—&lt;b&gt;Daphne Bridgerton&lt;/b&gt;. But the two of them know the truth—it’s all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it’s hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it’s his devilish smile, certainly it’s the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her… but somehow Daphne is falling for the dashing duke… for real! And now she must do the impossible and convince the handsome rogue that their clever little scheme deserves a slight alteration, and that nothing makes quite as much sense as falling in love…</description>

  <description>A bombshell bookworm. A chronic Casanova. And a lesson in chemistry too scandalous for school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Hanna Bergstrom receives a lecture from her overprotective brother about neglecting her social life and burying herself in grad school, she’s determined to tackle his implied assignment: get out, make friends, start dating. And who better to turn her into the sultry siren every man wants than her brother’s gorgeous best friend, Will Sumner, venture capitalist and unapologetic playboy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will takes risks for a living, but he’s skeptical about this challenge of Hanna’s…until the wild night his innocently seductive pupil tempts him into bed- and teaches him a thing or two about being with a woman he can’t forget. Now that Hanna’s discovered the power of her own sex appeal, it’s up to Will to prove he’s the only man she’ll ever need.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author, Penelope Ward, comes a friends-to-lovers story with sexy new characters. After getting dumped, the last thing I needed was to move next door to someone who reminded me of my ex-boyfriend, Elec. Damien was a hotter version of my ex. The neighbor I'd dubbed "Angry Artist" also had two massive dogs that kept me up with their barking. He wanted nothing to do with me. Or so I thought until one night I heard laughter coming through an apparent hole in my bedroom wall. Damien had been listening to all of my phone sessions with my therapist. The sexy artist next door now knew all of my deepest secrets and insecurities. We got to talking. He set me straight with tips to get over my breakup. He became a good friend, but Damien made it clear that he couldn't be anything more. Problem was, I was falling hard for him anyway. And as much as he pushed me away, I knew he felt the same...because his heartbeat didn't lie. I thought my heart had been broken by Elec, but it was alive and beating harder than ever for Damien. I just hoped he wouldn't shatter it for good. Author's note - Neighbor Dearest is a full-length standalone novel.</description>

  <description>Flint Hopkins finds the perfect tenant to rent the space above his Minneapolis-based law office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the t’s are crossed and i’s dotted on Ellen’s application. Her references are good. And she’s easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flint discovers Ellen Rodgers, Board-Certified Music Therapist, plays music. Bongos, guitars, singing—not Beethoven administered through noise-cancelling headphones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut-throat attorney serves up an eviction notice to the bubbly, constantly humming redhead who's too sexy for her own good. But luck is on Ellen’s side when Flint’s autistic son, Harrison, takes an instant liking to her. A single dad can’t compete with guitars—and rats. Yes, she has pet rats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This woman …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s annoyingly happy with a constant need to touch him—adjust his tie, button his shirt, invade his space, and mess with his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She must go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Their lust-hate relationship escalates into something beautiful and tragic. This sexy, romantic-comedy explores the things we want, the things we need, and the impossible decisions parents and children make to survive.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Drew Evans is a winner. Handsome and arrogant, he makes multimillion dollar business deals and seduces New York’s most beautiful women with just a smile. He has loyal friends and an indulgent family. So why has he been shuttered in his apartment for seven days, miserable and depressed? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll tell you he has the flu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we all know that’s not really true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine Brooks is brilliant, beautiful and ambitious. She refuses to let anything - or anyone - derail her path to success. When Kate is hired as the new associate at Drew’s father’s investment banking firm, every aspect of the dashing playboy’s life is thrown into a tailspin. The professional competition she brings is unnerving, his attraction to her is distracting, his failure to entice her into his bed is exasperating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, just when Drew is on the cusp of having everything he wants, his overblown confidence threatens to ruin it all. Will he be able untangle his feelings of lust and tenderness, frustration and fulfillment? Will he rise to the most important challenge of his life? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Drew Evans win at love? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tangled is not your mother’s romance novel. It is an outrageous, passionate, witty narrative about a man who knows a lot about women…just not as much as he thinks he knows. As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing he never wanted in life, is the only thing he can’t live without.</description>

  <description>Sarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things don’t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victor’s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is their story…</description>

  <description>From #1 &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller &lt;b&gt;Vi Keeland&lt;/b&gt;, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was just a typical Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the big boss asked me to make the pitch for a prospective new client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two years on shaky ground at work because of my screw up, an opportunity to impress the senior partners was just what I needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or so I thought…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I walked into the conference room and collided with the man I was supposed to pitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My coffee spilled, my files tumbled to the ground, and I almost lost my balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that was the good part of my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the gorgeous man crouched down and looking at me like he wanted to eat me alive, was none other than my ex, Gray Westbrook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who I’d only just begun to move on from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who my heart despised—yet my body obviously still had other ideas about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who was as charismatic and confident as he was sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, I managed to make it through my presentation ignoring his intense stare. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it was impossible to ignore all the dirty things he whispered into my ear right after I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there was no way I was giving him another chance, especially now that he was a client&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;…was there?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30656751" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Four young ladies enter London society and band together to each find a husband. Has the third "Wallflower" now met her match?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Devil's Bargain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily the shyest Wallflower, Evangeline Jenner stands to become the wealthiest, once her inheritance comes due. Because she must first escape the clutches of her unscrupulous relatives, Evie has approached the rake Viscount St. Vincent with a most outrageous proposition: &lt;i&gt;marriage!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian's reputation is so dangerous that thirty seconds alone with him will ruin any maiden's good name. Still, this bewitching chit appeared, &lt;i&gt;unchaperoned&lt;/i&gt;, on his doorstep to offer her hand. Certainly an aristocrat with a fine eye for beauty could do far worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Evie's proposal comes with a condition: no lovemaking after their wedding night. She will &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; become just another of the dashing libertine's callously discarded broken hearts—which means Sebastian will simply have to work harder at his seductions... or perhaps surrender his own heart for the very first time in the name of true love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eccentric wallflower…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most debutantes dream of finding a husband. Lady Pandora Ravenel has different plans. The ambitious young beauty would much rather stay at home and plot out her new board game business than take part in the London Season. But one night at a glittering society ball, she’s ensnared in a scandal with a wickedly handsome stranger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A cynical rake…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of evading marital traps with ease, Gabriel, Lord St. Vincent, has finally been caught-by a rebellious girl who couldn’t be less suitable. In fact, she wants nothing to do with him. But Gabriel finds the high-spirited Pandora irresistible. He’ll do whatever it takes to possess her, even if their marriage of convenience turns out to be the devil’s own bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A perilous plot…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After succumbing to Gabriel’s skilled and sensuous persuasion, Pandora agrees to become his bride. But soon she discovers that her entrepreneurial endeavors have accidentally involved her in a dangerous conspiracy—and only her husband can keep her safe. As Gabriel protects her from their unknown adversaries, they realize their devil’s bargain may just turn out to be a match made in heaven...</description>

  <description>When Gia Montgomery's boyfriend, Bradley, dumps her in the parking lot of her high school prom, she has to think fast. After all, she'd been telling her friends about him for months now. This was supposed to be the night she proved he existed. So when she sees a cute guy waiting to pick up his sister, she enlists his help. The task is simple: be her fill-in boyfriend—two hours, zero commitment, a few white lies. After that, she can win back the real Bradley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that days after prom, it's not the real Bradley she's thinking about, but the stand-in. The one whose name she doesn't even know. But tracking him down doesn't mean they're done faking a relationship. Gia owes him a favor and his sister intends to see that he collects: his ex-girlfriend's graduation party—three hours, zero commitment, a few white lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Gia begins to wonder if she could turn her fake boyfriend into a real one, Bradley comes waltzing back into her life, exposing her lie, and threatening to destroy her friendships and her new-found relationship.</description>

  <description>The night I met Drew Jagger, he’d just broken into my new Park Avenue office. I dialed 9-1-1 before proceeding to attack him with my fancy new Krav Maga skills.  He quickly restrained me, then chuckled, finding my attempted assault amusing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, my intruder had to be arrogant. Only, turned out, he wasn’t an intruder at all.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drew was the rightful occupant of my new office. He’d been on vacation while his posh space was renovated. Which was how a scammer got away with leasing me office space that wasn’t really available for rent. I was swindled out of ten grand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next day, after hours at the police station, Drew took pity on me and made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. In exchange for answering his phones while his secretary was out, he’d let me stay until I found a new place. I probably should have acted grateful and kept my mouth shut when I overheard the advice he was spewing to his clients. But I couldn’t help giving him a piece of my mind. I never expected my body to react every time we argued. Especially when that was all we seemed to be able to do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The two of us were complete opposites. Drew was a bitter, angry, gorgeous-as-all-hell destroyer of relationships. And my job was to help people save their marriages. The only thing the two of us had in common was the space we were sharing. And an attraction that was getting harder to deny by the day. </description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like a good idea at the time. Look up Landon Roderick, that boy from childhood whom I’d never been able to forget—even though he so easily forgot about me—and call him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, anything sounds like a good idea when you’ve had a little too much wine before bed, right? It was supposed to be just a quick, meaningless, prank call. Instead, I went off on him—unloading thirteen years of pent-up emotions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think he’d call me back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly could never have anticipated the weeks of sexually tense phone conversations that followed as I got to know the man he’d become. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out, Landon had never really forgotten me, either. That special connection we had was still there. I opened up to him, but there were also things about me he didn’t know. And he had his own secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the countless hours we talked on the phone, I wondered what would happen if we actually saw each other. One night, I did something impulsive again. Only this time, I went to the airport and booked a ticket to California. We were about to find out if one phone call could bring two lost souls together or if my drunk dial really was all just a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete STANDALONE.</description>

  <description>Sharing a summer house with a hot-as-hell roommate should be a dream come true, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not when it’s Justin…the only person I’d ever loved…who now hates me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my grandmother died and left me half of the house on Aquidneck Island, there was a catch: the other half would go to the boy she helped raise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same boy who turned into the teenager whose heart I broke years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same teenager who’s now a man with a hard body and a hardass personality to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t seen him in years, and now we’re living together because neither one of us is willing to give up the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part? He didn’t come alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d soon realize there’s a thin line between love and hate. I could see through that smug smile. Beneath it all…the boy is still there. So is our connection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is…now that I can’t have Justin, I’ve never wanted him more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author's note&lt;/i&gt; – RoomHate is a full-length standalone novel. Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>On the cusp of her first London season, Miss Madeline Gracechurch was shyly pretty and talented with a drawing pencil, but hopelessly awkward with gentlemen. She was certain to be a dismal failure on the London marriage mart. So Maddie did what generations of shy, awkward young ladies have done: she invented a sweetheart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Scottish sweetheart. One who was handsome and honorable and devoted to her, but conveniently never around. Maddie poured her heart into writing the imaginary Captain MacKenzie letter after letter … and by pretending to be devastated when he was (not really) killed in battle, she managed to avoid the pressures of London society entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until years later, when this kilted Highland lover of her imaginings shows up in the flesh. The real Captain Logan MacKenzie arrives on her doorstep—handsome as anything, but not entirely honorable. He’s wounded, jaded, in possession of her letters… and ready to make good on every promise Maddie never expected to keep.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When girl meets Duke, their marriage breaks all the rules…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his return from war, the Duke of Ashbury’s to-do list has been short and anything but sweet: brooding, glowering, menacing London ne’er-do-wells by night. Now there’s a new item on the list. He needs an heir—which means he needs a wife. When Emma Gladstone, a vicar’s daughter turned seamstress, appears in his library wearing a wedding gown, he decides on the spot that she’ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His terms are simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will be husband and wife by night only.&lt;br /&gt;- No lights, no kissing. &lt;br /&gt;- No questions about his battle scars.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s pregnant with his heir, they need never share a bed again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emma is no pushover. She has a few rules of her own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will have dinner together every evening.&lt;br /&gt;- With conversation.&lt;br /&gt;- And unlimited teasing.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s seen the man beneath the scars, he can’t stop her from falling in love…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

She never doubted romance would be in her future, too. The storybooks offered endless possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as she grew older, Izzy crossed them off. One by one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;del&gt;Ugly duckling turned swan?&lt;br /&gt; Abducted by handsome highwayman?&lt;br /&gt; Rescued from drudgery by charming prince?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, no, and… Heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Izzy’s given up yearning for romance. She’ll settle for a roof over her head. What fairy tales are left over for an impoverished twenty-six year-old woman who’s never even been kissed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An ambitious intern. A perfectionist executive. And a whole lot of name calling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whip-smart, hardworking, and on her way to an MBA, Chloe Mills has only one problem: her boss, Bennett Ryan. He's exacting, blunt, inconsiderate—and completely irresistible. A Beautiful Bastard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bennett has returned to Chicago from France to take a vital role in his family's massive media business. He never expected that the assistant who'd been helping him from abroad was the gorgeous, innocently provocative—completely infuriating—creature he now has to see every day. Despite the rumors, he's never been one for a workplace hookup. But Chloe's so tempting he's willing to bend the rules—or outright smash them—if it means he can have her. All over the office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their appetites for one another increase to a breaking point, Bennett and Chloe must decide exactly what they're willing to lose in order to win each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally only available online as &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; by tby789 — and garnering over 2 million reads on fanfiction sites — &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Bastard&lt;/i&gt; has been extensively updated for re-release.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four consecutive weeks on the New York Times and #1 in Romance. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out like any other morning on the train.&lt;br /&gt;Until I became mesmerized by the guy sitting across the aisle.&lt;br /&gt;He was barking at someone on his phone like he ruled the world.&lt;br /&gt;Who did the stuck-up suit think he was...God?&lt;br /&gt;Actually, he looked like a God. That was about it.&lt;br /&gt;When his stop came, he got up suddenly and left. So suddenly, he dropped his phone on the way out.&lt;br /&gt;I might have picked it up.&lt;br /&gt;I might have gone through all of his photos and called some of the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;I might have held onto the mystery man's phone for days―until I finally conjured up the courage to return it.&lt;br /&gt;When I traipsed my ass across town to his fancy company, he refused to see me.&lt;br /&gt;So, I left the phone on the empty desk outside the arrogant jerk's office.&lt;br /&gt;I might have also left behind a dirty picture on it first though.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't expect him to text back.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't expect our exchanges to be hot as hell.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't expect to fall for him―all before we even met.&lt;br /&gt;The two of us couldn't have been any more different.&lt;br /&gt;Yet, you know what they say about opposites.&lt;br /&gt;When we finally came face to face, we found out opposites sometimes do more than attract―we consumed each other.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing could have prepared me for the ride he took me on. And I certainly wasn't prepared for where I'd wind up when the ride was over.&lt;br /&gt;All good things must come to an end, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Except our ending was one I didn't see coming.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lauren Layne’s latest novel about the healing power of redemption tells the story of a crush gone wickedly wrong, proving that what you want isn’t always what you need.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Growing up in New York, Michael St. Claire never expected to spend his twenties wearing cowboy boots. But that was before he learned about his real father, a total stranger with a family in Cedar Grove, Texas. Once in the Lone Star State, Michael meets Kristin Bellamy, who is exquisitely refined and everything Michael always thought he wanted in a woman. The only problem is that Kristin is dating Michael’s new half brother, Devon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristin’s mouthy, curvy sister Chloe has always been in love with Devon Patterson. So when Michael offers to help Chloe break up Devon and Kristin, Chloe agrees to a deal that seems too good to be true. Before long, Chloe finally gets her man, only to make a startling discovery: She no longer wants the guy she had to fight for—she wants the one who stood by her side.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After all he and Chloe have been through, Michael swears he’s damaged goods. Can Chloe convince him that love is worth the risk?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The rules are clear—until they're broken. Lauren Layne puts a New Adult spin on Pygmalion, also the inspiration for Pretty Woman, and gives the classic love story its edgiest twist yet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Who knew that pretending you're not falling for someone would be so much more difficult than pretending that you are?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie Kendrick gave up her whole summer to ace her NYU film school screenwriting course, so she's pissed to be stuck with a preppy, spoiled frat boy as her writing partner. Then again, with her piercings, black-rimmed eyes, and Goth wardrobe, Stephanie isn't exactly Ethan Price's type, either. He's probably got his eye on some leggy blonde with a trust fund... or does he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer scene kicks off in the Hamptons, Ethan is desperate to make his snobbish mother forget the pedigreed girl who broke his heart. While Stephanie's a stretch as a decoy, the right makeover and a pastel cardigan just might do the trick. She may not love the idea of playing Ethan's brainless Barbie girlfriend, but the free rent and luxurious digs make a tempting offer. So does the promise of a ready-made screenplay idea inspired by their charade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Stephanie steps into Ethan's privileged world, the "acting" begins to feel all too real. The kissing and touching that were intended to fool the Hamptons crowd wind up manipulating "them." And Stephanie faces a question she's too afraid to ask: Is Ethan falling for the real her or for the dolled-up princess he wants to see?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lauren Layne’s New Adult novel tells the story of a girl with secrets, a guy with scars, and a love that could save them both... or destroy them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Olivia Middleton abandons the glamour of Park Avenue for a remote, coastal town in Maine, everyone assumes she’s being the kind do-gooder she’s always been. But Olivia has a secret: helping an injured war veteran reenter society isn’t about charity—it’s about penance. Only, Olivia’s client isn’t the grateful elderly man she’s expecting. Instead, he’s a brooding twenty-four-year-old who has no intention of being Olivia’s path to redemption . . . and whose smoldering gaze and forbidden touch might be her undoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Langdon doesn’t need a mirror to show him he’s no longer the hotshot quarterback he was before the war. He knows he’s ugly—inside and out. He’ll do anything to stay in self-imposed exile, even accept his father’s ultimatum that Paul tolerate the newest caretaker for three months or lose his inheritance. But Paul doesn’t count on the beautiful twenty-two-year-old who makes him long for things that he can never have. And the more she slips past his defenses, the more keeping his distance is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Paul and Olivia have to decide: Will they help each other heal? Or are they forever broken?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a novel that’s perfect for fans of &lt;b&gt;Alice Clayton and Emma Chase&lt;/b&gt;, Lauren Layne delivers a sexy take on the timeless question: Can a guy and a girl &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; be “just friends”?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Parker Blanton meets Ben Olsen during her freshman year of college, the connection is immediate—and platonic. Six years later, they’re still best friends, sharing an apartment in Portland’s trendy Northwest District as they happily settle into adult life. But when Parker’s boyfriend dumps her out of the blue, she starts to wonder about Ben’s no-strings-attached approach to dating. The trouble is, even with Ben as her wingman, Parker can’t seem to get the hang of casual sex—until she tries it with &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The arrangement works perfectly . . . at first. The sex is mind-blowing, and their friendship remains as solid as ever, without any of the usual messy romantic entanglements. But when Parker’s ex decides he wants her back, Ben is shocked by a fierce stab of possessiveness. And when Ben starts seeing a girl from work, Parker finds herself plagued by unfamiliar jealousy. With their friendship on the rocks for the first time, Parker and Ben face an alarming truth: Maybe they can’t go back. And maybe, deep down, they never want to.</description>

  <description>Bennett Fox walked into my life on one hell of a crappy Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was late for the first day at my new job—a job I’d now have to compete for even though I’d already worked &lt;i&gt;eight years&lt;/i&gt; to earn it, because of an unexpected merger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While I lugged my belongings up to my new office, a meter maid wrote me a parking summons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’d ticketed a long line of cars—except for the Audi parked in front of me, which happened to be the same make and model as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annoyed, I decided to &lt;i&gt;regift&lt;/i&gt; my ticket to the car that had evaded a fine. Chances were, the owner would pay it and be none the wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, I &lt;i&gt;accidentally&lt;/i&gt; broke the windshield wiper while slipping the ticket onto the car’s window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my day couldn’t get any worse.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things started to perk up when I ran into a gorgeous man in the elevator. We had one of those brief moments that only happened in movies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You know the deal…your body lights up, fireworks go off, and the air around you crackles with electricity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His heated stare left me flush when I stepped off the elevator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe things here wouldn’t be so bad after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I walked into my new boss’s office and met my competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gorgeous man from the elevator was now my nemesis. His heated stare wasn’t because of any mutual attraction. It was because he’d seen me vandalize his car. And now he couldn’t wait to annihilate his rival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a fine line between love and hate—and we shouldn’t cross it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We shouldn’t&lt;/i&gt;—but straddling that line could be so much fun.</description>

  <description>Each day I prayed for my husband to love me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fifteen years together, he walked away from me, and into the arms of another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know how to cope. I didn’t know my worth. I didn’t know how to exist without him by my side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was for him to come back to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Jackson Emery appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was supposed to be a distraction for my mind. A summer fling. A confidence boost to my bruised heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were perfect for one another, because we both knew we wouldn’t last. Jackson didn’t believe in commitment, and I no longer believed in love. He was too closed-off for me, and I was too damaged for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was fine, until one night my heart skipped a beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t expect him to make me laugh. To make me think. To make my sadness somewhat disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When our time was up, my heart didn’t know how to walk away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day I prayed for my husband to love me again, yet slowly my prayers began to shift toward the man who wasn’t right for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prayed for one more smile, one more kiss, one more laugh, one more touch… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prayed for him to be mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I knew his heart wasn’t destined to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This book was previously known as &lt;i&gt;Between the Notes&lt;/i&gt;.*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>Everyone says opposites attract. And they must be right, because there’s no logical reason why I’m so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don’t usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I’m flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn’t help that he’s buddy-buddy with my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that his best friend has a crush on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that I just moved in with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I not mention we’re roommates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it doesn’t matter. Fitzy has made it clear he’s not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I’m not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I’m not about to start. I’ve got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he’s missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32315591.here" title="here" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s good at achieving her goals…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College senior Sabrina James has her whole future planned out: graduate from college, kick butt in law school, and land a high-paying job at a cutthroat firm. Her path to escaping her shameful past certainly doesn’t include a gorgeous hockey player who believes in love at first sight. One night of sizzling heat and surprising tenderness is all she’s willing to give John Tucker, but sometimes, one night is all it takes for your entire life to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the game just got a whole lot more complicated...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucker believes being a team player is as important as being the star. On the ice, he’s fine staying out of the spotlight, but when it comes to becoming a daddy at the age of twenty-two, he refuses to be a bench warmer. It doesn’t hurt that the soon-to-be mother of his child is beautiful, whip-smart, and keeps him on his toes. The problem is, Sabrina’s heart is locked up tight, and the fiery brunette is too stubborn to accept his help. If he wants a life with the woman of his dreams, he’ll have to convince her that some goals can only be made with an assist.</description>

  <description>He knows how to score, on and off the ice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn’t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, she’s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck won’t include the king of one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’ll take more than flashy moves to win her over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girls…he’s a ladies man, all right, and he’s yet to meet a woman who’s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire world—and now she wants to be friends? Nope. It’s not over until he says it’s over. Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He’s a player in more ways than one…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College junior John Logan can get any girl he wants. For this hockey star, life is a parade of parties and hook-ups, but behind his killer grins and easygoing charm, he hides growing despair about the dead-end road he’ll be forced to walk after graduation. A sexy encounter with freshman Grace Ivers is just the distraction he needs, but when a thoughtless mistake pushes her away, Logan plans to spend his final year proving to her that he’s worth a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now he’s going to need to up his game…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a less than stellar freshman year, Grace is back at Briar University, older, wiser, and &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; over the arrogant hockey player she nearly handed her V-card to. She’s not a charity case, and she’s not the quiet butterfly she was when they first hooked up. If Logan expects her to roll over and beg like all his other puck bunnies, he can think again. He wants her back? He’ll have to &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; for it. This time around, she’ll be the one in the driver’s seat…and she plans on driving him wild.</description>

  <description>He was someone who belonged in my wildest fantasies instead of a rest stop in the middle of Nebraska.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sexy, cocky, Australian named Chance was the last person I expected to run into on my cross-country drive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my car broke down, we made a deal. Next thing I knew, we were traveling together, spending sexually-tense nights in hotels and taking unplanned detours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ordinary road trip turned into the adventure of a lifetime. It was all fun and games until things got intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted him, but Chance wouldn’t make a move. I thought he wanted me too, but something was holding him back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t supposed to fall for the cocky bastard, especially when I knew we’d be going our separate ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All good things must come to an end, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Except our ending was one I didn’t see coming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author's note - Cocky Bastard is a full-length standalone novel. Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>The first time I met Chase Parker, I didn’t exactly make a good impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hiding in the bathroom hallway of a restaurant, leaving a message for my best friend to save me from my awful date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He overheard and told me I was a bitch, then proceeded to offer me some dating advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I told him to mind his own damn business—his own tall, gorgeous, full-of-himself damn business—and went back to my miserable date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he walked by my table, he smirked, and I watched his arrogant, sexy ass walk back to his date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t help but sneak hidden glances at the condescending jerk on the other side of the room. Of course, he caught me on more than one occasion, and winked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the gorgeous stranger and his equally hot date suddenly appeared at our table, I thought he was going to rat me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead, he pretended we knew each other and joined us—telling elaborate, embarrassing stories about our fake childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My date suddenly went from boring to bizarrely exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was over and we parted ways, I thought about him more than I would ever admit, even though I knew I’d never see him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, what were the chances I’d run into him again in a city with eight million people?&lt;br /&gt;Then again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were the chances a month later he’d wind up being my new sexy boss?</description>

  <description>It didn’t matter that the ref called it a clean hit. Nico Hunter would never be the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle has a good life. A job she loves, a great apartment, and the guy she’s been dating for more than two years is a catch and a half. But it’s boring…and she strives to keep it that way. Too many emotions are dangerous. Her own past is living proof of what can happen when you lose control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Nico walks into Elle’s office and everything changes…for both of them. But what can the tattooed, hard-bodied MMA fighter and the beautiful and always steady attorney have in common? A lot more than they bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Author's note*** THIS IS A STAND-ALONE NOVEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;USA Today Bestseller&lt;/i&gt;, Vi Keeland, comes a sexy new standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I met Brody Easton was in the men's locker room.&lt;br /&gt;It was my first interview as a professional sportscaster.&lt;br /&gt;The famed quarterback decided to bare all.&lt;br /&gt;And by all, I don't mean he told me any of his secrets.&lt;br /&gt;No. The arrogant ass decided to drop his towel, just as I asked the first question. &lt;i&gt;On camera.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Super Bowl MVP quickly adopted a new hobby--screwing with me.&lt;br /&gt;When I pushed back, he shifted from wanting to screw &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; me, to wanting &lt;i&gt;to screw&lt;/i&gt; me.&lt;br /&gt;But I don't date players.&lt;br /&gt;And it's not because I'm one of the few women working in the world of professional football.&lt;br /&gt;I'd date an athlete.&lt;br /&gt;It's the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; kind of player I don't date. &lt;br /&gt;You know the type. Good looking, strong, cocky, always looking to get laid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brody Easton was the ultimate player. &lt;br /&gt;Every woman wanted to be the one to change him. &lt;br /&gt;But the truth was, all he needed was a girl worth changing for. &lt;br /&gt;Turned out, I was that girl. &lt;br /&gt;Simple right? Let's face it. It never is. &lt;br /&gt;There's a story between once upon a time and happily ever after...&lt;br /&gt;And this one is ours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author's note - &lt;i&gt;The Baller&lt;/i&gt; is a full-length standalone novel. Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's about to make a deal with the college bad boy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Wells has finally found someone who turns her on. But while she might be confident in every other area of her life, she's carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction. If she wants to get her crush's attention, she'll have to step out of her comfort zone and &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; him take notice... even if it means tutoring the annoying, childish, &lt;i&gt;cocky&lt;/i&gt; captain of the hockey team in exchange for a pretend date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and it's going to be oh so good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Garrett Graham has ever wanted is to play professional hockey after graduation, but his plummeting GPA is threatening everything he's worked so hard for. If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he's all for it. But when one unexpected kiss leads to the wildest sex of both their lives, it doesn't take long for Garrett to realize that pretend isn't going to cut it. Now he just has to convince Hannah that the man she wants looks a lot like &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</description>
