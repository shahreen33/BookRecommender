  <description>The top-selling, beloved indie author of &lt;i&gt;Ten Tiny Breaths&lt;/i&gt; returns with a new romance about a young woman who loses her memory—and the man who knows that the only way to protect her is to stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left for dead in the fields of rural Oregon, a young woman defies all odds and survives—but she awakens with no idea who she is, or what happened to her. Refusing to answer to “Jane Doe” for another day, the woman renames herself “Water” for the tiny, hidden marking on her body—the only clue to her past. Taken in by old Ginny Fitzgerald, a crotchety but kind lady living on a nearby horse farm, Water slowly begins building a new life. But as she attempts to piece together the fleeting slivers of her memory, more questions emerge: Who is the next-door neighbor, quietly toiling under the hood of his Barracuda? Why won’t Ginny let him step foot on her property? And why does Water feel she recognizes him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Jesse Welles doesn’t know how long it will be before Water gets her memory back. For her sake, Jesse hopes the answer is never. He knows that she’ll stay so much safer—and happier—that way. And that’s why, as hard as it is, he needs to keep his distance. Because getting too close could flood her with realities better left buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, water always seems to find its way to the surface.</description>

  <description>In Amy Poehler’s highly anticipated first book, &lt;i&gt;Yes Please&lt;/i&gt;, she offers up a big juicy stew of personal stories, funny bits on sex and love and friendship and parenthood and real life advice (some useful, some not so much), like when to be funny and when to be serious. Powered by Amy’s charming and hilarious, biting yet wise voice, &lt;i&gt;Yes Please&lt;/i&gt; is a book full of words to live by.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I’m a ruthless killer. A bloodthirsty beast.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I always take what I want, &lt;br /&gt;What I’m owed, &lt;br /&gt;And what has been stolen from me. &lt;br /&gt;With a gorgeous face and a porn star body, Lindy thinks she owns Sin City. &lt;br /&gt;But my new obsession made a deadly choice when she walked into my casino. &lt;br /&gt;She trusted the wrong people, put greed before common sense, and lost everything. &lt;br /&gt;Now, there’s a debt to be paid. &lt;br /&gt;To me. &lt;br /&gt;But I don’t care about money. &lt;br /&gt;I want her as my payment. &lt;br /&gt;And it’s time to collect.</description>

  <description>Choose the best phrase to describe Sibby Goldstein's life:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Sucky.&lt;br /&gt;2) Really sucky.&lt;br /&gt;3) Major suck-fest.&lt;br /&gt;D) All of the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my day with a boyfriend and a job. I ended my day with a bottle of tequila. I'll let you connect the dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, I wound up working as a waitress at an Italian restaurant. I have no idea what I'm doing. And I'm not just talkin' about life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be interesting.</description>

  <description>13 hours, 37 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author J. Kenner kicks off a smoking hot, emotionally compelling new trilogy that returns to the world of her beloved Stark novels: &lt;i&gt;Release Me, Claim Me, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Complete Me&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Say My Name&lt;/i&gt; features Jackson Steele, a strong-willed man who goes after what he wants, and Sylvia Brooks, a disciplined woman who’s hard to get—and exactly who Jackson needs.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I never let anyone get too close—but he’s the only man who’s ever made me feel alive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meeting Jackson Steele was a shock to my senses. Confident and commanding, he could take charge of any room . . . or any woman. And Jackson wanted me. The mere sight of him took my breath away, and his touch made me break all my rules.   &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Our bond was immediate, our passion untamed. I wanted to surrender completely to his kiss, but I couldn’t risk his knowing the truth about my past. Yet Jackson carried secrets too, and in our desire we found our escape, pushing our boundaries as far as they could go. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Learning to trust is never easy. In my mind, I knew I should run. But in my heart, I never felt a fire this strong—and it could either save me or scorch me forever.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Say My Name &lt;/i&gt;is intended for mature audiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Say My Name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Readers who need more of Kenner’s racy, sizzling Stark novels will delight in this new series, set in the same decadent, lavish world. . . . Kenner has crafted a hero whose compassion is remarkable, and who is strong enough not only to apologize and to change, but to offer her the kind of love she wants and needs, as well. . . . Fans of dark, intense and emotionally scorching romances will surely adore this series opener.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “J. Kenner returns to the world she established in her original Damien Stark erotic romance trilogy, only this time the heroine is Stark’s most trusted employee and her hero is the one man she’s loved enough to push away for his own good. . . . It’s a heady mix of love and intrigue, and Kenner continues to deliver a knockout experience that made me long for the next book even as I was more than satisfied with this story’s ending. To say more would give too much away, and I encourage everyone who loved the original Stark trilogy to read &lt;i&gt;Say My Name&lt;/i&gt; to find out what’s there for themselves.”&lt;b&gt;—The Romance Evangelist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “J. Kenner has given us one hell of a story with this start to the Stark International series. And if anyone can give Damien Stark a run for his money, it’s Jackson Steele.”&lt;b&gt;—Cocktails and Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “If you enjoyed the Stark novels, you are going to love &lt;i&gt;Say My Name&lt;/i&gt;!”&lt;b&gt;—Reading Keeps Me Sane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “J. Kenner’s best work to date. . . . The pull between these two is off the charts. They have this intense chemistry that pretty much makes their sexy times go through the roof! . . . It was great getting to see Nikki and Damien again. . . . Even though I know them from their series, they seem fresh. . . . J. Kenner knocked it out of the park with this one. Five-off-the-charts-hot-stars!”&lt;b&gt;—About That Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “J. Kenner never fails to provide a gripping and passionate story. &lt;i&gt;Say My Name&lt;/i&gt; takes you to the edge and then pushes you over. Not that I was expecting anything less, but Jackson Steele is the perfect addition to the Stark series. . . . I cannot wait to see what unfolds next. . . . More Jackson! &lt;i&gt;More please&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;b&gt;—Obsessed with Myshelf&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Our desire runs deep. But our secrets cut close.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, strong, and commanding, Damien Stark fills a void in me that no other man can touch. His fierce cravings push me beyond the brink of bliss—and unleash a wild passion that utterly consumes us both.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet beneath his need for dominance, he carries the wounds of a painful past. Haunted by a legacy of dark secrets and broken trust, he seeks release in our shared ecstasy, the heat between us burning stronger each day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our attraction is undeniable, our obsession inevitable. Yet not even Damien can run from his ghosts, or shield us from the dangers yet to come.</description>

  <description>Thug Kitchen started their wildly popular web site to inspire people to eat some Goddamn vegetables and adopt a healthier lifestyle. Beloved by Gwyneth Paltrow ("This might be my favorite thing ever") and named &lt;i&gt;Saveur's&lt;/i&gt; Best New Food blog of 2013—with half a million Facebook fans and counting—Thug Kitchen wants to show everyone how to take charge of their plates and cook up some real f*cking food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, plenty of blogs and cookbooks preach about how to eat more kale, why ginger fights inflammation, and how to cook with microgreens and nettles. But they are dull or pretentious as hell—and most people can't afford the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thug Kitchen lives in the real world. In their first cookbook, they're throwing down more than 100 recipes for their best-loved meals, snacks, and sides for beginning cooks to home chefs. (Roasted Beer and Lime Cauliflower Tacos? Pumpkin Chili? Grilled Peach Salsa? Believe that sh*t.) Plus they're going to arm you with all the info and techniques you need to shop on a budget and go and kick a bunch of ass on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is an invitation to everyone who wants to do better to elevate their kitchen game. No more ketchup and pizza counting as vegetables. No more drive-thru lines. No more avoiding the produce corner of the supermarket. Sh*t is about to get real.</description>

  <description>For generations, the Bradford family has worn the mantle of kings of the bourbon capital of the world. Their sustained wealth has afforded them prestige and privilege—as well as a hard-won division of class on their sprawling estate, Easterly. Upstairs, a dynasty that by all appearances plays by the rules of good fortune and good taste. Downstairs, the staff who work tirelessly to maintain the impeccable Bradford facade. And never the twain shall meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Lizzie King, Easterly’s head gardener, crossing that divide nearly ruined her life. Falling in love with Tulane, the prodigal son of the bourbon dynasty, was nothing that she intended or wanted—and their bitter breakup only served to prove her instincts were right. Now, after two years of staying away, Tulane is finally coming home again, and he is bringing the past with him. No one will be left unmarked: not Tulane’s beautiful and ruthless wife; not his older brother, whose bitterness and bad blood know no bounds; and especially not the ironfisted Bradford patriarch, a man with few morals, fewer scruples, and many, many terrible secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As family tensions—professional and intimately private—ignite, Easterly and all its inhabitants are thrown into the grips of an irrevocable transformation, and only the cunning will survive.</description>

      <![CDATA[Excellent start to this series. I already loved J. R. Ward’s Black Dagger Brotherhood series, but this is on a whole nother level. Deep characters, complex storylines, and set in KY! What more can you ask for?! Excited to read the next two!]]>

  <description>For Damien, our obsession is a game. For me, it is fiercely, blindingly, real.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Damien Stark’s need is palpable—his need for pleasure, his need for control, his need for me. Beautiful and brilliant yet tortured at his core, he is in every way my match.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have agreed to be his alone, and now I want him to be fully mine. I want us to possess each other beyond the sweetest edge of our ecstasy, into the deepest desires of our souls. To let the fire that burns between us consume us both.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there are dark places within Damien that not even our wildest passion can touch. I yearn to know his secrets, yearn for him to surrender to me as I have surrendered to him. But our troubled pasts will either bind us close . . . or shatter us completely.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Claim Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>For fans of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You comes an erotic, emotionally charged romance between a powerful man who’s never heard “no” and a fiery woman who says “yes” on her own terms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He was the one man I couldn’t avoid. And the one man I couldn’t resist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Damien Stark could have his way with any woman. He was sexy, confident, and commanding: Anything he wanted, he got. And what he wanted was me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our attraction was unmistakable, almost beyond control, but as much as I ached to be his, I feared the pressures of his demands. Submitting to Damien meant I had to bare the darkest truth about my past—and risk breaking us apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Damien was haunted, too. And as our passion came to obsess us both, his secrets threatened to destroy him—and us—forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Release Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>John Rain is back. And “the most charismatic assassin since James Bond” (San Francisco Chronicle) is up against his most formidable enemy yet: the nexus of political, military, media, and corporate factions known only as the Oligarchy.&lt;p&gt;When legendary black ops veteran Colonel Scott “Hort” Horton tracks Rain down in Tokyo, Rain can’t resist the offer: a multi-million dollar payday for the “natural causes” demise of three ultra-high-profile targets who are dangerously close to launching a coup in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the opposition on this job is going to be too much for even Rain to pull it off alone. He’ll need a detachment of other deniable irregulars: his partner, the former Marine sniper, Dox. Ben Treven, a covert operator with ambivalent motives and conflicted loyalties. And Larison, a man with a hair trigger and a secret he’ll kill to protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the shadowy backstreets of Tokyo and Vienna, to the deceptive glitz and glamour of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and finally to a Washington, D.C., in a permanent state of war, these four lone wolf killers will have to survive presidential hit teams, secret CIA prisons, and a national security state as obsessed with guarding its own secrets as it is with invading the privacy of the populace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, they’ll have to survive each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Detachment&lt;/i&gt; is what fans of Eisler, “one of the most talented and literary writers in the thriller genre” (Chicago Sun-Times), have been waiting for: the worlds of the award-winning Rain series, and of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Fault Line&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Inside Out&lt;/i&gt;, colliding in one explosive thriller as real as today’s headlines and as frightening as tomorrow’s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"Very erotic indeed" "A lovely and very naughty seduction"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gym session also went well. Dressed in her black sports bra and tight black shorts, Dr Dupont was actually conscious of several pairs of eyes on her as she began her 20 minute work-out on the exercise bicycle. She didn’t really mind the attention: in fact, she would not be wearing that rather skimpy sports bra if she had really objected. But quite a lot depended, naturally enough, on who was paying the attention. Today she was conscious that a young female student – not one of her own, incidentally – was glancing in her direction rather frequently. The girl was quite tall with an attractive figure, short fair hair and smiling blue eyes. She was dressed as if for tennis – a white T-shirt with a collar and short sleeves and a pleated short white skirt. And she was pulling some weights on a pulley just to the right of where Dr Dupont was cycling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl had such a ready smile that Dr Dupont found herself smiling back from time to time. After her cycle ride, she walked over to the drinks fountain, which was a fair distance from the various exercise machines, and she sensed that someone had moved to stand behind her. Sure enough, it was that same girl and Dr Dupont was the first to speak: “You looked like you were pulling some pretty heavy stuff there!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh no, not really. I don’t want to bulk up my arms too much.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I know what you mean! But you look in really great shape,” said Dr Dupont in genuine admiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Why thank you, I’m sure!” The girl looked genuinely delighted. “And so do you!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Dupont smiled inwardly at the compliment but tried to appear unmoved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What’s your major?” the girl asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Dupont smiled inwardly again. That sounded like a nice compliment! I guess this girl must think I’m a student – maybe a mature student!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a moment, Dr Dupont felt like pretending she was indeed a student. Something told her it might be safer – and even perhaps sexier. But she stuck to the truth and replied: “No, no. I’m on the staff!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Really?!” said the girl quickly, apparently genuinely surprised. “You look young enough to be a student here. You really keep yourself in great shape!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Dupont could feel herself getting a little embarrassed now and wondered if she might be going ever-so-slightly pink. Good that I’ve just had a work-out! she thought to herself. I’ll be pretty pink in any case, so nothing will show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“So what do you study?” Dr Dupont enquired, trying to sound fairly formal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I do politics, with a sociology minor.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Interesting! There are some overlaps with my own subject, which is psychology.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That’s great”, the girl said, with real enthusiasm. “And do you specialise within psychology?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“My special subject is the psychology of human attraction,” Dr Dupont replied, adopting the matter-of-fact face she had practiced so many times when telling others about her research interests. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh gosh!” the girl said. “That’s kinda cool!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Is it a conversation stopper?” said Dr Dupont. “I could make myself a specialist in tax law if that would make me more interesting to you!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both laughed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You fancy a bite to eat?” Dr Dupont found herself suggesting.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Forced to represent an outlaw biker, a married attorney must come to terms with her feelings for her client while avoiding the danger he brings into her sedate life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President of the Lost Kings MC, Rochlan "Rock" North, hasn't managed to find a woman capable of making him want to curb his wild ways—until he meets sweet, innocent, married lawyer Hope Kendall. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to represent the outlaw biker, Hope is rattled by her immediate attraction to Rock. Hope is a good girl in a good marriage. Rock thrills her, but she's not going to throw away everything she's built on a fling with her criminal client. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock respects Hope enough to leave her alone, even as he realizes he's become a little obsessed with her. When their connection endangers her life, he'll have to destroy her in order to save her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tragedy strikes, Rock is determined to earn Hope's forgiveness and convince her that even with their staggering differences, they're meant to be together.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Previously published as &lt;i&gt;Requiem for an Assassin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunted and finally cornered, John Rain faces his deadliest enemy ever: himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Rain, “the most charismatic assassin since James Bond” (&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;), getting out of the life was never going to be easy. But with a new identity in Paris, and the help of his lover, Mossad agent Delilah, he was beginning to leave the killing business behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he receives a message from rogue CIA operative Jim Hilger: We have your friend Dox. Do as we tell you, or he dies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a professional like Rain, the choice ought to be easy: do the job—a series of three hits—and save his friend and partner. But how does Rain know Hilger won’t kill Dox, anyway, once the assignment is complete? How does he know each of the hits isn’t simultaneously a setup for Rain himself? Most of all, how can he control the killing rage Hilger’s lethal game of extortion reignites inside him? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the deceptively tranquil beaches of Bali, to the backstreets and boulevards of Paris, to the urban canyons of Silicon Valley and New York and the old killing fields of Vietnam, Rain must grapple with his age, his enemies, and, most of all, with the killer inside himself in a battle not even Rain can hope to survive intact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Killer Ascendant&lt;/i&gt; was previously published as &lt;i&gt;Requiem for an Assassin&lt;/i&gt;, the sixth in the bestselling John Rain assassin series. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Barry Eisler has been compared to Forsyth, Ludlum, le Carré, Ian Fleming, and Graham Greene. But his latest thriller brings Eisler into a league of his own.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Even for an average citizen, a love triangle is dangerous business. For assassin John Rain--"one of the most compelling lead characters in the genre" (&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;)--it's going to be downright deadly.&lt;p&gt;When Rain learns that his former lover, Midori, has been raising their child in New York, Rain senses a chance for reconciliation, perhaps even for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Midori and the child are being watched by Rain's enemies, and Rain's sudden appearance puts them in terrible danger. To save them, Rain is forced to use the same deadly talents he had been hoping to leave behind. With the help of Tatsu, his one-time nemesis in the Japanese FBI; and Dox, the former Marine sniper whose good ol' boy persona masks a killer as deadly as Rain himself, Rain races against time to bring his enemies into the open and eliminate them forever. But to finish the job, he'll need one more ally: Mossad operative Delilah, a woman for whom Rain's hopes with Midori represent an altogether different kind of threat...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"... a terrific, fun read, full of modern spy craft (Eisler worked for the CIA for a while), exotic locales, hot sex and violence. Not to mention an extremely well-defined character in John Rain, who seems like a pretty good guy, given his career." &lt;i&gt;–San Jose Mercury News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Previously published as &lt;i&gt;Killing Rain&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;One Last Kill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nearly dying while taking out a target in Hong Kong, Rain has a new employer, The Mossad, which wants him to fix a “problem” in Manila. He also has a new partner, Dox, whose good-ol’-boy persona masks a sniper as deadly as Rain himself. And he has a new hope: that by using his talents in the service of something good, he might atone for all the lives he has taken. But when Rain’s conscience causes him to botch the Manila hit, he finds out the next problem The Mossad wants fixed is him. Is Delilah, his Mossad lover, coming to help him? Or was she sent to finish him off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Redemption Games&lt;/i&gt; was previously published as &lt;i&gt;Killing Rain&lt;/i&gt; in the US and &lt;i&gt;One Last Kill&lt;/i&gt; in the UK, the fourth in the bestselling John Rain assassin series. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Despite having been besotted with Dante Garcea since she was a child, wolf shifter Jaime Farrow figures that it’s time to move past the crush. If he wanted her, he wouldn’t have ignored her flirtatious behavior, right? Hiding her intense attraction to him isn’t easy – especially now that they're part of the same pack again – but with bigger issues to worry about and with the submissive wolf act to maintain, Jaime is resolute on moving forward. Now if only the workaholic control-freak would let her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the pack Beta, Dante doesn't have the space or time in his life for a relationship. As such, he ignores his intense hunger for the willful – and sometimes crazy – Jaime. Yet when her flirtations abruptly end, Dante finds that he doesn’t like losing her attention. He finds something else too – Jaime's hiding something. Determined to uncover her secret, he sets out to break through her defenses, even though being around her intensifies his cravings for her. What he finds is a problem that Jaime is convinced not even a powerful Beta can solve.</description>

  <description>When female wolf shifter Taryn Warner first encounters Trey Coleman, an alpha male wolf shifter with a dangerous reputation, she’s determined to resist his charms. After all, Trey—who was only fourteen when he defeated his own father in a duel, winning the right to be alpha of his pack—can’t have anything to offer the talented healer besides trouble, or so she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taryn finds herself drawn in by Trey’s forceful demeanor and arctic-blue eyes, and she eventually agrees to enter an uneasy alliance with him. If the two succeed in convincing their respective packs that they’ve chosen each other as mates, Trey will win valuable political allies, while Taryn will escape an odious arranged mating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are a lot of potential pitfalls to this plan—including the very real possibility that the wolf shifters, overwhelmed by their growing attraction to each other, will be unable to maintain the clear heads needed to pull off the deception.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Previously published as &lt;i&gt;Rain Storm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Choke Point &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Rain has disappeared in Brazil to escape the killing business and the enemies encircling him in Japan. But the CIA isn’t willing to lose its premier “natural causes” contract killer, and they force Rain to take on a high-risk assignment: eliminate a ruthless arms dealer operating in Southeast Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upside? Financial, of course, along with the possibility of moral redemption. But first, Rain will have to survive the downside: a second assassin zeroing in on the target; an alluring and dangerous woman with an agenda of her own; the possibility that the entire mission is nothing but an elaborate setup. From the gorgeous beaches of Rio to the glitzy casinos of Macau to the gritty back streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, Rain becomes a reluctant player in an international game far deadlier and more insidious than any he has encountered before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Winner Take All&lt;/i&gt; was previously published as &lt;i&gt;Rain Storm&lt;/i&gt; in the US and &lt;i&gt;Choke Point&lt;/i&gt; in the UK, the third in the bestselling John Rain assassin series. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Previously published as &lt;i&gt;Hard Rain&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Blood from Blood &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All John Rain wants is to get out of the killing business. But with his discretion, his reliability, and his unique talent for death by “natural causes,” no one is willing to let him just retire. So when an old nemesis from the Japanese national police force comes to him with a new job—eliminate Murakami, a killer even more fearsome than Rain himself—he can’t refuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aided by an achingly desirable half Brazilian, half Japanese exotic dancer he knows he shouldn’t trust, Rain pursues his quarry through underground no-holds-barred fight clubs, mobbed-up hostess bars, and finally into the heart of a shadow war between the CIA and the yakuza. It’s a war Rain can’t win, but also one he can’t afford to lose—a war where the distinctions between friend and foe and truth and deceit are as murky as the rain-slicked streets of Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Lonely Resurrection&lt;/i&gt; was previously published as &lt;i&gt;Hard Rain&lt;/i&gt; in the US and &lt;i&gt;Blood From Blood&lt;/i&gt; in the UK, the second in the bestselling John Rain assassin series. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a dead-end town of 12,000 people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather never thought she would compete in Panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher. She’d never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dodge has never been afraid of Panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game, he’s sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he’s not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them—and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.</description>

      <![CDATA[Another one of those books where everything was as the reviews said. All of it. I wasn’t really impressed and this didn’t make me want to read more of the author’s work, but some of the passages were so beautifully eloquent.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WANTED: Shared girlfriend for exclusive 3-on-1 live-in relationship.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ad was right there in black and white, sending a flock of butterflies fluttering through my stomach. 'Three young authors seeking an extremely open-minded female for an exclusive, sinful, and very unorthodox arrangement.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only these weren't any three authors. These were my &lt;i&gt;employers&lt;/i&gt;. The same three hot guys I'd been working for as a personal chef, at their secluded Spanish villa. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And they were absolutely &lt;i&gt;gorgeous&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was Chase, dark-haired and beautiful, with a supermodel's face and a whole ocean of ripped abdominals I could sink my teeth into. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nathan was his mirror image, the wavy-blond surfer with a panty-melting smile... not to mention a lithe, impossibly tan body I just wanted to hold against me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rounding them out was Burke; tall and brooding. A muscle-bound giant with smarmy good looks and a matching, razor-sharp wit. A total monster... inside the bedroom and out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their ad doesn't even seem real... until it actually is. Until I'm goaded into answering it, unable to bear the thought of another female just wandering in and being this insanely lucky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three of them... one of me. Sharing me. &lt;i&gt;Possessing&lt;/i&gt; me. The guys are just too hot, too perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too &lt;i&gt;mine&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE ARRANGEMENT&lt;/b&gt; is a sizzling, stand-alone reverse harem love story filled with humor, suspense, and sweltering MFMM menage sex, in single and multiple partner scenes, hot enough to melt your kindle. HEA guaranteed. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Needed:&lt;/i&gt; Community Girlfriend for (4) Army Ranger Specialists at incredible lakehouse estate. Wife material. Long term only.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ad was ridiculous. Beyond ridiculous! Yet for Sammara Madsen, bored in life and unlucky in love? The concept made her stomach do a sexy barrel roll. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a chance encounter with a gorgeous soldier reveals the opportunity of a lifetime, Sammara goes along out of simple curiosity. Yet when she falls in love with the beautiful mansion as well as the &lt;i&gt;three other&lt;/i&gt; handsome Rangers who live there? The idea of being &lt;b&gt;shared&lt;/b&gt; between them as their girlfriend doesn't seem so outrageous anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kyle is the charming, sculpted epitome of the perfect man. Dakota, the beautiful giant - and quintessential country boy. Ryan is the brooding, motorcycle-riding bad boy who shares Sammara's lonely past, and Briggs is the mysterious alpha mercenary, dark and enigmatic, with wounds only a lover could heal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet satisfying the physical and emotional needs of four strapping, powerful soldiers is not without its share of problems. Sammara is plagued by the woes of her dying business. And the four brothers-in-arms have a puzzling secret all their own... one that could easily put them - and their eager new girlfriend - in mortal danger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four Army Rangers... sharing the same woman, mind, body, and soul. The ultimate fantasy becomes heart-pounding reality as Sammara is taken into each of their beds - and hearts - one by one, two on one... and more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Sammara succeed in fulfilling her role to each of her beautiful new boyfriends; that of friend, lover, and so much more? Or will sinister unknown forces crush their budding 5-way relationship before it can even begin? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;QUADRUPLE DUTY&lt;/b&gt; is a sexy, stand-alone reverse harem military romance filled with humor, drama, pulse-pounding excitement, and enormous amounts of love. It also contains sizzling hot MFMMM menage sex, in single and multiple partner scenes so molten they're bound to melt your kindle! HEA guaranteed. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Why is my perfect match the only guy I hate on campus?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I join the college dating app, I'm expecting to be matched with someone who's my type. Instead, I get the college prankster, Elijah. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He might be good looking, he might even be chivalrous, but that doesn't mean I'm interested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think it's a mistake, or maybe one of his pranks. &lt;br /&gt;I keep my distance for a while, but I'm only human. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mistake is my middle name, especially when it comes to relationships.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I find myself left with two dramas. Elijah is going to be my stepbrother and is now totally forbidden. Oh, and the other thing is I'm carrying his baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a standalone novel with a HEA and NO cheating!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>When Logan West impulsively answers a dead man’s ringing phone, he triggers a global race against the clock to track down an unknown organization searching for an Iraqi artifact that is central to a planned attack in the Middle East—one that will draw the United States into a major conflict with Iran.&lt;p&gt;Logan, a former Marine officer, is quickly contracted as a “consultant” to assist the FBI as part of a special task force bent on stopping the shadowy operatives, whatever the cost. The battles are nonstop, from the plains of the Midwest, to mansions in northern Mexico, to the war-torn Al-Anbar province, pitting an international team against trained mercenaries employed by the world’s largest private security contractor...whose owner has a personal vendetta against the US government. Meanwhile, Logan is battling his own demons, especially the trauma of the ambush that his Force Recon unit suffered at an insurgent torture compound in Fallujah in 2004, which threatens to destroy everything he holds dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With high-stakes and fully-realized characters, &lt;i&gt;Overwatch&lt;/i&gt; is a thriller unlike any you’ve read before: deftly plotted, up-to-the-minute, and impossible to put down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A former Marine himself, Betley proves himself an able heir to the throne currently held by the likes of Brad Thor and the late, great Vince Flynn. But Betley also incorporates a quest for a historical artifact reminiscent of James Rollins and Steve Berry, resulting in a structurally flawless read, unafraid to tackle difficult issues like PTSD as well. Not to be missed.” &lt;/b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Providence Journal &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Matthew Betley has proven he’s an accomplished writer. Overwatch is a brilliantly conceived thriller that surges from the first chapter through mounting deception to a powerful conclusion.”&lt;/b&gt; —Clive Cussler, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Overwatch is an exceptional read—a thoroughly engrossing thriller that reminds us of battles fought and threats we still face. We might have expected from Matthew Betley the gripping battlefield accounts that could only come from a seasoned warrior. But the humanity of its characters and the relentless drive of its narrative will make readers impatient for Betley’s next book.”&lt;/b&gt; —Stephen Hayes, &lt;i&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“As a former Marine, Betley really knows his stuff. Fans of nonstop, nail-biting action will love this one!”&lt;/b&gt; —Kyle Mills, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the author of the beloved &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling book &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;and the creator and star of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Mindy Project&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; comes a collection of essays that are as hilarious and insightful as they are deeply personal.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Why Not Me?, &lt;/i&gt; Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it's falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you're constantly reminded that no one looks like you. &lt;br /&gt; In "How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet's Confessions", Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, ("Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn't the land of appropriate-&lt;i&gt;this is Hollywood, baby&lt;/i&gt;. Out here, a dark-skinned woman s traditional hair color is honey blonde.") "Player" tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. ("I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.") In "Unlikely Leading Lady", she muses on America's fixation with the weight of actresses, ("Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they're walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.") And in "Soup Snakes", Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak ("I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.") &lt;br /&gt; Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who's ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who've never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Sylvia Day comes a story of the ultimate seduction. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Westin. Sex incarnate. She could smell it, feel it with his proximity. Everything about him was a little rough, a little gritty. He was a primitive creature. Just like her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He held her hand a little too long, his gaze, under thick lashes, clearly stating his intention to have her. To tame her. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Victoria."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her name, just one word, but spoken with such possession she could almost feel the collar around her neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's in your nature," he murmured. "The desire to be taken."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this game of cat and mouse, everything is an illusion, but the passion is as real as it gets. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a universe where assassins make the law, everyone lives in fear--except for Syn. Born of an illicit scandal that once rocked a dynasty, he always knew how to survive on the bloodthirsty streets. But that was then, and the future is now…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syn was raised as a tech-thief until his livelihood uncovered a truth that could end his life. He tried to destroy the evidence, and has been on the run ever since. Now trained as an assassin, he allows no one to threaten him. Ever. He is the darkness that swallows his enemies whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shahara Dagan is the best bounty hunter in the universe. When Syn comes back on the radar, she's the only one who can bring him to justice. There's only one problem: Syn is a close family friend who's helped out the Dagans countless times. But if she saves him, both of their lives will be on the line. Is Syn's protection worth the risk? The only hope Shahara has is to find the evidence he buried long ago. Now it's kill or be killed--and they, the predators, have just become the hunted…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if your sense of duty required you to betray the man you love? One woman struggles to choose between her honor and her heart in this enthralling espionage drama set against an unforgettable historical backdrop.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1986, the heart of the Cold War, and Marie Mitchell is an intelligence officer with the FBI. She's brilliant but she's also a young black woman working in an old boys' club, and her career has stalled out; she's overlooked for every high profile squad, and her days are filled with monotonous paperwork. So when she's given the opportunity to join a shadowy task force aimed at undermining Thomas Sankara, the charismatic, revolutionary president of Burkina Faso, whose Communist ideology has made him a target for American intervention, she says yes. Yes, even though she secretly admires the work Thomas is doing for his country. Yes, even though she is still grieving the mysterious death of her sister, whose example led Marie to this career path in the first place. Yes, even though a furious part of her suspects she's being offered the job because of her appearance and not her talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year that follows, Marie will observe Thomas, seduce him, and ultimately, have a hand in the coup that will bring him down. But doing so will change everything she believes about what it means to be a spy, a lover, a sister, and a good American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by true events--Thomas Sankara is known as "Africa's Che Guevara"--this novel knits together a gripping spy thriller, a heartbreaking family drama, and a passionate romance. This is a face of the Cold War you've never seen before, and it introduces a powerful new literary voice.</description>

  <description>For sex-crimes detective Livia Lone, a position with a government anti-trafficking task force is a chance to go back to Thailand to ferret out Rithisak Sorm, the trafficking kingpin behind her own childhood ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a planned takedown in a nightclub goes violently awry, Livia discovers that she’s not the only one hunting Sorm. Former Marine sniper Dox has a score to settle, too, and working together is the only way to take Sorm out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Livia and Dox couldn’t be less alike. But they share a single-minded creed: the law has to serve justice. And if it doesn’t, justice has to be served another way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they don’t know is that in threatening Sorm, they’re also threatening a far-reaching conspiracy—one involving the highest levels of America’s own intelligence apparatus. It turns out that killing Sorm just might be the easy part. The real challenge will be payback from his protectors.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Is my perfect match on campus one guy or three?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had a filthy fantasy. One so bad that the night before going to college, I had the wildest dream about the all-star football player falling at my feet. I was brought down to reality as I soon found out that life at NYU didn’t turn out the way that I hoped. All the social clubs that I joined were a bust and my roommate turned out to be far from my friend, but a bully that I needed to get as far away from as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suddenly, I got a text. &lt;br /&gt;Not any ordinary text, but one so dirty that it drove my mind wild. &lt;br /&gt;It messed with me. &lt;br /&gt;So, I responded. &lt;br /&gt;And that’s how the texting relationship started and as the texts got dirtier there was only one thing on my mind... who was this guy? &lt;br /&gt;Or was it three guys?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The message tone changed depending on the time of day. &lt;br /&gt;The ones I got first thing in the morning, were so hot that they could turn steel bars into pools of molten metal. &lt;br /&gt;The ones in the afternoon were even better but just… different. &lt;br /&gt;And the texts I got in the evening were so damn dirty I could barely sleep without putting my hands between my thighs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They were so addictive that I agreed to meet this Casanova of the text world. I had one worry, though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What if it was three guys? &lt;br /&gt;What was I going to do with all three of them at once?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author´s Note: &lt;br /&gt;Triple Sext is a stand-alone reverse harem with a mixture of bullying, romance, humor, and even suspense. There are multiple partner scenes, so make sure that not only is your Kindle ready, but you have a towel nearby too as you read this standalone HEA.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Since the death of her husband, Anne Dunne and her three children have struggled in every way. In a last ditch effort to save the family, Anne plans an elaborate sailing vacation to bring everyone together once again. But only an hour out of port, everything is going wrong. The teenage daughter, Carrie, is planning to drown herself. The teenage son, Mark, is high on drugs and ten-year-old Ernie is nearly catatonic. This is the worst vacation ever.&lt;p&gt;Anne manages to pull things together bit by bit, but just as they begin feeling like a family again, something catastrophic happens. Survival may be the least of their concerns. &lt;br /&gt;Written with the blistering pace and shocking twists that only James Patterson can master, &lt;i&gt;Sail&lt;/i&gt; takes "Lost" and "Survivor" to a new level of terror.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Seattle PD sex-crimes detective Livia Lone knows the monsters she hunts. Sold by her Thai parents along with her little sister, Nason; marooned in America; abused by the men who trafficked them…the only thing that kept Livia alive as a teenager was her determination to find Nason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livia has never stopped looking. And she copes with her failure to protect her sister by doing everything she can to put predators in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, when that fails, by putting them in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a fresh lead offers new hope of finding Nason and the men who trafficked them both, Livia will have to go beyond just being a cop. Beyond even being a vigilante. She’ll have to relive the horrors of the past. Take on one of the most powerful men in the US government. And uncover a conspiracy of almost unimaginable evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every way, it’s an unfair fight. But Livia has two advantages: her unending love for Nason—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a lifelong lust for vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A page-turning romantic feast that will have you desperate for more. I was immediately hooked." -#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rachel Van Dyken&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kylie Scott comes an irresistible new romance.&lt;/b&gt;When a vicious attack leaves 25-year-old Clementine Johns with no memory, she's forced to start over. Now she has to figure out who she was and why she made the choices she did - which includes leaving the supposed love of her life, tattoo artist Ed Larsen, only a month before. Ed can hardly believe it when his ex shows up at his tattoo parlor with no memory of their past, asking about the breakup that nearly destroyed him. The last thing he needs is more heartache, but he can't seem to let her go again. Should they walk away for good, or does their love deserve a repeat performance?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The #1 &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt; bestselling series. Lucas Davenport goes on a city-to-city search for a bizarre ritualistic killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slumlord and a welfare supervisor butchered in Minneapolis . . . a rising political star executed in Manhattan . . . an influential judge taken in Oklahoma City . . . All the homicides have the same grisly method — the victim's throat is slashed with an Indian ceremonial knife – and in every case the twisted trail leads back through the Minnesota Native American community to an embodiment of primal evil known as Shadow Love. Once unleashed, Shadow Love's need to kill cannot be checked, even by those who think they control him. Soon he will be stalking Lucas Davenport — and the woman he loves...&lt;br /&gt;Never get involved with a cop: Lieutenant Lucas Davenport has been warning women for years, but now he finds himself on dangerous ground with a policewoman named Lily Rothenburg, on assignment from New York to help investigate the murders. Both have previous commitments, but neither can stop, and as their affair grows more intense, so too does the mayhem surrounding them, until the combined passion and violence threaten to spin out of control and engulf them both. Together, Lucas and Lily must stalk the drugged-out, desperate world of the city's meanest streets to flush out Shadow Love — not knowing they are now the objects of his deadliest desires....</description>

  <description>No husbands allowed &lt;p&gt;Only minutes after Abbie Elliot and her three best friends step off of a private helicopter, they enter the most luxurious, sumptuous, sensually pampering hotel they have ever been to. Their lavish presidential suite overlooks Monte Carlo, and they surrender: to the sun and pool, to the sashimi and sake, to the Bruno Paillard champagne. For four days they're free to live someone else's life. As the weekend moves into pulsating discos, high-stakes casinos, and beyond, Abbie is transported to the greatest pleasure and release she has ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened last night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning's harsh light, Abbie awakens on a yacht, surrounded by police. Something awful has happened—something impossible, unthinkable. Abbie, Winnie, Serena, and Bryah are arrested and accused of the foulest crime imaginable. And now the vacation of a lifetime becomes the fight of a lifetime &amp;amp; for survival. GUILTY WIVES is the ultimate indulgence, the kind of nonstop joy-ride of excess, friendship, betrayal, and danger that only James Patterson can create.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When a bookshop patron commits suicide, his favorite store clerk must unravel the puzzle he left behind. Lydia Smith lives her life hiding in plain sight. A clerk at the Bright Ideas bookstore, she keeps a meticulously crafted existence among her beloved books, eccentric colleagues, and the BookFrogs—the lost and lonely regulars who spend every day marauding the store’s overwhelmed shelves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But when Joey Molina, a young, beguiling BookFrog, kills himself in the bookstore’s upper room, Lydia’s life comes unglued. Always Joey’s favorite bookseller, Lydia has been bequeathed his meager worldly possessions. Trinkets and books; the detritus of a lonely, uncared for man. But when Lydia flips through his books she finds them defaced in ways both disturbing and inexplicable. They reveal the psyche of a young man on the verge of an emotional reckoning. And they seem to contain a hidden message. What did Joey know? And what does it have to do with Lydia?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As Lydia untangles the mystery of Joey’s suicide, she unearths a long buried memory from her own violent childhood. Details from that one bloody night begin to circle back. Her distant father returns to the fold, along with an obsessive local cop, and the Hammerman, a murderer who came into Lydia’s life long ago and, as she soon discovers, never completely left.</description>

  <description>The Fates are cackling their bony asses off...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been a year since Seth made the deal with the gods that pledged his life to them. And so far, the jobs they've given him have been violent and bloody--which is kind of all right with him. But now Apollo has something else in mind for Seth. He's got to play protector while keeping his hands and fingers off, and for someone who really has a problem with restraint, this new assignment might be the most challenging yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie has no idea what this crazy hot guy's deal might be, but it's a good bet that his arrival means the new life she started after leaving home is about to be thrown into an Olympian-sized blender turned up to puree. Either Josie is going insane or a nightmare straight out of ancient myth is gunning for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it might be the unlikely attraction simmering between her and the golden-eyed, secret-keeping Seth that may prove to be the most dangerous thing of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because history has once again been flipped to repeat.</description>

  <description>Logan St. James is a smoldering, sexy beast. Sure, he can be a little broody at times—but Ellie Hammond’s willing to overlook that. Because, have you seen him?? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy. As. Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ellie’s perky enough for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, she’s had a crush on the intense, gorgeous royal security guard—but she doesn’t think he ever saw her, not really. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Logan, Ellie was just part of the job—a relative of the royal family he’d sworn to protect. Now, at 22 years old and fresh out of college, she’s determined to put aside her X-rated dreams of pat-downs and pillow talk, and find a real life happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Queen of Wessco encourages Ellie to follow in her sister’s footsteps and settle down with a prince of her own. Or a duke, a marquis…a viscount would also do nicely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the pursuit of a fairy tale ending, Ellie learns that the sweetest crushes can be the hardest to let go.&lt;br /&gt; ***&lt;br /&gt;Logan St. James grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, in a family on the wrong side of the law. But these days, he covers his tattoos and scars with a respectable suit. He’s handsome, loyal, brave, skilled with his hands and…other body parts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any woman would be proud to call him hers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s only one woman he wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years he’s watched over her, protected her, held her hair back when she was sick, taught her how to throw a punch, and spot a liar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He dreams of her. Would lay down his life for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beautiful Ellie Hammond’s off-limits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody knows the bodyguard rules: Never lose focus, never let them out of your sight, and never, ever fall in love.</description>

  <description>We fell in love on a beach, got married in paradise, and I carried her off into the sunset. It should have been perfect, but saying “I do” doesn’t guarantee a happily-ever-after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, I barely recognize either of us behind the walls we’ve built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time to bring it full circle. Back to a tropical paradise. Back to find out if we can still make this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not willing to give her up, but to save us, I have to risk everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two damaged people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Countless secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight of our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We might be broken, but we’re not done.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes a story of untold truths and one man’s redemption in the Dirty Mafia Duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every family has a black sheep. &lt;br /&gt;In the infamous Casso crime family, that black sheep is me—Cannon Freeman. &lt;br /&gt;Except I’m not a free man. I’ve never been free. Not since the day I was born. &lt;br /&gt;I owe my loyalty to my father, Dominic Casso, even if he won’t publicly acknowledge me as his blood. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve never had a reason to go against his wishes… until I met her. &lt;br /&gt;Drew Carson turned my world upside when she walked into my club looking for a job. &lt;br /&gt;Now, my honor and my life are on the line. &lt;br /&gt;Going against my father’s wishes might buy me a bullet straight from his gun, but black sheep or not, it’s time to make my stand. &lt;br /&gt;She's worth the fallout. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"You can put that man in a suit, but he'll never be tame." &lt;br /&gt;One look at Jericho Forge and I knew the rumors were true. He was a predator, and he had set his sights on me.&lt;br /&gt;I knew better than to bet more than I could afford to lose that night. I knew better than to bet myself. But desperation leads to bad decisions, and I thought there was no way I could lose.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have no choice but to make a deal with the devil.</description>

  <description>(This is the contemporary version of &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17331378.The_Wicked_Wallflower" title="The Wicked Wallflower" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Wicked Wallflower&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first installment of a sexy, whirlwind romance about a modern day heroine writing historical romance novels based on her romantic misadventures with the bad boy billionaire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Sparks has accidentally announced her engagement on Facebook—to the infamous Bad Boy Billionaire, Duke Austen. As soon as it’s discovered that Jane and Duke barely know each other (One hot kiss at a party does not a relationship make), she’ll be humiliated. And then Duke does something Jane never expected. He plays along with her charade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his hard partying, playboy reputation jeopardizing a fifty million dollar investment deal, Duke realizes an engagement with the hot but oh-so-proper librarian could be just the thing to repair his reputation. This good girl tempts him to be very wicked…but just with her. It’s unprecedented. Inconceivable. Totally alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the unlikely match of librarian and tech entrepreneur set out to convince the world—and the internet—that their love is real, something unexpected happens: they start falling for each other. But Jane is secretly writing a historical romance novel that could expose their carefully constructed romance…unless two perfect strangers are content to be perfectly scandalous together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A shrewd, laugh–out–loud parody of E. L. James' bestselling &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt; series:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young, arrogant, tycoon Earl Grey seduces the naïve coed Anna Steal with his overpowering good looks and staggering amounts of money, but will she be able to get past his fifty shames, including shopping at Walmart on Saturdays, bondage with handcuffs, and his love of BDSM (Bards, Dragons, Sorcery, and Magick)? Or will his dark secrets and constant smirking drive her over the edge?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;See the world of &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt; anew through the eyes of Christian Grey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Christian's own words, and through his thoughts, reflections, and dreams, E L James offers a fresh perspective on the love story that has enthralled millions of readers around the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian Grey exercises control in all things; his world is neat, disciplined, and utterly empty—until the day that Anastasia Steele falls into his office, in a tangle of shapely limbs and tumbling brown hair. He tries to forget her, but instead is swept up in a storm of emotion he cannot comprehend and cannot resist. Unlike any woman he has known before, shy, unworldly Ana seems to see right through him—past the business prodigy and the penthouse lifestyle to Christian’s cold, wounded heart.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will being with Ana dispel the horrors of his childhood that haunt Christian every night? Or will his dark sexual desires, his compulsion to control, and the self-loathing that fills his soul drive this girl away and destroy the fragile hope she offers him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Get ready for the darker and dirtier side of New Orleans with a brand new alpha romance from USA Today bestselling author Meghan March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans belongs to me. &lt;br /&gt;You don’t know my name, but I control everything you see—and all the things you don’t. &lt;br /&gt;My reach knows no bounds, and my demands are always met. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t need to loan money to a failing family distillery, but it amuses me to have them in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;To have her in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t know she caught my attention. &lt;br /&gt;She should’ve been more careful. &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to own her. Consume her. Maybe even keep her. &lt;br /&gt;It’s time to collect what I’m owed. &lt;br /&gt;Keira Kilgore, you’re now the property of Lachlan Mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ruthless King is book 1 of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira’s story is anticipated to be completed in Fall 2017 with Defiant Queen and Sinful Empire.*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy continues with &lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m his entertainment. His toy. Payment on a debt. &lt;br /&gt;I tell myself I hate him, but every time he walks into the room, my body betrays me. How can I want him and fear him in the same moment? &lt;br /&gt;They told me he’d mess with my head. Make it go to war with my body. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t realize it would be complete anarchy. &lt;br /&gt;I should’ve known better. When Mount’s involved, there are no rules. &lt;br /&gt;I will not surrender. I will not show weakness. I’ll stand my ground and make it out of this bargain with my heart and soul intact. &lt;br /&gt;But he has other plans . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt; is the second book of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira's story concludes in &lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>I've got a big dick and an even bigger bank account. That's pretty much where my bio ends. Honestly, I don't need to say anything else. I've just sold 99% of women on going home with me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do I sound like an asshole to you?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's because I am.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And guess what? It works for me just fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or at least it did.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until I met her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Books talk about sparks flying. Fuck that shit. With her, it was like emergency flares mixed with jet fuel. Or maybe just straight up napalm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She didn't leave her name or number when she disappeared from the hotel room after the hottest fucking night of my life. Now I've had a taste of unicorn pussy—the sweetest, rarest of all pussy—and I need it again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what's an asshole to do?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I took this problem to the street. A missed connection gone viral.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when I find her? I'm keeping her.</description>

  <description>It’s a demon-eat-demon world for Nick Gautier. Just when he thinks he’s finally gotten a handle on how not to take over the world and destroy it, Death returns with an all-star cast that is determined to end the Malachai reign and lineage forever. Worse? Death and War have found the one, true enemy Nick can’t find, and even if he did, it’s one he could never bring himself to banish or kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now framed for murders he hasn’t committed, and surrounded by new friends who might be turncoats, Nick is learning fast how his father went down in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat in New Orleans is rising fast, and Nick’s threat-level has gone into a whole new level of intensity. He’s learning fast that when War and Death decide to battle, they don’t take prisoners. The don’t negotiate. And they’re both immune to his biting sarcasm and Cajun charm. To win this, he will have to embrace a new set of powers, but one wrong step, and he will belong to the side of Darkness, forever.</description>

  <description>Look, but don’t touch…she might as well wear a neon sign that says it. It just makes me want her more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She might be above me in every way, but I still want her under me.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve got no business touching her rich-girl skin, but that won’t stop me from stealing a taste. Because rules were meant to be broken—especially when the prize is so fine.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world where nothing is as it seems, what's buried beneath these lies?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the new GhostWalker novel by the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Viper Game&lt;/i&gt;, a trained killer meets his match in a woman whose very kiss can stop a heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Cajun dive in the middle of the godforsaken swamps wasn’t exactly Trap Dawkins’ idea of fun. But the GhostWalker wasn’t there for a good time. He was looking for &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. Cayenne. It’s where she found her victims. Poor suckers. Then again, who wouldn’t want to leave a place like this with a woman like her?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s not Cayenne’s fault. Locked up, experimented on and never knowing kindness, she was bred this way—with a heart of pure venom. Trap understands her. He survived his own dark past and he shares her desire for getting even. But now Trap’s greatest danger is Cayenne herself. Because what’s inside her is hard to control—especially when it’s aroused by a lover as reckless as Trap.</description>

  <description>The "maddog" murderer who is terrorizing the Twin Cities is two things: insane and extremely intelligent. He kills for the pleasure of it and thoroughly enjoys placing elaborate obstacles to keep police befuddled. Each clever move he makes is another point of pride. But when the brilliant Lieutenant Lucas Davenport--a dedicated cop and a serial killer's worst nightmare--is brought in to take up the investigation, the maddog suddenly has an adversary worthy of his genius.</description>

  <description>GhostWalker Wyatt Fontenot knows the price he paid for the secret military experiments that gave him his special catlike abilities. After all, he left his bayou home a healer and came back a killer. While Wyatt and his GhostWalker brother Gator may have known exactly the sort of game they were getting into, Wyatt never anticipated where it would lead—or to whom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swamps hold many mysteries, but few are as sinuously seductive as Le Poivre de Cayenne. The woman the locals call Pepper is every bit as enigmatic as the three little girls she’s desperately trying to protect. From what, Wyatt is soon to discover. Right now Pepper needs a man like Wyatt. Passionately. But her secrets are about to take them both deeper into the bayou than either imagined—where desire is the deadliest poison of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDES A BONUS EXCERPT FROM CHRISTINE FEEHAN’S GHOSTWALKER NOVEL, &lt;i&gt;NIGHT GAME&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Trez “Latimer” doesn’t really exist. And not just because the identity was created so that a Shadow could function in the underbelly of the human world. Sold by his parents to the Queen of the S’Hsibe as a child, Trez escaped the Territory and has been a pimp and an enforcer in Caldwell, NY for years- all the while on the run from a destiny of sexual servitude. He’s never had anyone he could totally rely on... except for his brother, iAm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iAm’s sole goal has always been to keep his brother from self-destructing- and he knows he’s failed. It’s not until the Chosen Serena enters Trez’s life that the male begins to turn things around... but by then it’s too late. The pledge to mate the Queen’s daughter comes due and there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and no negotiating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped between his heart and a fate he never volunteered for, Trez must decide whether to endanger himself and others- or forever leave behind the female he’s in love with. But then an unimaginable tragedy strikes and changes everything. Staring out over an emotional abyss, Trez must find a reason to go on or risk losing himself and his soul forever. And iAm, in the name of brotherly love, is faced with making the ultimate sacrifice...</description>

  <description>Marjorie Steel is still healing from the events of the past year, and she’s happy to put her plans to study culinary arts on hold to help her best friend deal with a difficult pregnancy and two recently adopted troubled boys. The fact that Bryce Simpson spends a lot of time at the Steel Ranch is a benefit, and she’s ready to see if her attraction to him might be something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryce wants to do a hard day’s work on the ranch. Once his muscles give out and he collapses from exhaustion, maybe he’ll stop torturing himself over his late father’s horrific double life. The Steels have a different idea. They ask Bryce to take an executive position complete with a profit share. As he has a young son and widowed mother to support, it’s an offer he can’t refuse. The only catch is Marjorie. She’s beautiful, smart, feisty, and her kisses set him on fire. But he’s an empty shell with nothing to offer her, and she deserves the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sins of his father continue to haunt him, Bryce learns the horrors of the past may not yet be buried.</description>

  <description>Ariana Fitzroy has lost her family and her fortune. The fight for survival leads her to the shadowed card games of court where she discovers she has quite a talent for slipping cards into her favor. While the winnings are enough to sustain her at present, they will not last forever… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connor Grant, trainer of the fallen women from the English court and personal assassin to the king, is just as broken as the women he trains. After losing his own land and all his people in a brutal attack from a trusted friend, he has no choice but to rebuild any way he sees possible – even if it means going against everything he’s ever believed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After catching Ariana cheating at cards, Connor has a new trainee to instruct at one of the king’s many confiscated castles. In the dilapidated ruins, he discovers Ariana is more than she appears and falls in love with her incredibly tenacity and dedication – a love that is challenged by Connor’s chance at reclaiming the inheritance he once lost and has sought so desperately to regain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story is one of second chances, of realizing a strength where only hopelessness once resided – a story of rising above the bad hand one has been dealt into a life of accomplishment and love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a galaxy powered by the current, everyone has a gift.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyra is the sister of the brutal tyrant who rules the Shotet people. Cyra’s currentgift gives her pain and power—something her brother exploits, using her to torture his enemies. But Cyra is much more than just a blade in her brother’s hand: she is resilient, quick on her feet, and smarter than he knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akos is the son of a farmer and an oracle from the frozen nation-planet of Thuvhe. Protected by his unusual currentgift, Akos is generous in spirit, and his loyalty to his family is limitless. Once Akos and his brother are captured by enemy Shotet soldiers, Akos is desperate to get his brother out alive—no matter what the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Akos is thrust into Cyra's world, and the enmity between their countries and families seems insurmountable. Will they help each other to survive, or will they destroy one another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Carve the Mark&lt;/i&gt; is Veronica Roth's stunning portrayal of the power of friendship—and love—in a galaxy filled with unexpected gifts.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Fate brought them together. Now it will divide them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the addition of two powerful new voices, Veronica Roth's sequel to &lt;i&gt;Carve the Mark&lt;/i&gt; is a chorus of hope, humor, faith, and resilience.</description>

  <description>E L James revisits the world of Fifty Shades with a deeper and darker take on the love story that has enthralled millions of readers around the globe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their scorching, sensual affair ended in heartbreak and recrimination, but Christian Grey cannot get Anastasia Steele out of his mind, or his blood. Determined to win her back, he tries to suppress his darkest desires and his need for complete control, and to love Ana on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the horrors of his childhood still haunt him, and Ana’s scheming boss, Jack Hyde, clearly wants her for himself. Can Christian’s confidant and therapist, Dr. Flynn, help him face down his demons? Or will the possessiveness of Elena, his seducer, and the deranged devotion of Leila, his former submissive, drag Christian down into the past?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if Christian does win Ana back, can a man so dark and damaged ever hope to keep her?</description>

  <description>I was raised on the streets, so I know things are rarely as simple as they appear—especially this rich girl showing up at my pawnshop demanding a job.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s the most tempting thing I’ve ever seen, and I’ll be damned if I can make her leave.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shit just got complicated … but when it comes to her—I want complicated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We’re both fighting our own demons, and our only chance at a future is to let go of the past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But will we be strong enough to break free from beneath these chains?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEATH THESE CHAINS may be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>From author Meghan March comes a &lt;b&gt;sexy new standalone&lt;/b&gt; in the Beneath series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready to fall in love with the villain? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m the guy you love to hate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every story in my life, I seem to end up playing the villain—and I’ve got the scars to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That role works fine for me, because I’m sure as hell not anyone’s hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run my life and my empire with an iron fist—until she knocks my tightly controlled world off its axis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s nobody’s damsel in distress, but I can’t help but want to save her anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we’re about to find out if there’s a hero buried beneath these scars.</description>

  <description>I’ve always known she was too good for me, but that never stopped me from wanting her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I finally had her for one night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A night I don’t remember. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I’d blown my shot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now she’s walked back into my life, and this time, I have the upper hand. I want my second chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she be able to see the man beneath this ink?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the Ichidian Universe, The League and their ruthless assassins rule all. Expertly trained and highly valued, the League Assassins are the backbone of the government. But not even the League is immune to corruption . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Command Assassin Nykyrian Quikiades once turned his back on the League—and has been hunted by them ever since. Though many have tried, none can kill him or stop him from completing his current mission: to protect Kiara Zamir, a woman whose father’s political alliance has made her a target. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her world becomes even deadlier, Kiara must entrust her life to the same kind of beast who once killed her mother and left her for dead. Old enemies and new threaten them both and the only way they can survive is to overcome their suspicions and learn to trust in the very ones who threaten them the most: each other.</description>

  <description>They were masters of the darkness, searching through eternity for a mistress of the light....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He ran with the wolves...materialized from the mists...hijacked the very heavens to his whims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was the dark guardian of his people. So how, after centuries of a bleak, soulless existence had he, Lucian Daratrazanoff, suddenly come to crave petite, curvy, colorful lady cop Jaxon Montgomery, who foolishly made it her life's work to protect others from harm?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely daring, Jaxx would sacrifice anything to shield others-- particularly since a deadly menace dogged her every footstep, threatening all who got close to her. And strangely seductive, piercingly erotic Lucian was no exception. Lucian was powerfully, perilously mesmerizing--oddly gentle yet clearly a born predator. He had vowed to possess her, to guard her for all time. Yet with his every thirsty kiss, was he drawing Jaxon more deeply into danger . . . and his dark, mysterious desires?</description>

  <description>For Mack McKinley and his team of GhostWalker killing machines, urban warfare is an art. But despite a hard-won knowledge of the San Francisco streets, Mack knows from experience that too many things can still go wrong. Danger was just another part of the game - and now he's come face-to-face with a woman who can play just as tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's Jaimie, a woman with a sapphire stare so potent it can destroy a man. Years ago she and Mack had a history - volatile, erotic and electric. Then she vanished. But now she's walked back into Mack's life again, as a spy with more secrets than are good for her. Against all odds, she's hooking up with Mack one more time to take on an enemy that could destroy them both, or bring them back together in one hot, no-holds-barred adrenaline rush.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is my favorite one in the series so far. I like the point-blank I love you I want to be with you we have history were together. I also like that there’s indecision, second thoughts, and of course the heat better always is. I’m going to continue one because this one was really good!]]>

  <description>When Napoleon Bonaparte died in exile in 1821, he took to the grave a powerful secret. As general and emperor, he had stolen immeasurable riches from palaces, national treasuries, and even the Knights of Malta and the Vatican. In his final days, his British captors hoped to learn where the loot lay hidden. But he told them nothing, and in his will he made no mention of the treasure. Or did he? &lt;br /&gt;Former Justice Department operative Cotton Malone isn't looking for trouble when it comes knocking at his Copenhagen bookshop. Actually, it breaks and enters in the form of an American Secret Service agent with a pair of assassins on his heels. Malone has his doubts about the anxious young man, but narrowly surviving a ferocious firefight convinces him to follow his unexpected new ally. &lt;br /&gt;Their first stop is the secluded estate of Malone's good friend, Henrik Thorvaldsen. The wily Danish tycoon has uncovered the insidious plans of the Paris Club, a cabal of multimillionaires bent on manipulating the global economy. Only by matching wits with a terrorist-for-hire, foiling a catastrophic attack, and plunging into a desperate hunt for Napoleon's legendary lost treasure can Malone hope to avert international financial anarchy. &lt;br /&gt;But Thorvaldsen's real objective is much more personal: to avenge the murder of his son by the larcenous aristocrat at the heart of the conspiracy. Thorvaldsen's vendetta places Malone in an impossible quandary one that forces him to choose between friend and country, past and present. Starting in Denmark, moving to England, and ending up in the storied streets and cathedrals of Paris, Malone plays a breathless game of duplicity and death, all to claim a prize of untold value. But at what cost? "From the Hardcover edition.""</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The tomb of China’s First Emperor, guarded by an underground army of terra-cotta warriors, has remained sealed for more than 2,000 years. Though it’s regarded as one of the greatest archaeological sites in the world, the Chinese government won’t allow anyone to open it. Why?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;That question is at the heart of a dilemma faced by former Justice Department operative Cotton Malone, whose life is shattered when he receives an anonymous note carrying an unfamiliar Web address. Logging on, he sees Cassiopeia Vitt, a woman who’s saved his life more than once, being tortured at the hands of a mysterious man who has a single demand: &lt;i&gt;Bring me the artifact she’s asked you to keep safe.&lt;/i&gt; The only problem is, Malone doesn’t have a clue what the man is talking about, since Cassiopeia has left nothing with him. So begins Malone’s most harrowing adventure to date; one that offers up astounding historical revelations, pits him against a ruthless ancient brotherhood, and sends him from Denmark to Belgium to Vietnam then on to China, a vast and mysterious land where danger lurks at every turn.</description>

  <description>As a child, former Justice Department agent Cotton Malone was told his father died in a submarine disaster in the North Atlantic, but now he wants the full story and asks his ex-boss, Stephanie Nelle, to secure the military files. What he learns stuns him: His father’s sub was a secret nuclear vessel lost on a highly classified mission beneath the ice shelves of Antarctica.&lt;p&gt;But Malone isn’t the only one after the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin sisters Dorothea Lindauer and Christl Falk are fighting for the fortune their mother has promised to whichever of them discovers what really became of their father–who died on the same submarine that Malone’s father captained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sisters know something Malone doesn’t: Inspired by strange clues discovered in Charlemagne’s tomb, the Nazis explored Antarctica before the Americans, as long ago as 1938. Now Malone discovers that cryptic journals penned in “the language of heaven,” inscrutable conundrums posed by an ancient historian, and the ill-fated voyage of his father are all tied to a revelation of immense consequence for humankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to ensure that this explosive information never rises to the surface, Langford Ramsey, an ambitious navy admiral, has begun a brutal game of treachery, blackmail, and assassination. As Malone embarks on a dangerous quest with the sisters–one that leads them from an ancient German cathedral to a snowy French citadel to the unforgiving ice of Antarctica–he will finally confront the shocking truth of his father’s death and the distinct possibility of his own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Rue and the crew of the Spotted Custard return from India with revelations that shake the foundations of England's scientific community. Queen Victoria is not amused, the vampires are tetchy, and something is wrong with the local werewolf pack. To top it all off, Rue's best friend Primrose keeps getting engaged to the most unacceptable military types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rue has family problems as well. Her vampire father is angry, her werewolf father is crazy, and her obstreperous mother is both. Worst of all, Rue's beginning to suspect what they really are... is frightened.</description>

  <description>Alexia Tarabotti, Lady Maccon, has settled into domestic bliss. Of course, being Alexia, such bliss involves integrating werewolves into London High society, living in a vampire's second best closet, and coping with a precocious toddler who is prone to turning supernatural willy-nilly. Even Ivy Tunstell's acting troupe's latest play, disastrous to say the least, cannot put a dampener on Alexia's enjoyment of her new London lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until, that is, she receives a summons from Alexandria that cannot be ignored. With husband, child and Tunstells in tow, Alexia boards a steamer to cross the Mediterranean. But Egypt may hold more mysteries than even the indomitable Lady Maccon can handle. What does the vampire Queen of the Alexandria Hive really want from her? Why is the God-Breaker Plague suddenly expanding? And how has Ivy Tunstell suddenly become the most popular actress in all the British Empire?</description>

  <description>In a small village in New York lives Jane Doe, a girl with no memory of who she is or where she came from. So when she is working at a diner and slowly begins to realize she can see dead people, she's more than a little taken aback. Stranger still are the people entering her life. They seem to know things about her. Things they hide with lies and half-truths. Soon, she senses something far darker. A force that wants to cause her harm, she is sure of it. Her saving grace comes in the form of a new friend she feels she can confide in and the fry cook, a devastatingly handsome man whose smile is breathtaking and touch is scalding. He stays close, and she almost feels safe with him around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no one can outrun their past, and the more lies that swirl around her—even from her new and trusted friends—the more disoriented she becomes, until she is confronted by a man who claims to have been sent to kill her. Sent by the darkest force in the universe. A force that absolutely will not stop until she is dead. Thankfully, she has a Rottweiler. But that doesn't help in her quest to find her identity and recover what she's lost. That will take all her courage and a touch of the power she feels flowing like electricity through her veins. She almost feels sorry for him. The devil in blue jeans. The disarming fry cook who lies with every breath he takes. She will get to the bottom of what he knows if it kills her. Or him. Either way.</description>

Twelve of the deadliest beasts ever forged in the fires of hell have escaped onto our plane, and they want nothing more than to rip out the jugular of Charley Davidson and serve her lifeless, mangled body to Satan for dinner. So there’s that. But Charley has more on her plate than a mob of testy hellhounds. For one thing, her father has disappeared, and the more she retraces his last steps, the more she learns he was conducting an investigation of his own, one that has Charley questioning everything she’s ever known about him. Add to that an ex-BFF who is haunting her night and day, a rash of suicides that has authorities baffled, and a drop-dead sexy fiancé who has attracted the attentions of a local celebrity, and Charley is not having the best week of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tad north of hell, a hop, skip, and a jump past the realm of eternity, is a little place called Earth, and Charley Davidson, grim reaper extraordinaire, is determined to do everything in her power to protect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re doomed.</description>

  <description>Few things in life can come between a grim reaper and her coffee, but the sexy, sultry son of Satan is one of them. Now that Reyes Farrow has asked for her hand, Charley Davidson feels it's time to learn more about his past, but Reyes is reluctant to open up. When the official FBI file of his childhood abduction lands in her lap, Charley decides to go behind her mysterious beau’s back and conduct her own investigation. Because what could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, another case has fallen into her lap—one with dangerous implications. Some very insistent men want Charley to hunt down a witness who is scheduled to testify against their boss, a major player in the local crime syndicate. If Charley doesn't come up with an address in 48 hours, the people closest to her will start to disappear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that a desperate man in search of the soul he lost in a card game, a dogged mother determined to find the ghost of her son, and a beautiful, young Deaf boy haunted by his new ability to see the departed as clearly as he sees the living, and Charley has her hands full. The fact that Reyes has caught on to her latest venture only adds fuel to the inferno that he is. Good thing for Charley she's used to multi-tasking and always up for a challenge…especially when that challenge comes in the form of Reyes Farrow.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never underestimate the power of a woman on a double espresso with a mocha latte chaser high.&lt;br /&gt;- T-shirt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson isn't your everyday, run-of-the-mill grim reaper. She's more of a paranormal private eye/grim reaper extraordinaire. However, she gets sidetracked when the sexy, sultry son of Satan, Reyes Farrow, moves in next door. To further complicate matters, Reyes is her main suspect in an arson case. Charley has vowed to stay away from him until she can find out the truth...but then dead women start appearing in her apartment, one after another, each lost, confused, and terrified beyond reason. When it becomes apparent that her own sister, Gemma is the serial killer's next target, Charley has no choice but to ask for Reyes's help. Arsonist or not, he's the one man alive who could protect Gemma no matter who or what came at her. But he wants something in return. Charley. All of her, body and soul. And to keep her sister safe, it is a price she is willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is at it again in the sexy, suspenseful, and laugh-out-loud funny fifth installment of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best selling series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Paranormal private eye. Grim reaper extraordinaire. Whatever. Charley Davidson is back! And she's drinking copious amounts of caffeine to stay awake because, every time she closes her eyes, she sees him: Reyes Farrow, the part-human, part-supermodel son of Satan. Yes, she did imprison him for all eternity, but come on. How is she supposed to solve a missing persons case, deal with an ego-driven doctor, calm her curmudgeonly dad, and take on a motorcycle gang hellbent on murder when the devil's son just won't give up?</description>

  <description>Charley Davidson, Grim Reaper Extraordinaire, is back in this sexy, suspenseful novel of supernatural shenanigans When Charley is rudely awakened in the middle of the night by her best friend who tells her to get dressed quickly and tosses clothes out of the closet at her, she cant help but wonder what Cookies up to. Leather scrunch boots with a floral miniskirt? Together? Seriously? Cookie explains that a friend of hers named Mimi disappeared five days earlier and that she just got a text from her setting up a meet at a coffee shop downtown. They show up at the coffee shop, but no Mimi. But Charley finds a message on the bathroom wall. Mimi left a clue, a womans name. Mimis husband explains that his wife had been acting strange since she found out an old friend of hers from high school had been found murdered a couple weeks prior. The same woman Mimi had named in her message. Meanwhile, Reyes Alexander Farrow (otherwise known as the Son of Satan. Yes. Literally) has left his corporeal body and is haunting Charley. Hes left his body because hes being tortured by demons who want to lure Charley closer. But Reyes cant let that happen. Because if the demons get to Charley, theyll have a portal to heaven. And if they have a portal to heavenwell, lets just say it wouldnt be pretty. Can Charley handle hot nights with Reyes and even hotter days tracking down a missing woman? Will Cookie ever get a true fashion sense? And is there enough coffee and chocolate in the world to fuel them as they do?</description>

  <description>Return to the world of the GhostWalkers with “the queen of paranormal romance” (USA Today) as she raises the stakes in the ultimate game of love and death… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Games should be fun, but for two expert teams across the country, they’re murder – because the winning team is the one that gets the most kills. The participants in this violent challenge rumored to be GhostWalkers. And Kadan Montague isn’t happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kadan is a GhostWalker and he’s determined to clear the GhostWalker name of the rumors. To do it, he’s going to need the help of psychic Tansy Meadows. But as soon as he sees her, he knows his mission will be more complicated than he imagined – and the “murder game” may not be at all what it seems.</description>

  <description>Dante Gabriel is starving. What he craves is red gold—human blood. After being held captive as a blood slave to a female vampire for years, he has finally escaped. Unchained at last, he follows his nose to the nearest blood bank to sate his hunger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ER nurse Erin Hamilton expects just another busy night shift…until she finds a gorgeous stranger vandalizing the hospital blood bank. Though her logic tells her to turn him in, she’s pulled by stronger and unfamiliar emotions to protect the man who seems oddly infatuated with her scent. Chemistry sizzles between them, but Dante, plagued by nightmares of his time in captivity, fears he won’t be able to control himself…especially when he discovers a secret she doesn’t even know she’s hiding.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to Fillory in the riveting sequel to The New York Times bestseller and literary phenomenon of 2009--&lt;i&gt;The Magicians&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Magicians&lt;/i&gt; was praised as a triumph by readers and critics of both mainstream and fantasy literature. Now Grossman takes us back to Fillory, where the Brakebills graduates have fled the sorrows of the mundane world, only to face terrifying new challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quentin and his friends are now the kings and queens of Fillory, but the days and nights of royal luxury are starting to pall. After a morning hunt takes a sinister turn, Quentin and his old friend Julia charter a magical sailing ship and set out on an errand to the wild outer reaches of their kingdom. Their pleasure cruise becomes an adventure when the two are unceremoniously dumped back into the last place Quentin ever wants to see: his parent's house in Chesterton, Massachusetts. And only the black, twisted magic that Julia learned on the streets can save them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Magician King&lt;/i&gt; is a grand voyage into the dark, glittering heart of magic, an epic quest for the Harry Potter generation. It also introduces a powerful new voice, that of Julia, whose angry genius is thrilling. Once again Grossman proves that he is the cutting edge of literary fantasy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A beautiful fugitive. A hot bodyguard. A high-stakes game of temptation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Nasir, former Special Ops military man and bodyguard, his new job seems like an easy-money gig: trail a Russian mobster’s runaway wife in Mexico, enjoy the sun, observe, and report. Just one rule: don’t get too close. But it’s all Naz can do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to watch the alluring dancer’s every move. A closer look is irresistible—especially when she’s in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evalina escaped to the island getaway to live an untraceable life—as far away from the past as she can get. But Eva can’t ignore the dark, muscled stud who rescues her from a drug gang. He says he’s an ex-cop on vacation. When providence throws them together time and again, Eva thinks it’s all a beautiful coincidence. Now she’s giving in to a strange new sensation: trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Naz has a mission to accomplish and a secret to keep. Eva has her share of secrets, too. And as the heat flares between them, Naz knows that &lt;i&gt;trust&lt;/i&gt; could become the most dangerous impulse of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Life Just Threw Her A Curveball.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the team-owner’s daughter, Maggie Jameson grew up in the New York Saints’ stadium—glove, cap, hot dogs, and all. Baseball’s in her blood, and she’s always dreamed of the day when she would lead the Saints to victory herself. That was before her dad had to sell the team to Alex Winters. The fast-talking, fiercely attractive businessman has a baseball pedigree that’s distinctly minor league. Maggie wants to hate him but his skills of seduction, however, are off the charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will Love Be A Home Run?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex could never have imagined how much this team means to Maggie. He needs her to help show the players that they’re still a family…even if he and Maggie are at the verge of exchanging blows. But her fiery determination and gorgeous looks prove irresistible to Alex. And much as he wants to relegate their relationship to the playing field—and get the Saints back in the game—Alex just can’t help himself: What he wants to win most is Maggie’s heart…</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Love—on the rocks….&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing Vaughan Hewson expects to find when he returns to his childhood home is a broken hearted bride in his shower, let alone the drama and chaos that come with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lydia Green doesn't know whether to scream or cry in a corner. Discovering the love of your life is having an affair on your wedding day is bad enough. Finding out it's with his best man is another thing all together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when this runaway bride has nowhere left to turn, a handsome stranger offers her a broad, muscular shoulder to cry on. Vaughan is the exact opposite of the picture perfect, respected businessmen she's normally drawn to. This former musician-turned-bartender is rough around the edges and is facing his own crossroads. But Lydia's already tried Mr. Right and discovered he's all wrong--maybe it's time to give Mr. Right Now a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, what's wrong with getting dirty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty &lt;/i&gt;is the first book in the Dive Bar series from bestselling author Kylie Scott.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Locating Alexander the Great's final resting place-unknown to this day-remains a tantalizing goal for both archaeologists and treasure hunters. Now the quest for this coveted prize is about to heat up. After narrowly escaping a fire that consumes a Danish museum, Cotton Malone-former U.S. Justice Department agent turned rare-book dealer-learns from his friend, the beguiling adventurer Cassiopeia Vitt, that the blaze was part of a campaign of arson intended to mask a far more diabolical design.&lt;br /&gt; From the ashes of the U.S.S.R., a new nation has arisen: the Central Asian Federation. At its helm is Supreme Minister Irina Zovastina, a cunning despot with the single-minded desire to surpass Alexander the Great as history's ultimate conqueror. The Federation has amassed a harrowing arsenal of biological weapons, and only one thing keeps Zovastina from setting in motion her death march of domination: a miraculous healing serum, kept secret by an ancient puzzle and buried with the mummified remains of Alexander the Great-in a tomb lost to the ages for more than 1,500 years.&lt;br /&gt; Together, Cotton and Cassiopeia must outrun and outthink the forces allied against them in order to unravel a riddle whose solution could destroy or save millions of people-depending on who finds the lost tomb first.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The official playscript of the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The playscript for &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/em&gt; was originally released as a 'special rehearsal edition' alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's West End in summer 2016. Based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews from theatregoers and critics alike, while the official playscript became an immediate global bestseller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This definitive and final playscript updates the 'special rehearsal edition' with the conclusive and final dialogue from the play, which has subtly changed since its rehearsals, as well as a conversation piece between director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne, who share stories and insights about reading playscripts. This edition also includes useful background information including the Potter family tree and a timeline of events from the Wizarding World prior to the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you could change your story, would you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane has lived a mostly ordinary life, raised by her recently deceased aunt Magnolia, whom she counted on to turn life into an adventure. Without Aunt Magnolia, Jane is directionless. Then an old acquaintance, the glamorous and capricious Kiran Thrash, blows back into Jane’s life and invites her to a gala at the Thrashes’ extravagant island mansion called Tu Reviens. Jane remembers her aunt telling her: “If anyone ever invites you to Tu Reviens, promise me that you’ll go.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Jane doesn’t know is that at Tu Reviens her story will change; the house will offer her five choices that could ultimately determine the course of her untethered life. But every choice comes with a price. She might fall in love, she might lose her life, she might come face-to-face with herself. At Tu Reviens, anything is possible.</description>

  <description>Stieg Engstrom, Angriest Viking Ever, has got big problems. The human Viking Clans of earth are in danger of being obliterated—along with the rest of the world—and the only one who may be able to save them is a super pain-in-the-ass Crow. Most people annoy Stieg, but this is the one woman he really can’t stand…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin Amsel loves being a Crow! Why wouldn’t she when the other Viking Clans are so hilariously arrogant and humorless? She’s not about to let all that come to an end! She just didn’t expect to be shoulder to shoulder in battle with Stieg. Then again, he’s so easy to torment—and also kind of cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the future of the world riding on them, Stieg knows he’ll have to put aside his desperate need to kiss the smirk right off Erin’s face. Wait. What? He didn’t mean that—did he? No! They have one goal: To conquer the idiots. Because nothing bugs Stieg more than when idiots win. If only he can keep himself from suddenly acting like one….</description>

  <description>Think your life is complicated and confusing? Nick Gautier was born to bring about the end of the world…It’s not easy being the heir of a demon overlord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nick is determined to thwart his destiny and get into a good college. To be more than his genetics and prophecy foretell. No one is ever going to tell this stubborn Cajun who and what he really is. Or how to live his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even the Fates of the Universe. But now that he and his team of ancient gods and demons have claimed the Eye of Ananke and he sees the missteps of the future, he has to battle the demons within that are far deadlier and more treacherous than any he’s battled before. All the while his arch nemesis is back and determined to reclaim his place as the harbinger for Armageddon. Even if it means killing Nick and barbecuing everyone he loves to do so.</description>

  <description>Memphis, 1939. Twelve-year-old Rill Foss and her four younger siblings live a magical life aboard their family’s Mississippi River shantyboat. But when their father must rush their mother to the hospital one stormy night, Rill is left in charge—until strangers arrive in force. Wrenched from all that is familiar and thrown into a Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage, the Foss children are assured that they will soon be returned to their parents—but they quickly realize the dark truth. At the mercy of the facility’s cruel director, Rill fights to keep her sisters and brother together in a world of danger and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiken, South Carolina, present day. Born into wealth and privilege, Avery Stafford seems to have it all: a successful career as a federal prosecutor, a handsome fiancé, and a lavish wedding on the horizon. But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family’s long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on one of America’s most notorious real-life scandals—in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country—Lisa Wingate’s riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong.</description>

  <description>Quitting her husband's house and moving back in with her horrible family, Lady Maccon becomes the scandal of the London season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queen Victoria dismisses her from the Shadow Council, and the only person who can explain anything, Lord Akeldama, unexpectedly leaves town. To top it all off, Alexia is attacked by homicidal mechanical ladybugs, indicating, as only ladybugs can, the fact that all of London's vampires are now very much interested in seeing Alexia quite thoroughly dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Lord Maccon elects to get progressively more inebriated and Professor Lyall desperately tries to hold the Woolsey werewolf pack together, Alexia flees England for Italy in search of the mysterious Templars. Only they know enough about the preternatural to explain her increasingly inconvenient condition, but they may be worse than the vampires -- and they're armed with pesto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLAMELESS is the third book of the Parasol Protectorate series: a comedy of manners set in Victorian London, full of werewolves, vampires, dirigibles, and tea-drinking.</description>

  <description>They're bad boys-with that little something extra. Sexy, wild, out-of-this-world talents that can leave any woman feeling weak at the knees (among other body parts), they're the ones to call when you want pleasure that lasts…and lasts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHELLY LAURENSTON&lt;br /&gt;CAN'T GET ENOUGH&lt;br /&gt;Even for a dragon, Ailean the Wicked has a bad reputation. For 150 years he's been renowned for his fighting prowess, but now he's got a new conquest in mind-a gorgeous dragoness known as Shalin the Innocent. Ailean suspects she's anything but. And while he's saving her from her enemies, he plans to prove that, even in human form, a bad-boy dragon can show a girl a good time that's truly off the scale...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CYNTHIA EDEN&lt;br /&gt;SPELLBOUND&lt;br /&gt;No witch in her right mind would summon an immortal soul-hunter to her aid, but Serena Tyme needs Luis D'Amil's help to destroy the warlock who's stalking her coven. And she's willing to pay any price he names…especially when the tall, dark, sexy-as-hell assassin shows her he can work some sensual magic of his own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOELLE MACK&lt;br /&gt;TURN ME ON&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Beth Danforth has found a man who can flip her switch. That's because supersexy Justin Watts, CEO of SpectraSign, is literally made of light, with a dazzling, custom-built body. The only thing he needs to maintain his energy level is to turn up the heat with a real woman, and with Beth, the results are guaranteed to be electrifying.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The debut novel of an American original, Laurie Plissner is both medical thriller and lyric love story in the tradition of magical realism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the snowy night when her family's car slammed into a tree, killing her parents and little sister, Sasha has been unable to speak except through a computer with a robotic voice. Nothing is wrong with her body; that's healed. But, after four years, Sasha's memory, and her spirit, are still broken. Then one day, she's silently cussing out the heavy book she dropped at the library when a gorgeous, dark-haired boy, the kind of boy who considers Sasha a freak or at least invisible, "answers" Sasha's hidden thoughts -- out loud. Yes, Ben can read minds; it's no big deal. He's part of a family with a host of unusual, almost-but-not-quite-supernatural talents. Through Ben's love, Sasha makes greater progress than she has with a host of therapists and a prominent psychiatrist. With him to defend her, bullies keep the world from ever understanding Sasha, he pulls away. Determined to win him and prove her courage by facing her past, Sasha confronts her past -- only to learn that her family's death was no accident and that a similar fate may wait for her, in the unlikeliest of disguises.</description>

  <description>Zombies, demons, vampires, shapeshifters— another day in the life of Nick Gautier– and those are just his friends. But now that he’s accepted the demon that lives inside him, he must learn to control it and temper the very emotions that threaten the lives of everyone he cares for. Something that’s hard to do while trying to stay off the menus of those who want his head on a platter. And no one wants him more than the dark gods who created his race. Now that they know where he is, they will stop at nothing to reclaim him. And without knowing it, Nick has just embraced the one person he should never have trusted. The one person who will hand him over to his enemies to get back the life they lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick has finally accepted his fate, now he must learn to defy his destiny, and the dark, deadly forces that will stop at nothing to destroy everyone he loves so that they can again return to the world of man and own it.</description>

  <description>A thrilling and original coming-of-age novel for adults about a young man practicing magic in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren’t black and white, love and sex aren’t simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'Every Carpathian male is drawn to his life mate, a Carpathian or human female able to provide the light to his darkness. Without her, the beast within slowly consumes the man until turning vampire is the only option.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel wakes deep within the ground, and the first sensation he feels is an overwhelming hunger for blood. But as he hunts the dark streets of Paris for prey, a voice calls to him, soothing, calming, giving him the strength to control his craving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francesca Del Ponce is a healer, a woman who radiates goodness as powerfully as the sun does light. Though Gabriel can only imagine what she will feel like in his arms, he knows the taste of her will be addictive. And yet he fears for her life and his soul if he gives in to his desire...</description>

  <description>Be careful what you wish for…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just might get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Gautier is tired of his destiny. He doesn’t want to be the son of a demon who’s fated to end the world. Nor does he want to see another demon or other preternatural creature who wants to kill or enslave him. He just wants to be normal and have normal problems like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But normality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. When he gets sucked into an alternate reality where his mother has married his mentor and his Atlantean god best friend has become a human geek, he begins to understand that no life is free of pain, and that every person has a specific place in the universe… Even the son of a hated demon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, he sees that his powers aren’t the curse he thought they were, and that the world needs a champion, especially one its enemies can’t imagine rising up to defend the ones he should destroy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old enemies and new friends square off for a major battle that will either restore Nick to his real world, or end him forever.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A risk worth taking…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; No one would ever accuse Jace Berisha of having an easy life—considering her husband…you know…killed her. But that was then! Now she fights for mighty Viking gods with the spectacular and vicious Crows.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But things are turning very bad, very quickly because a vengeful, ancient goddess has come into the world with just one thing on her mind—ending it. And the only way they can hope to stop her is if the Crows join forces with their one-time enemies, the Protectors. A Viking Clan created to do nothing but kill every Crow they see. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Thankfully, Protector Ski Eriksen is a peace loving kind of guy. Because the woman he is desperately trying to get close to is the beautiful and not-very-chatty Jace. Battling Nordic clans? Unkillable goddesses? Jace’s mean-spirited dog? None of these things would ever get in the way of a true Viking!</description>

  <description>My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise, I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cap mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead...</description>

  <description> Her instincts tell her he's dangerous...  &lt;p&gt;While her overprotective brother's away, Meara Greymere's planning to play—and it wouldn't hurt to find herself a mate in the process. The last thing she needs is one of his SEAL buddies spoiling her fun, even if the guy is the hottest one she's ever seen...&lt;/p&gt;  His powers of persuasion are impossible to resist...  &lt;p&gt;Finn Emerson is a battle-hardened Navy SEAL and alpha wolf. He's a little overqualified for baby-sitting, but feisty Meara is attracting trouble like a magnet...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the only responsible alpha male in the vicinity, Finn is going to have to protect this intriguing woman from a horde of questionable men, and definitely from himself...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Crazy Rich Asians is the outrageously funny debut novel about three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From beloved award-winning actor, Neil Patrick Harris, comes the magical first book in a new series with plenty of tricks up its sleeve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When street magician Carter runs away, he never expects to find friends and magic in a sleepy New England town. But like any good trick, things change instantly as greedy B.B. Bosso and his crew of crooked carnies arrive to steal anything and everything they can get their sticky fingers on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a fateful encounter with the local purveyor of illusion, Dante Vernon, Carter teams up with five other like-minded kids. Together, using both teamwork and magic, they'll set out to save the town of Mineral Wells from Bosso's villainous clutches. These six &lt;i&gt;Magic Misfits&lt;/i&gt; will soon discover adventure, friendship, and their own self-worth in this delightful new series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WINGING IT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kera Watson never expected to face death behind a Los Angeles coffee shop. Not after surviving two tours lugging an M16 around the Middle East. If it wasn’t for her hot Viking customer showing up too late to help, nobody would even see her die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In uncountable years of service to the Allfather Odin, Ludvig “Vig” Rundstöm has never seen anyone kick ass with quite as much style as Kera. He knows one way to save her life—but she might not like it. Signing up with the Crows will get Kera a new set of battle buddies: cackling, gossiping, squabbling, party-hearty women. With wings. So not the Marines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Vig can’t give up on someone as special as Kera. With a storm of oh-crap magic speeding straight for L.A., survival will depend on combining their strengths: Kera’s discipline, Vig’s loyalty… and the Crows’ sheer love of battle. Boy, are they in trouble.</description>

  <description>James Patterson, bestselling author of the Alex Cross novels Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls, and Pop Goes the Weasel, offers the first of a new series dubbed The Women's Murder Club, featuring a four-woman team that occasionally works outside the system. None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Tom Piccirilli</description>

  <description>Alexia Maccon, the Lady Woolsey, awakens in the wee hours of the mid-afternoon to find her husband, who should be decently asleep like any normal werewolf, yelling at the top of his lungs. Then he disappears; leaving her to deal with a regiment of supernatural soldiers encamped on her doorstep, a plethora of exorcised ghosts, and an angry Queen Victoria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Alexia is armed with her trusty parasol, the latest fashions, and an arsenal of biting civility. So even when her investigations take her to Scotland, the backwater of ugly waistcoats, she is prepared: upending werewolf pack dynamics as only the soulless can. She might even find time to track down her wayward husband, if she feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHANGELESS is the second book of the Parasol Protectorate series: a comedy of manners set in Victorian London, full of werewolves, vampires, dirigibles, and tea-drinking.</description>

Powerful. But tormented. For the brooding hunter walked alone, always alone, far from his Carpathian kind, alien to even his twin. Like his name, his existence was savage. Until he met the woman he was sworn to protect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Julian heard Desari sing, rainbows swamped his starving senses. Emotions bombarded his hardened heart. And a dark hunger to possess her flooded his loins, blinding him to the danger stalking him. And even as Desari enflamed him, she dared to defy him with mysterious, unparalleled feminine powers. Was Desari more than his perfect mate? Julian had met his match in this woman, but would she drive him to madness... or save his soul?</description>

  <description>The heat is on, and a new threat to humanity has risen…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick has his driver’s license and he’s not afraid to use it. But turning sixteen isn’t what he thought it would be. While other boys his age are worried about prom dates and applying for college, Nick is neck deep in enemies out to stop him from living another day. No longer sure if he can trust anyone, his only ally seems to be the one person he’s been told will ultimately kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But life spent serving the undead is anything except ordinary. And those out to get him have summoned an ancient force so powerful even the gods fear it. As Nick learns to command and control the elements, the one he must master in order to combat his latest foe is the one most likely to destroy him. As the old proverb goes, fire knows nothing of mercy, and if Nick is to survive this latest round, he will have to sacrifice a part of himself. However, the best sacrifice is seldom the sanest move. Sometimes it’s the one that leaves your enemies confused, and you even more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes, you have to trust your enemy to save your friends. But what do you do when that enemy is you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://us.macmillan.com/inferno-3/SherrilynKenyon" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/inferno-3/She...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Zoey Mathers had everything going for her until one night she lost her biggest client, her job, and her reputation. Leaving her life up to fate, Zoey closed her eyes and pointed. She would serve out her career exile in the small mountain town of Moonshine Hollow where moonshine flowed as freely as a mountain stream.Giving up the law to become a baker in Moonshine Hollow turned out to be the best thing Zoey had ever done. She was happy and enjoying life in her new small town. But Zoey should have learned the first time . . . one night can change your whole life. After unknowingly crashing a battle between witches, Zoey accidentally becomes a witch herself. That's all before Zoey stumbles over a murder victim and the town's sheriff becomes involved. Now she's trying to find a murderer, stop two old witches from playing matchmaker, and learning she's way more than a mere accidental witch.And that's all before fate turns up one more sexy hunk of a twist . . .</description>

  <description>Lady Alexia Maccon, soulless, is at it again, only this time the trouble is not her fault. When a mad ghost threatens the queen, Alexia is on the case, following a trail that leads her deep into her husband's past. Top that off with a sister who has joined the suffragette movement (shocking!), Madame Lefoux's latest mechanical invention, and a plague of zombie porcupines and Alexia barely has time to remember she happens to be eight months pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Alexia manage to determine who is trying to kill Queen Victoria before it is too late? Is it the vampires again or is there a traitor lurking about in wolf's clothing? And what, exactly, has taken up residence in Lord Akeldama's second best closet?</description>

  <description>The world has fallen in love with Nick Gautier and the Dark-Hunters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Nick’s saga continues in the next eagerly anticipated volume...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to school. Get good grades. Stay out of trouble. That’s the mandate for most kids. But Nick Gautier isn’t the average teenager. He’s a boy with a destiny not even he fully understands. And his first mandate is to stay alive while everyone, even his own father, tries to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s learned to annihilate zombies and raise the dead, divination and clairvoyance, so why is learning to drive and keep a girlfriend so dang hard? But that isn’t the primary skill he has to master. Survival is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in order to survive, his next lesson makes all the others pale in comparison. He is on the brink of becoming either the greatest hero mankind has ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or he’ll be the one who ends the world. With enemies new and old gathering forces, he will have to call on every part of himself to fight or he’ll lose everyone he cares about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even himself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Long live the King... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After turning his back on the throne for centuries, Wrath, son of Wrath, finally assumed his father’s mantle—with the help of his beloved mate. But the crown sets heavily on his head. As the war with the Lessening Society rages on, and the threat from the Band of Bastards truly hits home, he is forced to make choices that put everything—and everyone—at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Randall thought she knew what she was getting into when she mated the last pure blooded vampire on the planet: An easy ride was not it. But when she decides she wants a child, she’s unprepared for Wrath’s response—or the distance it creates between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is, will true love win out... or tortured legacy take over?</description>

  <description>Qhuinn, son of no one, is used to being on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has finally found an identity as one of the most brutal fighters in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems to be within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blay, after years of unrequited love, has moved on from his feelings for Qhuinn. And it’s about time: it seems Qhuinn has found his perfect match in a Chosen female, and they are going to have a young. It’s hard for Blay to see the new couple together, but building your life around a pipe dream is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. And Qhuinn needs to come to terms with some dark things before he can move forward…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate seems to have taken these vampire soldiers in different directions... but as the battle over the race’s throne intensifies, and new players on the scene in Caldwell create mortal danger for the Brotherhood, Qhuinn finally learns the true definition of courage, and two hearts who are meant to be together... finally become one.</description>

  <description>Ever since the death of his &lt;i&gt;shellan&lt;/i&gt;, Tohrment has been unrecognizable from the vampire leader he once was. Physically emaciated and heartbroken beyond despair, he has been brought back to the Brotherhood by a self-serving fallen angel. Now, fighting once again with ruthless vengeance, he is unprepared to face a new kind of tragedy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tohr begins to see his beloved in his dreams—trapped in a cold, isolated netherworld far from the peace and tranquillity of the Fade—he turns to the angel in hopes of saving the one he has lost. But because Lassiter tells him he must learn to love another to free his former mate, Tohr knows they are all doomed.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except then a female with a shadowed history begins to get through to him. Against the backdrop of the raging war with the &lt;i&gt;lessers&lt;/i&gt;, and with a new clan of vampires vying for the Blind King’s throne, Tohr struggles between the buried past and a very hot, passion-filled future…but can his heart let go and set all of them free?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Number-one New York Times best-selling author J.R. Ward's thrilling new novel in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payne, twin sister of Vishous, is cut from the same dark, seductive cloth as her brother. Imprisoned for eons by their mother, the Scribe Virgin, she finally frees herself - only to face a devastating injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuel Manello, M.D., is drafted by the Brotherhood to save her as only he can - but when the human surgeon and the vampire warrior meet, their two worlds collide in the face of their undeniable passion. With so much working against them, can love prove stronger than the birthright and the biology that separates them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;18 hours and 37 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>John Matthew has come a long way since he was found living among humans, his vampire nature unknown to himself and to those around him. After he was taken in by the Brotherhood, no one could guess what his true history was- or his true identity. Indeed, the fallen Brother Darius has returned, but with a different face and a very different destiny. As a vicious personal vendetta takes John into the heart of the war, he will need to call up on both who he is now and who he once was in order to face off against evil incarnate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xhex, a symphath assassin, has long steeled herself against the attraction between her and John Matthew. Having already lost one lover to madness, she will not allow the male of worth to fall prey to the darkness of her twisted life. When fate intervenes, however, the two discover that love, like destiny, is inevitable between soul mates.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;In this "frighteningly addictive" paranormal romance saga there's a war raging between vampires and their slayers. Here are the stories of a secret band of brothers like no other—six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. And now a dutiful twin must choose between two lives...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely loyal to the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Phury has sacrificed himself for the good of the race, becoming the male responsible for keeping the Brotherhood's bloodlines alive. As Primale of the Chosen, he is obligated to father the sons and daughters who will ensure that the traditions of the race survive, and that there are warriors to fight those who want all vampires extinguished. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his first mate, the Chosen Cormia wants to win not only his body, but his heart for herself. She is drawn to the noble responsibility behind the emotionally scarred male. But Phury has never allowed himself to know pleasure or joy. As the war with the Lessening Society grows grim, tragedy looms over the Brotherhood's mansion, and Phury must decide between duty and love....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;an alternate cover edition can be found &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23253472" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were masters of the darkness, searching through eternity for a mistress of the light...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Would she find magic—or madness in his dark embrace?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young Savannah Dubrinsky is a mistress of illusion, a world-famous magician capable of mesmerizing millions. But there is one—Gregori, the Dark One—who holds her in terrifying thrall. Whose cold silver eyes and heated sensuality send shivers of danger, of desire, down her slender spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a dark magic all his own, Gregori—the implacable hunter, the legendary healer, the most powerful of Carpathian males—whispers in Savannah's mind that he is her destiny. That she was born to save his immortal soul. And now, here in New Orleans, the hour has finally come to claim her. To make her completely his. In a ritual as old as time . . . and as inescapable as eternity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alexia Tarabotti is laboring under a great many social tribulations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, she has no soul. Second, she's a spinster whose father is both Italian and dead. Third, she was rudely attacked by a vampire, breaking all standards of social etiquette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to go from there? From bad to worse apparently, for Alexia accidentally kills the vampire--and then the appalling Lord Maccon (loud, messy, gorgeous, and werewolf) is sent by Queen Victoria to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With unexpected vampires appearing and expected vampires disappearing, everyone seems to believe Alexia responsible. Can she figure out what is actually happening to London's high society? Will her soulless ability to negate supernatural powers prove useful or just plain embarrassing? Finally, who is the real enemy, and do they have treacle tart?</description>

  <description>A Monstrous Regiment of Women continues Mary Russell's adventures as a worthy student of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and as an ever more skilled sleuth in her own right. Looking for respite in London after a stupefying visit from relatives, Mary encounters a friend from Oxford. The young woman introduces Mary to her current enthusiasm, a strange and enigmatic woman named Margery Childe, who leads something called "The New Temple of God." It seems to be a charismatic sect involved in the post-World War I suffrage movement, with a feminist slant on Christianity. Mary is curious about the woman, and intrigued. Is the New Temple a front for something more sinister? When a series of murders claims members of the movement's wealthy young female volunteers and principal contributors, Mary, with Holmes in the background, begins to investigate. Things become more desperate than either of them expected as Mary's search plunges her into the worst danger she has yet faced.</description>

  <description>BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Steve Berry’s &lt;i&gt;The Emperor’s Tomb &lt;/i&gt;and a Cotton Malone dossier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cotton Malone retired from the high-risk world of elite operatives for the U.S. Justice Department to lead the low-key life of a rare-book dealer. But his quiet existence is shattered when he receives an anonymous e-mail: “You have something I want. You’ re the only person on earth who knows where to find it. Go get it. You have 72 hours. If I don’t hear from you, you will be childless.” His horrified ex-wife confirms that the threat is real: Their teenage son has been kidnapped. When Malone’s Copenhagen bookshop is burned to the ground, it becomes brutally clear that those responsible will stop at nothing to get what they want. And what they want is nothing less than the lost Library of Alexandria.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A cradle of ideas–historical, philosophical, literary, scientific, and religious–the Library of Alexandria was unparalleled in the world. But fifteen hundred years ago, it vanished into the mists of myth and legend–its vast bounty of wisdom coveted ever since by scholars, fortune hunters, and those who believe its untold secrets hold the key to ultimate power.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now a cartel of wealthy international moguls, bent on altering the course of history, is desperate to breach the library’s hallowed halls–and only Malone possesses the information they need to succeed. At stake is an explosive ancient document with the potential not only to change the destiny of the Middle East but to shake the world’s three major religions to their very foundations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Pursued by a lethal mercenary, Malone crosses the globe in search of answers. His quest will lead him to England and Portugal, even to the highest levels of American government–and the shattering outcome, deep in the Sinai desert, will have worldwide repercussions.</description>

  <description>It begins as a mission to protect a politician from an assassination threat. But the operation takes an unexpected turn when Mari, a mysteriously beautiful GhostWalker, is taken hostage. At the same time, Ken Norton, expert assassin and himself a GhostWalker warrior, is on a mission of his own—one that reaches into Mari’s own past. No stranger to the ways of violent warfare, Mari must join forces with Ken and trust his every move—each one more intimate than the last.*&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>After being together for ten years, Sylvie and Dan have all the trimmings of a happy life and marriage; they have a comfortable home, fulfilling jobs, beautiful twin girls, and communicate so seamlessly, they finish each other’s sentences. However, a trip to the doctor reveals they could live another 68 years together… and panic sets in. They never expected ‘until death do us part’ to mean seven decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of marriage survival, they quickly concoct a plan to keep their relationship fresh and exciting: they will create little surprises for each other so that their (extended) years together will never become boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in their pursuit to execute Project Surprise Me, mishaps arise and secrets are uncovered that start to threaten the very foundation of their unshakeable bond. When a scandal from the past is revealed that questions some important untold truths, they begin to wonder if they ever really knew each other after all…</description>

  <description>Jack Norton is a GhostWalker, a genetically enhanced sniper with a merciless sense of justice, a phantom welcomed by the anonymity of the night. But a mission to rescue his brother in the jungle has left him vulnerable to rebel forces. His only salvation is his power of telepathy. Then he meets Briony, an unusual beauty on a mission of her own. But they share more than the sweltering heat ... Briony shares the GhostWalker powers. Yet she's different. She doesn't know what she is, or what she's capable of. But her enemies do. And Jack and Briony's flight will take them into frightening conspiracy of mind and body - across the globe and into the heart of darkness, where the shocking truth is something neither of them could have foreseen - or can escape...</description>

  <description>If you knew the date of your death, how would you live your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It's 1969 in New York City's Lower East Side, and word has spread of the arrival of a mystical woman, a traveling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the day they will die. The Gold children—four adolescents on the cusp of self-awareness—sneak out to hear their fortunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prophecies inform their next five decades. Golden-boy Simon escapes to the West Coast, searching for love in '80s San Francisco; dreamy Klara becomes a Las Vegas magician, obsessed with blurring reality and fantasy; eldest son Daniel seeks security as an army doctor post-9/11; and bookish Varya throws herself into longevity research, where she tests the boundary between science and immortality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping novel of remarkable ambition and depth, &lt;i&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/i&gt; probes the line between destiny and choice, reality and illusion, this world and the next. It is a deeply moving testament to the power of story, the nature of belief, and the unrelenting pull of familial bonds.</description>

  <description>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>Ryan Steel, his world recently upended by an earth-shattering secret, now faces yet another potential revelation surrounding the Steel family mystery. He no longer fully trusts his siblings or the woman he loves. He’s alone—alone and terrified and immersed in a conundrum that becomes more twisted each day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ruby Lee loves Ryan and desperately wants to help him. She’ll do whatever she must to see him through this troubling time, but her own shrouded past still haunts her, and she’s determined to put an end to both of their mysteries once and for all. But the more she uncovers, the more danger she’s in…and she may lose Ryan forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Gail Carriger comes a new novel in the world of the Parasol Protectorate starring Prudence, the daughter of Alexia Tarabotti.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Prudence Alessandra Maccon Akeldama (Rue to her friends) is given an unexpected dirigible, she does what any sensible female would under similar circumstances - names it the Spotted Custard and floats to India in pursuit of the perfect cup of tea. But India has more than just tea on offer. Rue stumbles upon a plot involving local dissidents, a kidnapped brigadier's wife, and some awfully familiar Scottish werewolves. Faced with a dire crisis and an embarrassing lack of bloomers, what else is a young lady of good breeding to do but turn metanatural and find out everyone's secrets, even thousand-year-old fuzzy ones?</description>

  <description>Ryan Steel is known in Snow Creek as the handsomest Steel brother with the most jovial personality. Now that his busy grape harvest and winemaking season is over, he's happy to spend time with his family and help his brothers, Talon and Jonah, celebrate their impending nuptials. The Steels are taking a well-deserved break from the conspiracy surrounding them...until an unlikely woman and a long-buried secret shatter Ryan's world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Detective Ruby Lee has been on her own since she was fifteen. When her past collides with the Steel family's mysteries, she's determined to find the truth. She has her own issues, and she's not looking for a relationship, despite her all-consuming attraction to Ryan Steel. The gorgeous dark-haired man gets under her skin anyway...and he needs her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together they explore both of their histories, but those pasts could cost them a future.</description>

  <description>Jonah Steel is knee deep into trying to solve the mystery surrounding his family and his brother's abduction, and the arrival of his best friend has complicated the situation...although not as much as his infatuation with his brother's therapist, Dr. Melanie Carmichael. The quiet humility of the blond beauty has him enthralled, and he burns for her as he never has for any woman. &lt;br /&gt; Melanie Carmichael is intelligent and driven, yet filled with regret. She has fallen in love with gorgeous Jonah Steel, but fears she may never be able to tell him. The demons from her past have come for her... and she may not get out alive.</description>

  <description>Jade Roberts’s love for Talon Steel is the real deal, and she’s more determined than ever to help him come to grips with whatever is haunting him. To that end, she continues her investigation of the Steels…and unknowingly attracts some dangerous foes from their shrouded history. Talon loves Jade deeply and longs to possess her forever, so he faces his worst fears and exposes his rawest wounds in an attempt to heal. The road is icy and treacherous, but if he perseveres and comes out whole on the other side, he’ll finally be worthy of Jade’s love. The untamed passion between the two still blazes, but as the horrors of Talon’s past resurface, Jade and Talon aren’t safe.…</description>

  <description>After being left at the altar, Jade Roberts seeks solace at her best friend's ranch on the Colorado western slope. Her humiliation still ripe, she doesn't expect to be attracted to her friend's reticent brother, but when the gorgeous cowboy kisses her, all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talon Steel is broken. Having never fully healed from a horrific childhood trauma, he simply exists, taking from women what is offered and giving nothing in return...until Jade Roberts catapults into his life. She is beautiful, sweet, and giving, and his desire for her becomes a craving he fears he'll never be able to satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion sizzles between the two lovers...but long-buried secrets haunt them both and may eventually tear them apart.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Reese Witherspoon’s Book Club Pick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lively, sexy, and thought-provoking East-meets-West story about community, friendship, and women’s lives at all ages—a spicy and alluring mix of Together Tea and Calendar Girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman has a secret life . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikki lives in cosmopolitan West London, where she tends bar at the local pub. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she’s spent most of her twenty-odd years distancing herself from the traditional Sikh community of her childhood, preferring a more independent (that is, Western) life. When her father’s death leaves the family financially strapped, Nikki, a law school dropout, impulsively takes a job teaching a "creative writing" course at the community center in the beating heart of London’s close-knit Punjabi community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of a miscommunication, the proper Sikh widows who show up are expecting to learn basic English literacy, not the art of short-story writing. When one of the widows finds a book of sexy stories in English and shares it with the class, Nikki realizes that beneath their white dupattas, her students have a wealth of fantasies and memories. Eager to liberate these modest women, she teaches them how to express their untold stories, unleashing creativity of the most unexpected—and exciting—kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more women are drawn to the class, Nikki warns her students to keep their work secret from the Brotherhood, a group of highly conservative young men who have appointed themselves the community’s "moral police." But when the widows’ gossip offers shocking insights into the death of a young wife—a modern woman like Nikki—and some of the class erotica is shared among friends, it sparks a scandal that threatens them all.</description>

  <description>Jesmyn Ward’s first novel since her National Book Award–winning &lt;i&gt;Salvage the Bones&lt;/i&gt;, this singular American writer brings the archetypal road novel into rural twenty-first-century America. An intimate portrait of a family and an epic tale of hope and struggle, &lt;i&gt;Sing, Unburied, Sing&lt;/i&gt; journeys through Mississippi’s past and present, examining the ugly truths at the heart of the American story and the power—and limitations—of family bonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jojo is thirteen years old and trying to understand what it means to be a man. He doesn’t lack in fathers to study, chief among them his Black grandfather, Pop. But there are other men who complicate his understanding: his absent White father, Michael, who is being released from prison; his absent White grandfather, Big Joseph, who won’t acknowledge his existence; and the memories of his dead uncle, Given, who died as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; His mother, Leonie, is an inconsistent presence in his and his toddler sister’s lives. She is an imperfect mother in constant conflict with herself and those around her. She is Black and her children’s father is White. She wants to be a better mother but can’t put her children above her own needs, especially her drug use. Simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she’s high, Leonie is embattled in ways that reflect the brutal reality of her circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When the children’s father is released from prison, Leonie packs her kids and a friend into her car and drives north to the heart of Mississippi and Parchman Farm, the State Penitentiary. At Parchman, there is another thirteen-year-old boy, the ghost of a dead inmate who carries all of the ugly history of the South with him in his wandering. He too has something to teach Jojo about fathers and sons, about legacies, about violence, about love.</description>

      <![CDATA[Beautifully written, some of the descriptions are poetic and heart-wrenching. I did not have as big of a problem with the ghosts, but Richie’s character was very annoying. My biggest problem was the time aspect of the setting. I didn’t realize the book was modern day until Misty was on her cell....]]>

  <description>It was immediate for Roman. In three thousand years, he’d never lost control of his emotions, or his heart. But the moment he laid eyes on Evelynne Farrow, he knew she was the woman who haunted his dreams. And everything changed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie Farrow has always loved a good vampire romance. In fact, she makes a living writing them. While sitting in a coffee shop and working on her next mega-hot book, Evie is approached by a tall, dark, and handsome man who could have been pulled directly from one of her novels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to her, Roman D’Angelo is exactly what he appears to be – a vampire, and not just any vampire, but the king of vampires. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, while Roman is both ancient and invulnerable, Evie is flesh and blood. Just as Roman decides that he and Evie have a date with destiny, for reasons of their own, an ancient god and a homicidal vampire take an equally strong interest in her. To make things more complicated, there’s something very special about Evie. Something not quite human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Roman fight off the incredible forces that would have Evie as their own long enough to win her heart, or will destiny betray him, and destroy everything he has ever dreamed of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Lalura had told him about her vision. Thirteen kings on a chess board – and thirteen queens….”</description>

  <description>Petite, kind, brilliant, and young, Stevie is nothing like the usual women bodyguard Shen Li is interested in. Even more surprising, the youngest of the lethal, ball-busting, and beautiful MacKilligan sisters is terrified of bears. But she’s not terrified of pandas. She loves pandas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which means that whether Shen wants her to or not, she simply won’t stop cuddling him. He isn’t some stuffed Giant Panda, ya know! He is a Giant Panda shifter. He deserves respect and personal space. Something that little hybrid is completely ignoring.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Stevie has a way of finding trouble. Like going undercover to take down a scientist experimenting on other shifters. For what, Shen doesn’t want to know, but they’d better find out. And fast. Stevie might be the least violent of the honey badger sisters, but she’s the most dangerous to Shen’s peace of mind. Because she has absolutely no idea how much trouble they’re in . . . or just how damn adorable she is.</description>

  <description>It’s not every day that a beautiful naked woman falls out of the sky and lands face-first on grizzly shifter Berg Dunn’s hotel balcony. Definitely they don’t usually hop up and demand his best gun. Berg gives the lady a grizzly-sized t-shirt and his cell phone, too, just on style points. And then she’s gone, taking his XXXL heart with her. By the time he figures out she’s a honey badger shifter, it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Honey badgers are survivors. Brutal, vicious, ill-tempered survivors. Or maybe Charlie Taylor-MacKilligan is just pissed that her useless father is trying to get them all killed again, and won’t even tell her how. Protecting her little sisters has always been her job, and she’s not about to let some pesky giant grizzly protection specialist with a network of every shifter in Manhattan get in her way. Wait. He’s trying to help? Why would he want to do that? He’s cute enough that she just might let him tag along—that is, if he can keep up . . .</description>

  <description>Possessed of an extraordinary telekinetic gift, Dahlia Le Blanc has spent her life isolated from other people. And just when she thinks she's finally achieved some semblance of peace, her well-orchestrated world comes crashing down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a reason she cannot guess, she has become the target of deadly assassins. Suddenly no place is safe--not even the secret refuge she'd established long ago. Now she must rely on Nicolas Trevane--a dangerous warrior sent to track her down and protect her. Together they generate a scorching heat Dahlia never imagined was possible. But can she trust this man with her secrets--especially when some people would kill to get their hands on them?&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>The classified experiment is the brainchild of renowned scientist Peter Whitney and his brilliant daughter, Lily. Created to enhance the psychic abilities of an elite squadron, it can transform their natural mental powers into a unique military weapon. But something goes wrong. In the isolated underground labs, the men have been dying-victims of bizarre accidents. Captain Ryland Miller knows he is next. When Dr. Whitney himself is murdered, Ryland has only one person left to trust: the beautiful Lily. Possessed of an uncanny sixth sense herself, Lily shares Ryland's every new fear, every betrayal, every growing suspicion, and every passionate beat of the heart. Together, they will be drawn deeper into the labyrinth of her father's past and closer to a secret that someone would kill to keep hidden.</description>

  <description>Bullied and battered as a child, Kate Matthews grows up and transforms herself into beautiful and confident, Brandy Alexander, a sexy, high-class call girl. With a select number of rich and successful clients and a jaw dropping income, Kate feels like she’s living her dream being desired and bedded by some of Australia’s most powerful and influential men. But she has one rule. Don’t fall in love. Except the more time she spends with her favorite client Blaine Waymann, the more she fears he might be the one man who could topple the perfect world she’s built. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Billionaire philanthropist Blaine Waymann is determined to break Kate’s rule. He wants exclusive rights to Brandy and Kate, in bed and out, and is willing to risk everything to win her body and her trust. But when Kate starts opening her heart to Blaine, she faces an agonizing decision. Run like she always does, or stay with the man she not only lusts after, but loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The VIP Desire Agency series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1: Lady in Red &lt;br /&gt;Book 2: High Class</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If one must flirt...flirt with danger.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Lessons in the art of espionage aboard Mademoiselle Geraldine's floating dirigible have become tedious without Sophronia's sootie Soap nearby. She would rather thwart dastardly Picklemen, yet her concerns about their wicked intentions are ignored. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can she trust? Royal werewolf dewan? Stylish vampire Lord Akeldama? Only one thing is certain: a large-scale plot is under way. Sophronia must be ready to save her friends, her school, and all of London from disaster.</description>

  <description>Sophronia continues her second year at finishing school in style—with a steel-bladed fan secreted in the folds of her ball gown, of course. Such a fashionable choice of weapon comes in handy when Sophronia, her best friend Dimity, sweet sootie Soap, and the charming Lord Felix Mersey stowaway on a train to return their classmate Sidheag to her werewolf pack in Scotland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one suspected what—or who—they would find aboard that suspiciously empty train. Sophronia uncovers a plot that threatens to throw all of London into chaos and she must decide where her loyalties lie, once and for all.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Does one need four fully grown foxgloves for decorating a dinner table for six guests? Or is it six foxgloves to kill four fully grown guests?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophronia's first year at Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality has certainly been rousing! For one thing, finishing school is training her to be a spy--won't Mumsy be surprised? Furthermore, Sophronia got mixed up in an intrigue over a stolen device and had a cheese pie thrown at her in a most horrid display of poor manners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as she sneaks around the dirigible school, eavesdropping on the teachers' quarters and making clandestine climbs to the ship's boiler room, she learns that there may be more to a field trip to London than is apparent at first. A conspiracy is afoot--one with dire implications for both supernaturals and humans. Sophronia must rely on her training to discover who is behind the dangerous plot-and survive the London Season with a full dance card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel to &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Etiquette &amp;amp; Espionage&lt;/i&gt;, class is back in session with more petticoats and poison, tea trays and treason. Gail's distinctive voice, signature humor, and lush steampunk setting are sure to be the height of fashion this season.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Mothers&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;An American Marriage&lt;/i&gt; in this dazzling debut novel about mothers and daughters, identity and family, and how the relationships that sustain you can also be the ones that consume you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Butler family has had their share of trials—as sisters Althea, Viola, and Lillian can attest—but nothing prepared them for the literal trial that will upend their lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Althea, the eldest sister and substitute matriarch, is a force to be reckoned with and her younger sisters have alternately appreciated and chafed at her strong will. They are as stunned as the rest of the small community when she and her husband Proctor are arrested, and in a heartbeat the family goes from one of the most respected in town to utter disgrace. The worst part is, not even her sisters are sure exactly what happened.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Althea awaits her fate, Lillian and Viola must come together in the house they grew up in to care for their sister’s teenage daughters. What unfolds is a stunning portrait of the heart and core of an American family in a story that is as page-turning as it is important.</description>

  <description>Long retired, Sherlock Holmes quietly pursues his study of honeybee behavior on the Sussex Downs. He never imagines he would encounter anyone whose intellect matched his own, much less an audacious teenage girl with a penchant for detection. Miss Mary Russell becomes Holmes's pupil and quickly hones her talent for deduction, disguises and danger. But when an elusive villain enters the picture, their partnership is put to a real test.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Akata Witch&lt;/i&gt; transports the reader to a magical place where nothing is quite as it seems. Born in New York, but living in Aba, Nigeria, twelve-year old Sunny is understandably a little lost. She is albino and thus, incredibly sensitive to the sun. All Sunny wants to do is be able to play football and get through another day of school without being bullied. But once she befriends Orlu and Chichi, Sunny is plunged in to the world of the Leopard People, where your worst defect becomes your greatest asset. Together, Sunny, Orlu, Chichi and Sasha form the youngest ever Oha Coven. Their mission is to track down Black Hat Otokoto, the man responsible for kidnapping and maiming children. Will Sunny be able to overcome the killer with powers stronger than her own, or will the future she saw in the flames become reality?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a world so dark and seductive, expect nothing less than a triple-cross in the explosive all-new Ghostwalker novel by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Christine Feehan… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an underground club, a high-ranking public official spends his secret nights indulging in fantasies as exciting as they are depraved. For a seductive employee of the Dungeon, it’s her job to fulfill them. But she’s playing a far more dangerous game—one of blackmail, politics, and murder that reaches into the shadow world of the Ghostwalkers, and the creation of a spectacular, one-of-a-kind new weapon of defense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a dictator makes his own catastrophic moves, the Ghostwalkers have no choice but to bring in two major players—a man and woman both driven by passion and revenge. Both expendable. Both with nothing left to lose.&lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the #1 international best seller &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Spider's Web:&lt;/i&gt; the new book in the Millennium series, which began with Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisbeth Salander - the girl with the dragon tattoo, the brilliant hacker, the obstinate outsider, the volatile seeker of justice for herself and others - has never been able to uncover the most telling facts of her traumatic childhood, the secrets that might finally, fully explain her to herself. Now, when she sees a chance to uncover them once and for all, she enlists the help of Mikael Blomkvist, the editor of the muckraking, investigative journal &lt;i&gt;Millennium&lt;/i&gt;. And nothing will stop her - not the anti-Muslim gang she enrages by rescuing a young woman from their brutality; not the deadly reach from inside the Russian mafia of her long-lost twin sister, Camilla; and not the people who will do anything to keep buried knowledge of a sinister pseudo-scientific experiment known only as The Registry. Once again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, together, are the fierce heart of a thrilling full-tilt novel that takes on some of the most insidious problems facing the world at this very moment.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Amy Poehler’s &lt;em&gt;Yes Please, &lt;/em&gt;Lena Dunham’s &lt;em&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/em&gt;, and Roxane Gay's &lt;em&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/em&gt;, a powerful collection of essays about gender, sexuality, race, beauty, Hollywood, and what it means to be a modern woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One month before the release of the highly anticipated film &lt;em&gt;The Birth of a Nation,&lt;/em&gt; actress Gabrielle Union shook the world with a vulnerable and impassioned editorial in which she urged our society to have compassion for victims of sexual violence. In the wake of rape allegations made against director and actor Nate Parker, Union—a forty-four-year-old actress who launched her career with roles in iconic ’90s movies—instantly became the insightful, outspoken actress that Hollywood has been desperately awaiting. With honesty and heartbreaking wisdom, she revealed her own trauma as a victim of sexual assault: "It is for you that I am speaking. This is real. We are real." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this moving collection of thought provoking essays infused with her unique wisdom and deep humor, Union uses that same fearlessness to tell astonishingly personal and true stories about power, color, gender, feminism, and fame. Union tackles a range of experiences, including bullying, beauty standards, and competition between women in Hollywood, growing up in white California suburbia and then spending summers with her black relatives in Nebraska, coping with crushes, puberty, and the divorce of her parents. Genuine and perceptive, Union bravely lays herself bare, uncovering a complex and courageous life of self-doubt and self-discovery with incredible poise and brutal honesty. Throughout, she compels us to be ethical and empathetic, and reminds us of the importance of confidence, self-awareness, and the power of sharing truth, laughter, and support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From stand-up comedian, actress, and breakout star of &lt;i&gt;Girls Trip&lt;/i&gt;, Tiffany Haddish, comes&lt;i&gt; The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt;, a sidesplitting, hysterical, edgy, and unflinching collection of (extremely) personal essays, as fearless as the author herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in one of the poorest neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles, Tiffany learned to survive by making people laugh. If she could do that, then her classmates would let her copy their homework, the other foster kids she lived with wouldn’t beat her up, and she might even get a boyfriend. Or at least she could make enough money—as the paid school mascot and in-demand Bar Mitzvah hype woman—to get her hair and nails done, so then she might get a boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; None of that worked (and she’s still single), but it allowed Tiffany to imagine a place for herself where she could do something she loved for a living: comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tiffany can’t avoid being funny—it’s just who she is, whether she’s plotting shocking, jaw-dropping revenge on an ex-boyfriend or learning how to handle her newfound fame despite still having a broke person’s mind-set. Finally poised to become a household name, she recounts with heart and humor how she came from nothing and nowhere to achieve her dreams by owning, sharing, and using her pain to heal others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By turns hilarious, filthy, and brutally honest, &lt;i&gt;The Last Black Unicorn&lt;/i&gt; shows the world who Tiffany Haddish really is—humble, grateful, down-to-earth, and funny as hell. And now, she’s ready to inspire others through the power of laughter.</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. In this deft exploration of love, loyalty, race, justice, and both Black masculinity and Black womanhood in 21st century America, Jones achieves that most-elusive of all literary goals: the Great American Novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named an Oprah’s Book Club Selection.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this gripping page-turner, an ex-agent on the run from her former employers must take one more case to clear her name and save her life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used to work for the U.S. government, but very few people ever knew that. An expert in her field, she was one of the darkest secrets of an agency so clandestine it doesn't even have a name. And when they decided she was a liability, they came for her without warning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she rarely stays in the same place or uses the same name for long. They've killed the only other person she trusted, but something she knows still poses a threat. They want her dead, and soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her former handler offers her a way out, she realizes it's her only chance to erase the giant target on her back. But it means taking one last job for her ex-employers. To her horror, the information she acquires only makes her situation more dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resolving to meet the threat head-on, she prepares for the toughest fight of her life but finds herself falling for a man who can only complicate her likelihood of survival. As she sees her choices being rapidly whittled down, she must apply her unique talents in ways she never dreamed of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tautly plotted novel, Meyer creates a fierce and fascinating new heroine with a very specialized skill set. And she shows once again why she's one of the world's bestselling authors.</description>

  <description>When editor Susan Ryeland is given the manuscript of Alan Conway’s latest novel, she has no reason to think it will be much different from any of his others. After working with the bestselling crime writer for years, she’s intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus Pünd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy English villages. An homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers, Alan’s traditional formula has proved hugely successful. So successful that Susan must continue to put up with his troubling behavior if she wants to keep her job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conway’s latest tale has Atticus Pünd investigating a murder at Pye Hall, a local manor house. Yes, there are dead bodies and a host of intriguing suspects, but the more Susan reads, the more she’s convinced that there is another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript: one of real-life jealousy, greed, ruthless ambition, and murder.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A propulsive new thriller about the obsessive nature of love when an intensifying relationship between best friends is disrupted by a kidnapping.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up as best friends in small-town New Hampshire, Jon and Chloe are the only ones who truly understand each other, though they can never find the words to tell one another the depth of their feelings. When Jon is finally ready to confess his feelings, he's suddenly kidnapped by his substitute teacher who is obsessed with H.P. Lovecraft and has a plot to save humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mourning the disappearance of Jon and facing the reality he may never return, Chloe tries to navigate the rites of entering young adulthood and "fit in" with the popular crowd, but thoughts of Jon are never far away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jon finally escapes, he discovers he now has an uncontrollable power that endangers anyone he has intense feelings for. He runs away to protect Chloe and find the answers to his new identity—but he's soon being tracked by a detective who is fascinated by a series of vigilante killings that appear connected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whisking us on a journey through New England and crashing these characters' lives together in the most unexpected ways, Kepnes explores the complex relationship between love and identity, unrequited passion and obsession, self-preservation and self-destruction, and how the lines are often blurred between the two.</description>

  <description>In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a &lt;i&gt;Tätowierer&lt;/i&gt; (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for more than two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, &lt;i&gt;The Tattooist of Auschwitz&lt;/i&gt; is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.</description>

  <description>This is how a family keeps a secret…and how that secret ends up keeping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how a family lives happily ever after…until happily ever after becomes complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how children change…and then change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Claude. He’s five years old, the youngest of five brothers, and loves peanut butter sandwiches. He also loves wearing a dress, and dreams of being a princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he grows up, Claude says, he wants to be a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosie and Penn want Claude to be whoever Claude wants to be. They’re just not sure they’re ready to share that with the world. Soon the entire family is keeping Claude’s secret. Until one day it explodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is How It Always Is is a novel about revelations, transformations, fairy tales, and family. And it’s about the ways this is how it always is: Change is always hard and miraculous and hard again, parenting is always a leap into the unknown with crossed fingers and full hearts, children grow but not always according to plan. And families with secrets don’t get to keep them forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"This is a novel everyone should read. It’s brilliant. It’s bold. And it’s time.” &lt;br /&gt;―Elizabeth George, &lt;i&gt;#1 New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Banquet of Consequences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful new statement about feminism today--written as a letter to a friend. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele &lt;/i&gt;is Adichie's letter of response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions--compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive--for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can "allow" women to have full careers, &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele&lt;/i&gt; goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.</description>

  <description>Northern California, during the violent end of the 1960s. At the start of summer, a lonely and thoughtful teenager, Evie Boyd, sees a group of girls in the park, and is immediately caught by their freedom, their careless dress, their dangerous aura of abandon. Soon, Evie is in thrall to Suzanne, a mesmerizing older girl, and is drawn into the circle of a soon-to-be infamous cult and the man who is its charismatic leader. Hidden in the hills, their sprawling ranch is eerie and run down, but to Evie, it is exotic, thrilling, charged—a place where she feels desperate to be accepted. As she spends more time away from her mother and the rhythms of her daily life, and as her obsession with Suzanne intensifies, Evie does not realize she is coming closer and closer to unthinkable violence, and to that moment in a girl’s life when everything can go horribly wrong.</description>

  <description>Stitching together girlhood memories with the finest threads of innocence, feminist intellectual bell hooks presents a powerfully intimate account of growing up in the South. A memoir of ideas and perceptions, &lt;i&gt;Bone Black&lt;/i&gt; shows the unfolding of female creativity and one strong-spirited child's journey toward becoming a writer. She learns early on the roles women and men play in society, as well as the emotional vulnerability of children. She sheds new light on a society that beholds the joys of marriage for men and condemns anything more than silence for women. In this world, too, black is a woman's color—worn when earned—daughters and daddies are strangers under the same roof, and crying children are often given something to cry about. hooks finds good company in solitude, good company in books. She also discovers, in the motionless body of misunderstanding, that writing is her most vital breath.</description>

  <description>It is a boiling hot Boston summer. Adding to the city's woes is a series of shocking crimes, in which wealthy men are made to watch while their wives are brutalized. A sadistic demand that ends in abduction and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pattern suggests one man: serial killer Warren Hoyt, recently removed from the city's streets. Police can only assume an acolyte is at large, a maniac basing his attacks on the twisted medical techniques of the madman he so admires. At least that's what Detective Jane Rizzoli thinks. Forced again to confront the killer who scarred her - literally and figuratively - she is determined to finally end Hoyt's awful influence . . . even if it means receiving more resistance from her all-male homicide squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rizzoli isn't counting on the U.S. government's sudden interest. Or on meeting Special Agent Gabriel Dean, who knows more than he will tell. Most of all, she isn't counting on becoming a target herself, once Hoyt is suddenly free, joining his mysterious blood brother in a vicious vendetta. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with superbly created characters and the medical and police procedural details that are her trademark,The Apprentice is Tess Gerritsen at her brilliant best. Set in a stunning world where evil is easy to learn and hard to end, this is a thriller by a master who could teach other authors a thing or two.</description>

  <description>Stranded on Earth by deception, Zeva has no intention of becoming the alien on display to her human captors. Escape isn't just a dream, it's a basic need of survival. Nothing and no one will stop her from breaking her own chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on Alcandar, more than her home and family wait for her. There, when minds brush, details fall away from the reality of binding fever. And an initial mind brush with Zeva was all it took for Ravid and Keenan, the men who threaten her freedom once more, to know what she is desperate to avoid—she is their mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Earth isn't the only planet that harbors evil. Even on Alcandar, men of no honor threaten the perfection her fantasies promised. Evil can rip a life to shreds in mere seconds, leaving you reaching for the one thing you were certain you did not want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freedom comes with a high price tag, and may cost Zeva the two men who are part of her soul. Ravid and Keenan are more than her mates—they hold her heart as well and she has no intention of letting anyone keep her away from them.</description>

  <description>Jessica's love life is a mess. She wants a man who will love her, make her heart pound with desire and her body melt from passion. Marriage is in there too, but finding the right guy is turning out to be mission impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumping Mr. Wrong, she heads to her cabin in the mountains, hardly expecting to be swept off her feet and out of this world—literally—into the arms of the sexiest man she's ever met. What she isn't prepared for is to get the man of her dreams—in duplicate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan and Jett don't care which planet they discover their mate on, only that they find the woman who will complete them both. And when Dylan touches Jessica's mind and body, he knows it is his mate he holds in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jessica is about to find her personal taboos stretched to the limit by these two sexy, powerful warriors. Offering her everything she ever wanted from a man, she finds out that sometimes what you wished for is a whole lot more than you can handle. But an Alcandian warrior never gives up until the battle is won…</description>

But that leaves him with a woman under his roof whom he can't ignore, and not just because she's his enemy's daughter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A woman who's as much trouble as she is temptation...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shannon McBoyd decides to use her captor to experience passion for the first time, and then to destroy him. But her plan goes awry because once she has lured Torin into her bed, she no longer wants to hurt the one man who seems to value and understand her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if her father will kill him-and her-when he discovers what they've done...</description>
