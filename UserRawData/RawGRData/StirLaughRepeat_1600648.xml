  <description>As if communicating with the dead isn't strange enough, Ripley Van Raden does it mostly via text message. Good thing she has the unlimited data package with her cell phone provider. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Librarian by day and haunted tour guide by night. Rip, as her friends call her, discovers books that possibly contain secret messages. When a young girl is murdered, Rip has to put her sleuthing skills to the test. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the help of part-time paranormal investigator and full-time handsome police officer Brannon Landon, they must work together to solve this potentially paranormal related crime. Brannon and Rip can't let an ex-wife, dark entities, stalkers, or defaced library books stand in their way.</description>

  <description>Hired by millionaire businessman Malcolm Capshaw to search for a fabled historical artifact in the shadows of Glastonbury Tor, Joe Cutler and his team from Strata Survey Systems are drawn into a web of sex, lies, deceit, murder, and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The artifact is revealed to be bogus, and the real purpose of their search is slowly exposed. A menacing background presence, in the form of an old-established London crime family, appears to display an abnormal interest in the goings-on in the ancient town where Christianity laid its roots in England. There, aided by the enigmatic and flamboyant university professor Lucius Doberman, Joe and his team must solve the mystery of Glastonbury before the sinister historian Walter Graves makes the discovery that could cost him and the whole team their lives.</description>

  <description>Life in the upscale Los Angeles area community of the Venice Canals takes an ominous turn when retired doctor Al Shady and his wife Barbara Shady, Vice President and Treasurer of the Venice Canals HOA, disappear after a meeting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cops are on it, but looking in all the wrong places. What appeared to be home invasion and kidnapping turns out to be so much more including murder. Get ready for characters from different books in this series to come together to dig the dirt. As fate would have it, advertising agency owner Cameron Harson from GETTING EVEN and RIPOFF-- the first and second book in this series--and former FBI agent turned author Danny Garrett from BUMPING OFF FAT VINNY, the fourth book, are neighbors who didn't know each other. A mutual friend and neighbor--89-year-old retired Colonel Michael Thompson introduces them at an HOA meeting where the main focus was to celebrate the settlement of a multi-million dollar suit for construction default against developers who built mini-mansions and polluted the canals in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the trio walks home together along Grand Canal, accompanied by the Colonel's aged Afghan Hound Clarence, something looks suspicious at the Shady home on the other side of the canal. They cross over the bridge to investigate and find the house door ajar, the house is in a shambles and the Shadys are missing. With their backgrounds in investigating crimes, they are tempted to see what they can uncover, but should they? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Cameron's friend Kate Steele, CEO of FraudBusters, who is visiting from San Francisco and Danny's friend, co-author and fellow sleuth Margaret Stanton, how can they resist? They delve into things that the cops won't, and they find plenty but in the process risk getting in the way of Federal agencies! Twists and turns make this a fun meeting of the minds with a surprise ending.</description>

  <description>The journey of life. We all go through it. Matthew Davis went down a different one than most of us. Horse racing, computers, divorce, and food. Food especially, led him down a path of self destruction. What happens when a thirty-something man who is addicted to betting on the horses gets divorced? Will he have the self-discipline to move on? Spending hours upon hours alone in his small condo wasting his life on the horse racing forum that has become his only social involvement, Bang-Bang Man leads a life that no one should. Can he change the course his life is on? Will there be anyone who can help him cope? Will he ever realize just how important people are to each other?</description>

  <description>Agnes Lockwood returns to Tyneside after spending a few months abroad. On her first visit, she gained quite the reputation as an amateur sleuth, as she helped the police solve a murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she is simply looking forward to meeting again with Alan Johnson, a DCI with the Newcastle police force. Having missed him while she was away, she is hoping their relationship will continue to blossom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on her first day back in the city, she gets caught up in another murder. This time, her intrusion into the police investigation pushes Alan Johnson’s patience to the very limit.</description>

  <description>If ever a whole town could be haunted, Devil's Moon, Kentucky would be that town. Ripley Van Raden, or Rip as her friends call her, has come back to her hometown to start her own ghost tour business. That’s not her only career path though. Librarian by day, and ghost tour guide by night, Rip is ready to take on the ghosts following her around and the mysterious residents who show up for more than the tour in the Devil’s Moon Cemetery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her first day on the job as librarian, Ripley finds a dead body and a ghost who can only communicate through electronics. Who knew ghosts could send text messages? To make things even more complicated, Ripley meets a hot cop who happens to also be a ghost hunter. She doesn’t know if Brannon Landon is interested in helping her or just around for the paranormal activity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Rip discovers threatening notes between the pages of a novel, she must solve the library patron’s mysterious death before she unwillingly joins the other side of her haunted tour. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Just because she can see the dead doesn’t mean Verity Long wants to spend her days hunting ghosts. Instead, she’s over the moon to land a marketing job at the local bank… until she finds her new boss dead in the vault. Even her ghost friend, Frankie, knows that's no way to start a career. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Relieved to let the police take charge, Verity steps aside, bound and determined to keep her ghost sightings to herself. But when she learns the main suspect in the murder is a very crooked, very dead mobster, Verity knows it's up to her to solve the case. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She teams up with her ghostly gangster buddy Frankie, as well as the irresistible and charming Ellis, as the three of them search haunted mob hideouts, hidden passageways, and historic cemeteries for the facts behind the heist of the century — and a modern-day motive for murder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad uncovering the truth could very well make Verity the next victim...</description>

  <description>The wreckage of a World War II plane is found in the mountains of Appalachia. It mysteriously crashed in 1943 on its way to a naval base. Inside the plane is a note, written by Annie Tillery's great-grandmother, Charlotte, who was in love with a fighter pilot. Young Charlotte tested the planes and flew them to naval bases; her fiance flew the planes in battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While investigating the crash site, NCIS finds the note in the plane, which they trace to Charlotte and then to her surviving family members, Annie and her mother Carol. The mystery begins. Why did the plane crash, and what does Charlotte's note mean? Annie and her mother decide to dig into Great-Grandmother's past by way of the aged family attic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, they find love letters written by Charlotte and her Navy pilot fiance. There is a code to be broken in those letters and The Mystery of the Lost Avenger to be solved. As they explore, Annie suspects Charlotte's ghost is reaching out to tell her something, but what? She enlists the help of her boyfriend, newly licensed pilot Ty Egan, but Annie feels she may be the key to her great-grandmother's top-secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>She found her! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jess saw Roxanne in one of her visions. Ben was wrong and the odd-ball sisters-in-law, believe it or not, were right—Roxanne wasn’t dead! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But where Jess saw her she could never come home from. She was as good as dead to Ben, because Roxanne couldn’t be his wife again, ever. If only Jess could find a way to make him understand, but he wouldn’t even listen to her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amber, Ben’s 4 year old autistic daughter was in trouble. Her development regressed drastically and Jess hoped it wouldn’t be permanent. Trying to take the child away from the influence of her aunts, she found that she couldn’t leave the house. She, and Amber, were trapped at Weltevreden. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Was this what Ether, the old housekeeper, meant on the day Jess arrived when she told her Jess would never leave again? The sisters wanted to do her in, but she was trapped and at their mercy? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then Ether decided that she was living her final day, and that there was one more thing she had to do. Can a person do that? Can when decide when it was time to die? And what was the last thing she had to do? And after she was gone… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Would the sisters’ plan for Ben and Amber finally be revealed?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Seven-million dollars' worth of missing gems bring Carrie Singleton's long-lost and larcenous dad back into her life and it's up to Carrie to clear his name.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A devoted dad is as precious as diamonds, but Carrie Singleton wouldn't know since her dad Jim's been on the lam most of her life. In an unusual family reunion, she finds Jim breaking into her cottage in the middle of the night. The fun really starts when he begs her to help him recover his half of a seven-million-dollar gem heist he pulled off with the local jeweler, Benton Parr. When she refuses, Jim takes off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie finds her father again behind bars for the recent murder of Benton Parr. Who made the connection? Unbeknownst to her, Carrie's boyfriend Dylan, an insurance investigator, has been searching for the gems. Determined to find the jewels herself, she starts examining every facet of Parr's life. She turns up a treasure trove of suspects, one of whom bashes her on the head as she's searching the victim's country cabin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retreating to the quiet confines of the library where she works, Carrie watches as Smokey Joe, the resident cat, paws at a hole in the wall. Is he after the library's ghost Evelyn, or something shinier?</description>

  <description>Recently widowed Agnes Lockwood is spending a few days on Tyneside in Northeast England, keen on catching up with her past. But after only a few days at the hotel, an expensive item of jewelry is stolen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more jewelry goes missing, Chief Inspector Alan Johnson is assigned to the case. During the investigation, Alan recognizes Agnes as a friend from schooldays and they rekindle their friendship – with Agnes bombarding him with questions about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having dinner together one evening, they find a body lying on the roadside. Fearing for her safety, Alan warns Agnes to stay away from the case: theft is one thing, but murder is something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being an inquisitive woman, Agnes can’t resist getting involved... too involved.</description>

  <description>The Roxanne's Ghost Saga is set against the backdrop of modern day South Africa. It is a complex ghost story of identical twin sisters’ love for the same man. There will ultimately be three books in the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the theme? Nothing is what it seems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, we move into the realms of the mists of time that could either reveal or conceal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book 1, Goodbye, My Love, sets the scene. It introduces country vet, Ben, his four-year-old autistic daughter and the would-be nanny, Jessica James. Jess’ interview with Ben for the nanny position takes place on Friday the 13th. An attraction between the two is immediate, which by all accounts isn't entirely normal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ben's three oddball sisters-in-law descend on him for the anniversary of his wife Roxanne's death. They try to convince Ben that Roxanne isn't dead, more than likely to put an end to whatever might develop between Ben and Jessica. But Ben knows that no one could ever have survived what led to Roxanne’s death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His daughter is supposed to be autistic, but only sometimes does she display the symptoms that led to her diagnosis. As Ben has often said: Autism is not a disease, it's a condition. Symptoms can't be turned on and off at will. So…what is it with the child?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben's wife's twin sister, Millicent, brings a psychic with her to Ben's home in order to help them find Roxanne. Only, Daemon wears dresses and a half-moon shaped earring. Who would take him seriously? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, his wife’s twin isn't happy to find Jess already in Ben's house—trouble is imminent. But only as far as Ethel, Ben's ancient housekeeper, will allow her to. What does the housekeeper know that will keep Millicent's ruffled feathers under control?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where is Roxanne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye, My Love will be available on 29 May 2017.</description>

  <description>When reality TV turns to murder, it's sink, swim or die. Ambitious personal trainer Cassidy Novak has gained national fame for starring on Sink or Swim, nicknamed SOS, a hit reality game show set aboard a Tall Ship. She hopes the prize money will help to launch her dream of owning a chain of fitness centers. Not only does she lose the competition and have to walk the plank in the finale, after the game show ends, the terror begins. Upon returning to her small Massachusetts hometown, Cassidy discovers she has attracted a stalker masterminding his own twisted game. She struggles to focus on her health club job and celebrity endorsement opportunities, but her stalker has other plans. As her former competitors get knocked off one-by-one, Cassidy refuses to play by his bizarre rules.She's also being shadowed by hunky photographer Zach Gallagher, who has been assigned to capture her personal moments for a spread in the local newspaper. She wants to trust Zach, but fears he may not be the nice guy that he seems. With or without Zach's help, when the stalker forces a showdown by threatening her family, Cassidy must once again walk the plank - this time for her life.</description>

L.

  <description>A large corporation is seizing land by eminent domain. Syd Cranzler stands in its way, threatening a court battle. After a heated meeting with the corporation representative, Syd is found dead from an overdose of heart medication. The police call it suicide. Case closed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Father Frank, Syd’s pastor, and Georgia Peitz, another member of his church, don’t believe Syd committed suicide and begin to look for clues to what really happened. Will this affect Georgia’s romantic interest in the lead detective?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the priest is almost poisoned, they convince the police to investigate further. Immediately, Father Frank becomes the target of rumors and speculation he might have had something to do with Syd’s death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more clues Father Frank and Georgia uncover, the more danger they find themselves in. Can they find the real killer before they become victims?</description>

  <description>After a construction worker unearths a human skull on the campus of the University of Mississippi dating to the 1960s, an older woman’s desperate attempt to erase history counts down the five manners of death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Diana Bratton is a surgeon surrounded by bodies after the discovery of her Aunt Phoebe’s 50-year-old note detailing the manners of death. Suicide, accident, natural cause, and one death classified undetermined are soon crossed off this list—leaving Diana to believe that only murder remains. When Diana spots photographs in a 1966 university yearbook, Phoebe is linked not only to that death, but to the recent deaths of two local men. Diana is torn between pursuing Phoebe’s innocence and accepting police theory that her aunt is involved in the murder of several men she knew in college. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In “The Five Manners of Death,” Dr. Diana Bratton steals precious time from her young daughter, her surgical practice, and her hopes for renewed romance to clear Aunt Phoebe’s name of multiple murder and uncover the significance of the list. Even as Diana searches Phoebe’s home basement for evidence, she works to trump the police and outrun the conspiracy between her ex-husband and Phoebe’s long-time lover—her quest to expose the truth overshadowed by a need to rebury the past. Even though she realizes there is a chance to save her shrinking family, Diana understands that of the five ways to die, murder is her family secret.</description>

  <description>California archaeology student Chione Ini-Herit has vivid dreams about the discovery of an opulent tomb. After learning that Chione's dreams are playing out in Egypt, the founder of the California Institute of Archaeology accepts an offer to examine a mysterious site in Valley of the Queens. When they discover a tomb, things begin to unravel. Magical spells encoded into the hieroglyphs on the tomb's walls transport Chione and her former boyfriend, fellow archaeologist Aaron Ashby, back 3,500 years to ancient Egypt. Even stranger, Aaron and Chione begin to morph into Tutankhamon and Tauret, a priestess in Pharaoh's Court, after learning that Tauret coded the magical spells into the hieroglyphs to keep her and Pharaoh irrevocably joined in the afterlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When other team members speak the spells aloud, they, too, are affected in unfathomable ways by the Ka, the spirit of the entombed person. Chione and Aaron learn that Tauret has conjured powerful spells to provide Tutankhamon with a living heir, and Tauret has chosen Chione and Aaron to complete her destiny.</description>

  <description>IN THE WEEDS is a boisterous ‘70s tale of gas, grass, ass…and Vietnam. While serving there as an Air Force pilot, Slats Kisov directs bombing runs from a plane so small that the armament doubles if a passenger climbs in wearing a shoulder holster. Slats returns to the US a changed man, one determined to live a life of harmless banditry from the cockpit of an airplane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War has left Slats something of an adrenaline junkie and, using his exceptional low-and-slow flying skills, he begins to smuggle marijuana into Florida from the Bahamas. He is aided in this venture by his friends the Morales brothers, members of an improbable family of immigrants seeking their own unique form of artistic freedom. They’re moral people…who just also happen to be money launderers, gun molls, and poetry-spouting bulimic Cuban marijuana farmers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slats generally enjoys good fortune as he strolls through life, but his luck takes the occasional appalling turn. Much of the trouble comes from Bobby Ray Pistle, police chief of Farth. He’s the sort of man who considers the Klan an upstanding civic organization, and he views Slats as nothing more than a Hebraic hippie who prefers the company of minorities to that of paler folk. The chief soon comes to suspect that Slats is smuggling the same weed he’s been smoking, though Pistle’s bulb burns too dimly to find proof. But when the chief discovers his lusty ex has fallen for Slats, it’s time to fish or cut bait. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slats fights many battles – with the Viet Cong, hijackers, PTSD, and mother nature herself – but no enemy proves more perilous than the chief.</description>

  <description>To the memory of Ruth Swerdloff, whose journey you are about to take.&lt;br /&gt;Many people fall into routines that require them to do the same thing, the same way, everyday. They get up, go to work and perform the same job, read the same types of books—never changing anything. When they are forced to vary from their routines, some people often find it difficult, or virtually impossible. People, not just seniors, who take part in different activities each day give their minds a chance to workout, which may reduce their risk of developing dementia. This book is dedicated to all those whose memories are precious, whose lives have been drastically changed, and whose families I hope after reading this book will understand the huge undertaking and commitment they are making when they decide to become a caregiver. In my heart and soul, I hope someday a cure or a preventive will be found for Alzheimer’s disease. I dedicate this book to my mom, Ruth Swerdloff, who gave me the courage to be the person I am today, and taught me the true meanings of courage and survival.</description>

  <description>Sam Rockwell is a fledgling private investigator specializing in Returns, or, recently deceased ghosts with unfinished business. After his no-nonsense father is murdered and comes back, Sam takes the case hoping for a big break and a chance to win the heart of his Girl Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short on experience and long on the swagger of the dog-eared pulp fiction he keeps in his desk, Rockwell sets out to find his father’s killer only to find himself caught up in a deadly game of Cold War Intrigue at its most horrific as the Doomsday Clock inches closer to permanent midnight in this witty throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood noire.</description>

  <description>James Murray is a young man with a dream -- he wants to be a writer just like his idol, Dashiell Hammett. While working as a clerk at a swank downtown department store, James pens a novel that turns out to be a surprise success. Now, he’s the junior screenwriter at a major Hollywood studio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During his time there, productions at the studio have been plagued by a series of mysterious accidents including fires, damage to costumes, theft of miniatures used for trick shots -- and the worst: theft of an important scene from the studio’s big picture, "King Kong." Not wanting to attract too much attention by calling the police, head of production Merian C. Cooper enlists James’s help in trying to find out what’s behind the sabotage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Sabotage at RKO Studio," and its predecessor "Murder at Eastern Columbia," are unlike any other books you've read: Not a single novel, it's two parallel novels, featuring two heroes, working two mysteries in two different versions of 1930s Hollywood. Join James and his alter ego as they each try to find the saboteurs behind the “accidents.” His hard-boiled alter ego -- neither a private detective nor a police officer: just someone "who wants to help" -- needs to find out who's trying to pin the “accidents” on him. Two men in two stories work their way through 1930s Hollywood following clews, interviewing people who might know something, going from location to location, with one goal in mind: find out who might want to damage the studio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, they meet a rich cast of characters including a glamorous movie star; a poor Mexican girl working as a secretary in a bank; a mysterious blonde secretary who harbors a deadly secret; the intriguing Mexican girl from a very wealthy family who still mourns the death of her brother; the silent-screen star who left movies to marry into oil; a handsome young police officer just trying to do his job; and the pretty, young girl who gives tours at the Richfield Oil Building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Sabotage at RKO Studio" is filled with twists, turns and a final scene at a glamorous Hollywood movie premiere at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come along for the ride in this, the second James Murray mystery: the story of a young man who dreams of something better.</description>

  <description>Carrie Singleton is just about done with Clover Ridge, Connecticut until she's offered a job as the head of programs and events at the spooky local library, complete with its own librarian ghost. Her first major event is a program presented by a retired homicide detective, Al Buckley, who claims he knows who murdered Laura Foster, a much-loved part-time library aide who was bludgeoned to death fifteen years earlier. As he invites members of the audience to share stories about Laura, he suddenly keels over and dies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medical examiner reveals that poison is what did him in and Carrie feels responsible for having surged forward with the program despite pushback from her director. Driven by guilt, Carrie's determined to discover who murdered the detective, convinced it's the same man who killed Laura all those years ago. Luckily for Carrie, she has a friendly, knowledgeable ghost by her side. But as she questions the shadows surrounding Laura's case, disturbing secrets come to light and with each step Carrie takes, she gets closer to ending up like Al. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's due or die for Carrie in &lt;i&gt;Death Overdue&lt;/i&gt;, the delightful first in a new cozy series by Allison Brook.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The sun is out. Your little boy is smiling. The next time you look… he’s gone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lana Cross would do anything to protect her perfect family but on a trip to an adventure park, they slip out of her sight. When she finds her husband, he’s out cold on the forest floor. Then the truth sinks in: Cooper, her four-year-old son, is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one stopped the man carrying the sleeping boy. The park cameras don’t show where he went. Then Lana receives an anonymous message, telling her to visit a local school with a horrifying history...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is no random attack.&lt;/b&gt; Whoever took Cooper is playing a twisted game, and if Lana wants to find him, she must participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could there be a link between the school and her missing son? And can Lana find her little boy before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestseller Angie Fox, the second book in the new &lt;i&gt;Southern Ghost Hunter Mysteries&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A haunted library is no place for a girl who can see ghosts, but when Verity Long stumbles on a dead body in the middle of the main reading room, she has to believe someone… even a dead someone… must have witnessed the crime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her ghostly sidekick Frankie warns her to stay out of it. The very alive, very handsome deputy sheriff, Ellis Wydell, inadvertently places her directly in the middle of it. And her ex-fiancé, Ellis’s brother, is back with an agenda of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Undaunted, Verity presses forward, uncovering scandalous secrets, long-forgotten ghosts, and a shocking trail of clues that places her directly in the path of a killer.</description>

  <description>A nearly flawless museum robbery, a missing million-dollar necklace, a stalled police investigation. For the victim of the crime, the situation calls for desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope Fitzpatrick wasn’t born to wealth. Her grandfather fed the family by selling his small stash of gemstones smuggled from tsarist Russia when the monarchy fell. Now, Pen has done well for herself as a successful novelist. But when the final jewel in her family legacy becomes the target of a cunning band of thieves, and the priceless piece is stolen, the police have many excuses why they can’t solve the crime. Not one to accept defeat, Pen does the only thing she can do—gather a group of friends to help catch the crooks and steal back the necklace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It becomes apparent the thief is a master con man who is likely working with an international theft ring. The chase takes the Ladies far from home and into elegant European enclaves as they attempt to face him down. Close calls and near misses—it’s never quite certain whether the women will be able to pull their own spectacular heist and see justice done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Janet Evanovich and Jana DeLeon will love this daring and spunky group of women friends in their first mystery caper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Connie Shelton’s previous novels:&lt;br /&gt;“Readers can only hope the likable characters, fast-paced plots and local color will continue …” –Albuquerque Journal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Down to earth and very readable.” –Library Journal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“…a delightfully complex mystery.” –Romantic Times (4 out 5 five stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Connie Shelton gets better with every book she writes.” –The Midwest Book Review</description>

  <description>This is the true story of a sensationalized murder case told by Cheryl Pierson Cuccio and Rob Cuccio after nearly thirty years of silence. What really happened to Cheryl and Rob before, during and after Cheryl Pierson, a sixteen-year-old sexually, physically and mentally abused teen, hired a classmate to kill her father for $1,000 in 1986?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case was in the national media for many years. In 1988 a New York Times reporter wrote A Deadly Silence, a successful true crime book about this case using an investigative journalism style. It also became a TV movie. As a traumatized sixteen year old, Cheryl only gave one short interview 30 years ago, so much of what was reported in the media, book and movie was fabrication and speculation. Some accounts implied she lied about the abuse, others that she did it for her father’s insurance, but Cheryl remained silent for years—too young and destroyed to fight back against the speculation and frequent falsehoods or to discuss the true dark nature of the nightmare she lived every day of her young life. After her release from jail, she and her high school boyfriend, Rob Cuccio were married, they had two daughters and led as normal a life as possible. Most friends and neighbors had no idea of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout her life, Cheryl has suffered from PTSD and other symptoms as a result of her father’s abuse and his subsequent murder, but the story doesn’t end there. People often wonder what happened next, or where are they now, because this case continues to hold a fascination. Two episodes are scheduled on Discovery ID channel in early 2017.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not fiction and is not sugar-coated. It is the story of their life to the present, and everything is backed by documentation. Cheryl hopes through finally telling the truth about what drove her to murder in her own words, it will help other abuse victims and encourage them to speak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Cheryl’s forty-third birthday, May 14, 2012, after months of misdiagnosed chest pain and other symptoms, Rob Cuccio, her husband of 25 years, suffered a fatal heart attack. Doctors pronounced him dead after thirty minutes, but he’d saved Cheryl’s life for so many years, even when she wanted to commit suicide, that now she knew in her heart she couldn’t live without him. She had to do everything possible to save him. Over the years through Rob’s love, understanding and support she had come a long way from the abused teenage victim. She refused to accept that he was dead, because something inside told her he was clinging to a remnant of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She begged doctors to keep trying and wouldn’t give up. The doctor finally said, “We’ll try for ten minutes more, but after that you have to let him go.” Then she prayed to everyone she could think of, even to the father she paid to have killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only two minutes of the ten left, forty-three minutes after his heart ceased to beat and supply oxygen to his brain, there was a faint pulse and Rob came back to life. It was called a miracle. The doctors never had a case where the patient was dead for so long and did not sustain massive brain damage. Everything Cheryl endured during her life had given her the strength to demand they keep trying to save her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl and Rob brought a malpractice suit against the cardiologist who had treated Rob for chest pain and other classic symptoms. Over at least a six month period, instead of diagnosing that Rob’s arteries were blocked and his heart was dying, the doctor never ordered tests like an angiogram, and instead told him repeatedly nothing was wrong—it was only anxiety. The malpractice case was proven, but a travesty of justice occurred in an astounding jury verdict—the doctor won the case. Some of the doctor’s testimony is included in the book.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;In writing their dramatic book, they want to illustrate that damaged lives can be rebuilt. The book has a photo and media reprint section.</description>

  <description>Has it been too long since you've been scared? The long-awaited Ghost Hunting Diary Volume VI is finally here! Curl up in your favorite chair, set your favorite sipping beverage beside you, and settle in for another spooky ride into the paranormal. You'll wander into Louisiana in "Cajun Crossovers," although it's not the ride you think it will be. Then back to Texas for some ride-alongs with Aunt Belle and her cohort, T. M., as they investigate the "Old Calvert Nursing Home" and granddaughter "Tara's Home." Yep, the SRT crew does "do" a cemetery again; graveyards after dark are still one of their favorite haunts. T.M. also continues her work to help lost, wandering souls in "Crossing Over Violent Death Victims." Then you'll see what happens when one of the nasties is able to breach Simmons' own house in "Demon at the Door." If you feel some eyes watching you while you read, T.M. hopes it's not too far from your chair to the light switch on the wall. Sometimes it looks like quite a distance in a dark room where ghosts might be prowling, huh?</description>

  <description>After human lie detector Charmaine Digby scores a job as the County Coroner's new investigative assistant, the unthinkable happens—a doctor reports the suspicious death of Trudy, a family friend and one of several elderly patients at the hospital whose heart mysteriously stopped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no physical evidence of foul play, Char's on the case, much to the irritation of Detective Steve Sixkiller, who doesn't want her to stick her pretty nose for trouble in his investigation. But she's a woman on a mission to uncover the truth, and she'd better keep her eyes open or the next body on the way to the morgue could be hers....</description>

  <description>My name is Leona Tillard. I need your help. You see I have been spending my whole life trying to know who I am. I was born and raised in Akron, Ohio. Being a product of a temporary singled-parent home, I was left without some pertinent information that could have possibly told me who I am. Eventually, still a child, my family structure evolved into a blended family situation. In silence, I cried far more than I laughed. &lt;br /&gt;Don’t get me wrong. There was much love for me. I learned early in life that I was a very special little girl. People loved being in my presence but more than anything, my body was always desired. I didn’t want for anything. Life was good to me. I just didn’t understand love and what is considered being a normal human being. This is where I need your help. Would you listen to me as I tell you my story about my life? Tell me who really loved me. Am I really an angel or a freak of nature? Your help will be highly appreciated. In return, I promise to entertain you from beginning to end. Below find one of my thought processing moments. It came during a time I needed understanding. Until we meet, enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;“My body was betraying me in the worst way.&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, God, help me! I face you now in my naked and weakened state and beg you to save me.” I prayed silently.”</description>

  <description> Being the star of a reality TV show means that all your secrets can come out.   &lt;br /&gt;Melissa McBallister and her rescue dog, Bubbles, are stars of the hottest reality show on TV. Savvy Socialites of Fishcreek Falls is so popular that producers have arranged a crossover episode with another show, Texas Shore Cowboys. Their cast arrives with plenty of drama and fighting. It is a surprise to everyone when one of their stars tumbles out of a pink cowboy hat on stage, dead. Melissa steps up to solve the mystery while dodging paparazzi and her own secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Ryan is the producer of the show but finds himself distracted by Melissa. When a female friend from college shows up during the filming of a crossover episode, he wonders if he wants to follow old dreams. There’s no time to ponder his feelings, as the socialites are eager to be the first to solve the latest murder and Ryan must scrabble to get it all on camera. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reality TV Cozy Mysteries 2</description>

Those were the last words his father uttered before dying, and from what he knew of his family tree and the unfortunate end that came to so many of his ancestors, Del Honeycutt couldn't disagree. What he didn't know was that his family held dark secrets-secrets that were about to come crashing down upon him. A seemingly innocent date gone tragically wrong plunges Del into a web of murder, lies, greed, and a hidden fortune dating back to a crime committed 85 years earlier by his great-grandfather. Accompanied by Sabrina, the sister of Del's brutally murdered date, a violent journey of discovery and fear begins. Pursued by vicious killers intent on eliminating anyone with knowledge of the 85-year-old crime, their only hope of survival is to find the reasons behind the original crime and why, decades later, someone is still willing to kill to keep it hidden. But Sabrina is concealing a monstrous lie of her own. Is she who she says she is? By the author of the Amazon bestselling thriller Wisdom Spring.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Welcome to Spellbound, where paranormal is the new normal.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only magic Emma Hart believes in is caffeine and the power of the dryer to lose one sock per load. A public interest lawyer buried under a mound of student debt, Emma’s whole life has been one turn of bad luck after another. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her streak seems to continue when she gets lost on the way to see a client in the remote Pocono Mountains. A chance encounter with a suicidal angel lands her in Spellbound, a town where supernaturals have been cursed to remain for centuries--probably not the best time for Emma to discover that she's actually a witch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between the recent murder of the town’s public defender, a goblin accused of theft, remedial witch classes, and the attention of one smoking hot vampire, Emma struggles to navigate this unfamiliar terrain without losing her mind...or her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Curse the Day&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the &lt;i&gt;Spellbound&lt;/i&gt; paranormal cozy mystery series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length, humorous paranormal cozy mystery novel.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>FIRST IN A NEW SERIES! &lt;br /&gt;When an American tourist is murdered with a scone in Gemma Rose’s quaint Oxfordshire tearoom, she suddenly finds herself apron-deep in a mystery involving long-buried secrets from Oxford’s past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Armed with her insider knowledge of the University and with the help of four nosy old ladies from the village (not to mention a cheeky little tabby cat named Muesli), Gemma sets out to solve the mystery—all while dealing with her matchmaking mother and the return of her old college love, Devlin O’Connor, now a dashing CID detective. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with the body count rising and her business going bust, can Gemma find the killer before things turn to custard? &lt;br /&gt;(**Traditional English scone recipe included)</description>

  <description>When out of work graphic designer Verity Long accidentally traps a ghost on her property, she’s saddled with more than a supernatural sidekick—she gains the ability to see spirits. It leads to an offer she can’t refuse from the town’s bad boy, the brother of her ex and the last man she should ever partner with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellis Wydell is in possession of a stunning historic property haunted by some of Sugarland Tennessee’s finest former citizens. Only some of them are growing restless—and destructive. He hires Verity put an end to the disturbances. But soon Verity learns there’s more to the mysterious estate than floating specters, secret passageways, and hidden rooms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a modern day mystery afoot, one that hinges on a decades-old murder. Verity isn't above questioning the living, or the dead. But can she discover the truth before the killer finds her?</description>

  <description>Christmas Eve 1928 gave birth to a yearly phenomenon in South Africa. A herd of false killer whales were found beached upon the shore. It has also given birth to the story of two young children who meet an old woman named Kima. Kima somehow knows why this has happened, but that’s not all she knows. The children, Alex and Alice, realize that there is more to this woman that what meets the eye, and ear. She will reveal to them a tale, a mysterious story she claims was passed on to her by a mythical Black Seagull.&lt;br /&gt; Derived from both historic tales and figures, Kima is a fictional character portrayed in a way that makes her become real.</description>

  <description>The announcement of Union Miller’s death arrived with the Saturday mail. That notice pushed Travis Gibbs to return to Riverfield only to discover that his best friend, Union Miller, had been dead for two years. It was an open and shut murder case—Union had stalked a woman, had killed her, and then had been killed by her husband. However, women had always pursued Union. Why stalk one? Why kill one? The search for answers propels Travis on a deceit-filled journey that ends in a conclusion he can’t believe, until violence steps into his life.</description>

  <description>Anything can happen on a reality show, though finding a body on set—and live on air—is new.&lt;br /&gt;Melissa McBallister is young, rich, and beautiful but frustrated. She wants nothing more than to be a famous author like her mother. When the opportunity to be on a new reality TV show comes her way, she grabs the chance, hoping to find some inspiration. When a castmate is murdered during a live broadcast and her blood is literally on Melissa’s hands, the young writer gets more than she bargained for—reality TV is much stranger than fiction. Can Melissa prove that she’s innocent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan Sethi prefers to produce TV commercials. They’re boring and safe. But he can’t pass up the opportunity to produce a show about socialites in Fishcreek Falls, an exclusive ski town high in the Rocky Mountains. But can he keep the show, cast, crew, and especially Melissa safe while a killer is on the loose? Or will a reality TV show gone bad ruin both of their lives?</description>

  <description>From USA Today bestselling author Connie Shelton a light, charming holiday mystery novella, complete with lots of special Southwestern Christmas traditions. Bonus: two of the recipes featured in the story. It's a New Mexico Christmas. The lights are strung, the luminarias are set along the sidewalks. Treats are abundant and Charlie Parker is getting ready for her mother-in-law's holiday visit. But there is trouble in the neighborhood and when death shows up--right next door--Charlie's bright, festive plans suddenly take a turn for the dark. Get in the spirit with this holiday novella. "A Charlie Parker mystery is always a good read." --Southwest Book Views "Connie Shelton does a fantastic job of interweaving various New Mexico locales and cultures into the plot so that the state feels like the land of enchantment." Harriet Klausner, online reviewer</description>

  <description>Trent Cooper, the former newspaper man-turned aspiring novelist, and his genius sidekick, Horatio, must, once again, delve into the past. Thanks to a misprinted ad, Trent and Horatio are now on the case of a failed assassination attempt on former President Calvin Coolidge, who once vacationed in Mount Dora. For better or worse, Trent must also prove that notorious gangster Al Capone was framed in the plot. All of this leads to the answer of a present day homicide and an attempt on his own life. Interweaving stories from the past and present, Mobsters blends fact and fiction in a who-dun-it of historic proportions.</description>

  <description>A young nurse is savagely killed during a pre-dawn run on Galveston’s seawall. The murderer slices her running shorts from her body as his trophy and tosses the body over the wall to the rocks below. As dawn breaks, a bedraggled street person, wearing four layers of old, tattered clothes, emerges from the end of the jetty, waving his arms and talking to people only he hears. He trips over the body, checks for a pulse and, instead, finds a diamond bracelet which he puts in his pocket. He hurries across the street, heading for breakfast at the Salvation Army two blocks away, leaving his footprints in blood as he goes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wayne Little, former Galveston prosecutor and now Houston trial lawyer, learns that his older brother has been charged with capital murder for the killing. At first he refuses to be dragged back into his brother’s life. Once a brilliant lawyer, Dan’s paranoid schizophrenia had captured his mind, estranging everyone including Wayne. Finally giving in to pleas from his mother, Wayne enlists the help of his best friend, Duke Romack, former NBA star turned criminal lawyer. When Wayne and Duke review the evidence, they conclude that Dan’s chances are slim. They either find the killer or win a plea of insanity since the prosecution’s case is air tight. The former may be a mission impossible since the killer is the most brilliant, devious and cruel fictional murderer since Hannibal Lecter. The chances of winning an insanity plea are equally grim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It will take the combined skills of the two lawyers along with those of Duke’s girlfriend, Claudia, a brilliant appellate lawyer, and Rita Contreras, Wayne’s next door neighbor and computer hacker extraordinaire, to attempt to unravel the mystery of the serial killer before the clock clicks down to a guilty verdict for Dan.</description>

  <description>The Edge of the Cemetery is book 2 in the Ghost Killer Series (What Haunts Me - Ghost Killer Book 1) and although it could be read as a stand-alone novel, book 1 was developed as an introduction and I would recommend starting there first. Below is a more detailed description of the continuing adventures of the Ghost Killers - I truly hope you enjoy this new series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ghosts and demons that wander among the living; they do not haunt in the traditional sense. Instead, they plague mankind with diseases and physical deformities, and once a ghost finds its victim it will haunt them for a lifetime. When George Sinclair discovered he could see these ghosts, and more importantly, he could kill them and save their victims, his life changed from ordinary to extraordinary, he'd become a ghost killer, one of the most powerful to be born in some time. George has embraced this new life and now works alongside his new friends, Billy Wilkinson and Phil James. Together they assist the Watchers, an international group of ghost killers and supernatural experts who monitor the world for ghostly sightings and demon infestations to maintain the balance between the living and the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When San Francisco and the surrounding area are suddenly plagued by rogue groups of ghosts and demons, who appeared to have a leader of sorts, a 17th century musketeer demon, the Watchers know it isn't random, nor was it the usual form in which ghosts and demons prefer to haunt. These monsters were also possessing their victims and forcing them to hurt others, and once the ghost killers arrived, the demons directed their human weapons on them. The question was, who was this musketeer demon and why was he directing these attacks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As George, Billy, Phil and the Watchers investigate, they discover the 17th century demon is teamed up with a teenage boy, who they come to realize is a powerful ghost killer himself and more importantly, they believe he is being controlled by the demon and is now using its energy to kill people at will. Their search for the teenager and his demon lead them to the discovery of an enemy from their past and a mysterious prophecy. As they decipher the true meaning of the prophecy, they uncover a plot for murderous revenge involving a secret vault containing numerous malevolent souls and a plan to return those wicked dead to human form as directed by Satan himself. Unfortunately, they also discover the true purpose of the demon musketeer's involvement, which is to become one with the powerful teenage ghost killer, creating a monster that cannot be defeated. With the clock ticking against them, they must find the vault and destroy it before it can be opened and kill the demon and his teenage host.</description>

  <description>Hetta Coffey is a sassy Texan with a snazzy yacht, and she's not afraid to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A globe-trotting engineer with attitude, a penchant for trouble, and a yacht, Hetta is back, and this time she's steering us into hot Mexican waters.&lt;br /&gt;Miffed that vacation plans with her chronically absent boyfriend, Jenks Jenkins, have gone awry, she accepts a job in Baja.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what, if she and her friend Jan are spectacularly unqualified to take her yacht on a thousand-mile cruise in the eastern Pacific Ocean during hurricane season?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiring a handsome, if somewhat fishy captain for the trip might keep them off the rocks, but probably won't do the same for her future with Jenks. Meanwhile, a little eye candy on board can't be all bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hetta's fierce independence impels her to tackle a very profitable (if environmentally and politically incorrect) project south of the border. True to form, her irreverent nature and disregard for danger soon swamps her in a sea of mayhem, illegal aliens, a pesky whale, and a menacing Mexican machinator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set sail for Baja Mexico's Magdalena Bay as Hetta Coffey leads us once more into a morass of intrigue that will keep you laughing, breathless, and wanting more.</description>

  <description>When the remains of a disfigured body turns up in the backwoods of Virginia, FBI agent Jack Stanwick is once again summoned. This was now the third victim recovered with unusual physical characteristics, and with most of the brotherhood on another high-profile case, he needed some outside help...and knew who to enlist. Jack knocked on the front door of the Davenport Detective Agency where three ex-cops, Bren Williams, Derek O'Rourke and Russ Munroe are employed by former police chief, Raymond Davenport. Once hired, the detectives focus their attention on the militia group, M.A.G.O.C. (Men Against Government Overtaking Control), and find that several members along with the aid of a high-ranking official in the White House, are involved in a governmental conspiracy. Digging further, the detectives come upon Prescott Chemicals, where an elixir that was discovered in the Amazon Rainforest by the Mayapo natives years before, is now being transformed into a formula with irreversible consequences. While investigating the chemical plant, they accidentally come into contact with the new solution and experience a change to their bodies and minds; causing some amusing yet permanent issues. As the detectives gain control over themselves, their strategy emerges. With the assistance of a beautiful newspaper journalist, Simone Wellington, and a bitter French physicist, Lydia Reome, they discover the perpetrators and uncover a plot of betrayal, and a secret that affects one detective; altering his life</description>

  <description>For 25 years France Hunter has been studying owls, and has discovered five new species around the world. Her work has kept her busy and she never had time for a relationship. She travels with Jason “Doc” Bradley, a former paramedic, and his cousins Tony and Andy Bradley. Now, on her last outing she is joined by a magazine writer, Cathy Birch, and a world famous angler, John Sinclair, who has also dedicated his life to his field. &lt;br /&gt; As the small caravan travels to the Amazon river France falls and severely injures her left arm. Against Doc's recommendation to turn back, she pushes on. This is her last trip and she wants to go to the place where she found her first new owl. &lt;br /&gt; While fishing a blue-ringed owl lands on John's canoe and looks down the river to where France's group is, and then looks back at him. This alerts John. He gets the satellite phone and tries to reach her to no avail. He decides the fishing can wait and, with Mark in another canoe, begin the journey back to France.&lt;br /&gt; At France's camp two jaguars attack one of the boatmen severing his left leg. The other two boatmen, they all have rifles, shoot at the jaguars killing one. The other escapes with the boatman's leg. Doc and the others wake to the noise and he and Tony go to where the boatmen are camping. In the ruckus the canoes become untied and go eastward down the shore and the sat phone is destroyed. Now they have no way to get help and will have to wait for John's team to come back, which could take three or four more days.&lt;br /&gt; Will help get there in enough time?</description>

  <description>Cambridge Books announces the publication of C. M. Albrecht's fourteenth novel, a step away from crime and mystery. &lt;br /&gt;In "Hail Mary" his latest tale, the only mystery is how three slightly tarnished "Golden Girls" manage to survive a wake for Mary's husband. Booze, marijuana, an aircraft Mary doesn't know how to fly, and out of gas at 3,000 ft. along with some bad-ass actor bikers converge upon them with a vengeance but Mary's son Creighton probably suffers more than the girls do. &lt;br /&gt;Available in July from Cambridge Books, amazon.com. nook.com and most venues. &lt;br /&gt;"I laughed more at this than at anything I've ever read." — Martha A. Cheves&lt;br /&gt;"A study in family dynamics...well worth reading." — Anne K. Edwards&lt;br /&gt;Pre-order your copy today!</description>

  <description>In his first novel, FCEtier delves into the mindset of a masters candidate and the events that take the student on a career path to the top of a lonely profession. We meet ?The Shooter? as a mission is about to conclude and quickly become acquainted with a conflicted individual seeking resolution to inner conflicts as a phenomenal career enters its twilight years. Then another assignment comes up almost immediately. How does an individual become a target? Who makes the life-ending decision? The cast includes potential victims, security staffs, and several eccentric characters including an aging hippie who speaks only in song lyrics and a former FBI agent with diverse interests. The role of Julian F. Thibaut, the enigmatic billionaire member of the one percent of the one percenters, changes with the winds and adds doubt to the already unstable status quo. As the action proceeds on several fronts, the shooter battles conscience, hired killers, and burn-out while juggling relationships and attempts at normalcy. In this fast-paced story with political overtones, FCEtier takes readers on a thrilling ride while addressing personal, business, and governmental ethics.</description>

  <description>~ A Sensual Paranormal Romance ~ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Casey Montgomery's lifelong addiction to bad boys has brought her nothing but heartache. Just as she swears off alpha males forever, a brief, torrid encounter with one of the hottest, Harley-riding, leather-jacketed hunks she's ever seen leaves her reeling – and worse, jeopardizes her carefully laid plans to meet and fall in love with a nice, dependable nerd. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jake Benedict has been around the block enough times to recognize his mate when he meets her, a gorgeous werewolf with a case of latent genes who doesn't have a clue about her true identity. Jake is just the were to teach Casey about her ancient heritage and coax her feral side into revealing itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Casey can't resist the intense physical attraction she feels for Jake, she's determined to freeze him out emotionally. Can Jake break through Casey's defenses and prove to her once and for all that he's one bad boy who's playing for keeps?</description>

  <description>The mind-bending sequel to No Greater Sacrifice:&lt;br /&gt;In a remote laboratory, genetic scientists are challenged to create a serum that heals injured soldiers and quickly returns them to the battlefield. Thus, Project Angel is born… only to fail under suspicious circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, archaeologists Renée Arturo and Dianna McEvoy discover in Norway what could be Mjolnir, the legendary hammer of Norse mythology. Neither event seems related until Dianna disappears and Renée’s son is kidnapped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renée and her husband, David, begin a desperate search to save their loved ones. When they discover both Dianna and her scientist father supposedly went missing when Project Angel ended, the mystery deepens. Was it really Dianna in Norway? Are her father’s experiments the reason the Arturos’ son was taken? Do cryptic codes on the hammer hint at the location of other fantastic treasures? Or something more sinister? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renée and David are no strangers to puzzles, but nothing can prepare them for this deceptive game where the consequences of losing are darker than anyone can imagine.</description>

  <description>SASHA is the story of a very remarkable dog: a Staffordshire Bull Terrier abandoned close to death at the age of 6 weeks old. Rescued from a street gutter, she had the good fortune to be adopted by author Brian L. Porter and his family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite suffering from a catalogue of injuries, including two broken legs and skin allergies, and eventually being diagnosed as a serious epileptic at just two years old, Sasha's story is one of triumph over adversity; of love, happiness and inspiration. Her love of life and capacity for enjoying every day to the fullest is nothing short of miraculous, and her story is told here by the person who shares every moment of her life on a daily basis, and how a disabled author and his dog have become dependent on each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a story that has already touched many who have come into contact with her, from vets to nurses and a whole host of followers on her own Facebook page. Read her story and join them in sharing in the life of an amazing and very special dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PUBLISHER'S NOTE Now available in a new, updated second edition, with a new chapter and additional photographs.</description>

  <description>"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead, and the bridge is love."--Thornton Wilder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who uses a computer is vulnerable to cyber-attack through a cell phone, Facebook page, e-mail account, or even files that might be accessed by a remote system while connected to the Internet. But who thinks it will happen to them? Paige Campbell had never considered that she had anything to worry about until she got the first crank call. By the time her Facebook page is hacked and one of her files changed so that she is suspended from college and accused of plagiarism, she's beginning to believe that someone--or something--is out to get her. Not a person or corporation, though, because it seems able to do things that are possible only for a magician . . . or a ghost. Can there actually be a "ghost in the machine"?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan McConnell doesn't believe in ghosts and thinks it's outlandish to claim that his prototypical AI test system (for writing advertising jingles) has become the portal by which a ghost (or at least a paranormal entity, perhaps a demon, which he also doesn't believe in) has entered our material plane. But after his system does several strange things and can't be turned off, he concludes that there is something behind this "haunting" complained about by his client Paige Campbell. Although he can't see how it's the spirit of someone spurned by Jenny Lind (the Swedish Nightingale of the P. T. Barnum era) who insists Paige is actually Jenny and who has come back for her to "remove the curse," he determines to help her. They run headlong into the murk of a paranormal entity (a ghost, even though he's not a believer) that has mistaken Paige for someone else but is determined to haunt her until she “undoes” the curse it believes she has set on it and declares her love. Paige and Alan's mutual attraction proves to be an inconvenience they can't ignore. But before they can do anything else, they must break the hold that the entity has gained over them without resorting to doing something evil themselves-­-thereby becoming as wicked as the entity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer*: Y'all know Shalanna Collins=Denise Weeks, right? That's me. OK.</description>

  <description>Around the World in 80 Meals: The Best of Cruise Ship Cuisine weaves gastronomic delights around an exotic seven-day dream fantasy cruise. Imagine waking up on a different ship in a new port of call every day, and treating your taste buds to a gourmet meal every evening, each carefully prepared by one of the best chefs afloat. This book highlights the most interesting menus and recipes of a diversity of cruise lines, from the luxurious Cunard Line, famed for its opulent ocean liners, to a small but highly exclusive line of yachts that offer the most personalized cruise experience.

  <description>The small, peaceful lakeside community of Mount Dora suddenly changes one morning when two local fishermen snag the skeletal remains of a man murdered more than 75 years earlier. The local police give up after only a few days even though a relative of the dead man claims infamous mobster Meyer Lansky committed the crime, but he’s been dead for 25 years. &lt;br /&gt;Former newspaperman Trent Cooper thought he was heading into an early retirement. Maybe he would finally have a chance to finish the novel he’d been working on for too long. &lt;br /&gt;Mostly by accident, he finds himself investigating the unsolved murder with the help of his good friend Horatio Cook, a borderline genius and certifiable slob. &lt;br /&gt;Cooper begins to unravel the web of clues and sort through the local lore involving the mafia, a U.S. President, a Hollywood movie and even a dead F.B.I. Director. The two reluctant sleuths enlist their freewheeling girlfriends and a cast of unique townspeople to help stay a step ahead of the Miami mob. Cooper learns that it will take the skill, tenacity and diligence from his former life as an investigative reporter to solve a Murder in Mount Dora.</description>

  <description>Eloise had the wedding of her dreams-all arranged and finalized within a month. Now that the wedding night was upon her, her fears reared their ugly heads. Dane, her new husband was really a stranger to her. In hindsight, Eloise realized she shouldn't have insisted they wait for their wedding night to have sex. It wasn't that she was inordinately traditional, only that Dane should have been given a choice in the matter. Because Eloise had a secret. Dane and Eloise left for the beautiful Maldives on a two-week honeymoon. In this idyllic setting, life threw her a curve ball. Because Dane had a secret, too. She would have put up with a number of things, but this particular secret could shatter her belief in fairytale weddings. How was she supposed to deal with another wife?</description>

  <description>SOLDIER WITH A BACKPACK – Living and Dying Simultaneously &lt;br /&gt; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, the hidden love killer, is instrumental in creating a world of alienation in the human experience. “Soldier with a Backpack, Living and Dying Simultaneously” is written to form a silent unity of hope and understanding for individuals experiencing or knowing someone with PTSD and to reveal a needed truth about it. &lt;br /&gt; She grew up with a tainted trust in adults, now that she has become one herself; Author Wattley began to learn why adults were so unhappy. She realized that stress and trauma had molded her into someone who felt unworthy of love, yet there was still something else willing her to life, telling her to share with the world that sufferers of PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder are more than words could ever describe. &lt;br /&gt;Author Wattley shares the experienced impact stress and trauma has on the human soul and the price we pay ignoring this reality. It is with great urgency she intimately shares her plight in life with her readers. Being mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically raped as a child, she survived by learning to exist in an inner world of divine peace. Something happened to that little girl; she didn’t die nor did she live, yet much was lost while much was gained.</description>

  <description>When Lori Sullivan wakes in the hospital with no memories, her first response is panic. Then psychiatrist Dr. Mark Greene shows up in her room, top of the rotation for emergency patients. Mark seems familiar somehow, though he doesn’t seem to know her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark is instantly drawn to this new patient with the strange, beautiful eyes. She’s vulnerable and lost, and he finds himself caught in the position of wanting more than a professional relationship with Lori. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither one can see what a relationship between the two of them will lead to, for them or for the planet.</description>

  <description>The ghosts that wander among the living do not haunt in the traditional sense; instead, they plague the innocent with disease, deformity and addiction. And once a ghost finds its victim, it will haunt them for a lifetime... or kill them quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After George gets ill, the dreams begin. Suppressed memories are triggered, allowing him to see ghosts, and a deeply buried instinct emerges. George finds out he can kill these monsters, and heal their victims. The ability to save lives is something George cannot ignore, but it soon becomes an obsession and begins to eat away at his sanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His quest for understanding leads him to new friends and allies, and exposes him to enemies he could have never imagined. In the end, can you really ever kill something that’s already dead?</description>

  <description>The discovery of three teenage girls found hanging from an ancient elm tree, alleged suicides, on the grounds of abandoned Starlight Mansion by a teenage boy sets him on a mission to find the truth. Nearly forty years later, now the sheriff, Big Jake finds himself drawn into the investigation of a mysterious “suicide” and the disappearance of another teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jayme Barclay sees her fifteen-year-old daughter swinging on a rope from a tree at the mansion the county commissioner is turning into a resort. Brad Patterson loses a piece of himself when he answers the 911 call to get to Starlight on a snowy December night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, the mystery surrounding Tawni's alleged suicide still haunts both Jayme and Brad. Big Jake has been shackled in this investigation, much like another sheriff so many years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reluctant teens hold back information, until Jayme returns to the hometown she abandoned, to find the truth. Brad hates that he had to intrude on her grief, but also believes this is his chance to redeem himself for not protecting the daughter of the woman he loves. Big Jake suspects who the killer is and that the person isn’t done yet, but must stand back and allow a younger man stand up against a powerful and corrupt group of politicians.</description>

  <description>Dr. Bethany McNeal is living her dream as a pediatric resident in one of the most sought-after medical centers in Seattle. Beautiful and intelligent, she’s missing only one thing—love, which she put on hold to focus on her career after ending a tumultuous relationship. Everything changes when she meets Dr. Brent Anderson, a charming and handsome fellow resident. Despite her reservations, Bethany falls for Brent—hard. When she learns Brent is married several months into their relationship, she immediately breaks it off. After graduating residency and going their separate ways, Bethany tries to move on with another man—real estate broker and personal trainer Charles Blakely. But just when things get serious with Charles, she realizes she’s still in love with Brent, and she finds herself caught between the two men, facing a series of difficult decisions and harrowing events that will change her life forever. Will she be able to recover from the vital temptations that turned her perfect life upside down?</description>

Once there, a British agent makes Cisneros an offer he can't refuse and the captain must travel to Japan.

Samurai fomenting war with Russia! Historical characters and powerfully drawn fictional ones mixing it up with political intrigues make David Lee Summers' The Brazen Shark a steampunk novel not to be missed. Put it at the top of your reading list. Now!" Robert E. Vardeman, author of Gateway to Rust and Ruin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Pack your goggles and your telescope and your atlas because the Clockwork Legion is taking us on another whirlwind adventure.

  <description>The deathly silence is about to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She disliked the company of others and death did little to warm her spirit. She had led an independent life and she faced death in much the same way. She was finally alone, finally free from the mindless babble of others, at least that's what she thought. May Elizabeth Trump was the rarest of spirits and she was none too happy about it either. She was a dead medium, a ghost who can speak with the living, and her services were to become in great demand. Flung into the limelight and smothered with unwanted attention, May soon discovers that it is not only ghosts with long awaited messages that have taken an interest in her. Something dark was lurking in the shadows, stalking her. Even the dead are not left to rest in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Medium: A humorous, character driven story and a unique vision of life after death. Not your average ghost story.</description>

  <description>Sprig of Broom is a coming-of-age creative non-fiction work about Geoffrey Plantagenet, a count, who at the age of 15 marries King Henry’s daughter, Empress Matilda, and fathers the dynasty of Plantagenet kings. The story begins with the count on his journey to Rouen in Normandy to become a Knight of the Bath. From Rouen, he and the king’s entourage travel to LeMans where Geoffrey is wed to Matilda. And the loathing begins . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Geoffrey Plantagenet has much to learn, and over the course of his life’s journey he develops a better understanding of himself, fathers a long line of kings, endures adversaries—especially his own wife—and boldly faces the world of chaos around him.</description>

  <description>Amateur sleuth Annie Tillery has been warned to stay away from Nevshehir, Turkey, where she is heading to meet her boyfriend, Ty Egan, and Cedric Zeeks, Ty's best friend. Intent on helping the two excavate an archeological site where they hope to link human remains to the first African ancestors, Annie does her best to shakes her foreboding feelings as her plane lands in Istanbul and she prepares to embark on her next adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a stranger claims he is there to pick her up and then disappears once he sees Ty, Annie is immediately thrown back into worry mode-especially after Ty tells her there is unexplained tension surrounding the dig and she receives a threatening note at the hotel. Still, as the three head to Nevshehir, Annie is buoyed by the excitement surrounding ancient Turkey and the possibility of uncovering secrets. The dig is plagued by accidents and theft, however, and the three friends, assisted by the head archeologist's twins, must search the ancient city of Istanbul and the caves of fantastic Cappadocia to find who is sabotaging their work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this young adult thriller, detective Annie Tillery must once again walk on a dangerous path in an attempt to unravel a complicated mystery and solve the secrets in the fairy chimneys.</description>

  <description>After fifteen-year-old Simon Porte's family is killed in an automobile crash, his father's brother whom he's never met brings Simon to live with him and his wife in upstate New York. Simon doesn't trust Uncle Raymond, and for good reason. Raymond is dying and using his powers to take over Simon's body. Simon and his allies—his dotty great-aunt Lucinda, his sister whom he finds living with another relative, and a pair of odd twins—wage war against the evil Raymond and his cronies.</description>

  <description>Alternate Cover Edition 9781514350218&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is said that the maid of honor and the best man are the most likely to have sex on a wedding night. Add a love-hate relationship and throw a couple of ghosts into the mix, and you have the runaway couple. &lt;br /&gt;Eloise chose a Gothic themed wedding for her and Dane, complete with remote setting, flickering candles, flaming torches and shadows, all geared toward scaring the guests. The stormy weather and swirling mists were a bonus. &lt;br /&gt;But the person most scared is the maid of honor, the bride’s elder sister, Piper. She didn’t do creep. Added to that, she’s been lumped together with Marcus, the best man and the bane of Piper’s teenage life. He was a prankster of renown when they were growing up. As the boy-next-door, he singled Piper out for the best he could come up with. She didn’t trust him then, and she certainly didn’t trust him now. &lt;br /&gt;As the runaway couple, will they follow the traditional path? Or will Piper’s dislike and mistrust of Marcus win out? &lt;br /&gt;Set in South Africa, the Runaway Couple is the first book in a set of steamy romances about bridesmaids, weddings and honeymoons that will appeal to the young and the young at heart alike.</description>

  <description>Rampaging Russians, Deadly Teapots, Twin Sleuths, Old Magicians and MURDER!&lt;br /&gt;Another zany Silver Sisters escapade&lt;br /&gt;Twin sleuths Goldie and Godiva, the Silver Sisters, are at it again. This time they're-tracking seven stolen teapots from Alaska to LA. To add to the fun, the twins' eighty-one-year-old mother and uncle, Flossie and Sterling Silver who are former vaudeville magicians, get into the act! The Russian samovar teapots sell quickly, but people begin to die&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shipment of Russian samovars failed to arrive at Goldie's antique shop in Juneau, Alaska and the ladies from the Russian Orthodox church are driving her crazy. They ordered one of the fancy tea urns as a gift for the retiring priest, but before the wayward antiques are located, his young replacement is murdered. A rampant crime wave has just begun in quiet little Juneau when her identical twin, Godiva Olivia DuBois, syndicated Beverly Hills advice columnist, pays Goldie a visit with her celebrity chef boyfriend in tow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The samovars sell quickly, and Goldie has only one left when two menacing Russians bumble into her shop. By the next day it seems the seven beautiful antiques are cursed. Everyone in town who received one of the samovars has been beaten or murdered, and two more customers are likely targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But our curvy sleuths are hot on the killers' trail with plenty of twist and turns and a surprise at the end.</description>

  <description>Historical romance. A Mississippi plantation. A southern belle. A Union officer. The turmoil of the Civil War rips a country asunder as lives are transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Caldwell is young and in love in the midst of the raging war that disrupts her world. She hopes to soon announce her engagement when the Civil War destroys her plans, and her beau leaves to fight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bert Russell, a Union officer, invades her life when his wounded men are moved to Whitworth College in Brookhaven, Mississippi, and he turns it into a hospital for his soldiers. When there is not enough room for his men and the Confederate soldiers, he confiscates Cotton Grove Plantation, Alice’s home, as a hospital for his remaining men and encamps on her front lawn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in the hospital with wounded and dying men changes Alice’s once-sheltered life. She’s no simpering southern belle batting lashes behind a sandalwood fan, but becomes a woman who finds the courage to go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through it all, the magnolia trees continue to bloom, majestic live oaks curtained with Spanish moss wave their limbs, the great Mississippi River continues to flow as the North and South battle for its control, and somehow, people go on with their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Belle-Officer-Battlefield-Romance-Book-ebook/dp/B00YQB58BK/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1433280984&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=the+belle+and+the+officer" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Belle-Officer-B...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>In this poetry collection, Brian L. Porter will take you into the center of the action. One minute you'll find yourself in the cockpit of a bomber, limping home from a raid over enemy territory, and the next in a dogfight during the Battle of Britain. &lt;br /&gt; Author and screenwriter Brian L. Porter served with the RAF during the Cold War. Many of the works in this collection are based on the personal experiences of those who took part in the conflicts they depict; men and women who were pleased to relate those experiences to the author. You will experience the poignancy of his words, the simple message of Remembrance, the moving dignity of Polska, and the graphic horror of the concentration camps, as related in Holocaust. &lt;br /&gt; "I am writing on behalf of all members of 617 squadron to thank you for your written tribute to "The Dambusters." It is a wonderful piece, which for me captures the spirit and courage of the young men who played a part on that fateful raid." Flight Lieutenant Richard Saunders, 617 Squadron RAF, speaking of "Apres Moi le Deluge."</description>

  <description>Boo! Turn up the lights and sit down to read more true ghost tales from the extensive collection of diaries T. M. Simmons kept over the years of her paranormal investigative career. Things do seem to go bump in the night when Simmons and her aunt prowl a haunted house or cemeteries during both dark and full moons. It's a scary Halloween all year round for this ghost hunter and her readers.&lt;br /&gt;In "St. James Jeepers Creepers" Simmons takes us to the extremely haunted St. James Hotel in Cimarron, New Mexico, where she and her aunt were given free access for two full nights of haunted chills and fun. "The Making of Barney the Believer" tells how her staid engineer husband grew to believe in the paranormal. Readers who follow Simmons will recall the problematic portal in a friend's house. "That Pesky Portal" is, hopefully, the conclusion of this saga. In the spring of 2012, she and her aunt finally managed to tour the haunted Prospect Place in the tiny village of Trinway, Ohio. "Possibilities of Prospect Place" relates their experiences there. Simmons always includes a scary tale, and "Hot Springs Heart Attack (Almost) won't fail in that regard. One day maybe Simmons will find out what evil entity tried to share her bed, but it's not high on her priority list.&lt;br /&gt;Readers ask questions and the two articles included in this volume of true ghost stories attempts to respond to some of those. "Four Psychic Reception Areas" explains the various areas of that enjoyable but illusive Sixth Sense. "How to Tell if You Have a Haunting, and What to Do" isn't a complete guide to understanding whether or not a ghost is haunting you. The reason for that is because no one understands everything about the paranormal. However, it might give you a start and point you to further assistance.&lt;br /&gt;This volume of diaries is being released at the same point in time as Simmons new paranormal mystery, Dead Man Hand. Both are available for numerous e-reading devices.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; In this Video Game, "Game Over" Means You're Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her independent efforts to catch child killers, Emily Stone discovers the evidence that the cops can't - or won't - uncover. Now, this covert investigator is back on the hunt for the world's most sick and twisted murderers. But even with help from ex-police detective Rick Lopez, this time she's facing her most dangerous opponent yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The headlines in the San Jose Mercury News blare updates on a serial killer who seems able to slaughter with impunity. Men, women - it doesn't matter; the victims serve only to satisfy a perverted need to kill. The killer watches the moment of death on multiple computer screens, over and over again. The only connection is that they're all devotees of the latest video-game craze - a sophisticated brain-puzzler called EagleEye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the killer goes after Lopez's law-enforcement mentor, Lopez and Stone decide to give the cops a little extra, unsolicited help. What follows takes them deep inside a shocking high-tech world, a kind of social-networking community for serial killers. But when they start getting too close to the truth, all hell's going to break loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Stone and Lopez become the killer's next target as Stone must make a difficult decision to leave the ones she loves in an all-or-nothing effort for survival. Can they stay alive long enough to blow the whistle on this unlikely perpetrator?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Allison is also interested in dream interpretation and invites Taylor to her Friday night Dream Club, where members meet once a week to share and analyze their dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a local dance instructor, Chico Hernandez, is found dead in his studio, and the murder scene has an eerie resemblance to one of the dreams shared at their meeting, Taylor can’t help but be intrigued. And when her sister, who was briefly involved with the dance teacher, becomes the prime suspect, Taylor and their fellow club members can’t be caught napping. It’s up to them to dream up a solution to the murder before Allison faces a real-life nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Thomas Gunn (ex-Special Forces) and his partner Julie are running for their lives. Who are they running from? And why? It all starts when Thomas decides to investigate the mysterious murder of his wealthy industrialist father. Billions have been funneled into a secret project that his father's company no longer controls. A project he desperately needs access to. But when he's stonewalled by UK officials and nearly killed in the U.S., he goes on the attack. Joining forces with MI5 he uses his old skills in covert operations to relentlessly pursue a tangled web of clues across 3 continents. There's got to be a link between the project in Northern Ireland, a microelectronics company in the U.S. and heavily fortified submarine base in Estonia. He just has to find it!With Julie's help and that of her computer expert father, the pieces start to fall into place until they expose an international conspiracy that could destabilise democracies around the world. This explosive revelation throws Thomas and Julie into the path of an unknown enemy with more power and influence than they could ever imagine. An enemy out to destroy them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who are these ruthless conspirators that wield such unimaginable power? How are they connected to his father? And what dark secrets from the past will Thomas uncover, in his relentless quest for the truth? This "gripping," "thought-provoking," "hard to put down novel" by a "master storyteller" keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing to the very last page!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the son of an MI6 operative, a former officer in Britain's elite Parachute Regiment, a pilot, yachstman, race car driver and bestselling author of "Contact," AFN Clarke brings his own unique and eye-opening experiences to this first book of the Thomas Gunn thriller series that's fast -paced, thought provoking and frighteningly real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR INTERVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do you think this series has been so well received by readers worldwide?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFN Clarke: I think it's because from page one, Thomas's world becomes their world! They become the Special Forces officer, trained in assassination, covert operations and international espionage. The caring, compassionate man who's finally found love, wants to leave his past behind him, yet puts those closest to him in mortal danger because of who he is and what he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When dangerous, dramatic and deeply personal events shake Thomas's world, inevitably those two worlds collide. But the only way Thomas knows to right a wrong, avenge a murder, expose a crime or bring an enemy to its knees, is to be the sharply tuned "weapon" he was trained to become. The question that haunts him, is at what price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think readers also appreciate that every book features strong female protagonists. Whether motivated by good or evil, they are powerful, independent thinking women, whose strength of character, insights, skills and intelligence directly determine how the action unfolds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THOMAS GUNN THRILLER SERIES BOOK CATEGORIES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each book in the series has its own themes with specific genres as listed below. Throw into the mix the secret agendas of intelligence agencies like MI5, MI6, the FBI, CIA and the manipulation of power by corrupt individuals and you have a heart pumping recipe for compelling plots, explosive action and the thought provoking blurring of lines between fiction and reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystery, Thriller and Suspense Series Political Thrillers Financial Thrillers Techno Thrillers Murder Mystery International Mystery and Crime International Espionage International Conspiracy Special Forces Fiction MI5 FBI Conspiracy"</description>

  <description>The Orange Moon Affair - by the best-selling author of CONTACT - is the first book of a compelling new thriller series, an action-packed conspiracy with a hero and heroine you hold your breath for. If you enjoy the action of Robert Ludlum, the intensity of Brad Thor and international intrigue of Daniel Silva, then this book’s for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-British Special Forces soldier Thomas Gunn is drawn back into his old life of international intrigue and danger following the murder of his billionaire father. The deeper he digs the more complicated the puzzle becomes until he finds himself working for MI5 uncovering a global conspiracy that puts the freedom of the western world at grave risk. His girlfriend Julie becomes his accomplice surprising him with her loyalty, strength of character and physical prowess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While traversing the globe being shot at, shot down, and losing loved ones - a haunting question tears at his soul – was his father really at the heart of this evil conspiracy? Or was he a pawn in a larger more insidious game that even he could not control? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking the final answer could cost Thomas dearly, ripping from him all that he most loves and cherishes and leaving him questioning his past, his future and what kind of person he is or wants to become. The final outcome depends on him! Or does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former Captain of Britain’s elite Parachute Regiment and son of an MI6 operative, the author brings his unique and eye-opening experiences to the character and exploits of Thomas Gunn, as well as an unsettling blurring of the lines between fiction and reality when exploring the ruthless abuse of power and position for personal gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFN Clarke is the bestselling author of Contact as well as Collisions, An Unquiet American, Dry Tortugas, The Book of Baker Series (Dreams from the Death Age; Armageddon; Genesis Revisited) and The Orange Moon Affair, the first of the Thomas Gunn series with more coming soon.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Serial Killers Terrorize a California Beach Community, One Woman Stands in Their Way&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Stone doesn't have a badge. But that hasn't stopped her from tracking down some of the West's most dangerous child-killers. Armed with a digital SLR camera, laptop computer and her trusty Beretta, Stone uses her innate gift for detective work to identify the perps -- and then anonymously e-mail the evidence to the cops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the hunt for two brazen serial killers on the loose right in her own coastal California town threatens to expose Stone's identity -- unraveling her carefully constructed cover and jeopardizing her life's work. But when she gets too close to the action, this razor-sharp hunter becomes the hunted. Cooperating with the handsome local police detective could be the only hope for stopping the rampage directed at unsuspecting young women -- and saving herself. Can they piece together the clues in time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsion mixes CSI-style investigation with a ripped-from-the-headlines plot and a dose of romance for a keeps-you-guessing, fast-paced and savvy thriller, right up until the shocking finale.</description>

  <description>Moments after Elva Kingfield placed flowers beside her late husband's tombstone, an explosion sent associate pastor Willa Hinshaw dodging chunks of hurling granite. Later, when Elva, who believes her dead husband's ghost is roaming the halls of her estate, falls mysteriously ill and her housekeeper is stabbed to death, Willa can't accept that the violence is simply random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon discovering that someone is looting Elva's valuables, plus the strange behavior of the widow's feuding family members, Willa is convinced that somebody wants Elva dead. Determined to do whatever she can to keep the kind woman out of harm's way, she ignores ominous threats telling her to mind her own business…or else. Willa's got all the help she needs from Above—it's the danger below that's got her worried.</description>

  <description>Shortly after the remains of a teenaged boy are unearthed on newly acquired Twin Lakes property, Lydia Krause has a worrisome conversation with her elderly neighbor. Daniel Korman hints at having known the dead boy and wonders if, after all this time, he should let sleeping dogs lie. Then Daniel dies under suspicious circumstances, and Lydia suspects that his two surviving childhood friends are responsible for both deaths. Or did one of Daniel’s money-hungry relatives decide to end his life? As the murders and assaults mount, Lydia is drawn further and further into Daniel Korman’s world. And, as if things weren't bad enough, her budding relationship with Detective Sol Molina is seriously compromised as she seeks answers in what Sol considers his professional arena. Can Lydia keep her relationship intact while uncovering the true killer?</description>

  <description>When unemployed computer programmer Nan Burton inherits a California beach cottage from her great-great-aunt, she's delighted. But she's in for a huge surprise: The house is haunted by the ghost of famous romance writer Max Murdoch (pen name Maxine DuBois) who insists Nan complete his last novel, threatening to keep her from sleeping until she agrees. The ensuing clash pits youth against the long-dead but still egotistical author with humorous and moving results.</description>

  <description>CRACK THE CODE AND YOU'LL SAVE LIVES...BUT KNOWING IT EXISTS COULD GET YOU KILLED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two American embassies in northern Africa are bombed, CIA operatives, Ridley Fox and Nita Parris, are assigned to track down the perpetrators. However, when their top asset is killed in a failed op, the agents suspect that there may be a new threat. Their search for the truth puts them on a collision course with a powerful multinational—which will go to extreme lengths to bury its criminal activities. However, the agents soon learn that someone with a personal vendetta against that company not only knows their secrets, but will expose them in a way that could result in the largest single-day attack against America.</description>

  <description>College student and art major Samantha Harper has been tracing her family tree for quite some time. Her mother, Rebecca, died when Sam was sixteen and she never talked much about her past. Samantha is thrilled to hear that she will be allowed to research her mother's past for a school assignment. Upon arriving in Rebecca's childhood neighborhood, Sam arranges to have a tour of her mother's grade school. She finds an area inside the school that had been damaged and at first, thinking a ghost was inhabiting the gymnasium, she accidentally crosses over into the year 1975; the year when her mother is in kindergarten. Fascinated and scared at the same time, Sam gets to witness her mother's childhood up front as she inadvertently gets involved in an old case of a young girl's accidental death. Little Josie Baker, a classmate of Sam's mother, died that year inside the school's gymnasium. But, was it an accident? After uncovering the dark secret surrounding Josie's death, Samantha wonders if she'll ever find her way back home where her father and best friend, Josh, have been waiting for her return. Will she return to the present or will she have to live the rest of her life in the past?</description>

  <description>Deep in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas in a place known as Grymme Creek Hollow was an abandoned homestead. Of course, being abandoned did not mean it was uninhabited. It was only abandoned in the sense that the original owner was long gone. This homestead was home to a chick named Chick. He was named Chick because his parents were not very imaginative. Chick, on the other hand, was very imaginative and had a real talent for finding adventure. This homestead was also home to a group of chickens who had claimed it as their own and established their own civilization. The homestead was surrounded by a stone wall which, as far as the chickens were concerned, was where civilization began and ended. Outside the stone wall was the dangerous wilderness known as the Deep Brush. The worse thing that could happen to any chicken was to be exiled from the safety of the homestead to the Deep Brush. This was exactly what was going to happen to Chick's Father, Walter, unless Chick could do something to stop it. Walter, who worked as a security rooster in the corn patch, had been accused by the malevolent hen, Aunty Hysidia, of stealing corn and giving it to the field mice of the Deep Brush. It was a serious offense and one that was punishable by exile. Chick Pinfeather, along with his friends Peq and Quinny, set out to prove Walter's innocence.</description>

  <description>High in the Santa Monica Mountains near Los Angeles, grisly murders are taking place. On each of the victim's bodies a note is left for L.A. Sheriff's detective, Gabriel McRay. The killer's identity is locked in the suppressed memory of a horrifying trauma from Gabriel's own childhood. Teamed with his forensic pathologist girlfriend and his pyschiatrist, Gabriel runs two parallel investigations. The first: a dark journey into the terrifying recollections of his past and the second, the hunt for a serial killer who seems to know more about Gabriel... than he knows himself.</description>

  <description>Murder in Paradise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an early morning paddle, Agapé Jones' outrigger team finds a body in the water off Maui, thrusting him into unexpected danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agapé Jones, retired NYPD detective, is asked to act as special investigator in the murder of famous surfer Philip Fowler, the son of Hawaii State Senator Thomas Fowler. The assignment takes Agapé to the North Shore of Oahu where he discovers he’s investigating more than just a murder. The young man had no enemies, and Agapé is frustrated by little evidence and few possible suspects.&lt;br /&gt;Agapé enjoys exercising his old skills, but he misses his wife, Gerry. He encounters several people who become more than acquaintances and, in the end, discovers the truth. Murder in Paradise will allow readers to uncover the answers along with the detective while experiencing a virtual trip to the real Paradise that is Hawaii.</description>

  <description>Stories that shatter the myths of stereotypical islands of paradise. In “Promises,” during the late 1960s, the ketch, Mercy, sinks during a sea storm off Culebra near the Virgin Islands. Ciara Malloy assumes custody of her drowned fiancé’s son and learns a devastating secret about the boy that changes her life forever. In “Adrift,” in the late 1990s, underwater photographer Lillian Avery gets caught in a rip current and swept out to sea off Kauai in Hawaii. In facing death, she finds a way to leave a message behind. Years later, in “Reunion,” the two former neighbors from Puerto Rico reunite on Kauai. A hurricane wreaks island-wide havoc. Ciara is missing, presumed dead. Among the rubble, Lillian finds Ciara’s memoirs; a life history that threatens to expose secrets tightly held since the sinking of the Mercy.</description>

  <description>A mystery surrounds the lush orchards and farmlands of California's Sacramento River Delta. As Sara Mason returns to her hometown in order to start a new life, she learns that a serial killer is terrorizing its residents. Despite battling the memory of the drowning deaths of her younger sister and alcoholic parents, Sara is determined to make peace with her past. However, she soon learns that the elusive psychopath who strangles his victims, snaps their necks, and then buries each along with a dead animal, is now stalking her. Sara's attempt to rebuild her life is hindered even more by the discovery of skeletal remains both on and near her property. She must move out as the criminal investigation focuses on suspects like the gravedigger Crazy Ike, a cat-killing vagrant, a Peeping Tom, and several others who may be connected to the twenty-eight victims. After several attempts on her life, Sara discovers critical clues and bravely volunteers to be a decoy for the sheriff's department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara Mason is a woman whose destiny has brought her back home, but her decision may lead her down a path lined with danger and straight into the arms of a madman in this captivating thriller.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Fairy Tale Fusion. &lt;br /&gt;Where things get messy in the Riding Hood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if the characters in Fairy Tales were real? What if they lived in Fairyland, a place not too dissimilar to ours, next to Wonderland and down the street from Camelot? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Detective Piper, member of the Fairyland Metro Police. His job, to ferret out the suspects and investigate crime on the streets and in the lanes of Fairyland. Along with Officer Simon, he’s hard at work, searching for a missing pumpkin, hunting for an arsonist, wondering what the future holds in a series of crystal ball robberies, and dealing with spells, curses and other strange happenings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His cases, and others like them, are the headlines of the day, brought to you by FTN news anchors Spider Bramble and Aurora Gossamer, with entertainment correspondent Lucinda Lovedust and reporter Chip Charming. Keep up-to-date on the latest information out of Fairyland and its adjacent suburbs, and the recent hubbub with trolls, princesses, fairies and their ilk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you are done dancing with Cinderella and her cronies, open the lid of a very scary toy box to find where children’s nightmares begin... and end, badly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, always be nice to your Fairy Godmother.</description>

  <description>The Memory Keeper is the story of Tomás Romero, a native of the Acjachemen band, whom the Spanish renamed Juaneño. Born in 1820 in San Juan Capistrano, Tomás attends the mission school where, in addition to the catechism, he learns to read, write, and cipher—uncommon for the Indians in San Juan at the time. Because Tomás assists the padres, he becomes aware of the world outside the small religious community. During his lifetime, he experiences the rule of Spain, Mexico, and finally, the United States. He survives drought, floods, plagues, the secularization of the mission property, and its return to the church. He also marries, raises two children, makes many friends, and provides assistance to the priests. He becomes co-owner of a mercantile. Although his story is rich with local history, it is, in the end, an engaging family saga with characters who come alive on the pages.</description>

  <description>When 88-year old Maggie McFarland is found shot to death on the grounds of the burned-down Artemis Hotel in the small Upstate New York fishing village of Roscoe, the only clue is a .45 caliber, World War II, shell casing. There are no apparent motives, no suspects, and no other clues, making this one of the most baffling cases of Matt's career as Chief of Police. Confounding matters is a battle over a proposed wind turbine farm that threatens to not only endanger the financial future of the town, but to set local residents one against another as well. Broken Promises is the latest in the Matt Davis Mystery Series, and as usual, the answer to the conundrum lies both in the present and in the past. Broken Promises is the fourth Matt Davis Mystery, and is scheduled for release on May 1, 2013 in both paperback and Kindle editions.</description>

  <description>From award-winning author B. J. Robinson comes a family saga amidst the backdrop of the Civil War and a deadly hurricane, rising floodwaters in the Big Easy, or Crescent City, as a plantation on River Road in Vacherie, Louisiana, is threatened. Will Hurricane Katrina destroy what the Civil War spared? &lt;br /&gt;Margaret Jane Turnrow first laid eyes on River Oaks Plantation amid lush foliage and oak trees dripping with Spanish moss when she returned from her honeymoon as a petite hazel-eyed fifteen-year-old bride to the antebellum mansion. She immediately fell in love with the house and grounds and beautifying the garden with plants. Her first task involved lining the oak drive with azaleas. Determined to have the best plantation gardens, she soon recreated formal ones designed from precious memories of France, Italy, and England she'd toured on her honeymoon. Before the Civil War, she imported plants, and gardening became her passion. During the war, it was her only one. The fertile Louisiana soil loved and nursed her plants as much as she did, and they grew like the cotton and sugarcane. &lt;br /&gt;Pale as a magnolia blossom, she sparkled like the sun reflecting off Lake Pontchartrain when she flashed pearly white teeth with her camellia red smile, but small white hands tucked demurely into the folds of her gown as she sat quietly during elegant dinners, concealed her true vivacious spirit. The war would change the shy woman-child as it ravaged through her life and took its toll on the home and family life she came to know and love with all of her heart. &lt;br /&gt;Before the Civil War, dashing Danny Paul Turnrow stood six-foot-two-inches, as tall and elegant as the white-columned plantation home he'd purchased on the banks of the Mississippi River. He led a charmed life as a charismatic cotton baron known as one of the richest men on River Road. River Oaks boasted over thirty-five-hundred acres of fertile Louisiana soil, mostly planted in cotton with the exception of some sugarcane along the Mississippi River banks and his wife's gardens. &lt;br /&gt;He returned from the war a different man, as broken as the pillared splendor of the South. Surrounded by cypress swamps and sugarcane fields on the river's end and white blankets of cotton edging the dirt roads, River Oaks Plantation still stood, but the grand life he'd led turned to one of backbreaking toil. He no longer stood so tall and proud with an aching back hunched over Louisiana cotton fields. &lt;br /&gt;With the future uncertain, fear lurks in his heart and soul and clouds his mind. What will sustain his marriage through the loss? Can they defend what's most precious to them and maintain River Oaks as a working plantation? The manor home is the only legacy he has left and the only life he has ever known. Will he lose it? &lt;br /&gt;Years later, Amaryllis Camilla O'Brien is stranded alone with two dogs on the top floor of an antebellum plantation in Vacherie, Louisiana, as a deadly hurricane rips and roars through the city and raging floodwaters threaten to devour the old home. She discovers a yellowed diary. Will family secrets drown in the flood with her? Will the diary matter? She's determined to save it and the dogs, or die trying. Has her grandmother left her a sinking ship? &lt;br /&gt;Noah Gautreaux, the plantation manager, took vehicles to higher ground and is supposed to return, but will he make it in time to save Amaryllis and his pet girls? The old house withstood the floods of 1973, 1983, and 1993. He doesn't think he has to worry about it floating off down the Mississippi River, but as excessive rain and wind continue to batter the area and the water continues to rise when the levee breaches, he realizes there's a first time for everything and this could be it for the white-columned beauty of ages past.</description>

Will Katrina destroy what the Civil War spared?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love and romance endure, grow, and flourish despite the Civil War, a killer hurricane, rising Mississippi River, and a raging flood. Experience the antebellum South with Maggie and Danny and weather the storm with Cammie and Noah as they battle a raging hurricane and flood. Noah still has the ring he bought for Cammie all those years ago. Should he ask the question he never did?

  <description>The Shocking True Story of Bella Capo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella Capo, the sexually and physically abused daughter of a powerbroker, whose close associates included politicians and organized crime figures, and a drug addicted mother, spent much of her youth in foster homes and rehabilitation facilities. As a young adult she became a force on Hollywood's Sunset Strip, running clubs and after-hours clubs. After a failed marriage to an abusive husband, Bella became a boss in the Crips- the only white female to hold such a position of power in the gang at that time. She late fled Los Angeles in fear for her life when her ex-husband and his associates stalked her and threatened her with death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although she could have died many times, Bella survived and overcame the obstacles to co-found La Bella Mafia, an online group that provides assistance and counseling to abuse victims especially those in life-threatening situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Courageous woman has now come out of hiding to share her story. It will serve as an inspiration to the hundreds of thousands of abuse victims in the United States who suffer in silence.</description>

  <description>Bailey Ruth loves to return to earth as an emissary from Heaven's Department of Good Intentions. Problem is, she's a bit of a loose cannon as far as ghosts go - forgetting to remain invisible, alarming earthly creatures - so she's far from the top of department head Wiggins's go-to list for assignments. That's why she's surprised when the Heaven-sent Rescue Express drops her off at a frame house on the outskirts of her old hometown, Adelaide, Oklahoma, where a young man is playing the drums. When a window cracks and a rifle barrel is thrust inside, only Bailey Ruth's hasty intervention saves Nick Magruder from taking a bullet. When she materializes to reassure him, she finds she can't go back to vanishing. What gives?</description>

  <description>Sam and Sara meet at a dance and soon fall in love. Sam is a college man; Sara only a junior in high school. Sara is the girl of his dreams. He wants to be with her, and she with him. Plans for that happy future are squashed when Sara's bigoted father finds out about Sam's mixed Japanese-American heritage. He refuses to allow his daughter to date a "breed," and devises a cruel scheme to separate them for good. Years later, Sara seeks legal help, and the lawyer she contacts is Sam. Though she's in a difficult personal situation, Sara's feelings for Sam are easily rekindled, as are his feelings for her. Just when it looks like they will be able to have a future together, catastrophe occurs. After months of crippling grief and depression, Sam remembers a discussion with one of his old college professors about time travel. Though Sam once scoffed at the idea, the improbable now seems his only hope: to travel back in time and change the order of events--to change their destiny.</description>

  <description>It's Your Fault is Wendy's eight year, sometimes humorous, journey in search of a cure to back pain caused by an exercise class injury. The author takes the reader on a wild ride through the Bay Area mainstream medical community, trying epidurals, physical therapy and other procedures, When her pain doesn't improve, she moves on to the universe of the alternative healing world with Interconnection Bodywork, a proselytizing Jewish yoga teacher, French maritime pine bark and more. Meanwhile, her teenage son is using the trunk of his car as a storage unit for strawberry -flavored vodka, sneaking out of the house and night and getting caught with smoking paraphernalia on Earth Day. As Wendy's desperation mounts, she discovers a tool that teaches her to trust her own instincts and learns that trying to find a solution often aggravates the problem. Her new found awareness opens the door as she learns how to deal with back pain and embrace her family.</description>

  <description>Judy and Jim Knowlton, a retired couple who enjoy fishing, decide to fish and explore one of the two legendary Dead Lakes in Wewahitchka, Florida, and soon find themselves boating through hauntingly beautiful cypress trees, skeletons, stumps, and knees in a lake considered the best freshwater sport and bass fishing in the nation. Brace yourself with courage to boat in a graveyard of trees and explore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Judy admits nature photographers would find an oasis, she can't shake the ominous feeling that snakes through her body. A lone cypress tree forms an eerie silhouette, but it isn't the only creepy rising skeleton from Dead Lake. Many bony fingers reach for the sky. Dawn breaks. A spectacular sunrise washes across the skyline, but fingertips of pink reach for the skeletal arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy likes to fish off bank, while Jim's pride and joy is his fifteen foot red-and-black Bass Tracker. He's all about boating and fishing on Dead Lake, and it'll take more than skeletal trees to change his mind. He can't wait for a diverse fish supper the lake offers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unsolved mystery from long ago entangles Judy and Jim in its web when an escaped convict decides he wants to search an old junk heap behind their mobile home. When their grandson and beloved pets are affected, the stakes are raised. Whose bones are discovered in Dead Lake near Swamp Rat's cabin in the woods? Judy spies the waters of the lake bubbling. Somehow, it doesn't remind her of discovering oil and becoming rich. The water is doing its on weird thing, and the tops of the cypress trees along the bank blur like wind is rustling through them, but there's no wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is still. A Florida evening T-storm drums down with wind gusting as Judy attempts to show Jim the water, but her voice is lost in the wind, and he steers the boat away without looking back. The lake water spirals around that certain strand of trees and ripples in a huge circle. Is the mystery of Dead Lake over, or is it just beginning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning author B. J. Robinson takes readers to the Florida Panhandle northern Gulf County best known for the Dead Lakes and Tupelo Honey, which is world famous and has been harvested for over one hundred years from the Apalachicola River Basin. This is the first novel in her Dead Lake Mystery Series, 51,376 words.</description>

  <description>Ashby Devereaux was born into a life of abuse, shame, and fear. For seventeen years Ashby’s life has been ruled by her stepfather, whom she calls “Poppa.” Garrett Devereaux is mean whether drunk or sober. Her mother the once beautiful, carefree Marie Boudreaux, was the cherished only child from a prominent Catholic family in New Orleans. That was before she became pregnant; before she was exiled to the backwoods of North Carolina and bound, through a deal made by her prideful father, to a marriage with a man who belittled and beat her. Momma was powerless to protect Ashby and her twin brother, Danny, from the wrath of Garrett’s words, fists, and belt. At school, Ashby kept to herself and did her best to hide her bruises and despair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, on her seventeenth birthday, life seems more unbearable than ever. Danny is gone, and Momma lives in a drug induced fog—from the pills Garrett feeds her. Garrett has been visiting her tiny bedroom with an increasing, terrifying intensity. Yet, unknown to Ashby, seventeen will be the year of her rebirth—and the beginning of a wonderful new life. However, it will take a bloody battle, a daring escape, and a whole lot of hardship, cunning, and courage to get there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her gripping debut novel, MEANS TO AN END (Two Harbors Press; $16.95 Paperback; ISBN: 978-1-62652-041-7), Elizabeth Romero introduces Monique Moreaux, who transformed herself from a victim—the downtrodden, timid Ashby Devereaux—into a strong, confident, and brilliant woman sought out by detectives for her keen insight into crimes against the vulnerable. Marking the first installment in the 'Redemption' Series, set primarily in New Orleans, MEANS TO AN END uncovers the roots of Monique’s drive to protect and avenge abused women and children, while unraveling violent crimes and mysteries of its own. Set in 1985, 'MEANS TO AN END' opens in the midst of Ashby’s terrible, unbearable home life. When Garrett’s sexual molesting culminates in rape, with a shattering outcome, Ashby finally finds the strength to defend herself—with a knife. Urged on by her Momma, Ashby flees North Carolina, with a burning destination in mind: New Orleans. Once there, she knows she’ll find her brother, Danny, who ran off four months back and, to her aching disappointment, she hasn’t heard a word from since. In New Orleans, if her dreams come true, she might also meet her Grandparents and see the lovely white columned house where Momma grew up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-more- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling as Monique Fontaine, her new identity, borrowed from a kind stranger, Ashby arrives in New Orleans. There she encounters a sometimes harsh, yet always colorful and exciting new reality. Despite its dangers, Monique quickly feels right at home in this big, bustling city of diverse people, delicious food, and exotic experiences. To have a place to sleep and earn enough to eat, Monique takes a job as a humble “cleanup girl” at Ms. Blanche’s house—a brothel. With shiny black hair, long legs, and striking figure, Monique could easily have made more money as a dancer, but scrubbing floors suits her fine. Haunted by her memories of Garrett, she recoils every time a man looks at her, let alone touches her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While minding her work and her own business, Monique draws the attention of the highly respected Judge Moreaux. When Ms. Blanche conveniently sends her on an errand, she meets this refined, handsome older man, who appears to be a real gentleman, but is he? Gradually, Monique begins to open her heart to Bradley Moreaux. Fighting against fear and insecurities she dares to hope that she could escape her past and find love, but Monique receives chilling news. An investigator has arrived in town—looking for Ashby Devereaux. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ashby/Monique be able to find her beloved twin Danny before she’s caught and arrested for her stepfather’s murder? Can she trust Bradley with her secrets? Or is the judge another man destined to betray and abandon her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping readers riveted until its greatly satisfying climax, MEANS TO AN END marks the start of a thrilling new mystery series starring a brave, resilient, and fascinating woman. The second in the series 'THE WATCHED' is a physiological thriller presently in the works.</description>

  <description>When Professor Frank Miller and his team of university geologists stumble across a strange cave containing an even stranger treasure, it's only natural that they would take the treasure home for closer study. But there is talk among the locals of an ancient curse, and the truth behind the supposed Moctezuma's Treasure turns out to be stranger than anyone could have imagined. Author Emile A. Pessagno, Jr. takes readers on a heart-stopping journey as a rapid increase in natural disasters around the globe reveals unprecedented turmoil in the interior of the earth, sending humankind hurtling toward obliteration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller and his group make a startling observation: the sudden increase in disasters seems to correlate with the group removing the treasure from the Mexican cave . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Frank Miller and his team manage to replace the treasure and avoid catastrophe before it's too late or have they unwittingly paved the way for the prophesied Apocalypse?</description>

  <description>"Darden North writes vividly, with strong pace, action and emotion, counterbalanced with sharp observations and wry humor."-Peter James, bestselling author of Not Dead Yet "A rollercoaster ride of murder, intrigue, and plot twists. Wiggle Room keeps you turning the pages to the final, climactic finish!"-Robert Dugoni, New York Times bestselling author of The Conviction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brad Cummins is an Air Force surgeon who returns from overseas deployment after serving four months at the height of the Iraq War, during which he fails to save an injured soldier but mends the GI's attacker. He endures rigid criticism from his peers, yet survives the medical tribunal's investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Jackson, Mississippi, still blaming himself for returning the insurgent to the killing fields, Cummins discovers his look-alike brother shot to death and is certain that he was the intended target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the police and Brad's fiancee discount his fears as paranoia, forcing Brad to consult a psychiatrist. Then his fiancee is found murdered in his apartment. There is no doubt in his mind that he is marked for murder.</description>

In Bertha Fights Back, find out what happens when she joins a gang and gets involved with the wrong kids. Learn about her tolerance and understanding program. Then read what happens when she goes to Dancing School, takes Ice Skating Lessons and Tillie goes to modeling school. Bertha and Tillie - Sisters Forever is filled with stories based on real life events experienced by the author and her sister, Marcia Joyce. The first half of the book is based on the author's experiences as an educator in the NYC Public School System as a reading and writing Staff Developer and Dean. ..".This book is an innocent slice of a young woman's life and harkens back to an era when manners were king. Ms. Lewis crafted a piece of Americana for young women to read and reflect upon, similar to the American Girl series without the cloying over-sweetness."- Bennet Pomerantz columnist, Amazon.com and A Piece of the Page</description>

  <description>Catholic Press Association award winner! The exciting sequel to Olivia and the Little Way: Olivia Thomas was the new girl in school when she felt St. Therese of Lisieux enter her life in a powerful way. Now, two years later, her relationship with the Little Flower has blossomed into a beautiful friendship as she prepares to follow the Little Way into the seventh grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School is out for the year and it is time for a fun beach adventure with family and friends. However, Olivia's summer vacation turns out to be anything but ordinary! She discovers that sometimes it can be difficult to be a good Catholic when you're in middle school—and she finds that she needs God and St. Therese now more than ever. In this beautiful novel that celebrates modesty and the precious gift of life, Olivia learns that it takes blind faith every day—and that God is never far away, even on vacation.</description>

  <description>A lifetime of learning; a journey of teaching Al Mazza grew up in 1940s Brooklyn, exploring a world confined to the beaches of Coney Island and the streets of his neighborhood. From the observation deck of Idlewild Airport he watched the drama of planes coming from and going to unknown destinations. He would often dream of being on one of those planes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His ticket arrived for foreign travel in 1979 when he was selected to escort students to Israel. Together, they traveled to the cradle of three great religions and explored the complexities of the Middle East. Mr. Mazza ultimately crisscrossed the globe with the best and brightest of New York City public school youth. His travels with them opened new worlds to his students. Partnerships with national and community organizations and local government resulted in the growth of student exchanges through the 1980s under his Young Diplomats Program. New York's Sister-City relationships with Tokyo, Beijing, Madrid and Cairo added to the diversity of the exchange offerings. In addition to travels to the Far East, the interests of high-profile funding sources led to excursions to Eastern and Western Europe, Africa and the Soviet Union as memories were built that shaped the thoughts of the future for his "Young Diplomats."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a memoir, "A Teacher Grows In Brooklyn," is a tool kit for teachers who want to focus on global education activities for their students. Amid the pages of colorful tales, the author includes fundraising strategies, tips on the handling of student emergencies, and ways of dealing with cultural activities and foods strange to New York City youth. Readers are invited to use this book to plan their own journeys and take new adventures into the lives of their own students.</description>

  <description>It all started with a radio, a black plastic squawker that sits on a shelf outside Noah's room. Now don't get him wrong. He enjoys a Saint Paul Saints baseball game, or the smooth sounds of a little Nora Jones, but the daily flood of cheerless talk radio gives him migraines. Shrill voices filling the airways with reckless claims make him sweat. While he does not speak lightly about grave issues, Noah feels it's high time for more fun and funny a humorous corrective, so to speak. This Noah operates in a world of horse hilarity. He writes. He travels. He plays cribbage. He falls in love. He dishes on the human condition. He even sounds off on things like hope, trust and the meaning of Valentine's Day. Noah's a good news kind of guy who operates on the 100watt side of life. The only thing funnier than his laugh out loud exploits is the fact that the exploits say more about the rest of us than they do about a horse named Noah Vail.</description>

  <description>Never trust a soul—even your own. With Five Million Dollars and their lives on the line, can a determined criminologist and a beautiful con artist learn to trust each other—or themselves? Both are experts in the art of communications. Both are driven by their goals—but they’re on opposite sides of the law. When her father is kidnapped, they join forces—and learn that it’s hard to trust each other—or themselves.</description>

  <description>Meet Christy. She's all about Palouse. She was born in the town of Palouse, in the Palouse region of Washington State. Her family name is Palus, and her father is a descendant of the Palouse tribe. Watered down to a few drops. Still, it's something she is proud of. If someone had told her that she will become a predatory lender, betray her best friend, fall in love with a thief, and help her bosses bust up the bank she works for, she would have laughed out loud. This is the summer of 2006, and everyone knows you can make a killing in mortgage lending. Christy and her BFF Megan moved to the big city of Seattle to do just that. While Megan is already dreaming of hot cars and designer clothes, "good girl" Christy's ambitions are more modest. At first! So how is it her fault that she lands in the world of subprime lending; you know, the stuff that lost families their homes and wrecked our economy? When Christy is accepted into loan officer training, she realizes quickly that she doesn't have the job unless she can pass. But before the class ends, Big Lou turns everything upside down. A new day has come to mortgage banking, and every American family deserves to own a home. With the real estate market "hotter than a hot air balloon," how can homeowners lose? Or the bank, for that matter? Hello, NINJA loans! Leaving Megan behind, Christy climbs the corporate ladder, all the way to her very own corner office. Watch her squirm, attempting to hold on to what's right while being assaulted morally from every direction. And when the bubble bursts, her world comes crashing down! Is Christy the predatory lender?</description>

  <description>What happens when an Irish girl from the North Country meets a Jewish guy from the Bronx? He has poured half a box of detergent into a washing machine at their NYC apartment Laundry Room. When she walks in to do her wash, the floor is covered with bubbles. She tells him, "You've put way too much soap in." And their conversation continues for 47 years. Love is sprinkled with small incidents, petty fights, heartache, loss and regret. Poet Mary Allen Sochet reaches into her own story to take us through the times before and after her husband's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fifty years with someone, can you possibly start all over again? Does loss overshadow all that came before? "Time Out" shows us that even the most plain ordinary moments can hold as much importance as the milestones. Loss does not mark the end of the story.</description>

  <description>A story of old and new love. Granny has a secret. Hope falls for the boy next door. Her grandmother rekindles a relationship her family didn't approve of years before. Hope finds an old picture of her Grandma clutched in the embrace of a man with icy blue eyes. Who is he? Hope scoots out the door and back to her own room, dashes to the window, and peeks outside. The moonlight reveals a funny sight. Her beach-ball granny climbs a ladder like the prince climbed Rapunzel’s hair. A man stands at the bottom and holds it. He gazes up at Hope's window, and she shivers and lets the curtain drop. Grandma is a grown woman. Why is she sneaking around with this mystery man? What's going on? Why is my honest, respectful, Bible-reading granny slipping out her bedroom window in the middle of the night like some teen? This novel spans three generations of women, so all ages will enjoy it, though it is classified as a sweet YA.</description>

  <description>Yesterday's Daughter is full of suspense and surprises as the plot develops. It holds a mirror to contemporary society so we can consider our feelings about people who seem different from us, the assumptions we may make about other groups, and the consequences of those assumptions. Yesterday's Daughter is an emotionally laden paranormal vampire romance novel woven with layers of betrayal, love and loss. Grace Stone, who later learns her true identity is Sapphira, is a loner who survives abuse in the foster care system after being abandoned as a child. A brilliant student, she escapes from her brutal foster parents as a teenager and creates a life for herself. But, her life is little more than existence; plagued with questions about what she really is, a family that she has never known and the never-ending need to keep her differences hidden. She is alone and lonely, believing it will always remain so until Malachi appears in her life. Malachi, a Guardian of the vampire communities, has searched for his life mate, Sapphira, for decades. He refuses to cease searching for Sapphira even though she is believed dead by all. Conflict arises over the decades between Malachi and his family because of his refusals to accept another mate. But his very soul drives him on to continue his search, knowing that he could not exist if Sapphira were not in the world, somewhere.</description>

  <description>After years of enjoying the quiet, civilian life, former Recon Marine Brandon Colson still has a large price on his head. . . only his family doesn't know it. That is, until heavily armed terrorists break into his house and try to kill him and his family. After swiftly dispatching the would-be assassins, Colson realizes the ghosts from his past have somehow managed to come back to haunt him. His identity--a secret until now--has been mysteriously compromised. Something he did years ago has kept anger burning in the hearts of powerful Arab adversaries. With his family in hiding, Colson and local detective Sam Collier set out to locate and neutralize the remainder of the terrorist cell.</description>

  <description>This is not a book of jokes. It is Rosetta Schwartz's story of how humor shaped her long life and does include several funny experiences. It also demonstrates how humor got her and her family through some very rough patches. Born in 1909, Rosetta was the youngest of a family of ten children. They didn't have much money, but the riches of their zany antics and laughter overflowed into the neighborhood. That love of laughter continued throughout her long life. One of her fondest childhood memories was when neighbors knocked at their door, saying, "Can we come in and laugh with you?"Rosetta Schwartz (later Rosetta Shifrin and finally Rosetta Lachman) wrote this memoir in 1989 when she was 80 years old. Her daughter, author Morgan St. James, uncovered it and edited it in 2012, adding her own comments and those from some family members as Part II, along with a reprint of "Shopping For Dancing Shoes," Morgan's short story about Rosetta that is the first story in "Chicken Soup for the Shopper's Soul." She was a shining light-an inspiration to all. Her smile never dimmed, as seen on the cover photo taken by her grandson Jason Pransky when Rosetta was 95 years old. She passed away in 2006, just before her 97th birthday. We invite you to come on in and laugh with her.FROM THE BOOK: Edna was only four years older than me, but she took care of me like a little mother. Her wonderful sense of humor added to the feeling that living in our family was like being in a full time vaudeville show. There was something going on all the time, and quite often she was the instigator.We were the only family members to go to high school. The others were lucky if they got to stay in school till the eighth grade. Most of my brothers only made it to the sixth grade. As we grew older, she changed roles from little mother to best friend. Edna and I were as close as two peas in a pod our entire lives. She was a very smart, independent person and her personality sparkled. I loved being with her because she made me feel more confident about what I could do.My brother Charlie's biggest ambition was to be a drummer. He had begun to take lessons and would practice on his board or anything else that had a hard surface and was handy-walls, floors, sinks-you name it and Charlie drummed on it. He usually started his drumming in the living room, but it was very noisy. My mother chased him from the living room to the dining room and from the dining room to the kitchen. Finally he wound up on the back porch. Poor Charlie just couldn't win. As he drummed on the porch, the neighbors complained about the noise, and from the porch he went to the basement. But Charlie never gave up, kept practicing and finally did become a drummer.From the time my brother Meyer was in his late teens all the way to his early twenties, his only desire was to be was an actor. We were living on Ogden Avenue at that time and there was a huge mirror built into the living room wall that went all the way from the floor to the ceiling. Meyer bought a makeup kit and every day he stood in front of that big mirror trying out a different kind of makeup and practicing lines. One of my vivid childhood memories is that I never knew what my brother would look like, because he tried so many different faces.</description>

  <description>In response to recent turmoil in Egypt’s intelligence community, the CIA has recalled Beth Becker to active duty. Though she accepts the assignment, the backstabbing and deceit she finds festering within the Agency remind her why she retired from government work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, her husband, “Beck,” stays home in Red Wing, helping Chief Deputy Sheriff, Doug “Gunner” Gunderson, formulate what should be routine security plans for a visiting dignitary. But a less than stellar private security firm, and a determined sniper, result in a crisis situation that stretches our heroes’ abilities to their limits. Filled with intrigue, humor, and ripped-from-the-headlines action, THE EXILED ELEMENT will remind you why you came to love the Beckers in the first place.</description>

  <description>BLURB &lt;br /&gt;FACES BEHIND THE STONE &lt;br /&gt;Driving down the rocky path I saw the overgrown grass, weeds and poison ivy overtaking the outer perimeter of the bushes. The smell of mildew, the stench of the dried bones of animals killed by cars along this dirt road coming up from the ground, the sadness on the faces of the drivers in the cars behind us; you could feel the pain and sorrow. As you looked inside the cars and saw the faces of the drivers, you began to wonder what they were thinking, their thoughts and feelings as they travelled down life’s highway, possibly for the very last time. What stories lie behind the faces behind the wheel of each car? What stories lie hidden? Faces: So…so many stories. Here are seven that will make chills run down your spine and make you wonder: What lies behind the stones? Who lives there?</description>

  <description>This is an ACE for ISBN13:9781938243776 &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16187933.Bad_Choices" title="Bad Choices" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bad Choices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choices that you make today are the ones you will live with forever. As I drive through many different cemeteries you will hear the voices of those behind these stones. Some are old and worn while others are just beginning to fade as the memories of those teens whose names are on the stones. Bad Choices are made when teens become despondent, feel all alone, do not fit in or even just want to become popular at any cost to themselves or others. The ground is flat and filled with mold and mildew on some of the plots and stones while others are covered with moss. The newer graves that have just been dug have no bushes or grass as the occupants have just arrived and their graves have yet to settle. Get in the back seat of the limo and join the driver and find out just why each of these teens wound up behind the many different stones in the many different cemeteries you will be visiting. Bad Choices: we all make them but some are more costly than others. Open the door the driver is waiting and maybe you won’t wind up as a face behind the stones.</description>

  <description>It is 1904. A mysterious letter written in 1813 by an apparently dying man to his lover is discovered. This letter recounts the burying of a fabulous treasure brought out of Russia in 1812. It is a window on a story of love, war, struggles against adversity, betrayal, kidnapping, murder, and survival against the most terrible odds. This is a page turner of a story that you won't want to put down.</description>

  <description>Our journey through life begins new each morning. The totality of these days, one day at a time, is our life experience. It is different for each of us. There are, however, many similarities in our personal experiences. We each experience joy, grief, exuberance, humiliation, optimism, doubt, genius, foolishness, and of course, courage, and fear. We each are so similar in so many different ways it is hard to not see how connected we all are. My hope is to convey my feelings on my experiences so you know you are not alone in your journey each new morning to the next. This new book regards many such experiences in your day's journey that are similar to mine. I hope you find some resonance and solace through events during my life's journey Until Today.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32871188-amongst-my-enemies" rel="nofollow"&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;B006LAOIWY&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside an old German U-Boat rusting on the bottom of the Baltic lie millions in gold bars, stolen art, and a secret that could tear NATO apart. In this WW II spy versus spy action adventure thriller, the only one who knows the truth is Mike Randall, a battle-scarred American aviator who survived the bitter winter of 1945 in the battered old port city of Konigsberg. After his B-17 crashed in East Prussia, rather than internment in a German POW camp or being executed as a spy, Randall and one crew mate find a worse fate, being thrown into in a Nazi forced labor battalion clearing rubble in the frozen hell of the north Baltic shore. Also trapped in Konigsberg is Kapitan Eric Bruckner and one of Germany’s last surviving U-Boats. Bruckner has been ordered east to meet with SS Major Heinz Kruger, Martin Bormann’s sinister hatchet man, for a top secret mission. When a British bomber sends the U-573 to the bottom of the Baltic, it carries a secret that only Mike Randall knows. Seven years later, in this cold war military political thriller, when he does speak up, Randall puts a target on his own forehead, one which the Russians, the West Germans, the U-boat’s former Nazi owners, the US government, and even the Israeli Mossad quickly take aim at. In this KGB CIA spy thriller, some want the gold, some want Randall dead, and some want proof that there is a high-ranking spy inside NATO itself. What Randall wants is much simpler in this historic military political thriller novel. Caught between the Kremlin, spies, killers, and a new, deadly, 4th Reich, he wants his revenge and to satisfy some old debts with a steel-jacketed bullet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy good action adventure thriller novels, put this new fast-moving, conspiracy mystery in your Cart. It is from the author of Burke’s Gamble, Burke’s War, The Undertaker, Winner Lose All, Thursday at Noon, and Aim True, My Brothers, with over 500 Kindle 5-Star Reviews. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>Bonnie, age four, along with four of her siblings, was taken from her home in rural Canada and placed with the Children's Aid Society. Over the next fourteen years, the children are split up and reunited multiple times, always hoping to find one another again. By luck or providence, the four sisters spend the majority of their lives together working on a tobacco farm and living in an attic, where the stovepipe offers warmth, comfort, and news from the outside world. Surviving some of the worst torments a child can know, Bonnie and her sisters form an unbreakable bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an unflinching voice, Virag's memoir engrosses readers with not only the darkness that she endured but, more important, the siblings' ability to create a sense of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unforgettable story is informed by Bonnie's recollections, remembrances from her sisters, and the official records of the Children's Aid Society.</description>

Exploring the terrain of love against the backdrop of places as far apart as Hunter Mountain, NY, and Alexandria, Egypt, Ellenelizabeth uses poetry as both roadmap and script. Each poem is transporting, each page takes us further away. For the romantic that resides in every beating poetic heart.</description>

  <description>Set in the romantic city of Cape Town, Storm tries to force a proposal from Trevor, and instead, she meets Jarred. Trevor has been preparing himself for what he plans for Storm, which is not quite what she expects. When she tells Trevor that she is carrying Jarred's baby, she releases true evil in Trevor. Storm, feeling that he ruined her life, refuses to have anything to do with Jarred, but he pursues her relentlessly. Donna, Storms roommate, bears the brunt of Trevor's anger. Elle, Trevor's sister, a fact unknown to them, makes it her mission to catch Trevor and bring him to justice, but he draws power from her for his evil purposes. Their mother senses what Trevor is doing and she uses her considerable knowledge and experience as a witch to curtail him. For a while it works, but he soon gathers his power, which he uses to his unfair advantage on Storm. Would Sybil and her helpers get through to Storm before she makes the mistake of her life!</description>

  <description>A modern day version of &lt;i&gt;Grapes of Wrath&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cry Into the Wind&lt;/i&gt; offers a revealing glimpse into the dysfunctional existence of an American Family and the healing power of duty, love and reconciliation. &lt;p&gt;Othello's recount of her childhood, of the truck that was the only home she knew during the first six years of her life, the two-room shack that claimed her mother's life in a tragic fire, the abusive behavior of an alcoholic father, and the eleven long years she spent with her siblings at an Oklahoma orphanage, is captivating. Recording her memories in a simple yet touching style, Othello conveys strength of emotions that have been distilled and clarified over time. &lt;i&gt;Cry Into the Wind&lt;/i&gt; is a story of triumph over adversity: a testimony to the strength of the American Spirit and a valuable source of inspiration for those struggling to overcome the effects of an abusive childhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
