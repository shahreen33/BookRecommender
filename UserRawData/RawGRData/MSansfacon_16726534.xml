  <description>Any wish fulfilled for the right price. That's the promise the organization behind The Desire Card gives to its elite clients - but sometimes the price may be more menacing than anyone could ever imagine. Harrison Stockton has lived an adult life of privilege and excess: a high-powered job on Wall Street fuels his fondness for alcohol and pills at the expense of a family he has no time for. Quite suddenly all of this comes crashing to a halt when he loses his job and at the same time discovers he almost certainly has only months left to live. Desperate, and with seemingly nowhere else left to turn, Harrison activates his Desire Card. What follows is a gritty and gripping quest that takes him from New York City to the slums of Mumbai and forces him to take chances, and make decisions, he never thought he'd ever have to face. When his moral descent threatens his wife and children, Harrison must decide whether to save himself at any cost, or do what's right and break his bargain with the mysterious group behind The Desire Card. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Desire Card is a taut fast-paced thriller, from internationally acclaimed author Lee Matthew Goldberg, that explores what a man will do to survive when money isn't always enough to get everything he desires.</description>

  <description>Gavin tells Delilah he’s hers—completely—but whatever lives inside that house with him disagrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seven years tucked away at an East coast boarding school, Delilah Blue returns to her small Kansas hometown to find that not much has changed. Her parents are still uptight and disinterested, her bedroom is exactly the way she left it, and the outcast Gavin Timothy still looks like he’s crawled out of one of her dark, twisted drawings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delilah is instantly smitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavin has always lived in the strange house: an odd building isolated in a stand of trees where the town gives in to mild wilderness. The house is an irresistible lure for Delilah, but the tall fence surrounding it exists for good reason, and Gavin urges Delilah to be careful. Whatever lives with him there isn’t human, and isn’t afraid of hurting her to keep her away.</description>

  <description>Returning early from a disastrous date night with my husband, I know something is wrong the moment the wheels crunch the gravel drive of our home. Inside, the TV is on and a half-eaten meal waits on the table. My heart stops when I find our little girl is alone in the house and our babysitter, Sasha, is missing…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days later, when I’m arrested for Sasha’s murder and torn away from my perfect little family, I’ll wish I had told someone about the threatening note I received that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll hate myself for not finding out who the gift hidden inside my husband’s wardrobe was for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll scream from the rooftops that I’m innocent – but no one will listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will realise I was completely wrong about everything that happened that night…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will you believe me?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In book three of the popular Jumbies series, Corinne must use her emerging supernatural powers to battle the angry god who would destroy her Caribbean island home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When an out-of-season hurricane sweeps through Corinne’s seaside village, Corinne knows it’s not a typical storm. At first Corinne believes Mama D’Leau—the powerful and cruel jumbie who rules the ocean—has caused the hurricane. Then a second, even more ferocious storm wrecks the island, sending villagers fleeing their houses for shelter in the mountains, and Corinne discovers the storms weren’t caused by a jumbie, but by the angry god Huracan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now Corinne, with the help of her friends and even some of her enemies, must race against time to find out what has angered Huracan and try to fix it before her island home is destroyed forever.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Lila Bennett’s bad choices have finally caught up with her. And one of those decisions has split her life in two. Literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one life, she’s taken hostage by someone who appears to be a stranger but knows too much. As she’s trapped in a concrete cell, her kidnapper forces her to face what she’s done or be killed. In an alternate life, she eludes her captor but is hunted by someone who is dismantling her happiness, exposing one secret at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila’s decorated career as a criminal defense attorney, her marriage, and her life are on the line. She must make a list of those she’s wronged—both in and out of the courtroom—to determine who is out to get her before it’s too late. But even if she can pinpoint her assailant, will she survive? And if she does, which parts of her life are worth saving, and which parts must die? Because one thing’s for certain—life as Lila Bennett knew it is over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Checking Out&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dry Hard&lt;/i&gt; comes a hilarious story about losing the love of your life, and finding yourself in the aftermath.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ollie Sweet is very publicly dumped by ‘The One’, his seemingly perfect world dissolves into misery, self-pity, and a bizarre rooftop meeting with a suicidal man in flip-flops. While most would seek out the support of loved ones at such a torrid time, natural-born journalist Ollie asks the subscribers of his website: how did &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; get over &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; failed relationships?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ollie follows some of their more extreme advice, chaos inevitably ensues, including accidentally exposing himself to some unsuspecting wildlife, jumping out of a perfectly serviceable aeroplane, and suffering from an &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; painful bottom, courtesy of a maniacal Scotsman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, all of this goes down a storm with his online following, and Ollie soon finds himself the centre of everyone’s attention – whether he likes it or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his eclectic collection of supporters to guide him, can Ollie mend his broken heart, heal his broken bottom, and learn to find happiness again?</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Georgia Boone has seen the shadow creatures in mirrors and other reflective surfaces since she was six-years-old. But no one--not even her brother, the person she’s closest to in the entire world--believes her. She is all alone in the hellish world where crow-like creatures hunting her everywhere she goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an afternoon of shopping ends in violence and blood, Georgia is sent to the UK’s most prestigious mental health hospitals: Brookwood Hospital. There, she’s forced to face her fears and answer the question: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are the shadows real, or is this all in her head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Brookwood, the shadow creatures are more present than ever and are getting stronger every day. Only with the help of a mysterious boy who lives inside the mirror world might she be able to prove that she’s not hallucinating and stop the shadows from destroying the human world.</description>

  <description>Life is a mixed bag for Piper Calloway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, she’s a twenty-nine-year-old VP at her dad’s multibillion-dollar real estate development firm, and living the high single life with her two best friends in a swanky downtown penthouse. On the other hand, she’s considered a pair of sexy legs in a male-dominated world and constantly has to prove her worth. Plus, she’s stuck seeing her narcissistic ex-fiancé—a fellow VP—on the other side of her glass office wall every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things get exponentially more complicated for Piper when she runs into Kyle Miller—the handsome new security guard at Calloway Group Industries, and coincidentally the first love of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy she hasn’t seen or heard from since they were summer camp counsellors together. The guy from the wrong side of the tracks. The guy who &lt;i&gt;apparently&lt;/i&gt; doesn’t even remember her name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper may be a high-powered businesswoman now, but she soon realizes that her schoolgirl crush is not only alive but stronger than ever, and crippling her concentration. What’s more, despite Kyle’s distant attitude, she’s convinced their reunion isn’t at all coincidental, and that his feelings for her still run deep. And she’s determined to make him admit to them, no matter the consequences.</description>

  <description>In the city of Craewick, memories reign. The power-obsessed ruler of the city, Madame, has cultivated a society in which memories are currency, citizens are divided by ability, and Gifted individuals can take memories from others through touch as they please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Etta Lark is desperate to live outside of the corrupt culture, but grapples with the guilt of an accident that has left her mother bedridden in the city’s asylum. When Madame threatens to put her mother up for auction, a Craewick practice in which a “criminal's" memories are sold to the highest bidder before being killed, Etta will do whatever it takes to save her. Even if it means rejoining the Shadows, the rebel group she swore off in the wake of the accident years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove her allegiance to the Shadows and rescue her mother, Etta must steal a memorized map of the Maze, a formidable prison created by the bloodthirsty ruler of a neighboring Realm. So she sets out on a journey in which she faces startling attacks, unexpected romance, and, above all, her own past in order to set things right in her world.</description>

Moving across the country seems like the perfect chance to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their isolated new neighborhood, Skye manages to fit in, but Deirdre withdraws from everyone, becoming fixated on the swampy woods behind their house and building monstrous sculptures out of sticks and bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Deirdre disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when something awful comes scratching at Skye's window in the middle of the night, claiming she's the only one who can save Deirdre, Skye knows she will stop at nothing to bring her sister home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

  <description>In the heart of Venice, a woman is sacrificed to a forgotten god, sparking a mystery lost for thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Penelope Bryne is ridiculed by the academic community for her quest to find the remnants of Atlantis, but when an ancient and mysterious script is found at a murder site, she flies to Venice determined to help the police before the killer strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope has spent her entire life trying to ignore the unexplainable and magical history of Atlantis, but when she meets the enigmatic Alexis Donato, everything she believes will be challenged. Little does she know, Alexis has spent the last three years doing his best to sabotage Penelope’s career so doesn’t learn the truth—Atlantis had seven magicians who survived, and who he has a duty to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Alexis draws her into the darkly, seductive world of magic and history, Penelope will have to use her heart as well as her head if she is to find the answers she seeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new MOSE system due to come online, and Carnivale exploding around them, Penelope and Alexis will have to work together to stop the killer and prevent dark magic from pulling Venice into the sea.</description>

  <description>You just dropped off your child at the bus stop. A panicked stranger calls your phone. Your child has been kidnapped, and the stranger explains that their child has also been kidnapped, by a completely different stranger. The only way to get your child back is to kidnap another child within 24 hours. Your child will be released only when the next victim's parents kidnap yet another child, and most importantly, the stranger explains, if you don't kidnap a child, or if the next parents don't kidnap a child, your child will be murdered. You are now part of The Chain.</description>

  <description>By day, seventeen-year-old Kiera Johnson is an honors student, a math tutor, and one of the only Black kids at Jefferson Academy. But at home, she joins hundreds of thousands of Black gamers who duel worldwide as Nubian personas in the secret multiplayer online role-playing card game, SLAY. No one knows Kiera is the game developer, not her friends, her family, not even her boyfriend, Malcolm, who believes video games are partially responsible for the "downfall of the Black man."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a teen in Kansas City is murdered over a dispute in the SLAY world, news of the game reaches mainstream media, and SLAY is labeled a racist, exclusionist, violent hub for thugs and criminals. Even worse, an anonymous troll infiltrates the game, threatening to sue Kiera for "anti-white discrimination."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven to save the only world in which she can be herself, Kiera must preserve her secret identity and harness what it means to be unapologetically Black in a world intimidated by Blackness. But can she protect her game without losing herself in the process?</description>

  <description>She's the seduction expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women contact her to take over their love lives. She steps in when they're lost, she's supposed to succeed where they failed. She handles their single status, their relationships, their breakups, and very often their partners' affairs. Her job is a life priority, she spends most of her time at the office or between two flights in business class and the fact of having a sports car that can reach one hundred kilometers in less than six seconds often make her feel like a superheroine in service to women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, take her card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll see, it's much better than spending holidays in St Barts.</description>

  <description>An adaptation of Shaftesbury's award-winning, groundbreaking queer vampire web series of the same name, Carmilla mixes the camp of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the snark of Veronica Mars, and the mysterious atmosphere of Welcome to Nightvale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly escaped from the stifling boredom of a small town, college freshman Laura is ready to make the most of her first year at Silas University. But when her roommate, Betty, vanishes and a sarcastic, nocturnal philosophy student named Carmilla moves into Betty's side of the room, Laura decides to play detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out Betty isn't the first girl to go missing ? she's just the first girl not to come back. All over campus, girls have been vanishing, and they are completely changed when (or if) they return. Even more disturbing are the strange dreams they recount: smothering darkness, and a strange pale figure haunting their rooms. Dreams that Laura is starting to have herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Laura closes in on the answers, tensions rise with Carmilla. Is this just a roommate relationship that isn't working out, or does Carmilla know more than she's letting on about the disappearances? What will Laura do if it turns out her roommate isn't just selfish and insensitive, but completely inhuman? And what will she do with the feelings she's starting to have for Carmilla?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produced by Shaftesbury, and available on the YouTube channel KindaTV, Carmilla is a global sensation. A scripted transmedia series that puts a modern spin on the cult-classic gothic vampire novella by Joseph Sheridan LeFanu, Carmilla has generated over 71 million views and 245 million minutes of watch time across three seasons since its launch in 2014. It has been translated into more than 20 languages and also been made into a feature film. Author Kim Turrisi brings her trademark humor and sensitivity to an adaptation that offers a deep dive for existing fans and a portal for new fans around the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For generations, the princes of Ilara have married the most beautiful maidens from the ocean village of Varenia. But though every girl longs to be chosen as the next princess, the cost of becoming royalty is higher than any of them could ever imagine…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor once dreamed of seeing the wondrous wealth and beauty of Ilara, the kingdom that’s ruled her village for as long as anyone can remember. But when a childhood accident left her with a permanent scar, it became clear that her identical twin sister, Zadie, would likely be chosen to marry the Crown Prince—while Nor remained behind, unable to ever set foot on land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Zadie is gravely injured, and Nor is sent to Ilara in her place. To Nor’s dismay, her future husband, Prince Ceren, is as forbidding and cold as his home—a castle carved into a mountain and devoid of sunlight. And as she grows closer to Ceren’s brother, the charming Prince Talin, Nor uncovers startling truths about a failing royal bloodline, a murdered queen… and a plot to destroy the home she was once so eager to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save her people, Nor must learn to negotiate the treacherous protocols of a court where lies reign and obsession rules. But discovering her own formidable strength may be the one move that costs her everything: the crown, Varenia and Zadie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a world where magic thrives in secret city corners, a group of magicians embark on a road trip—and it’s the "no-love-interest", found family adventure you’ve been searching for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Blythe is one of seven Guardians: magicians powerful enough to cause worldwide panic with a snap of their fingers. But Blythe spends her days pouring latte art at her family’s coffee shop, so why should she care about having apocalyptic abilities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s given a reason when magician anarchists crash into said coffee shop and kidnap her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartbroken but determined, Blythe knows she can’t save them alone. A war is brewing between two magician governments and tensions are too high. So, she packs up her family’s bright yellow Volkswagen, puts on a playlist, and embarks on a road trip across the United States to enlist the help of six strangers whose abilities are unparalleled—the other Guardians.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Tanner Scott’s family relocated from California to Utah, a move that nudged the bisexual teen temporarily back into the closet. Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High’s prestigious Seminar—where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester—Tanner can’t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class. And it takes less than a month for Tanner to fall completely in love with him.</description>

  <description>The Maasai Mara Sleeping Syndrome has returned after a six-month hiatus. This time, it's popped up in New York, and it's wiped out an entire homeless shelter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same night of the outbreak, Harper, a seventeen-year-old girl, stumbles across a glowing figure in the desert outskirts of her neighborhood. As her suburb goes on lockdown, Harper finds herself isolated from her friends and family, and soon begins to suspect that the events — though thousands of miles apart — may have something in common. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper must find her bravery and embark on a plot-twisting adventure that will have her looking for answers in unexpected places... and worlds.</description>

  <description>THE EAST END is an atmospheric debut novel of family secrets and scandal, of love and heartbreak, of working class struggle versus the privileges of the super wealthy, all set in a place whose incredible beauty means both pleasure and pain – a place where people will die for love, kill for truth, and dream of escaping forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE EAST END opens with Corey Halpern, a Hamptons local from a broken home who breaks into mansions at night for kicks. He likes the rush and admittedly, the escapism. One night just before Memorial Day weekend, he breaks into the wrong home at the wrong time: the Sheffield estate where he and his mother work. Under the cover of darkness, their boss Leo Sheffield -- billionaire CEO, patriarch, and owner of the vast lakeside manor -- arrives unexpectedly with his lover, Henry. After a shocking poolside accident leaves Henry dead, everything depends on Leo burying the truth. But unfortunately for him, Corey saw what happened and there are other eyes in the shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hordes of family and guests are coming to the estate the next morning, including Leo's surly wife, all expecting a lavish vacation weekend of poolside drinks, evening parties, and fireworks filling the sky. No one can know there’s a dead man in the woods, and there is no one Leo can turn to. With his very life on the line, everything will come down to a split-second decision. For all of the main players—Leo, Gina, and Corey alike—time is ticking down, and the world they’ve known is set to explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through multiple points of view, THE EAST END highlights the socio-economic divide in the Hamptons, but also how the basic human need for connection and trust can transcend class differences. Secrecy, obsession, and desperation dictate each character’s path. In a race against time, each critical moment holds life in the balance as Corey, Gina, and Leo approach a common breaking point. THE EAST END is a propulsive read, rich with character and atmosphere, and marks the emergence of a talented new voice in fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kristen Ciccarelli’s distinct brand of lyrical, haunting fantasy continues in the companion to her bestselling debut, &lt;em&gt;The Last Namsara&lt;/em&gt;. Perfect for fans of Kristin Cashore and Renee Ahdieh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once there were two sisters born with a bond so strong that it forged them together forever. Roa and Essie called it the hum. It was a magic they cherished—until the day a terrible accident took Essie’s life and trapped her soul in this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dax—the heir to Firgaard’s throne—was responsible for the accident. Roa swore to hate him forever. But eight years later he returned, begging for her help. He was determined to dethrone his cruel father, under whose oppressive reign Roa’s people had suffered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roa made him a deal: she’d give him the army he needed if he made her queen. Only as queen could she save her people from Firgaard’s rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a chance arises to right every wrong—an opportunity for Roa to rid herself of this enemy king and rescue her beloved sister. During the Relinquishing, when the spirits of the dead are said to return, Roa discovers she can reclaim her sister for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she has to do is kill the king.</description>

  <description>All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Silver Melody lives in a world where 80% of the population has modified their DNA. Known as the altereds, those people now possess enhancements like wings, tails, and increased strength or intelligence. Although Silver’s parents created the nanite pill used to deliver these genetic modifications, Silver is proud of her unadjusted state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when the president declares all unadjusteds must take a nanite, Silver has no choice but to flee the city with her father and some friends to prevent the extinction of the unadjusteds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Silver’s mother in prison for treason, Silver’s father is the unadjusteds’ only hope at finding a cure. But time is running out as Silver’s father is captured by the president’s almost immortal army. Vicious hellhounds are on Silver’s trail, and her only chance to recover her father involves teaming up with a new group of unlikely friends before all humanity is lost.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if America had a royal family? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When America won the Revolutionary War, its people offered General George Washington a crown. Two and a half centuries later, the House of Washington still sits on the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Princess Beatrice gets closer to becoming America's first queen regnant, the duty she has embraced her entire life suddenly feels stifling. Nobody cares about the spare except when she's breaking the rules, so Princess Samantha doesn't care much about anything, either . . . except the one boy who is distinctly off-limits to her. And then there's Samantha's twin, Prince Jefferson. If he'd been born a generation earlier, he would have stood first in line for the throne, but the new laws of succession make him third. Most of America adores their devastatingly handsome prince . . . but two very different girls are vying to capture &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet Bryce Davison, a gifted psychologist who can heal any troubled mind-except his own. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, Bryce's life is falling apart. His marriage is crumbling. His insomnia brings only half-sleep and troubled dreams-visions of dark and buried memories he'd rather forget or ignore completely. And the new female patient in his psych ward just might be more trouble than he's able to cope with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and now he has a stalker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody's been watching Bryce for a long time. Somebody who knows his life inside and out-his fears, his regrets, his greatest longings and deepest despairs. Somebody with access to his most private places-his workplace, his home, his family...anywhere Bryce might have felt safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do their dirty work in the shadows... and they want Bryce Davison dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Bryce has got to get his life together. To save his patients. To save his family. To save his marriage...and his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because no matter how close Bryce gets to the deadly truth, the enigmatic stalker is always closer than he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of psychological thrillers like &lt;i&gt;I Am Watching You&lt;/i&gt; by Teresa Driscoll, &lt;i&gt;Stillhouse Lake&lt;/i&gt; by Rachel Caine, and &lt;i&gt;No Exit&lt;/i&gt; by Taylor Adams will love this book.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is crazy twisted. I thought that the incidents that kept happening to Bryce were weird, until everything unfolded and everything made sense. The psychologist perspective on a stalker are different from other stalkerish stories, but I felt like this one was forced, like the author tried...]]>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Will Dimple and Rishi find their happily ever after? Find out in this funny, romantic, endlessly charming e-novella sequel to the New York Times bestseller When Dimple Met Rishi!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimple Shah has a lot of opinions about marriage, but they boil down to this: It’s not for her. Sure, she loves her boyfriend, Rishi, but why does she need to validate that with an institution that has historically never favored the woman? Why go through all that hassle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rishi Patel deeply disagrees. He believes in the power that comes with combining love and tradition, and when the time comes, wants nothing more than to honor those things in a huge celebration with his friends and family. He knows Dimple loves him, but in hearing her rant about how marriage is a “construct of hegemonic masculinity” for the millionth time, a small, niggling part of him worries that it’s not the institution of marriage Dimple has a problem with; maybe it’s him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two lovebirds find themselves at a philosophical impasse. Can they find a way to work it out, or does kismet have other plans?</description>

  <description>In the former United States, sixteen-year-old Noam Álvaro wakes up in a hospital bed, the sole survivor of the viral magic that killed his family and made him a technopath. His ability to control technology attracts the attention of the minister of defense and thrusts him into the magical elite of the nation of Carolinia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The son of undocumented immigrants, Noam has spent his life fighting for the rights of refugees fleeing magical outbreaks—refugees Carolinia routinely deports with vicious efficiency. Sensing a way to make change, Noam accepts the minister’s offer to teach him the science behind his magic, secretly planning to use it against the government. But then he meets the minister’s son—cruel, dangerous, and achingly beautiful—and the way forward becomes less clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught between his purpose and his heart, Noam must decide who he can trust and how far he’s willing to go in pursuit of the greater good.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;From the author of the beloved Ruth Galloway series, a modern gothic mystery for fans of &lt;i&gt;Magpie Murders&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Lake House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clare Cassidy is no stranger to murder. A high school English teacher specializing in the Gothic writer R. M. Holland, she teaches a course on it every year. But when one of Clare’s colleagues and closest friends is found dead, with a line from R. M. Holland’s most famous story, “The Stranger,” left by her body, Clare is horrified to see her life collide with the storylines of her favourite literature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To make matters worse, the police suspect the killer is someone Clare knows. Unsure whom to trust, she turns to her closest confidant, her diary, the only outlet she has for her darkest suspicions and fears about the case. Then one day she notices something odd. Writing that isn't hers, left on the page of an old diary: "Hallo, Clare. You don’t know me." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Clare becomes more certain than ever: “The Stranger” has come to terrifying life. But can the ending be rewritten in time?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Bolstering its reputation is research that strongly suggests that a keto diet &lt;b&gt;may help reverse diabetes&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;obesity&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;cancer&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;the effects of aging&lt;/b&gt;. However, in order to reap the benefits, you need to stick to the keto plan at every meal. That can be challenging when eating breakfast during your commute or figuring out what to eat for dinner after a long day. And what to do about lunch? Especially when your lunch "hour" may be 10 minutes at your desk. With &lt;i&gt;Keto All Day&lt;/i&gt; you won't be tempted to blow your keto diet on a carb-filled snack or a processed convenience meal simply because you are tired, rushed, or just don't know what to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enjoy tasty, flavorful recipes for&lt;b&gt; snacks&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;meals&lt;/b&gt;, such Breakfast Egg Muffins, Pizza Waffles, Carrot Cake Oatmeal, Southern Duck Deviled Eggs, Eggplant Parma Ham Rolls, and Taco Frittata. &lt;i&gt;Keto All Day&lt;/i&gt; even has recipes for delicious &lt;b&gt;drinks&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;desserts&lt;/b&gt;, including Cookie Dough Mousse, Boston Cream Pie, and Raspberry Lime Electrolyte Cooler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reap the benefits of the amazing keto diet in a delicious way with &lt;i&gt;Keto All Day&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Pull up a lounge chair and have a cocktail at Sunset Beach – it comes with a twist.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drue Campbell’s life is adrift. Out of a job and down on her luck, life doesn’t seem to be getting any better when her estranged father, Brice Campbell, a flamboyant personal injury attorney, shows up at her mother’s funeral after a twenty-year absence. Worse, he’s remarried – to Drue’s eighth grade frenemy, Wendy, now his office manager. And they’re offering her a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the job from hell, but the offer is sweetened by the news of her inheritance – her grandparents’ beach bungalow in the sleepy town of Sunset Beach, a charming but storm-damaged eyesore now surrounded by waterfront McMansions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other prospects, Drue begrudgingly joins the firm, spending her days screening out the grifters whose phone calls flood the law office. Working with Wendy is no picnic either. But when a suspicious death at an exclusive beach resort nearby exposes possible corruption at her father’s firm, she goes from unwilling cubicle rat to unwitting investigator, and is drawn into a case that may – or may not – involve her father. With an office romance building, a decades-old missing persons case re-opened, and a cottage in rehab, one thing is for sure at Sunset Beach: there’s a storm on the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sunset Beach &lt;/i&gt;is a compelling ride, full of Mary Kay Andrews' signature wit, heart, and charm.</description>

  <description>Littleport, Maine is like two separate towns: a vacation paradise for wealthy holidaymakers and a simple harbour community for the residents who serve them. Friendships between locals and visitors are unheard of - but that's just what happened with Avery Greer and Sadie Loman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each summer for a decade the girls are inseparable - until Sadie is found dead. When the police rule the death a suicide, Avery can't help but feel there are those in the community, including a local detective and Sadie's brother Parker, who blame her. Someone knows more than they're saying, and Avery is intent on clearing her name before the facts get twisted against her.</description>

  <description>Norris Kaplan is clever, cynical, and quite possibly too smart for his own good. A black French Canadian, he knows from watching American sitcoms that those three things don’t bode well when you are moving to Austin, Texas. Plunked into a new high school and sweating a ridiculous amount from the oppressive Texas heat, Norris finds himself cataloging everyone he meets: the Cheerleaders, the Jocks, the Loners, and even the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Making a ton of friends has never been a priority for him, and this way he can at least amuse himself until it’s time to go back to Canada, where he belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, against all odds, those labels soon become actual people to Norris. Be it loner Liam, who makes it his mission to befriend Norris, or Madison the beta cheerleader, who is so nice that it has to be a trap. Not to mention Aarti the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, who might, in fact, be a real love interest in the making. He even starts playing actual hockey with these Texans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the night of the prom, Norris screws everything up royally. As he tries to pick up the pieces, he realizes it might be time to stop hiding behind his snarky opinions and start living his life—along with the people who have found their way into his heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is, in its own way, a fresh view on the high school experience. I wanted to read it because the synopsis was really interesting, but also because Norris was from Montreal, where I am. <br /><br />I loved the categorization that Norris did on his notebook, I loved his sarcasm.

  <description>How twisted do you like your fairy tales?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half-woman, half-cockroach fused in a bizarre gardening accident? That would be Mrs Jittery Twitch, dwelling in the shadows of our misdeeds. If in danger, you can call upon her help… all she asks is your soul as payment. But she’s just a legend, so no need to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barry Harris is a 28-year-old man, still living with his dear old mum in a little flat above a hairdresser. His obsession with Star Trek and the martial arts won’t help him when he’s forced out on a date.&lt;br /&gt;And nobody knows about the weird string of events that’s about to put everyone’s lives in danger. A trio of samurai warriors and the strangest offer of help lead Barry on a perilous mission to save the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This book is the second in the Prophecy Allocation series but works fine as a standalone read.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why you should read this book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It explains revolutionary insights into the nature of reality that debunk the myth of free will (probably).&lt;br /&gt;It proves the multiverse has only two parallel universes (depending on your criteria for what makes up proof).&lt;br /&gt;It contains 50% extra innuendo-based gags than Book One in the series. Some of them might be considered funny (again this is relative).&lt;br /&gt;The author achieved a heightened dynamic tension not found in other books. He was heavily constipated during its creation. There may be a link. The author is no way suggesting that this makes it better than every other book ever written. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: The book is written in British English. All British slang terms are helpfully translated for the international reader, along with a short explanation of why British people are a little strange.</description>

  <description>Foster Stewart knows she's different. Her life has never been "normal." Talking to plants and controlling cloud formations aren't things most seventeen year olds are into. Tate "Nighthawk" Taylor is perfect. Star quarterback and all around dreamy boy next door he never thought about his "extra" abilities. What quarterback wouldn't want night vision? That's not weird, right? It's cool! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the night of their first meeting a deadly tornado brings them together and awakens their true abilities - the power to control the element air. Unbeknown to Tate and Foster, they are the first in a group of teens that were genetically manipulated before birth to bond with the elements. Which truly sucks for Foster, as she has to face the fact that Dr. Rick Stewart, her beloved scientist father, betrayed her and now wants to use her and the others for his own nefarious world domination plot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foster and Tate must stop Dr. Stewart and his minions before he destroys their lives and the world.</description>

  <description>What happened to Amanda Holmes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, she washed up on shore in a rowboat with a gash to the head after an overnight at Camp Macaw. No one was ever charged with a crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the MacAllister children are all grown up. After their parents die suddenly, they return to Camp to read the will and decide what to do with the prime real estate it's sitting on. Ryan, the oldest, wants to sell. Margo, the family's center, hasn't made up her mind. Mary has her own horse farm to run, and believes in leaving well-enough alone. Kate and Liddie—the twins—have opposing views. And Sean Booth, the family groundskeeper, just hopes he still has a home when all is said and done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the will is read and they learn that it's much more complicated than a simple vote. Until they unravel the mystery of what happened to Amanda, they can't move forward. Any one of them could have done it, and all of them are hiding key pieces of the puzzle. Will they work together to solve the mystery, or will their suspicions and secrets finally tear the family apart?</description>

  <description>Quatre ans après la parution de Parce qu'on a tous de la visite, Ricardo nous revient avec un quatrième livre de cuisine, cette fois dédié à la mijoteuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out la mijoteuse des années 70 dans lesquelles les « matantes » cuisaient des plats bruns dépourvus de saveurs, In la mijoteuse qui nous permet la préparation de mets savoureux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ricardo est tombé en amour avec la mijoteuse en créant ce livre de cuisine, lui qui la boudait depuis longtemps! Il nous propose des recettes savoureuses, allant du chou farci étagé à la joue de veau braisée aux figues en passant par les côtes levées et la traditionnelle lasagne. Tout se veut simple à préparer, goûteux et économique. Et pour les dents sucrées, de belles surprises telles que les brownies, la crème caramel et le gâteau au fromage. De quoi sortir la mijoteuse de son rôle traditionnel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Une véritable solution à la conciliation travail-famille!</description>

Her sister Caliza is busy running the kingdom after their mother's death, but all Thia can do is think of all she has lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Caliza is forced to agree to a marriage between Thia and the crown prince of Illucia, Thia is finally spurred into action.

I really enjoyed it, but some lengths in the story and a detail that bothered me made it a 3-stars read for me.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fierce young female adventurer battles time itself to claim her destiny in a sweeping new fantasy saga from the author of the Hundredth Queen series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everley Donovan is living on borrowed time. The lone survivor of her family’s unexplained assassination, she was saved by an ingeniously crafted clockwork heart. But the time she was given won’t last forever. Now, every tick-tock reminds her how fragile her existence is and hastens her quest to expose Killian Markham, the navy admiral who shattered her world and left her for dead. But Everley’s hunt for justice will be a long and hard-won voyage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her journey takes her to a penal colony on a cursed isle, where she will be married off and charged to build the new world. It is here, and beyond, that hidden realms hide, treasures are unearthed, her family secrets are buried, and young love will test the strength of her makeshift heart. When Everley discovers Markham may not be who he seems, her pursuit for truth is bound to his redemption, her tragic history, and her astonishing destiny.</description>

  <description>Meet Sissy. She's an arse-kicking, smart-mouthed chick from the Aussie outback. In fact, she's anything but what her name implies. She likes her men complex and her life simple, but all that is about to change.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You see Sissy's just woken up from a little nap to find she's been missing for five years. Now Aliens from a far off planet are either lining up to hire her or attempting to kill her, and that's all before she's had her morning coffee.</description>

  <description>Vesper Montgomery can summon your worst fear and turn it into a reality—but she’s learned the hard way that it’s an addicting and dangerous power. One wrong move and you could hurt someone you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she earns a spot in the Tournament of the Unraveling, where competitors battle it out for a chance to rewrite the past, Vesper finally has a shot to reverse the mistakes that have changed her forever. She turns to Sam Hardy, a former MMA fighter who’s also carrying a tragedy he desperately wants to undo. However, helping heal Sam’s heart will mean breaking her own, and the competition forces her to master her powers—powers she has been terrified of since they destroyed her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A SACRED OATH&lt;br /&gt;A FALLEN ANGEL&lt;br /&gt;A FORBIDDEN LOVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance was not part of Nora Grey's plan. She's never been particularly attracted to the boys at her school, no matter how hard her best friend, Vee, pushes them at her. Not until Patch comes along. With his easy smile and eyes that seem to see inside her, Patch draws Nora to him against her better judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a series of terrifying encounters, Nora's not sure whom to trust. Patch seems to be everywhere she is and seems to know more about her than her closest friends. She can't decide whether she should fall into his arms or run and hide. And when she tries to seek some answers, she finds herself near a truth that is way more unsettling than anything Patch makes her feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For she is right in the middle of an ancient battle between the immortal and those that have fallen - and, when it comes to choosing sides, the wrong choice will cost Nora her life.</description>

  <description>Sera has always felt as if she didn’t belong among her people, the Cerulean. She is curious about everything and can’t stop questioning her three mothers, her best friend, Leela, and even the High Priestess. Sera has longed for the day when the tether that connects her City Above the Sky to the earthly world below finally severs and sends the Cerulean to a new planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Sera is chosen as the sacrifice to break the tether, she doesn’t know what to feel. To save her City, Sera must throw herself from its edge and end her own life. But something goes wrong and she survives the fall, landing in a place called Kaolin. She has heard tales about the humans there, and soon learns that the dangers her mothers warned her of are real. If Sera has any hope to return to her City, she’ll have to find the magic within herself to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this spellbinding and suspenseful debut, a young woman haunted by the past returns home to care for her ailing mother and begins to dig deeper into her sister’s unsolved murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years ago, Sylvie’s sister Persephone never came home. Out too late with the boyfriend she was forbidden to see, Persephone was missing for three days before her body was found—and years later, her murder remains unsolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the present day, Sylvie returns home to care for her estranged mother, Annie, as she undergoes treatment for cancer. Prone to unexplained “Dark Days” even before Persephone’s death, Annie’s once-close bond with Sylvie dissolved in the weeks after their loss, making for an uncomfortable reunion all these years later. Worse, Persephone’s former boyfriend, Ben, is now a nurse at the cancer center where Annie is being treated. Sylvie’s always believed Ben was responsible for the murder—but she carries her own guilt about that night, guilt that traps her in the past while the world goes on around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she navigates the complicated relationship with her mother, Sylvie begins to uncover the secrets that fill their house—and what really happened the night Persephone died. As it turns out, the truth really will set you free, once you can bear to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Winter Sister&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing portrayal of the complex bond between sisters, between mothers and daughters alike, and forces us to ask ourselves—how well do we really know the people we love most?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A high-stakes survival story about eight teenagers who outlive an alien attack—perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The 5th Wave&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clover Martinez has always been a survivor, which is the only reason she isn't among the dead when aliens invade and destroy Earth as she knows it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clover hears an inexplicable radio message, she's shocked to learn there are other survivors—and that they're all at the former Area 51. When she arrives, she's greeted by a band of misfits who call themselves The Last Teenagers on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only they aren't the ragtag group of heroes Clover was expecting. The group seems more interested in hiding than fighting back, and Clover starts to wonder if she was better off alone. But then she finds a hidden spaceship, and she doesn't know what to believe…or who to trust.</description>

  <description>Gripping psychological suspense from the number one bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Then She Was Gone&lt;/i&gt;, as what begins as an innocent crush develops into a dangerous infatuation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re back home after four years working abroad with a brand new husband in tow. You’re keen to find a place of your own. But for now, you’re living with your big brother, camped out in his spare bedroom. And then – quite unexpectedly – you meet the man next door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s the head teacher of the local high school. He’s twice your age. And he’s devastatingly attractive. Soon you find you’re watching him. All the time. But what you don’t know is that someone is watching you. Or that what has started as an innocent crush is quickly turning into an obsession as dark as it is deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family secrets, illicit passion, and an unexplained murder lie at the heart of Lisa Jewell’s gripping new novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #1: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking… and what she’s hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #2: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #3: Should a punishment always fit the crime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>The bestselling author of The Paper Magician Series transports readers to a darkly whimsical world where strange magic threatens a quiet village that only a courageous woman can save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrona lives in an isolated village, where her life is centered on pleasing her parents. She’s diligent in her chores and has agreed to marry a man of their choosing. But a visit to Slava, the local tradesman, threatens to upend her entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entering his empty house, Matrona discovers a strange collection of painted nesting dolls—one for every villager. Fascinated, she can’t resist the urge to open the doll with her father’s face. But when her father begins acting strangely, she realizes Slava’s dolls are much more than they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he learns what she’s done, Slava seizes the opportunity to give Matrona stewardship over the dolls—whether she wants it or not. Forced to open one of her own dolls every three days, she falls deeper into the grim power of Slava’s creations. But nothing can prepare her for the profound secret hiding inside the fifth doll.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Unique craft cocktails, Scandinavian-inspired food, and the magic of the northern climate is abound in &lt;i&gt;Northern Hospitality&lt;/i&gt;, a unique combination cookbook, cocktail guide, and northern culture primer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In Portland, Maine, Andrew and Briana Volk welcome people into their restaurant like it's an extension of their home. It's here that&lt;b&gt; they create new tastes&lt;/b&gt; like &lt;i&gt;In the Pines&lt;/i&gt; (gin, Cynar, and stone pine liqueur) and the &lt;i&gt;Norseman&lt;/i&gt; (a Scandinavian take on the old-fashioned, with aquavit), while also &lt;b&gt;spending time perfecting the classics&lt;/b&gt; behind the bar, from the Pimm's Cup to hot buttered rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After the drinks, &lt;i&gt;Northern Hospitality&lt;/i&gt; moves on to &lt;b&gt;food inspired by both Portland and Scandinavia&lt;/b&gt;. The bar snacks are addictive;&lt;b&gt; green chile popcorn&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;cured venison&lt;/b&gt;, and&lt;b&gt; house-made pretzels&lt;/b&gt;, are just the beginning -- &lt;b&gt;smorgasbords &lt;/b&gt;feature smoked fish, cheese, and house-made cider pickles. Swedish meatballs with spaetzle and nutmeg cream are sure to warm you up. Or go further from the known with the nori hashbrowns and trout roe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Features on &lt;b&gt;ice fishing&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;shucking oysters&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;how to build a bonfire&lt;/b&gt;, and&lt;b&gt; après-sk&lt;/b&gt;i provide a sense of place and an experience as unique as the club itself. Celebrate the seasons the way those in the north do: with warmth, fun, and a sense of wonder.</description>

  <description>When the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drought—or the Tap-Out, as everyone calls it—has been going on for a while now. Everyone’s lives have become an endless list of don’ts: don’t water the lawn, don’t fill up your pool, don’t take long showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the taps run dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Alyssa’s quiet suburban street spirals into a warzone of desperation; neighbors and families turned against each other on the hunt for water. And when her parents don’t return and her life—and the life of her brother—is threatened, Alyssa has to make impossible choices if she’s going to survive.</description>

  <description>Kenzie holds one truth above all: the company is everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a citizen of Omnistellar Concepts, the most powerful corporation in the solar system, Kenzie has trained her entire life for one goal: to become an elite guard on Sanctuary, Omnistellar’s space prison for superpowered teens too dangerous for Earth. As a junior guard, she’s excited to prove herself to her company—and that means sacrificing anything that won’t propel her forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a routine drill goes sideways and Kenzie is taken hostage by rioting prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, she’s confident her commanding officer—who also happens to be her mother—will stop at nothing to secure her freedom. Yet it soon becomes clear that her mother is more concerned with sticking to Omnistellar protocol than she is with getting Kenzie out safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kenzie forms her own plan to escape, she doesn’t realize there’s a more sinister threat looming, something ancient and evil that has clawed its way into Sanctuary from the vacuum of space. And Kenzie might have to team up with her captors to survive—all while beginning to suspect there’s a darker side to the Omnistellar she knows.</description>

  <description>It’s 1871 and Emmeline Carter is poised to take Chicago’s high society by storm. Between her father’s sudden rise to wealth, and her recent engagement to Chicago’s most eligible bachelor, Emmeline has it all. But she can’t stop thinking about the life she left behind, including her childhood sweetheart, Anders Magnuson. Fiona Byrne, Emmeline’s childhood best friend, is delighted by her friend’s sudden rise to prominence, especially since it means Fiona is free to pursue Anders herself. But when Emmeline risks everything for one final fling with Anders, Fiona feels completely betrayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer turns to fall, the city is at a tipping point: friendships are tested, hearts are broken, and the tiniest spark might set everything ablaze. Sweeping, soapy, and romantic, this is a story about an epic love triangle—one that will literally set the city ablaze, and change the lives of three childhood friends forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>An artisan food revival has taken place in recent years, making kitchen skills a celebrated part of everyday life. These days, many cooks are seeking out the techniques their grandmothers took for granted, and realizing that patient preparation and tantalizing anticipation can make home-produced delicacies taste even better. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of the cook’s kitchen, from the simple pleasures of baking bread and cakes, to curing, dairymaking, bottling, potting and preserving. Discover the endless joys of the kitchen, with recipes that stand the test of time as well as helpful technique sections and information on the ingredients and equipment you’ll need. Experience the delights of the dairy by learning how to churn your own butter and soft cheese; make the most of seasonal fruits by transforming them into cordials and liqueurs; enjoy the aroma of freshly baked cakes, pastries and biscuits; feel the satisfaction that comes from salting and smoking meat at home; and fill up your larder with a mouthwatering array of jams, jellies and chutneys</description>

  <description>The brilliant, fearless, deeply flawed Nora Watts—introduced in the "utterly compelling" (Jeffery Deaver) atmospheric thriller &lt;em&gt;The Lost Ones&lt;/em&gt;—finds deadly trouble as she searches for the truth about her late father in this immersive thriller that moves from the hazy Canadian Pacific Northwest to the gritty, hollowed streets of Detroit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, Nora Watts only knew one parent—her father. When he killed himself, she denied her grief and carried on with her life. Then a chance encounter with a veteran who knew him raises disturbing questions Nora can’t ignore—and dark emotions she can’t control. To make her peace with the past, she has to confront it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the truth about her father’s life and his violent death takes her from Vancouver to Detroit where Sam Watts grew up, far away from his people and the place of his birth. Thanks to a disastrous government policy starting in the 1950s, thousands of Canadian native children like Sam were adopted by American families. In the Motor City, Nora discovers that the circumstances surrounding Sam’s suicide are more unsettling than she’d imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet no matter how far away Nora gets from Vancouver, she can’t shake trouble. Back in the Pacific Northwest, former police detective turned private investigator Jon Brazuca is looking into the overdose death of a billionaire’s mistress. His search uncovers a ruthless opiate ring and a startling connection to Nora, the infuriatingly distant woman he’d once tried to befriend. He has no way to warn or protect her, because she’s become a ghost, vanishing completely off the grid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focused on the mysterious events of her father’s past and the clues they provide to her own fractured identity and that of her estranged daughter, Nora may not be able to see the danger heading her way until it’s too late. But it’s not her father’s old ties that could get her killed—it’s her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Into every generation a Slayer is born…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina and her twin sister, Artemis, are far from normal. It’s hard to be when you grow up at the Watcher’s Academy, which is a bit different from your average boarding school. Here teens are trained as guides for Slayers—girls gifted with supernatural strength to fight the forces of darkness. But while Nina’s mother is a prominent member of the Watcher’s Council, Nina has never embraced the violent Watcher lifestyle. Instead she follows her instincts to heal, carving out a place for herself as the school medic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day Nina’s life changes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Buffy, the famous (and infamous) Slayer that Nina’s father died protecting, Nina is not only the newest Chosen One—she’s the last Slayer, ever. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nina hones her skills with her Watcher-in-training, Leo, there’s plenty to keep her occupied: a monster fighting ring, a demon who eats happiness, a shadowy figure that keeps popping up in Nina’s dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not until bodies start turning up that Nina’s new powers will truly be tested—because someone she loves might be next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is clear: Being Chosen is easy. Making choices is hard.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One girl must uncover secrets of the past to save her friend from a terrible curse in this&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; dark and mesmerizing story of love, revenge, and redemption inspired by the myth of Medusa.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milla knows two things to be true: Demons are real, and fear will keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milla's whole world is her family's farm. She is never allowed to travel to the village and her only friend is her beloved older brother, Niklas. When a bright-eyed girl named Iris comes to stay, Milla hopes her loneliness might finally be coming to an end. But Iris has a secret she's forbidden to share: The village is cursed by a demon who possesses girls at random, and the townspeople live in terror of who it will come for next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it seems, the demon has come for Iris. When Iris is captured and imprisoned with other possessed girls, Milla leaves home to rescue her and break the curse forever. Her only company on the journey is a terrible new secret of her own: Milla is changing, too, and may soon be a demon herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cold Is in Her Bones&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about the dark, reverberating power of pain, the yearning to be seen and understood, and the fragile optimism of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Ember in the Ashes&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Three Dark Crowns&lt;/i&gt; in this lush debut fantasy novel about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to join a secret group of warriors that ride phoenixes into battle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I had a sister, once…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders—legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire—until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I promised her the throne would not come between us.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders—even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;But it is a fact of life that one must kill or be killed. Rule or be ruled.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders’ return and intends to destroy them once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes the title of queen is given. Sometimes it must be taken.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crown of Feathers &lt;/i&gt;is an epic fantasy about love’s incredible power to save—or to destroy. Interspersed throughout is the story of Avalkyra Ashfire, the last Rider queen, who would rather see her empire burn than fall into her sister’s hands.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have only one thing to say: the book does start slow, and soon you’ll drown in historical details and characters. It’s really hard to keep up in the beginning, it’s not an easy read.

  <description>The ketogenic diet has become the go-to healthy diet for losing weight, managing diabetes, and possibly preventing and managing conditions such as neurodegenerative illnesses and cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The transition to a keto diet can be difficult, but this “induction” phase doesn’t have to be! Bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The KetoDiet Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, Martina Slajerova, explains the first tricky few weeks as your metabolism readjusts to burning fat rather than carbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every recipe in &lt;i&gt;The Keto-Induction Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is designed to meet the special nutrient requirements of the induction phase. Just some of the dishes you’ll be enjoying include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Breakfast Chili&lt;br /&gt; -Anti-Inflammatory Egg Drop Soup&lt;br /&gt; -Ricotta &amp;amp; Pepper Mini-Tarts&lt;br /&gt; -Avacado Power Balls&lt;br /&gt; -Salmon Ramen&lt;br /&gt; -Dulce de Leche Fudge&lt;br /&gt; -Chocolate Electrolyte Smoothies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From quick "keto-flu" remedies and curbing cravings, to avoiding pitfalls like incorrect macronutrient balances and “zero-carb” approaches, &lt;i&gt;The Keto-Induction Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; puts you on the right path to lose weight, get healthy, and enjoy all the benefits of the ketogenic diet for the long-term. &lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>To save his daughter, he'll go anywhere—and any-when…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kin Stewart is an everyday family man: working in I.T., trying to keep the spark in his marriage, and struggling to connect with his teenage daughter, Miranda. But his current life is a far cry from his previous career as a time-traveling secret agent from 2142.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranded in suburban San Francisco since the 1990s after a botched mission, Kin has kept his past hidden from everyone around him, despite the increasing blackouts and memory loss affecting his time-traveler's brain. Until one afternoon, his “rescue” team arrives—eighteen years too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their mission: return Kin to 2142 where he's only been gone weeks, not years, and where another family is waiting for him. A family he can’t remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between two lives, Kin is desperate for a way to stay connected to both. But when his best efforts threaten to destroy the agency and even history itself, his daughter’s very existence is at risk. It'll take one final trip across time to save Miranda—even if it means breaking all the rules of time travel in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A uniquely emotional genre-bending debut, Here and Now and Then captures the perfect balance of heart, playfulness, and imagination, offering an intimate glimpse into the crevices of a father’s heart, and its capacity to stretch across both space and time to protect the people that mean the most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Beautiful and inspiring one-dish meals in a bowl!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Buddha bowls, occasionally called “bliss bowls,” “nourish bowls,” or “power bowls,” are the ultimate in one-dish meals. You start with a base of whole grains, rice, noodles, or legumes. Then you layer on a generous assortment of cooked or raw vegetables. Finally, you top the veggies with a boost of protein and then a dressing, sauce, or broth. Buddha bowls are an &lt;b&gt;easy, healthy meal that can be ready in minutes&lt;/b&gt; and that you can have for breakfast, lunch, or dinner—or, if you like, all three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Buddha bowl concept is loosely &lt;b&gt;based on guidance from Chinese medicine&lt;/b&gt;: a meal should have vegetables, protein, and grain. Typically, in a Buddha bowl there is a high ratio of ingredients to broth or sauce and the ingredients are left whole or in large pieces, and not blended, minced, or pureed. Although it is Asian in inspiration, a Buddha bowl can be made with a variety of ingredients from just about anywhere on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kelli Foster, who writes about food for the popular website The Kitchn, serves up in these pages an amazing variety of Buddha bowl ideas, each one &lt;b&gt;vibrant with color&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;alive with flavor&lt;/b&gt;, and&lt;b&gt; oh-so-comforting &lt;/b&gt;to eat. Can you think of a heartier way to start the day than with a Blackberry Millet Breakfast Bowl, a Coconut Quinoa Breakfast Bowl, or a Chai-Spiced Multigrain Porridge Bowl, just three among many &lt;b&gt;breakfast bowl &lt;/b&gt;ideas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Later in the day, for &lt;b&gt;cozy meals&lt;/b&gt; with loved ones, how about Warm Autumn Chicken and Wild Rice Bowls, Sesame Tuna Bowls, or Lamb Kebab Bowls? For company, Lentil and Smoked Salmon Nicoise Bowls or Miso Noodle Bowls with Stir-Fried Beef will delight your guests. There are many &lt;b&gt;vegan recipes&lt;/b&gt;, too, from Cauliflower Falafel Power Bowls to Spicy Sesame Tofu and Rice Bowls and beyond. A special chapter on &lt;b&gt;fruit bowls&lt;/b&gt; has ideas for power-snacking, as well as for meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Buddha bowls are elegant in appearance and flavor, but &lt;b&gt;surprisingly easy to make&lt;/b&gt;—a perfect marriage of convenience and good taste. If you haven't tried them yet, now you have a great reason!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ashish Patel&lt;/b&gt; didn’t know love could be so…sucky. After he’s dumped by his ex-girlfriend, his mojo goes AWOL. Even worse, his parents are annoyingly, smugly confident they could find him a better match. So, in a moment of weakness, Ash challenges them to set him up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Patels insist that Ashish date an Indian-American girl—under contract. Per subclause 1(a), he’ll be taking his date on “fun” excursions like visiting the Hindu temple and his eccentric Gita Auntie. Kill him now. How is this ever going to work?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweetie Nair &lt;/b&gt; is many things: a formidable track athlete who can outrun most people in California, a loyal friend, a shower-singing champion. Oh, and she’s also fat. To Sweetie’s traditional parents, this last detail is the kiss of death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sweetie loves her parents, but she’s so tired of being told she’s lacking because she’s fat. She decides it’s time to kick off the Sassy Sweetie Project, where she’ll show the world (and herself) what she’s really made of.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ashish and Sweetie both have something to prove. But with each date they realize there’s an unexpected magic growing between them. Can they find their true selves without losing each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The wall between mages and the magicless is about to be broken...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Growing up in Manhattan's secret community of mages, 17-year-old Jonathan Lockwood has always seen his family as one of the enlightened ones, regularly campaigning to integrate with the so-called "Dulls" and offer their talents to the wider world. But when a looming disaster threatens hundreds of lives, he watches his parents bow to the pressure to stay silent. Horrified, he resolves to intervene himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jonathan's mission leads him to a chance encounter with Amy, a girl who should be Dull but has a clear affinity for magic. As they struggle to tackle the impending threat, he introduces her to the world he knows is rightfully hers. The closer Jonathan and Amy become, the more he finds himself losing his heart—and his certainty about the rules he's broken. The greater good may come at a price more painful than he ever expected to pay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Set four decades before the Conspiracy of Magic trilogy, &lt;i&gt;Magic Unmasked&lt;/i&gt; offers a glimpse into a critical turning point in magical history—events that set the stage for Rocío and Finn's ordeals.</description>

The rest must undergo a procedure to destroy their magical ability unless they prove themselves in the mysterious and brutal Mages' Exam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantaged by her parents' low standing, Rocío Lopez has dedicated herself to expanding her considerable talent to earn a place in the Confederation. Their rejection leaves her reeling—and determined to fight to keep her magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ashamed of his mediocre abilities, Finn Lockwood knows the Confederation accepted him only because of his prominent family. Declaring for the Exam instead means a chance to confirm his true worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown into the testing with little preparation, Rocío and Finn find themselves becoming unlikely allies—and possibly more. But the Exam holds secrets more horrifying than either could have imagined. What are the examiners really testing them for? And as the trials become increasingly vicious, how much are they willing to sacrifice to win?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first in a new series by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Megan Crewe, &lt;i&gt;Ruthless Magic&lt;/i&gt; combines the magic of Harry Potter with the ferocity of The Hunger Games alongside a poignant romance. Fans of Cassandra Clare and Holly Black, look no further for your next urban fantasy fix.</description>

  <description>A taut, philosophical mind-bender from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I’m Thinking of Ending Things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We don’t get visitors. Not out here. We never have.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Iain Reid’s second haunting, philosophical puzzle of a novel, set in the near-future, Junior and Henrietta live a comfortable, solitary life on their farm, far from the city lights, but in close quarters with each other. One day, a stranger from the city arrives with alarming news: Junior has been randomly selected to travel far away from the farm...very far away. The most unusual part? Arrangements have already been made so that when he leaves, Henrietta won't have a chance to miss him, because she won't be left alone—not even for a moment. Henrietta will have company. Familiar company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in Reid’s sharp and evocative style, &lt;i&gt;Foe&lt;/i&gt; examines the nature of domestic relationships, self-determination, and what it means to be (or not to be) a person. An eerily entrancing page-turner, it churns with unease and suspense from the first words to its shocking finale.</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>You will truly push the envelope on what you can accomplish in the kitchen with&lt;i&gt; Plants Taste Better&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; This plant-based recipe book puts vegetables on center-stage, and gives you a deeper understanding of the techniques which make them shine. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Cooking plants is an art form completely different from cooking meat or fish. It requires not only a solid grounding in traditional cooking techniques, but also a deeper understanding of new techniques specific to working with plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Current vegan cookbooks rarely address finer cuisine the way traditional cookbooks present preparing meats.&lt;i&gt; Plants Taste Better&lt;/i&gt; presents you with stunning recipes that take vegetable cooking to a new level and highlights specific techniques in each recipe to enhance your skills in the kitchen.</description>

  <description>High-horsepower power blenders are revolutionizing the kitchen habits of millions of people. These fast and convenient devices have many of the functions of the food processor, the juicer, and, of course, the old-fashioned, low-horsepower blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Vanessa Simkins' &lt;i&gt;Power Blender Revolution&lt;/i&gt; is the first general cookbook for power-blender owners who want to get the most use and pleasure from their purchase. Power blenders make juices without sacrificing the nutritious fiber that juicing machines can't handle; they make purees (including baby foods), soups that are silky smooth and light; and they excel with hummus, guacamole, and other dips and spreads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With a little instruction, you’ll be making healthy smoothies for breakfast. When dinner comes rolling around, you’ll know how to make every kind of sauce imaginable, for topping pastas, meats, potatoes, vegetables, and more. Time for dessert? You can't mix up a faster mousse, or a faster blend of ice-cream ingredients, in any other kind of machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With expert tips and tricks that help you choose, use, clean, and maintain your machine, and a bounty of more than 300 creative and tasty recipes, this book is an essential companion for anyone who has invested in a power blender.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "&lt;i&gt;Power Blender Revolution&lt;/i&gt; is packed full of healthy, vibrant recipes and creative ways to use your blender. Vanessa Simkins proves that your blender isn't just for smoothies. These are recipes you will come back to time and time again.". --Tieghan Gerard, author of &lt;i&gt;Half Baked Harvest&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Something is wrong with Marianne. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not just that her parents have split up, or that life hasn't been the same since she quit dancing. Or even that her mother has checked herself into the hospital. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's losing time. Doing things she would never do. And objects around her seem to break whenever she comes close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is after her. But a first attempt at an exorcism calls down the full force of the thing's rage. It demands Marianne give back what she stole. And Marianne must uncover the truth that lies beneath it all before the nightmare can take what it think it's owed, leaving Marianne trapped in the darkness of the other side.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Can you hide a secret with the whole world watching?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an explosion rips apart a Chicago building, the lives of three women are forever altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, Cecily is in mourning. She was supposed to be in the building that day. Instead, she stood on the street and witnessed it going down, with her husband and best friend inside. Kate, now living thousands of miles away, fled the disaster and is hoping that her past won’t catch up with her. And Franny, a young woman in search of her birth mother, watched the horror unfold on the morning news, knowing that the woman she was so desperate to reconnect with was in the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, despite the marks left by the tragedy, they all seem safe. But as its anniversary dominates the media, the memories of that terrifying morning become dangerous triggers. All these women are guarding important secrets. Just how far will they go to keep them?</description>

  <description>When five hyper-successful women agree to appear on a reality series set in New York City called Goal Diggers, the producers never expect the season will end in murder…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett’s the fan favorite. Tattooed and only twenty-seven, the meteoric success of her spin studio—and her recent engagement to her girlfriend—has made her the object of jealousy and vitriol from her cast mates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly, Brett’s older sister and business partner, is the most recent recruit, dismissed as a hanger-on by veteran cast. The golden child growing up, she defers to Brett now—a role which requires her to protect their shocking secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie, the first black cast member and the oldest, is a successful bestselling author of erotic novels. There have long been whispers about her hot, non-working actor-husband and his wandering eye, but this season the focus is on the rift that has opened between her and Brett, former best friends—and resentment soon breeds contempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren, the start-up world’s darling whose drinking has gotten out of control, is Goal Diggers’ recovery narrative—everyone loves a comeback story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Jen, made rich and famous through her cultishly popular vegan food line plays a holistic hippie for the cameras, but is perhaps the most ruthless of them all when the cameras are off.</description>

  <description>Murder and madness infect a small town &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For sixteen-year-old Ruthie Stroud, life on tiny Hemlock Island in the Pacific Northwest is an endless sea of boring green, in a place where everybody knows everybody’s business and nothing ever happens. Then her world is ripped apart when her parents divorce and a new man enters her mother’s life. But worse is yet to come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she drifts ashore on the mainland, hideously burned, Ruthie has a harrowing tale to tell. It begins with the murder of a family. It ends with her being the sole survivor of a cataclysm that sweeps her little island. As a detective attempts to unravel Ruthie’s story of murder and madness, only one horrifying conclusion can be drawn: whatever was isolated on remote Hemlock Island may now have come to the mainland. Is Ruthie safe? Is anyone?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wondered what secrets other mothers are keeping? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenny has too much on her plate:&lt;/b&gt; literally – she’s only pregnant with one child but she’s already eating for three. Not to mention trying to &lt;b&gt;juggle her future life with a baby, a nightmare boss, a know-it-all sister, and a bizarrely laid back husband. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She used to be famous for her ‘Single Girl About Town’ journalism. But not only is she bored of parties, she also hasn’t been single for years, and is now 8½ months pregnant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when her boss hands her column to a younger colleague, &lt;b&gt;Jenny panics and proposes instead writing about being a clueless new mum.&lt;/b&gt; Surely people will find her new friendship group fascinating? Even if the only thing they have in common is that they all had sex around the same time 9 months ago... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like – what’s the deal with scary Gail’s mystery husband? How is posh mum Antonia already out drinking when Jenny can barely make a cup of tea? Why isn’t sweet-natured Ruth answering any phone calls? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if her readers aren’t quite hooked yet, &lt;b&gt;maybe Jenny will just have to be more liberal with the truth. After all, none of the other mums will read it… will they? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Undercover Mother&lt;/i&gt; is a feel-good parenting page turner that will make you laugh, cry and recognise every moment. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Why Mummy Drinks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Bad Mother’s Diary&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Weekenders&lt;/i&gt; comes a delightful new novel about new love, old secrets, and the kind of friendship that transcends generations.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ninety-nine-year-old heiress Josephine Bettendorf Warrick summons Brooke Trappnell to Talisa Island, her 20,000 acre remote barrier island home, Brooke is puzzled. Everybody in the South has heard about the eccentric millionaire mistress of Talisa, but Brooke has never met her. Josephine’s cryptic note says she wants to discuss an important legal matter with Brooke, who is an attorney, but Brooke knows that Mrs. Warrick has long been a client of a prestigious Atlanta law firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a few meetings, the ailing Josephine spins a tale of old friendships, secrets, betrayal and a long-unsolved murder. She tells Brooke she is hiring her for two reasons: to protect her island and legacy from those who would despoil her land, and secondly, to help her make amends with the heirs of the long dead women who were her closest friends, the girls of The High Tide Club—so named because of their youthful skinny dipping escapades—Millie, Ruth and Varina. When Josephine dies with her secrets intact, Brooke is charged with contacting Josephine’s friends’ descendants and bringing them together on Talisa for a reunion of women who’ve actually never met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The High Tide Club&lt;/i&gt; is Mary Kay Andrews at her Queen of the Beach Reads best, a compelling and witty tale of romance thwarted, friendships renewed, justice delivered, and true love found.</description>

      <![CDATA[While the story is intriguing from the start, it was somewhat a slow start for me. I had difficulty to jump into it. But once inside, oh my. There are a lot of twists and turns. It could have been disorienting, but Mary Kay Andrews won't let you down. <br /><br />Big thanks to the publisher for my e-copy thr...]]>

  <description>Raised to be a warrior, seventeen-year-old Eelyn fights alongside her Aska clansmen in an ancient rivalry against the Riki clan. Her life is brutal but simple: fight and survive. Until the day she sees the impossible on the battlefield—her brother, fighting with the enemy—the brother she watched die five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with her brother's betrayal, she must survive the winter in the mountains with the Riki, in a village where every neighbor is an enemy, every battle scar possibly one she delivered. But when the Riki village is raided by a ruthless clan thought to be a legend, Eelyn is even more desperate to get back to her beloved family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is given no choice but to trust Fiske, her brother’s friend, who sees her as a threat. They must do the impossible: unite the clans to fight together, or risk being slaughtered one by one. Driven by a love for her clan and her growing love for Fiske, Eelyn must confront her own definition of loyalty and family while daring to put her faith in the people she’s spent her life hating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Wonder Woman, part &lt;i&gt;Vikings&lt;/i&gt;—and all heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>An aspiring teen filmmaker finds her voice and falls in love in this delightful romantic comedy from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;When Dimple Met Rishi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspiring filmmaker and wallflower Twinkle Mehra has stories she wants to tell and universes she wants to explore, if only the world would listen. So when fellow film geek Sahil Roy approaches her to direct a movie for the upcoming Summer Festival, Twinkle is all over it. The chance to publicly showcase her voice as a director? Dream come true. The fact that it gets her closer to her longtime crush, Neil Roy-a.k.a. Sahil's twin brother? Dream come true x 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mystery man N begins emailing her, Twinkle is sure it's Neil, finally ready to begin their happily-ever-after. The only &lt;i&gt;slightly &lt;/i&gt;inconvenient problem is that, in the course of movie-making, she's fallen madly in love with the irresistibly adorkable Sahil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twinkle soon realizes that resistance is futile: The romance she's got is not the one she's scripted. But will it be enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through the letters Twinkle writes to her favorite female filmmakers, &lt;i&gt;From Twinkle, with Love &lt;/i&gt;navigates big truths about friendship, family, and the unexpected places love can find you.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“I made the wrong choice.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lina is spending the summer in Tuscany, but she isn’t in the mood for Italy’s famous sunshine and fairy-tale landscape. She’s only there because it was her mother’s dying wish that she get to know her father. But what kind of father isn’t around for sixteen years? All Lina wants to do is get back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she is given a journal that her mom had kept when she lived in Italy. Suddenly Lina’s uncovering a magical world of secret romances, art, and hidden bakeries. A world that inspires Lina, along with the ever-so-charming Ren, to follow in her mother’s footsteps and unearth a secret that has been kept for far too long. It’s a secret that will change everything she knew about her mother, her father—and even herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People come to Italy for love and gelato, someone tells her, but sometimes they discover much more.</description>

  <description>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply atmospheric and ingeniously plotted, &lt;i&gt;The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle&lt;/i&gt; is a highly original debut that will appeal to fans of Kate Atkinson and Agatha Christie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also titled as The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I don't know where to start... That book is AMAZING. Even if Aiden has to relive the same day again and again and again, the story is original and I couldn't have predicted the many twists that come in the end. I LOVED IT!!! <br /><br />Many thanks to the publisher for my e-copy of this book in exchange for...]]>

  <description>Some houses seem to want to hold their secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1759 and the world is at war, pulling the North American colonies of Britain and France into the conflict. The times are complicated, as are the loyalties of many New York merchants who have secretly been trading with the French for years, defying Britain’s colonial laws in a game growing ever more treacherous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When captured French officers are brought to Long Island to be billeted in private homes on their parole of honour, it upends the lives of the Wilde family—deeply involved in the treasonous trade and already divided by war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lydia Wilde, struggling to keep the peace in her fracturing family following her mother’s death, has little time or kindness to spare for her unwanted guests. French-Canadian lieutenant Jean-Philippe de Sabran has little desire to be there. But by the war’s end they’ll both learn love, honour, and duty can form tangled bonds that are not broken easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their doomed romance becomes a local legend, told and re-told through the years until the present day, when conflict of a different kind brings Charley Van Hoek to Long Island to be the new curator of the Wilde House Museum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley doesn’t believe in ghosts. But as she starts to delve into the history of Lydia and her French officer, it becomes clear that the Wilde House holds more than just secrets, and Charley discovers the legend might not have been telling the whole story...or the whole truth.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love historical fiction. Even more when there’s a connection to the present, like with this book. And even even more when there’s romance. And it did help that it involved a French Canadian soldier, since I live in Quebec... I love to know more about history. I really loved that book. It’s beau...]]>

  <description>On a day that begins like any other, Hal receives a mysterious letter bequeathing her a substantial inheritance. She realizes very quickly that the letter was sent to the wrong person—but also that the cold-reading skills she’s honed as a tarot card reader might help her claim the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Hal finds herself at the funeral of the deceased…where it dawns on her that there is something very, very wrong about this strange situation and the inheritance at the centre of it.</description>

  <description>Ellie Mack was the perfect daughter. She was fifteen, the youngest of three. She was beloved by her parents, friends, and teachers. She and her boyfriend made a teenaged golden couple. She was days away from an idyllic post-exams summer vacation, with her whole life ahead of her.&lt;br /&gt; And then she was gone.&lt;br /&gt;Now, her mother Laurel Mack is trying to put her life back together. It’s been ten years since her daughter disappeared, seven years since her marriage ended, and only months since the last clue in Ellie’s case was unearthed. So when she meets an unexpectedly charming man in a café, no one is more surprised than Laurel at how quickly their flirtation develops into something deeper. Before she knows it, she’s meeting Floyd’s daughters—and his youngest, Poppy, takes Laurel’s breath away.&lt;br /&gt; Because looking at Poppy is like looking at Ellie. And now, the unanswered questions she’s tried so hard to put to rest begin to haunt Laurel anew. Where did Ellie go? Did she really run away from home, as the police have long suspected, or was there a more sinister reason for her disappearance? Who is Floyd, really? And why does his daughter remind Laurel so viscerally of her own missing girl?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Weisberger returns with a novel starring one of her favorite characters from &lt;i&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;/i&gt;—Emily Charlton, first assistant to Miranda Priestly, now a highly successful image consultant who’s just landed the client of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Greenwich, CT, where the lawns and the women are perfectly manicured, the Tito’s and sodas are extra strong, and &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; has something to say about the infamous new neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s be clear: Emily Charlton, Miranda Priestly’s ex-assistant, does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; do the suburbs. She’s working in Hollywood as an image consultant to the stars, but recently, Emily’s lost a few clients. She’s hopeless with social media. The new guard is nipping at her heels. She needs a big opportunity, and she needs it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karolina Hartwell is as A-list as they come. She’s the former face of L’Oreal. A mega-supermodel recognized the world over. And now, the gorgeous wife of the newly elected senator from New York, Graham, who also has his eye on the presidency. It’s all very Kennedy-esque, right down to the public philandering and Karolina’s arrest for a DUI—with a Suburban full of other people’s children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miriam is the link between them. Until recently she was a partner at one of Manhattan’s most prestigious law firms. But when Miriam moves to Greenwich and takes time off to spend with her children, she never could have predicted that being stay-at-home mom in an uber-wealthy town could have more pitfalls than a stressful legal career. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily, Karolina, and Miriam make an unlikely trio, but they desperately need each other. Together, they’ll navigate the social landmines of life in America’s favorite suburb on steroids, revealing the truths—and the lies—that simmer just below the glittering surface. With her signature biting style, Lauren Weisberger offers a dazzling look into another sexy, over-the-top world, where nothing is as it appears.</description>

  <description>Meet Hanna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s the sweet-but-silent angel in the adoring eyes of her Daddy. He’s the only person who understands her, and all Hanna wants is to live happily ever after with him. But Mommy stands in her way, and she’ll try any trick she can think of to get rid of her. Ideally for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Suzette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves her daughter, really, but after years of expulsions and strained home schooling, her precarious health and sanity are weakening day by day. As Hanna’s tricks become increasingly sophisticated, and Suzette's husband remains blind to the failing family dynamics, Suzette starts to fear that there’s something seriously wrong, and that maybe home isn’t the best place for their baby girl after all.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alice’s life on the road, always a step ahead of the uncanny bad luck biting at their heels. But when Alice’s grandmother, the reclusive author of a cult-classic book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate, the Hazel Wood, Alice learns how bad her luck can really get: her mother is stolen away―by a figure who claims to come from the Hinterland, the cruel supernatural world where her grandmother's stories are set. Alice's only lead is the message her mother left behind: “Stay away from the Hazel Wood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice has long steered clear of her grandmother’s cultish fans. But now she has no choice but to ally with classmate Ellery Finch, a Hinterland superfan who may have his own reasons for wanting to help her. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmother's tales began―and where she might find out how her own story went so wrong.</description>

  <description>Kiko Himura has always had a hard time saying exactly what she’s thinking. With a mother who makes her feel unremarkable and a half-Japanese heritage she doesn’t quite understand, Kiko prefers to keep her head down, certain that once she makes it into her dream art school, Prism, her real life will begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Kiko doesn’t get into Prism, at the same time her abusive uncle moves back in with her family. So when she receives an invitation from her childhood friend to leave her small town and tour art schools on the west coast, Kiko jumps at the opportunity in spite of the anxieties and fears that attempt to hold her back. And now that she is finally free to be her own person outside the constricting walls of her home life, Kiko learns life-changing truths about herself, her past, and how to be brave.</description>

  <description>In this chilling debut thriller, in the vein of &lt;i&gt;Dexter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/i&gt;, a family man obsessed with digging up the undiscovered remains of serial killer victims catches the attention of a murderer prowling the streets of Seattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Martin Reese is obsessed with murder.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, he has been illegally buying police files on serial killers and studying them in depth, using them as guides to find missing bodies. He doesn’t take any souvenirs, just photos that he stores in an old laptop, and then he turns in the results to the police anonymously. Martin sees his work as a public service, a righting of wrongs that cops have continuously failed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Sandra Whittal sees it differently. On a meteoric rise in police ranks due to her case-closing efficiency, Whittal is suspicious of the mysterious caller—the Finder, she names him—leading the police to the bodies. Even if the Finder isn’t the one leaving bodies behind, who’s to say that he won’t start soon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On his latest dig, Martin searches for the first kill of Jason Shurn, the early 1990s murderer who may have been responsible for the disappearance of his sister-in-law, whom he never met. But when he arrives at the site, he finds a freshly killed body—a young and recently disappeared Seattle woman—lying among remains that were left there decades ago. Someone else knew where Jason Shurn buried his victims . . . and that someone isn’t happy that Martin has been going around digging up his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a crooked cop with a tenuous tie to Martin vanishes, Whittal begins to zero in on the Finder. Hunted by a real killer and by Whittal, Martin realizes that in order to escape the killer’s trap, he may have to go deeper into the world of murder than he ever thought.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Riveting, chilling, and page-turning. Be prepared to stay up all night." -- &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Scottoline&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of dark and twisty psychological thrillers, Watch Me is a riveting novel of suspense about how far obsession can go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Youngblood is disappearing. Muddling through her late 30s as a creative writing professor at Blackwood college, she’s dangerously close to never being noticed again. The follow-up novel to her successful debut tanked. Her husband left her for a woman ten years younger. She’s always been bright, beautiful, independent and a little wild, but now her glow is starting to vanish. She’s heading into an age where her eyes are less blue, her charm worn out, and soon no one will ever truly look at her, want to know her, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Grist is Kate’s most promising student. An unflinching writer with razor-sharp clarity who gravitates towards dark themes and twisted plots, his raw talent is something Kate wants to nurture into literary success. But he’s not there solely to be the best writer. He’s been watching her. Wanting her. Working his way to her for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sam slowly makes his way into Kate’s life, they enter a deadly web of dangerous lies and forbidden desire. But how far will his fixation go? And how far will she allow it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping novel exploring intense obsession and illicit attraction, Jody Gehrman introduces a world where what you desire most may be the most dangerous thing of all.</description>

  <description>Noah Marshall has known a privileged and comfortable life thanks to his mother, the highly decorated chief of the Austin Police Department. But all that changes the night she reveals a skeleton that's been rattling in her closet for years, and succumbs to the guilt of destroying an innocent family's life. Reeling with grief, Noah is forced to carry the burden of this shocking secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gracie Richards wasn't born in a trailer park, but after fourteen years of learning how to survive in The Hollow, it's all she knows anymore. At least here people don't care that her dad was a corrupt Austin cop, murdered in a drug deal gone wrong. Here, she and her mother are just another family struggling to survive...until a man who clearly doesn't belong shows up on her doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their differences, Noah and Gracie are searching for answers to the same questions, and together, they set out to uncover the truth about the Austin Police Department's dark and messy past. But the scandal that emerges is bigger than they bargained for, and goes far higher up than they ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complex, gritty, and thrilling, Keep Her Safe solidifies K.A. Tucker's reputation as one of today's most talented new voices in suspense.</description>

  <description>In the near future, the world stands on the brink of another worldwide economic and social crisis. People look for understanding through occult practices, so that mediums and fortunetellers have become wildly successful in helping them escape reality. There are no more churches, and established religion is a thing of the past. Christians must now gather in secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fragile era emerges Josh Heartley, a young boy with astounding prophetic abilities. Though Josh had a heart transplant in his early years, it doesn't slow him down. He is a light for everyone around him, and he can often tell future events with supernatural clarity. &lt;br /&gt;During an accident, Josh has a Near Death Experience and finds himself in the middle of a spiritual battle that goes back more than two thousand years. Dr Julie Bond, conducting a research study involving Josh, hopes to unlock the secret behind NDEs and their ties to the human soul. She soon suspects the key lies within this very special boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Paul Thomas's thrilling novel is based on shocking real-world events of a thousand-years-long demonic occupation told through exciting storylines, unexpected twists, and many historical examples.</description>

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</description>

  <description>Lula Mortiz may be a bruja with healing powers, but after her family's battle in Los Lagos, she feels broken in a way she can't seem to fix. Then tragedy strikes when a bus crash leaves her friends and her boyfriend, Maks, dead. Desperate to reclaim normalcy, Lula invokes a dark spell to bring Maks back. It isn't until she hears that all of the bodies from the crash have gone missing that she realizes something is wrong. Lula has unwittingly raised an army of casi muertos--creatures between the living and dead--and they're hungry for freedom...which they can only achieve if Lula dies.</description>

  <description>If you knew the date of your death, how would you live your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It's 1969 in New York City's Lower East Side, and word has spread of the arrival of a mystical woman, a traveling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the day they will die. The Gold children—four adolescents on the cusp of self-awareness—sneak out to hear their fortunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prophecies inform their next five decades. Golden-boy Simon escapes to the West Coast, searching for love in '80s San Francisco; dreamy Klara becomes a Las Vegas magician, obsessed with blurring reality and fantasy; eldest son Daniel seeks security as an army doctor post-9/11; and bookish Varya throws herself into longevity research, where she tests the boundary between science and immortality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping novel of remarkable ambition and depth, &lt;i&gt;The Immortalists&lt;/i&gt; probes the line between destiny and choice, reality and illusion, this world and the next. It is a deeply moving testament to the power of story, the nature of belief, and the unrelenting pull of familial bonds.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this neighborhood, danger lies close to home. A domestic thriller packed full of secrets, and a twisty story that never stops—from the bestselling author of The Couple Next Door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He looks at her, concerned. “How do you feel?” She wants to say, Terrified. Instead, she says, with a faint smile, “Glad to be home.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen and Tom Krupp are happy—they’ve got a lovely home in upstate New York, they’re practically newlyweds, and they have no kids to interrupt their comfortable life together. But one day, Tom returns home to find Karen has vanished—her car’s gone and it seems she left in a rush. She even left her purse—complete with phone and ID—behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a knock on the door—the police are there to take Tom to the hospital where his wife has been admitted. She had a car accident, and lost control as she sped through the worst part of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accident has left Karen with a concussion and a few scrapes. Still, she’s mostly okay—except that she can’t remember what she was doing or where she was when she crashed. The cops think her memory loss is highly convenient, and they suspect she was up to no good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen returns home with Tom, determined to heal and move on with her life. Then she realizes something’s been moved. Something’s not quite right. Someone’s been in her house. And the police won't stop asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in this house, everyone’s a stranger. Everyone has something they’d rather keep hidden. Something they might even kill to keep quiet.</description>

  <description>Friend. Lover. Victim. Traitor.&lt;br /&gt;When you look in the mirror, what do you see?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old friends Red, Leo, Rose, and Naomi are misfits; still figuring out who they are and who they want to be. Life isn't perfect, but music brings them together, and they are excited about what the future holds for their band, Mirror, Mirror. That is until Naomi vanishes before being pulled unconscious out of the river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's left fighting for her life in a coma. The police claim it was a failed suicide attempt, but her friends aren't convinced. Will Naomi ever wake up? What - or perhaps who - led her to that hospital bed? And how did Red, the self-styled protector of the group, fail to spot the warning signs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Rose turns to wild partying and Leo is shrouded by black moods, Red sets out to uncover the truth. It's a journey that will cause Red's world to crack, exposing the group's darkest secrets. Nothing will ever be the same again, because once a mirror is shattered, it can't be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara Delevingne, the voice of her generation, explores identity, friendship and betrayal in this gripping and powerful coming-of-age story. For fans of WE WERE LIARS, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY and THE GIRLS.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As she saw his face for the first time, she knew he was going to kill her. She just didn’t know when.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dismembered body of Lydia Steiner is found washed up in the waters of a blisteringly hot Louisiana swamp, &lt;b&gt;Detective Jess Bishop&lt;/b&gt; knows for certain this isn’t the murderer’s first kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three other dismembered bodies have been found, all bearing the same marks. Marks that strike fear into Jess’s heart. They are identical to those from a case she’s spent her entire career trying to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess and her team try to link the victims, another body is discovered and they fear the serial killer is taunting them. They know it’s only a matter of time before he kills again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises, and the hunt goes cold, Jess knows she has to confront her past in order to catch the killer, &lt;b&gt;even if that means making herself the bait...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Three misfits come together to avenge the rape of a fellow classmate and in the process trigger a change in the misogynist culture at their high school transforming the lives of everyone around them in this searing and timely story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Nowhere Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re everygirl. But they start with just three:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Salter is the new girl in town, whose family was run out of their former community after her southern Baptist preacher mom turned into a radical liberal after falling off a horse and bumping her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosina Suarez is the queer punk girl in a conservative Mexican immigrant family, who dreams of a life playing music instead of babysitting her gaggle of cousins and waitressing at her uncle’s restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin Delillo is obsessed with two things: marine biology and &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;, but they aren’t enough to distract her from her suspicion that she may in fact be an android.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Grace learns that Lucy Moynihan, the former occupant of her new home, was run out of town for having accused the popular guys at school of gang rape, she’s incensed that Lucy never had justice. For their own personal reasons, Rosina and Erin feel equally deeply about Lucy’s tragedy, so they form an anonymous group of girls at Prescott High to resist the sexist culture at their school, which includes boycotting sex of any kind with the male students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating perspectives, this groundbreaking novel is an indictment of rape culture and explores with bold honesty the deepest questions about teen girls and sexuality.</description>

  <description>In the beginning, there was the Namsara: the child of sky and spirit, who carried love and laughter wherever he went. But where there is light, there must be darkness—and so there was also the Iskari. The child of blood and moonlight. The destroyer. The death-bringer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the legends that Asha, daughter of the king of Firgaard, has grown up learning in hushed whispers, drawn to the forbidden figures of the past. But it isn’t until she becomes the fiercest, most feared dragon slayer in the land that she takes on the role of the next Iskari—a lonely destiny that leaves her feeling more like a weapon than a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asha conquers each dragon and brings its head to the king, but no kill can free her from the shackles that await at home: her betrothal to the cruel commandant, a man who holds the truth about her nature in his palm. When she’s offered the chance to gain her freedom in exchange for the life of the most powerful dragon in Firgaard, she finds that there may be more truth to the ancient stories than she ever could have expected. With the help of a secret friend—a slave boy from her betrothed’s household—Asha must shed the layers of her Iskari bondage and open her heart to love, light, and a truth that has been kept from her.</description>

  <description>Poison is a literary psychological thriller about a marriage that follows minor betrayal into a bubbling stew of lies, cruelty, manipulation, and danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cass and Ryan Connor have achieved family nirvana. With three kids between them, a cat and a yard, a home they built and feathered, they seem to have the Modern Family dream. Their family, including Cass' two children from previous relationships, has recently moved to Portland —a new start for their new lives. Cass and Ryan have stable, successful careers, and they are happy. But trouble begins almost imperceptibly. First with small omissions and white lies that happen daily in any marital bedroom. They seem insignificant, but they are quickly followed by a series of denials and feints that mushroom and then cyclone in menace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With life-or-death stakes and irreversible consequences, Poison is a chilling and irresistible reminder that the closest bond designed to protect and provide for each other and for children can change in a minute.</description>

  <description>Penelope Wryter's life has been a mess ever since her sister committed suicide a year ago. Now Pen's hooked on Fix, an illegal drug that makes her feel, think, and see differently. The hallucinations are intense, but there's one vision that keeps Pen coming back for more--Nate. He's the only person who cares about her. Too bad he's just a side effect of the drug. Pen knows she's going nowhere fast. She's desperate to change. But when she tries to say goodbye to Nate, he professes his love for her making her more confused than ever. Then, when a girl from school goes missing during a bad Fix trip, Pen realizes she may be in a lot more danger than she ever imagined. Unless Pen straightens up and faces reality quick, she might be the next missing girl on the list.</description>

Still, it has potential. <br /><br />I received an advanced copy of this book from the author via NetGalley.]]>

  <description>Surpoids, dépression, diabète, maladies de peau… et si tout se jouait dans l’intestin ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Au fil des pages de son brillant ouvrage, Giulia Enders, jeune doctorante en médecine, plaide avec humour pour cet organe qu’on a tendance à négliger, voire à maltraiter. Après une visite guidée au sein de notre système digestif, elle présente, toujours de façon claire et captivante, les résultats des toutes dernières recherches sur le rôle du “deuxième cerveau’’ pour notre bien-être. C’est avec des arguments scientifiques qu’elle nous invite à changer de comportement alimentaire, à éviter certains médicaments ainsi qu’à appliquer quelques règles très concrètes en faveur d’une digestion réussie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irrésistiblement illustré par Jill Enders, la soeur de l’auteur, voici un livre qui nous réconcilie avec notre ventre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Succès surprise, Le Charme discret de l’intestin s’est vendu à plus de un million d’exemplaires en Allemagne et sera publié dans une trentaine de pays.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The stunningly original, must-read fantasy of 2018 follows two fiercely independent young women, centuries apart, who hold the power to save their world...or doom it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When assassins ambush her best friend, Rielle Dardenne risks everything to save him, exposing herself as one of a pair of prophesied queens: a queen of light, and a queen of blood. To prove she is the Sun Queen, Rielle must endure seven elemental magic trials. If she fails, she will be executed...unless the trials kill her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thousand years later, the legend of Queen Rielle is a fairy tale to Eliana Ferracora. A bounty hunter for the Undying Empire, Eliana believes herself untouchable--until her mother vanishes. To find her, Eliana joins a rebel captain and discovers that the evil at the empire's heart is more terrible than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rielle and Eliana fight in a cosmic war that spans millennia, their stories intersect, and the shocking connections between them ultimately determine the fate of their world--and of each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A collection of seventeen wonderful short stories showing that two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks is as talented a writer as he is an actor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gentle Eastern European immigrant arrives in New York City after his family and his life have been torn apart by his country's civil war. A man who loves to bowl rolls a perfect game--and then another and then another and then many more in a row until he winds up ESPN's newest celebrity, and he must decide if the combination of perfection and celebrity has ruined the thing he loves. An eccentric billionaire and his faithful executive assistant venture into America looking for acquisitions and discover a down and out motel, romance, and a bit of real life. These are just some of the tales Tom Hanks tells in this first collection of his short stories. They are surprising, intelligent, heartwarming, and, for the millions and millions of Tom Hanks fans, an absolute must-have!</description>

  <description>En camp de vacances, Angie, 13 ans, disparaît… Elle revient chez elle, persuadée de s’être seulement égarée quelques heures. En réalité, trois ans se sont écoulés. Trois ans sans le moindre souvenir, si ce n’est de profondes cicatrices aux chevilles et aux poignets, et une étrange bague à l’annulaire. Tout laisse à penser qu’Angela a vécu l’enfer… Mais que s’est-il réellement passé ? Et pourquoi a-t-elle tout oublié ?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt; in this ruthless, captivating story of a young woman’s survival in the frozen wilderness of the Yukon after the rest of the world has collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the old world dies, we all must choose to become predators. Or become prey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old world has been ravaged by war and disease, and as far as Lynn McBride is concerned, her family could be the last one left on earth. For seven years, the McBrides have eked out a meagre existence in the still, white wilderness of the Yukon. But this is not living. This is survival on the brink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into this fragile community walk new threats, including the enigmatic fugitive, Jax, who holds secrets about the past and, possibly, keys to a better future. And then there’s Immunity, the pre‑war organization that was supposed to save humankind from the flu. They’re still out there, enforcing order and conducting experiments—but is their work for the good of humankind or is something much more sinister at play? In the face of almost certain extinction, Lynn and her family must learn to hunt as a pack or die alone in the cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakout debut novelist Tyrell Johnson weaves a captivating tale of humanity stretched far beyond its breaking point, of family and the bonds of love forged when everything else is lost. Reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;, this is a classic and enthralling post‑apocalyptic adventure and a celebration of the human spirit.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love any dystopian story. But this one felt plausible to me. Maybe because it’s been -20C for more than a week here, the snow crunching beneath my boots. I loved every part of this book. The characters are vibrant, real, lovable. <br /><br />Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy via NetGalley....]]>

  <description>Tucked away in her tattoo studio in the port city of Halifax, Shaz draws meaning and symbolism onto the bodies of her clients. After the ransacking of her home, the brutal attack on her friend and the sudden appearance of her white father, Shaz is compelled to explore the racial divides in her life and in the city around her. A chance encounter with Rashid, a parkour-performing refugee from Sri Lanka, provides a stabilizing counterpoint to the tumultuous relationships in her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, Shaz discovers the complexities of truth, the meaning of loss and how we are all coloured by our experiences. In a narrative that explores racism, family dysfunction and the experiences of refugees, Under Her Skin paints the canvas of our landscape, making us aware of who we are.</description>

  <description>The most important thing is that Jess Wong is Angie Redmond's best friend, even if Angie can't see how she truly feels. It's okay that Jess is the girl on the sidelines that nobody notices. That means she's free to watch everyone else and be at Angie's side. But when Angie starts falling for Margot, a girl from the nearby boarding school, Jess can already see what's going to happen. And suddenly her gift for observation is a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Angie drags Jess further into Margot's circle, Jess finds more than her friend's growing crush. Secrets lie just beneath the carefree surface of this world, and when they come out, Jess knows Angie won't be able to handle the consequences. When the inevitable darkness finally descends, Angie will need her best friend.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The ultimate hockey dad, Karl Subban is a former school principal and father of five, including three sons--P.K., Malcolm and Jordan--who have been drafted to the NHL. Karl's inspirational and moving story follows the hockey journey from house league to the big leagues and shows how to grow the unlimited potential that is in every child.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his thirty-plus years of coaching, teaching and parenting, Karl Subban has proved to be a leader with the gift of inspiring others. He has dedicated his life to helping young people grow their potential--to be better at what they do, and to be better people.&lt;br /&gt;    Originally from Jamaica, Karl Subban, along with his wife, Maria, have raised five accomplished children. Their oldest son is P.K. Subban, who won the Norris trophy for top defenceman in the NHL and whose trade from the Canadiens to the Nashville Predators shocked the hockey world. Their two daughters are teachers, one a university basketball star and the other a talented visual artist. Their two youngest sons, Malcolm and Jordan, have been drafted and signed by the Bruins and the Canucks.&lt;br /&gt;    As a child, Karl dreamed of being a star cricket player--but when he moved to Canada at age 12, hockey and basketball became his new passions. At university, when he realized his NBA hoop dreams would not come to be, Subban found his true destiny as an educator, devoting his life to bringing out the best in his students and his children.&lt;br /&gt;    From the backyard hockey rink to the nail-biting suspense of draft days, Karl Subban shares tales of his family's unique hockey journey. Mixing personal stories with lessons he learned as a coach and principal--lessons about goal-setting, perseverance and accomplishment--&lt;i&gt;How We Did It&lt;/i&gt; will allow other parents, teachers, coaches and mentors to apply the same principles as they help the young people in their lives to identify, develop and &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; their dreams.</description>

  <description>With wry wit and boundless heart, Eva Woods delivers an unforgettable tale of celebrating triumphs great and small, seizing the day, and always remembering to live in the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It's simple, really. You're just meant to do one thing every day that makes you happy. Could be little things. Could be big. In fact, we're doing one right now…”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Hebden is stuck. Stuck in her boring job, with her irritating roommate, in a life no thirty-five-year-old would want. But deep down, Annie is still mourning the terrible loss that tore a hole through the perfect existence she'd once taken for granted—and hiding away is safer than remembering what used to be. Until she meets the eccentric Polly Leonard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bright, bubbly, intrusive Polly is everything Annie doesn't want in a friend. But Polly is determined to finally wake Annie up to life. Because if recent events have taught Polly anything, it's that your time is too short to waste a single day—which is why she wants Annie to join her on a mission…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred days. One hundred new ways to be happy. Annie's convinced it's impossible, but so is saying no to Polly. And on an unforgettable journey that will force her to open herself to new experiences—and perhaps even new love with the unlikeliest of men—Annie will slowly begin to realize that maybe, just maybe, there's still joy to be found in the world. But then it becomes clear that Polly's about to need her new friend more than ever…and Annie will have to decide once and for all whether letting others in is a risk worth taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Simply irresistible!" -Library Journal &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A special book that will make you laugh through your tears with its heartfelt take on happiness and friendship.”—Amy E. Reichert, author of The Coincidence of Coconut Cake</description>

  <description>It’s a new day in the Empire. Tyrus has ascended to the throne with Nemesis by his side and now they can find a new way forward—one where they don’t have to hide or scheme or kill. One where creatures like Nemesis will be given worth and recognition, where science and information can be shared with everyone and not just the elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having power isn’t the same thing as keeping it, and change isn’t always welcome. The ruling class, the Grandiloquy, has held control over planets and systems for centuries—and they are plotting to stop this teenage Emperor and Nemesis, who is considered nothing more than a creature and certainly not worthy of being Empress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nemesis will protect Tyrus at any cost. He is the love of her life, and they are partners in this new beginning. But she cannot protect him by being the killing machine she once was. She will have to prove the humanity that she’s found inside herself to the whole Empire—or she and Tyrus may lose more than just the throne. But if proving her humanity means that she and Tyrus must do inhuman things, is the fight worth the cost of winning it?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Long-awaited, thrilling new fiction from Kathleen Winter, whose previous novel &lt;i&gt;Annabel&lt;/i&gt; was a finalist for the Scotiabank Giller, Governor General's Award, Writers' Trust and Orange prizes, was a &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/i&gt; "Best Book" and a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; "Notable," and was a #1 bestselling Canada Reads selection.&lt;/b&gt; From one of Canada's most exciting writers comes a gripping, compassionate and stunning novel that overturns and rewrites history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the world of Jimmy--a tall, red-haired, homeless thirty-something ex-soldier, battered by PTSD--as he camps out on the streets of modern-day Montreal, trying to remember and reclaim his youth. While his past is something of an enigma, even to himself, the young man bears a striking resemblance to General James Wolfe, "Conqueror of Canada" and "Hero of Quebec," who died on the Plains of Abraham in 1759.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a young soldier in his twenties, the historical James Wolfe (1727-1759) was granted a short and much longed-for leave to travel to Paris to study poetry, music and dance--three of his passions. But in that very year, 1752, the British Empire abandoned the Julian calendar for the Gregorian, and every citizen of England lost eleven days: September 2 was followed by September 14. These lost eleven days happened to occur during the period that Wolfe had been granted for his leave. Despondent and bitter, he never got the chance to explore his artistic bent, and seven short years later, on the anniversary of this foreshortened leave, he died on the Plains of Abraham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, James is getting his eleven days back . . . but instead of the salons of 18th century Paris, he's wandering the streets of present-day Montreal and Quebec City, not as "the Hero of Quebec" but as a damaged war veteran wracked with anguish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like George Saunders in &lt;i&gt;Lincoln in the Bardo&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning author Kathleen Winter takes a brief, intensely personal incident in the life of a famous historical figure, and using her incomparable gifts as a fiction writer, powerfully reimagines him. Here is a wrenching, unforgettable portrait--like none you have ever seen or read--of one of the most well-known figures in Canadian history.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is something. I love historical novels, and this one is told from a modern point-of-view. How one can react to PTSD, it can be unpredictable.

  <description>These Royals will ruin you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton Royal has it all: looks, money, intelligence. His goal in life is to have as much fun as possible. He never thinks about the consequences because he doesn’t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Hartley Wright appears, shaking up his easy life. She’s the one girl who’s said no, despite being attracted to him. Easton can’t figure her out and that makes her all the more irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hartley doesn’t want him. She says he needs to grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rivals. Rules. Regrets. For the first time in Easton’s life, wearing a Royal crown isn’t enough. He’s about to learn that the higher you start, the harder you fall.</description>

  <description>These Royals will ruin you…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From mortal enemies to unexpected allies, two teenagers try to protect everything that matters most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Harper has met every challenge that life has thrown her way. She’s tough, resilient, and willing to do whatever it takes to defend the people she loves, but the challenge of a long-lost father and a boyfriend whose life is on the line might be too much for even Ella to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has a quick temper and even faster fists. But his tendency to meet every obstacle with violence has finally caught up with him. If he wants to save himself and the girl he loves, he’ll need to rise above his tortured past and tarnished reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one believes Ella can survive the Royals. Everyone is sure Reed will destroy them all.&lt;br /&gt;They may be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything and everyone conspiring to keep them apart, Ella and Reed must find a way to beat the law, save their families, and unravel all the secrets in their Twisted Palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Are you trying to kill us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but we love Ella so much and her adventures with the Royals that we needed to write this third book. You’ll see when you read it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Who’s in this book? And don’t say Ella!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella, the five Royal brothers, and a few more huge surprises.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The wild and poignant story of two young men--Ash Dhar, who is grieving the death of his father, and his best friend Matt, a pot-head drifter--who embark on a Don Quixote-like quest from Canada to Kashmir, India. A brilliantly entertaining novel by an award-winning, Giller Prize-nominated author.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pasha Malla burst onto the literary scene in 2009 with his first book, a collection of stories called &lt;i&gt;The Withdrawal Method&lt;/i&gt; that won the Trillium Book Award, was a &lt;i&gt;Globe&lt;/i&gt; Top 100 pick, and was nominated for the Giller Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. In 2012, he published his first novel, &lt;i&gt;People Park&lt;/i&gt;, which was shortlisted for the Amazon.ca First Novel Award. Now, with the extraordinary &lt;i&gt;Fugue States&lt;/i&gt;, he gives us a layered, mature work--equal parts funny and poignant, thought-provoking and compulsively, effortlessly readable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fugue States&lt;/i&gt; opens with the eulogy at a funeral: a eulogy delivered by Ash, a radio host, upon the death of his father, Brij, a Kashmir-born doctor and would-be writer. Later, while sorting through his father's belongings, Ash comes across a mysterious document: a half-completed and utterly baffling work of fiction set (possibly) in Kashmir. Ash begins to wonder about his Indian heritage and the ancestral home he knows only through his father's stories--as a place of brutality and stunning natural beauty. And yet he resists going to visit, skeptical of being another Westerner visiting a war-torn homeland; instead, Ash's best friend Matt--a drifter, pot-head, career bartender, massage therapy student, and self-described "maker of memories" (in other words, a "fool" in the best sense, in the spirit of Shakespeare and Cervantes and Nabokov's Pnin)--takes it upon himself to go in Ash's place...with strange, unexpected, hilarious and excruciating results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Fugue States &lt;/i&gt;is a spectacular novel, at once a parody of clueless tourism and western meddling in world affairs and a subtle, immensely affecting book about homesickness and the deep melancholy that abides in people who, like Ash and his father, and even like the foolish Matt, have never felt completely at home in the world.</description>

      <![CDATA[A lot of things are happening in this book. <br /><br />First, I have to say that I loved the way the author wrote the french words Matt tried to say, like phonetics for the dumbs. The words sounded like the french ones, I was really surprised! <br /><br />The story was good until the trip to Kashmir. Then it was chaos....]]>

  <description>Twenty-four-year-old truck stop waitress and single mother Catherine Wright has simple goals: to give her five-year-old daughter a happy life and to never again be the talk of the town in Balsam, Pennsylvania: population two thousand outside of tourist season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one foggy night, on a lonely road back from another failed attempt at a relationship, Catherine saves a man’s life. It isn’t until after the police have arrived that Catherine realizes exactly who it is she has saved: Brett Madden, hockey icon and media darling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine has already had her fifteen minutes of fame and the last thing she wants is to have her past dragged back into the spotlight, only this time on a national stage. So she hides her identity. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she finds the man she saved standing on her doorstep, desperate to thank her, all that changes. What begins as an immediate friendship quickly turns into something neither of them expected. Something that Catherine isn’t sure she can handle; something that Catherine is afraid to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because how long can an extraordinary man like Brett be interested in an ordinary woman like Catherine…before the spark fades?</description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy little English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code; little chalk stick figures they leave for each other as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing will ever be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out his other friends got the same messages, they think it could be a prank... until one of them turns up dead. That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expertly alternating between flashbacks and the present day, &lt;i&gt;The Chalk Man&lt;/i&gt; is the very best kind of suspense novel, one where every character is wonderfully fleshed out and compelling, where every mystery has a satisfying payoff, and where the twists will shock even the savviest reader.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;In the bestselling tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, from the internationally bestselling author whom Stephen King called “an absolute master” of the psychological thriller, comes a riveting suspense novel about the unlikely friendship between two pregnant women that asks: how far would you go to create the perfect family?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agatha is pregnant and works part-time stocking shelves at a grocery store in a ritzy London suburb, counting down the days until her baby is due. As the hours of her shifts creep by in increasing discomfort, the one thing she looks forward to at work is catching a glimpse of Meghan, the effortlessly chic customer whose elegant lifestyle dazzles her. Meghan has it all: two perfect children, a handsome husband, a happy marriage, a stylish group of friends, and she writes perfectly droll confessional posts on her popular parenting blog—posts that Agatha reads with devotion each night as she waits for her absent boyfriend, the father of her baby, to maybe return her calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Agatha learns that Meghan is pregnant again, and that their due dates fall within the same month, she finally musters up the courage to speak to her, thrilled that they now have the ordeal of childbearing in common. Little does Meghan know that the mundane exchange she has with a grocery store employee during a hurried afternoon shopping trip is about to change the course of her not-so-perfect life forever…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With its brilliant rendering of the secrets some women hold close and a shocking act that cannot be undone, &lt;i&gt;The Secrets She Keeps&lt;/i&gt; delivers a dark and twisted page-turner that is absolutely impossible to put down.</description>

Lynch's suspicions about who abducted Cody are met with scorn by his detectives, some of whom can't handle the fact that's he's gay. When half the station calls in sick with flu, Lynch seeks outside help. It arrives in the shape of an FBI agent for whom Lynch feels an immediate attraction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, local crime is on the rise and Lynch finds himself the target of prank calls and hate speech that he worries is the work of a colleague. Time is ticking away, Lynch is struggling to discover who is behind Idyll's crime spree, and he's beginning to doubt that Cody will ever be found ...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Named a &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; Notable Work of Fiction of 2017&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; Best Book of the Year&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Chatelaine &lt;/i&gt;Best Fall Reads pick&lt;br /&gt;#1 on the August Library Reads list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An&lt;i&gt; Entertainment Weekly's &lt;/i&gt;"13 Books to Read in August"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Amazon's "Best Books of the Month" for August&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Barnes &amp;amp; Noble "August's Best New Fiction" pick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;#3 on the September Indie Next List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aviva Grossman is a bright, ambitious congressional intern with a promising political future ahead of her until she makes the mistake of having an affair with her very married boss ... and writing what she thinks is an anonymous blog about it. When the affair dramatically comes to light, it's not the popular congressman who takes the fall, it's Aviva--and her life suddenly seems over before it's hardly begun. Slut-shamed and hounded by the media, she becomes a late-night talk show punchline. Determined to rebuild her life on her own terms, Aviva changes her name, moves from Florida to a small town in Maine, starts her own wedding planning business ... and decides to continue a surprise pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when "Jane" decides to run for public office, that long-ago mistake--an inescapable scarlet A--trails her via the Internet, threatening to derail her life yet again. It's only a matter of time until her daughter finds out who her mother once was--and is forced to reconcile that person with the one she thinks she knows ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Young Jane Young&lt;/i&gt; is a smart, funny, and extremely timely novel which exposes the myriad ways we shame, forgive, and love one another. Just as she did in &lt;i&gt;The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry&lt;/i&gt;, the superbly talented Gabrielle Zevin has created a cast of unforgettable characters: an ambitious yet naive twenty-something, a mother attempting to steer her daughter through a judgmental world, a veteran political wife facing the hard truth that fidelity isn't always rewarded, and a young girl who feels bold about her choices before she realizes the restrictions all around her. Not only does Zevin skewer the inherent double standards in women's everyday lives, she also explores the true meaning of resilience--and, ultimately, forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;We sat at the edge of the ocean—my sister Henri and I—inches apart but not touching at all. We'd been so sure someone would find us by now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emma had always orbited Henri, her fierce, magnetic queen bee of an older sister, and the two had always been best friends. Until something happened that wrecked them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'd trusted Henri more than I'd trusted myself. Wherever she told me to go, I'd follow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the unthinkable occurs—a watery nightmare off the dazzling coast. The girls wash up on shore, stranded. Their only companion is Alex, a troubled boy agonizing over his own secrets. Trapped in this gorgeous hell, Emma and Alex fall together as Emma and Henri fall catastrophically apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For the first time, I was afraid we'd die on this shore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To find their way home, the sisters must find their way back to each other. But there’s no map for this—or anything. Can they survive the unearthing of the past and the upheaval of the present?</description>

  <description>No outsiders are ever admitted to the monastery of Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups, hidden deep in the wilderness of Québec, where two dozen cloistered monks live in peace and prayer. Ironically, for a community that has taken a vow of silence, the monks have become world-famous for their glorious voices, raised in ancient chants whose effect on both singer and listener is so profound it is known as "the beautiful mystery."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the renowned choir director is murdered, the lock on the monastery's massive wooden door is drawn back to admit Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir of the Sûreté du Québec. There they discover disquiet beneath the silence, discord in the apparent harmony. But before finding the killer, before restoring peace, the Chief must first consider the divine, the human, and the cracks in between.</description>

Cracked and bloody, buried in the snow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agoraphobic fangirl Tessa Hart knows the truth, but she's finally left her #EricThornObsessed days behind. She has no intention of ever touching her Twitter app again. But Snapchat... That's safer, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of living under the radar, Tessa emerges from hiding, forced to face the deadly consequences of her past. But in the interrogation room, answers only lead to more questions in the pulse-pounding conclusion to the Follow Me Back duology.</description>

  <description>The user manual/recipe book that came with my Blendtec blender is now one of my go-to cookbooks. Great recipes, and really useful information about how to fruit &amp;amp; vegetable prep, sugar substitutions, and more.</description>

  <description>When a beloved high schooler named Lucinda Hayes is found murdered, no one in her sleepy Colorado suburb is untouched—not the boy who loved her too much; not the girl who wanted her perfect life; not the officer assigned to investigate her murder. In the aftermath of the tragedy, these three indelible characters—Cameron, Jade, and Russ—must each confront their darkest secrets in an effort to find solace, the truth, or both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In crystalline prose, Danya Kukafka offers a brilliant exploration of identity and of the razor-sharp line between love and obsession, between watching and seeing, between truth and memory. Compulsively readable and powerfully moving, &lt;i&gt;Girl in Snow&lt;/i&gt; offers an unforgettable reading experience and introduces a singular new talent in Danya Kukafka.</description>

  <description>Cyril Avery is not a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Avery or at least that’s what his adoptive parents tell him. And he never will be. But if he isn’t a real Avery, then who is he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born out of wedlock to a teenage girl cast out from her rural Irish community and adopted by a well-to-do if eccentric Dublin couple via the intervention of a hunchbacked Redemptorist nun, Cyril is adrift in the world, anchored only tenuously by his heartfelt friendship with the infinitely more glamourous and dangerous Julian Woodbead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the mercy of fortune and coincidence, he will spend a lifetime coming to know himself and where he came from – and over his three score years and ten, will struggle to discover an identity, a home, a country and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this, Boyne's most transcendent work to date, we are shown the story of Ireland from the 1940s to today through the eyes of one ordinary man. &lt;i&gt;The Heart's Invisible Furies&lt;/i&gt; is a novel to make you laugh and cry while reminding us all of the redemptive power of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>A riveting psychological thriller inspired by the never-caught Zodiac Killer, about a young detective determined to apprehend the serial murderer who destroyed her family and terrorized a city twenty years earlier.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caitlin Hendrix has been a Narcotics detective for six months when the killer at the heart of all her childhood nightmares reemerges: the Prophet. An UNSUB—what the FBI calls an unknown subject—the Prophet terrorized the Bay Area in the 1990s and nearly destroyed her father, the lead investigator on the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prophet’s cryptic messages and mind games drove Detective Mack Hendrix to the brink of madness, and Mack’s failure to solve the series of ritualized murders—eleven seemingly unconnected victims left with the ancient sign for Mercury etched into their flesh—was the final nail in the coffin for a once promising career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years later, two bodies are found bearing the haunting signature of the Prophet. Caitlin Hendrix has never escaped the shadow of her father’s failure to protect their city. But now the ruthless madman is killing again and has set his sights on her, threatening to undermine the fragile barrier she rigidly maintains for her own protection, between relentless pursuit and dangerous obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to decipher his twisted messages and stop the carnage, Caitlin ignores her father’s warnings as she draws closer to the killer with each new gruesome murder. Is it a copycat, or can this really be the same Prophet who haunted her childhood? Will Caitlin avoid repeating her father’s mistakes and redeem her family name, or will chasing the Prophet drag her and everyone she loves into the depths of the abyss?</description>

This is why this serial killer’s chase was so intense.<br /><br />Can’t wait for book 2!!<br /><br />Many thanks for the publisher and NetGal...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt; meets Ruth Ware’s &lt;i&gt;In A Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt; in this inventive and twisty psychological thriller about a mega-hit podcast that reopens a murder case—and threatens to unravel the carefully constructed life of the victim’s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The only thing more dangerous than a lie...is the truth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie Buhrman has spent the last ten years trying to escape her family’s reputation and with good reason. After her father's murder thirteen years prior, her mother ran away to join a cult and her twin sister Lanie, once Josie’s closest friend and confidant, betrayed her in an unimaginable way. Now, Josie has finally put down roots in New York, settling into domestic life with her partner Caleb, and that’s where she intends to stay. The only problem is that she has lied to Caleb about every detail of her past—starting with her last name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When investigative reporter Poppy Parnell sets off a media firestorm with a mega-hit podcast that reopens the long-closed case of Josie’s father’s murder, Josie’s world begins to unravel. Meanwhile, the unexpected death of Josie’s long-absent mother forces her to return to her Midwestern hometown where she must confront the demons from her past—and the lies on which she has staked her future.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is one twisty thriller! I had heard a lot about this book, and I was soooo happy to have won it in a Goodreads giveaway! It did not disappoint. I loved how the story of the murder is told by alternative ways (the "famous" podcast, the comments, articles or tweets surrounding it), it was refr...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"A female investigator every bit as brainy and battle-hardened as Lisbeth Salander." &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Maureen Corrigan, NPR's &lt;em&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/em&gt;, on Maisie Dobbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sunday September 3rd 1939.  At the moment Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain broadcasts to the nation Britain’s declaration of war with Germany, a senior Secret Service agent breaks into Maisie Dobbs' flat to await her return. Dr. Francesca Thomas has an urgent assignment for Maisie: to find the killer of a man who escaped occupied Belgium as a boy, some twenty-three years earlier during the Great War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In a London shadowed by barrage balloons, bomb shelters and the threat of invasion, within days another former Belgian refugee is found murdered.  And as Maisie delves deeper into the killings of the dispossessed from the “last war," a new kind of refugee — an evacuee from London — appears in Maisie's life. The little girl billeted at Maisie’s home in Kent does not, or cannot, speak, and the authorities do not know who the child belongs to or who might have put her on the “Operation Pied Piper” evacuee train.  They know only that her name is Anna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Maisie’s search for the killer escalates, the country braces for what is to come.  Britain is approaching its gravest hour — and Maisie could be nearing a crossroads of her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two missing girls. Thirteen years apart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Olivia Shaw has been missing since last Tuesday. She was last seen outside the entrance of her elementary school in Hunts Point wearing a white spring jacket, blue jeans, and pink boots. I force myself to look at the face in the photo, into her slightly smudged features, and I can't bring myself to move. Olivia Shaw could be my mirror image, rewound to thirteen years ago. If you have any knowledge of Olivia Shaw's whereabouts or any relevant information, please contact... I've spent a long time peering into the faces of girls on missing posters, wondering which one replaced me in that basement. But they were never quite the right age, the right look, the right circumstances. Until Olivia Shaw, missing for one week tomorrow. Whoever stole me was never found. But since I was taken, there hasn't been another girl. And now there is.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A bold debut novel for those who loved Emma Cline's &lt;i&gt;The Girls &lt;/i&gt;and Rachel Kushner's &lt;i&gt;The Flamethrowers&lt;/i&gt;--a story of love, lust, and the spaces in between, from a "captivating" (NYTBR) new voice in fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1950, and nine-year-old Willa's sheltered childhood is about to come to an end when her two new stepbrothers arrive at her family's summer home in British Columbia. As Willa's older sister pairs off with the older of these boys, Willa finds herself alone in the off-kilter company of the younger, Patrick. When, one afternoon, Patrick lures Willa into a dilapidated rowboat, Willa embarks upon an increasingly damaging relationship with Patrick, one that will forever reconfigure her understanding of herself and her place in a menacing, male-dominated world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Demi-Gods&lt;/i&gt; traces the tumultuous years of Willa's coming-of-age, as she is drawn further into Patrick's wicked games. Though they see each other only a handful of times, each of their encounters is increasingly charged with sexuality and degradation. When Willa finally realizes the danger of her relationship with Patrick, she desperately tries to reverse their dynamic, with devastating results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daring, singular, and provocative, &lt;i&gt;Demi-Gods&lt;/i&gt; explores a girl's attempt to make a life of her own choosing in a world where woman's independence is suspect, a world that threatens to claim a woman's body as a mere object for men's pleasure. A sensitive, playful, and entirely original evocation of the dualities within ourselves and our history, Eliza Robertson's debut novel announces the arrival of one of the most exciting new voices in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Erica Spindler comes &lt;i&gt;The Other Girl&lt;/i&gt;, a chilling new thriller about a ritualistic murder of a college professor that sends a small town cop back into the trauma she thought she’d put behind her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A horrific crime. One witness—a fifteen year old girl from the wrong side of the tracks, one known for lying and her own brushes with the law.&lt;br /&gt;Is it any surprise no one believed her?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Officer Miranda Rader of the Harmony, Louisiana PD is known for her honesty, integrity, and steady hand in a crisis—but that wasn’t always so. Miranda comes from the town of Jasper, a place about the size of a good spit on a hot day, and her side of the tracks was the wrong one. She’s worked hard to earn the respect of her coworkers and the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Miranda and her partner are called to investigate the murder of one of the town’s most beloved college professors, they’re unprepared for the brutality of the scene. This murder is unlike any they’ve ever investigated, and just when Miranda thinks she’s seen the worst of it, she finds a piece of evidence that chills her to the core: a faded newspaper clipping about that terrible night fifteen years ago. The night she’d buried, along with her past and the girl she’d been back then. Until now that grave had stayed sealed…except for those times, in the deepest part of the night, when the nightmares came: of a crime no one believed happened and the screams of the girl they believed didn’t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then another man turns up dead, this one a retired cop. Not just any cop—the one who took her statement that night. Two murders, two very different men, two killings that on the surface had nothing in common—except Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Big Jack had a secret book&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He did; yes, he did&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He kept it by his side&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He did; yes, he did&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone on the island of St. Pierre knows the story of Big Jack. A haunting island song that has been passed down through the generations tells of the slave and his mysterious book. The song warns any who dare seek out the tome, -You'll be cursed if you look.-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the frightening power of Big Jack's book of secrets, many become obsessed with finding it. One such hunter is Finch Waters. She has come to the South Carolina island with a university research expedition to study and preserve traditional folksongs. As she awakens to the magic of St. Pierre, she becomes increasingly entranced with the legend of Big Jack and his book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finch isn't the only person on the island looking for the book of secrets. An evil force is gathering on St. Pierre and will stop at nothing until it has the power of the book for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on true events, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Secrets&lt;/i&gt; weaves Finch's story into a spellbinding, thought-provoking narrative about temptation, corruption, and salvation.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;How far would you go to protect your family?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randolph Tiefenthaler leads a normal life. He has an attractive, intelligent wife, and two children, enjoys modest success as an architect, and has just moved into a beautiful old building in a respectable part of Berlin. Life seems perfect — until he meets the man living in the apartment downstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dieter Tiberius is friendly at first, if a little odd, but his behaviour quickly becomes distressing when erotic letters addressed to Randolph’s wife are discovered on their doorstep. As Dieter’s campaign of harassment intensifies, Randolph struggles with his own uncertainty — pondering fundamental questions about masculinity, violence, and the rule of law — and his reliability is slowly but irrevocably called into doubt. The result is an unsettling meditation on middle-class privilege reminiscent of sophisticated works of psychological suspense such as Herman Koch’s &lt;em&gt;The Dinner&lt;/em&gt; and Lionel Shriver’s &lt;em&gt;We Need to Talk About Kevin&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>In this gripping, atmospheric family drama, a young woman investigates the forty-year-old murder that inspired her mother’s bestselling novel, and uncovers devastating truths—and dangerous lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reformed party girl Meg Ashley leads a life of a privilege, thanks to a bestselling horror novel her mother wrote decades ago. But Meg knows that the glow of their very public life hides a darker reality of lies, manipulation, and the heartbreak of her own solitary childhood. Desperate to break free of her mother, Meg accepts a proposal to write a scandalous, tell-all memoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digging into the past—and her mother’s cult classic—draws Meg to Bonny Island, Georgia and an unusual woman said to be the inspiration for the book. At first, island life seems idyllic, but as Meg starts to ask tough questions, disturbing revelations come to light…including some about her mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Meg’s search leads her to question the facts of a decades-old murder. She’s warned to leave it alone, but as the lies pile up, Meg knows she’s getting close to finding a murderer. When her own life is threatened, Meg realizes the darkness found in her mother’s book is nothing compared to the chilling truth that lurks off the page.</description>

  <description>It’s been a year since Billie Flanagan—a beautiful, charismatic Berkeley mom with an enviable life—went on a solo hike in Desolation Wilderness and vanished from the trail. No body—only a hiking boot—has ever been found. Billie’s husband and teenage daughter cope with her death the best they can: Jonathan drinks, Olive grows remote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Olive starts having waking dreams—or are they hallucinations?—that her mother is still alive. Jonathan worries about Olive’s emotional stability, until he starts unearthing secrets from Billie’s past that bring into question everything he thought he knew about his wife. Together, Olive and Jonathan embark on a quest for the truth—about Billie, their family, and the stories we tell ourselves about the people we love.</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow. This book was recommended to me, so when I saw the Goodreads giveaway, I jumped on it. I am not a big romance reader, but I think I will read more from now! I absolutely devoured the book. The intensity of the emotions, the steamy sex scenes, everything was there to make me want to read more...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Ship&lt;/i&gt; is a luminous and genre-defying debut novel that follows a young woman's coming of age in a world where she has no future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;London burned for three weeks. And then it got worse...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lalla has grown up sheltered from the chaos amid the ruins of civilization. But things are getting more dangerous outside. People are killing each other for husks of bread, and the police are detaining anyone without an identification card. On her sixteenth birthday, Lalla's father decides it's time to use their escape route--a ship he's built that is only big enough to save five hundred people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the utopia her father has created isn't everything it appears. There's more food than anyone can eat, but nothing grows; more clothes than anyone can wear, but no way to mend them; and no-one can tell her where they are going.</description>

      <![CDATA[Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the e-copy of this book.<br /><br />It's creepy, just how plausible this story is. Seriously. In a futuristic London, a ship sailed to save 500 people, chosen carefully. For Lalla, the choice had not been entirely hers: it's her father that bought and fur...]]>

  <description>There is a reckoning coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atlanta is within striking distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four companions continue forging a path through the Beastlands, battling both the jungle and its inhabitants as they make their way toward the Enclave and a final confrontation with Jacob and his followers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the bond between Alee and Trace grows stronger, the last whispers of doubt Rayn had about him are left miles behind. In her heart, she knows he would lay down his life to protect any one of them, but she needs to make sure that that never happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a renewed sense of purpose, and Luk standing by her side, as he always has, Rayn promises herself that they will all make it back to Graceland and the future that awaits them there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, the embattled city of Birmingham blocks their way.</description>

  <description>The gaslight and shadows of the underground city of Recoletta hide secrets and lies. When Inspector Liesl Malone investigates the murder of a renowned historian, she finds herself stonewalled by the all-powerful Directorate of Preservation – Recoletta’s top-secret historical research facility. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; When a second high-profile murder threatens the very fabric of city society, Malone and her rookie partner Rafe Sundar must tread carefully, lest they fall victim to not only the criminals they seek, but the government which purports to protect them.</description>

  <description>After a failed apprenticeship, working her way up to head housekeeper of a posh London hotel is more than Sara Smythe ever thought she’d make of herself. But when a chance encounter with Theodore Camden, one of the architects of the grand New York apartment house The Dakota, leads to a job offer, her world is suddenly awash in possibility—no mean feat for a servant in 1884. The opportunity to move to America, where a person can rise above one’s station. The opportunity to be the female manager of The Dakota, which promises to be the greatest apartment house in the world. And the opportunity to see more of Theo, who understands Sara like no one else...and is living in The Dakota with his wife and three young children.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The propulsive second novel in a new contemporary trilogy about unforgettable love, scorching desire, and dangerous secrets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Abigail Rhodes bought that old house she fell in love with in Blink, Texas, she got more than she bargained for. After being told by the local psychic that it is filled with a passionate energy from the previous owners, who died years ago, Abby decides to fix up her beloved house and reluctantly moves in. But ever since then, strange things have been happening in her newly renovated home, and Abby has been plagued with dreams that wake her up and leave her breathless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a tumultuous life these last few years, Jordan Gatewood is following what amounts to a trail of breadcrumbs in an effort to find a renewed sense of purpose. Searching for the truth about the man his adoptive-father really was, Jordan makes his way to the old house where his father was murdered, in Blink--and right to the petite, understated beauty that answers the door. It's not long before Jordan realizes, quite unexpectedly, that Abby is the perfect woman for him. Jordan doesn't believe in ghosts or fate, but he does know that the powerful connection he feels for this woman started the day he met her in that house and he is determined to make her his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin is a successful Corporate Attorney, and was proud to be the lover of the most sought after bachelor in the state of Texas--until he abruptly breaks off their relationship, leaving her confused, heartbroken and bitter. When she discovers that he's left her for another woman, a woman she considers beneath her, Robin is determined to teach him a brutal lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man like Jordan has too many secrets, secrets that, if found out, could not only destroy his relationship with this other woman, but that could also cost him the biggest business deal of his life, and possibly, his freedom. Robin is the last person he wants to go up against, and she will stop at nothing to get him back or to make him pay for his betrayal, even if that means unleashing those secrets. The question is, will Jordan let her? Or will his all-consuming obsession with Abby win out, in &lt;i&gt;Seducing Abby Rhodes&lt;/i&gt; by J.D. Mason.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Thief. Manipulator. Con artist. Call it what you will—Bianca St. Ives is the best in the business.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, Bianca St. Ives knew she was different from all her friends. Instead of playing hopscotch or combing her dolls' hair, she studied martial arts with sensei masters and dismantled explosives with special-ops retirees. Her father prepped her well to carry on the family business. Now a striking beauty with fierce skills, the prodigy has surpassed the master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's known as the Guardian. Running a multinational firm with her father, she makes a living swindling con men out of money they stole—and she's damn good at it. She does things on her own terms. But her latest gig had a little hiccup—if you count two hundred million dollars and top secret government documents going missing as &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt;. Her father also died on the mission. The thing is, the US government doesn't believe he's really dead. They'll stop at nothing to capture Richard St. Ives, a high-value target and someone who has been on most-wanted lists all over the world for over two decades, and they mean to use Bianca as bait. With only a fellow criminal for backup and her life on the line, it's up to Bianca to uncover the terrifying truth behind what really happened...and set it right, before it's too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It’s not a lie if you can’t remember the truth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Flora Banks has no short-term memory. Her mind resets itself several times a day, and has since the age of ten, when the tumor that was removed from Flora’s brain took with it her ability to make new memories. That is, until she kisses Drake, her best friend’s boyfriend, the night before he leaves town. Miraculously, this one memory breaks through Flora’s fractured mind, and sticks. Flora is convinced that Drake is responsible for restoring her memory and making her whole again. So when an encouraging email from Drake suggests she meet him on the other side of the world, Flora knows with certainty that this is the first step toward reclaiming her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With little more than the words “be brave” inked into her skin, and written reminders of who she is and why her memory is so limited, Flora sets off on an impossible journey to Svalbard, Norway—the land of the midnight sun—determined to find Drake. But from the moment she arrives in the Arctic, nothing is quite as it seems, and Flora must “be brave” if she is ever to learn the truth about herself, and to make it safely home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As bubbly as champagne and delectable as wedding cake, &lt;i&gt;Once and for All&lt;/i&gt;, Sarah Dessen's thirteenth novel, is set in the world of wedding planning, where crises are routine.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Louna, daughter of famed wedding planner Natalie Barrett, has seen every sort of wedding: on the beach, at historic mansions, in fancy hotels and clubs. Perhaps that's why she's cynical about happily-ever-after endings, especially since her own first love ended tragically. When Louna meets charming, happy-go-lucky serial dater Ambrose, she holds him at arm's length. But Ambrose isn't about to be discouraged, now that he's met the one girl he really wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sarah Dessen’s many, many fans will adore her latest, a richly satisfying, enormously entertaining story that has everything—humor, romance, and an ending both happy and imperfect, just like life itself.</description>

  <description>Emma Cohen should be on top of the world. She has just graduated from Tulane University with a dual degree in English and Journalism and it is time for her life to begin. But when her boring, normal parents fail to show up to her celebratory dinner, everything starts to fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losing her parents is hard enough. But then the family attorney shows up to the hospital and informs her that she must run because there is a family secret that killed her parents and it still isn’t safe for her know the truth. Instead of attending her parents’ funeral and saying goodbye to her childhood home, she is sent to a houseboat that her parents kept for her as a sort of safe house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma tries to find a balance while living in the houseboat between blending in with her new small town surroundings and finding clues within the houseboat to try to find out what happened to her family. Can she find out the family secret before she meets the same fate as her parents? Or will the locals figure out her true identity and out her to the killer?</description>

  <description>Meet Sunday Night, a woman with physical and psychological scars, and a killer instinct... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunnie has spent years running from her past, burying secrets and building a life in which she needs no one and feels nothing. But a girl has gone missing, lost in the chaos of a bomb explosion, and the family needs Sunnie's help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the girl dead? Did someone take her? If she is out there, why doesn't she want to be found? It's time for Sunnie to face her own demons because they just might lead her to the truth about what really happened all those years ago.</description>

  <description>In the tender, heartwarming tradition of Nicholas Sparks, this compelling novel of two strangers in a small coastal town marks a romantic tour de force for internationally bestselling author Davis Bunn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He had not come all this way just to break another woman's heart.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Connor Larkin boards a late night bus in downtown LA, he's not sure where he's going or for what he's looking. Putting his acting career and his fiancee on hold, he's searching for something he can't define, a part of himself he lost on the road to success. Once he dreamed of being a singer in the classic style of Sinatra and Bennett. But his lean good looks soon landed him in movies as the sexy bad guy and in the arms of a famous young heiress. Now, with his wedding day approaching, Connor finds himself stepping into the sleepy seaside town of &lt;i&gt;Miramar Bay&lt;/i&gt; where one remarkable woman inspires him to rethink all of his choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She needed to know his secrets, and to see if he'd tell her the truth.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvie Cassick is nothing like the pretentious starlets back in Hollywood. The daughter of a nomadic painter, she's had to work hard for everything unlike Connor's fiancee. When Connor hears familiar music drifting out of Sylvie's restaurant, he feels as if he's finally come home. Sylvie isn't sure what to think when this impossibly handsome stranger applies for a waiter's job. Yet once he serenades her customers and slowly works his way into her heart she realizes there's more to him than he's letting on. And Connor realizes he's found his destiny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the outside world encroaches, threatening their fragile bond, Connor will have to risk losing everything to gain the life he longs for, and be the man Sylvie deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with bittersweet longing, &lt;i&gt;Miramar Bay&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable journey through doubt and desire to the truth that can be discovered along the road less taken.</description>

  <description>A sinister, sexy noir about art, motherhood, and the intensity of female friendships, set in the posh hills above Los Angeles, from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;California.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;High in the Hollywood Hills, writer Lady Daniels has decided to take a break from her husband. She’s going to need a hand with her young son if she’s ever going to finish her memoir. In comes S., a magnetic young artist, who will live in the secluded guest house out back, care for Lady’s young toddler son, and keep a watchful eye on her older, teenage, one. S. performs her day job beautifully, quickly drawing the entire family into her orbit, and becoming a confidante for Lady. But as the summer wears on, S.’s connection to Lady’s older son takes a disturbing, and possibly destructive, turn. Lady and S. will move closer to one another as they both threaten to harm the things they hold most dear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkly comic, twisty and tense, this mesmerizing new novel defies expectation and proves Edan Lepucki to be one of the most talented and exciting voices of her generation.</description>

  <description>Four months after the explosion at the Garden, a place where young women known as the Butterflies were kept captive, FBI agents Brandon Eddison, Victor Hanoverian, and Mercedes Ramirez are still entrenched in the aftermath, helping survivors in the process of adjusting to life on the outside. With winter coming to an end, the Butterflies have longer, warmer days of healing ahead. But for the agents, the impending thaw means one gruesome thing: a chilling guarantee that somewhere in the country, another young woman will turn up dead in a church with her throat slit and her body surrounded by flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Priya Sravasti’s sister fell victim to the killer years ago. Now she and her mother move every few months, hoping for a new beginning. But when she ends up in the madman’s crosshairs, the hunt takes on new urgency. Only with Priya’s help can the killer be found—but will her desperate hope for closure compel her to put her very life on the line?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;More than 100 fun food-crafting ideas that will engage, delight, and amaze kids-from actress, entrepreneur, and mom, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and former &lt;i&gt;Martha Stewart Living &lt;/i&gt;contributor Gia Russo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why stop with making basic brownies? Why not put them on a stick and decorate them? Why not take boring broccoli and turn it into a yummy cheese muffin instead? Sarah Michelle Gellar learned quickly that to get her kids to be adventurous with food, she had to involve them in preparing it. She wanted that process to be fun and help them develop self-confidence, creative thinking, and even math skills! So Sarah and co-author Gia Russo came up with more than 100 fun food-crafting ideas that take basic food preparation to a surprising new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organized by month, the book offers projects for every occasion and theme, including Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, Shark Week, Halloween, and even a &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; Day with licensed &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; creations! The possibilities are endless!</description>

  <description>Tessa Hart’s world feels very small. Confined to her bedroom with agoraphobia, her one escape is the online fandom for pop sensation Eric Thorn. When he tweets to his fans, it’s like his speaking directly to her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Thorn is frightened by his obsessive fans. They take their devotion way too far. It doesn’t help that his PR team keeps posting to encourage their fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a fellow pop star is murdered at the hands of a fan, Eric knows he has to do something to shatter his online image fast—like take down one of his top Twitter followers. But Eric’s plan to troll @TessaHeartsEric unexpectedly evolves into an online relationship deeper than either could have imagined. And when the two arrange to meet IRL, what should have made for the world’s best episode of Catfish takes a deadly turn…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Told through tweets, direct messages, and police transcripts.&lt;/i&gt;

But stories begin at the beginning and some secrets have to be earned.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela is being held in a police interrogation room. Her ex’s wife has gone missing and Detective Novak is sure Angela knows something, despite her claim that she’s not involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Novak’s prodding, Angela tells a story going back ten years, explaining how she met and fell in love with her high school friend HP. But as her past unfolds, she reveals a disconcerting love triangle and a dark, tangled web of betrayals. Is Angela a scorned ex-lover with criminal intent? Or a pawn in someone else’s revenge scheme? Who is she protecting? And why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisty and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;Our Little Secret&lt;/i&gt; is an intense cat-and-mouse game and a riveting thriller about the lies we tell others—and ourselves.</description>

  <description>Orphan Meg Fellowes makes her living picking pockets—until she steals from the wrong nobleman. Instead of rotting in prison like she expected, she’s whisked away to the court of Queen Elizabeth and pressed into royal service, where she joins four other remarkable girls in the Maids of Honor, the Queen’s secret society of protectors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meg’s natural abilities as a spy prove useful in this time of unrest. The Spanish Court is visiting, and with them come devious plots and hidden political motives. As threats to the kingdom begin to mount, Meg can’t deny her growing attraction to one of the dashing Spanish courtiers. But it’s hard to trust her heart in a place where royal formalities and masked balls hide the truth: Not everyone is who they appear to be. With danger lurking around every corner, can she stay alive—and protect the crown?</description>

She’s assigned to stake out Hollywood’s hottest clubs and spy on the celebrities inside. When Ella is pressured by her Devil Wears Prada-type boss to find an exclusive story to keep her job, she has to decide if being in Hollywood’s elite inner circle is worth jeopardizing her friendship with actress Holiday Hall, her budding romance with Holiday’s agent, and her family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A juicy, big-hearted novel about a young woman who loses herself in a fast-paced, glamorous world where finding your authentic self isn’t easy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From internationally acclaimed and Governor General's Award-winning author Steven Heighton comes a passionate novel of buried secrets, the repercussions of war and finding love among the ruins.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Elias Trifannis is desperate to belong somewhere. To make his dying ex-cop father happy, he joins the military--but in Afghanistan, by the time he realizes his last-minute bid for connection was a terrible mistake, it's too late and a tragedy has occurred. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the aftermath, exhausted by nightmares, Elias is sent to Cyprus to recover, where he attempts to find comfort in the arms of Eylul, a beautiful Turkish journalist. But the lovers' reprieve ends in a moment of shocking brutality that drives Elias into Varosha, once a popular Greek-Cypriot resort town, abandoned since the Turkish invasion of 1974.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hidden in the lush, overgrown ruins is a community of exiles and refugees living resourcefully but comfortably. Thanks to the cheerfully corrupt Colonel Kaya, who turns a blind eye, they live under the radar of the Turkish authorities.&lt;br /&gt; As he begins to heal, Elias finds himself drawn to the enigmatic and secretive Kaiti while he learns at last to "simply belong." But just when it seems he has found sanctuary, events he himself set in motion have already begun to endanger it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The thrilling conclusion to the #1 national bestselling historical trilogy by Roberta Rich.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Midwife of Venice&lt;/i&gt;, set in 1575, Hannah Levi was forced to flee Venice with the baby of a Venetian aristocratic family whom she rescued. Roberta Rich followed that action-packed adventure with &lt;i&gt;The Harem Midwife&lt;/i&gt;, which exiled Hannah and her beloved husband Isaac to Constantinople--only for Hannah to become enmeshed in the shady politics of a sultan's harem. And now, with &lt;i&gt;A Trial in Venice&lt;/i&gt;, set five years later, Hannah is forced back to Venice--both to opulent yet crumbling villas and the Jewish ghetto known as Veneto. Her beloved adopted son Matteo has been kidnapped and is in danger once more. And this time, so is Hannah.&lt;br /&gt; A rollicking and evocative read, peopled with beguiling, unforgettable characters (including the epic return of the troublesome and winsome Foscari and Cesca), this novel is a breathtaking follow up to &lt;i&gt;The Midwife of Venice&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Harem Midwife&lt;/i&gt;, certain to shock and delight fans of the series and solidify Rich's reputation as one of Canada's most loved historical fiction authors.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;All that glitters is not gold.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City, 2118. Manhattan is home to a thousand-story supertower, a breathtaking marvel that touches the sky. But amid high-tech luxury and futuristic glamour, five teenagers are keeping dangerous secrets…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leda is haunted by memories of what happened on the worst night of her life. She’ll do anything to make sure the truth stays hidden—even if it means trusting her enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watt just wants to put everything behind him…until Leda forces him to start hacking again. Will he do what it takes to be free of her for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rylin wins a scholarship to an upper-floor school, her life transforms overnight. But being there also means seeing the boy whose heart she broke, and who broke hers in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avery is tormented by her love for the one person in the world she can never have. She’s desperate to be with him…no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Calliope, the mysterious, bohemian beauty who arrives in New York determined to cause a stir. And she knows exactly where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unbeknownst to them all, someone is watching their every move, someone with revenge in mind. After all, in a world of such dazzling heights, just one wrong step can mean a devastating fall.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Ruby is a Fireblood who has concealed her powers of heat and flame from the cruel Frostblood ruling class her entire life. But when her mother is killed trying to protect her, and rebel Frostbloods demand her help to overthrow their bloodthirsty king, she agrees to come out of hiding, desperate to have her revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her unpredictable abilities, Ruby trains with the rebels and the infuriating - yet irresistible - Arcus, who seems to think of her as nothing more than a weapon. But before they can take action, Ruby is captured and forced to compete in the king’s tournaments that pit Fireblood prisoners against Frostblood champions. Now she has only one chance to destroy the maniacal ruler who has taken everything from her - and from the icy young man she has come to love.</description>
