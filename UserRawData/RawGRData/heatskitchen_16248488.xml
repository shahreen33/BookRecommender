  <description>&lt;i&gt;Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nine perfect strangers are about to find out...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer—or should she run while she still can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining all of the hallmarks that have made Liane Moriarty's writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, &lt;i&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers&lt;/i&gt; once again shows why she is a master of her craft.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian note: older cover of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18890079-cars-and-trucks-and-things-that-go" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780307157850&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The station wagon, the tow truck, the garbage truck and the bulldozer. Every manner of machinery that moves is riotously depicted in this classic favorite. As the pig family head to the beach for a picnic, they encounter every vehicle known, from the forklift to the locomotive, and many vehicles that are not as common, from the pumpkin car to the broom-o-cycle. Each detailed spread provides tremendous opportunity to make up stories and describe situations. Will Officer Flossy catch Dingo? Will Rollo Rabbit catch his runaway steamroller? And with literally hundreds of things to look at, youngsters will spend hours trying to find Goldbug on every page. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A hilarious gift and perfect stocking stuffer, the third installment of the &lt;i&gt;T-Rex Trying&lt;/i&gt; series features simple, charming, and hilarious illustrations depicting the hapless T-Rex and family doing their best in a world made for creatures with smaller heads and longer arms.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last six years, the lovable, hilarious T-Rex family--T-Rex himself, his partner She-Rex, and their adorable child, Wee-Rex--have charmed readers and dinosaur lovers throughout the nation. With a sweetly funny tone and truly adorable illustrations, the new collection will include all-new material, featuring T-Rex and family in situations like these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to hail a cab...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to shear a flock of sheep...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to grab the toys at the bottom of his pool...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to put a comforter inside a duvet cover...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to play the bagpipes...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to cut down a tree with a two-person saw...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to feed a horse through an electric fence...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;T-Rex trying to plug in a lamp behind the bed...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book will leave you applauding (like T-Rex can't) and wiping tears from your eyes (like T-Rex wishes he could), but most of all, it will leave you wondering how on earth this animal survived a day, let alone the entire Cretaceous Period.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Ann Rule, “America’s best true-crime writer” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;), her unforgettable classic account of the horrifying murders in the Pacific Northwest and her shock when she discovered her friend—Ted Bundy—was not only a suspect but also one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting in 1971 at a Seattle crisis clinic, Ann Rule and Ted Bundy developed a friendship and correspondence that would span the rest of his life. Rule had no idea that when they went their separate ways, their paths would cross again under shocking circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Stranger Beside Me &lt;/i&gt;is Rule’s compelling firsthand account of not just her relationship with Bundy, but also his life—from his complicated childhood to the media circus of his trials. Astonishing in its intimacy and with Rule’s clear-eyed prose, you can’t help but share in her growing horror at discovering that her friend was one of the most notorious American serial killers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unforgettable and haunting work of research, journalism, and personal memories, &lt;i&gt;The Stranger Beside Me &lt;/i&gt;is “as dramatic and chilling as a bedroom window shattering at midnight” (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was interesting, but I'd look for something different if I wanted to actually learn about Ted Bundy and his killings. This was a pretty personal account without many details. The author did the narration herself, and I had a hard time listening to her. Interesting, but not a big recomme...]]>

  <description>6 hours, 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A debut psychological thriller about a young woman who finds her sister brutally murdered, and the shocking incident in their past that may hold the key to finding the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nora takes the train from London to visit her sister in the countryside, she expects to find her waiting at the station or at home cooking dinner. But when she walks into Rachel's familiar house, what she finds is entirely different: her sister has been the victim of a brutal murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stunned and adrift, Nora can't return to her former life. An unsolved assault in the past has shaken her faith in the police, and she can't trust them to find her sister's killer. Haunted by the murder and the secrets she unravels, she is under the harrow--distressed and in danger. As Nora's fear turns to obsession, she becomes as unrecognizable as the sister her investigation uncovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A riveting psychological thriller and a haunting exploration of the fierce love between two sisters, the distortions of grief, and the terrifying power of the past, Under the Harrow marks the debut of an extraordinary new writer.</description>

  <description>A new thrilling suspense novel from #1 international bestselling author Sara Blaedel, author of THE FORGOTTEN GIRLSOne of the best I've come across. -Michael ConnellySara Blaedel is a force to be reckoned with. She's a remarkable crime writer who time and again delivers a solid, engaging story that any reader in the world can enjoy. -Karin SlaughterOne can count on emotional engagement, spine-tingling suspense, and taut storytelling from Sara Blaedel.-Sandra BrownAlready widowed by the age of forty, Ilka Nichols Jensen, a school portrait photographer, leads a modest, regimented, and uneventful life in Copenhagen. Until unexpected news rocks her quiet existence: Her father--who walked out suddenly and inexplicably on the family more than three decades ago--has died. And he's left her something in his will: his funeral home. In Racine, Wisconsin.Clinging to this last shred of communication from the father she hasn't heard from since childhood, Ilka makes an uncharacteristically rash decision and jumps on a plane to Wisconsin. Desperate for a connection to the parent she never really knew, she plans to visit the funeral home and go through her father's things--hoping for some insight into his new life in America--before preparing the business for a quick sale.But when she stumbles on an unsolved murder, and a killer who seems to still be very much alive, the undertaker's daughter realizes she might be in over her head . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This vividly rendered novel reads like HBO’s &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; . . . if it were set in the Ottoman Empire. Ambitious in scope and intimate in execution, the story’s atmospheric setting is rife with political intrigue, with a deftly plotted narrative driven by fiercely passionate characters. Fans of Victoria Aveyard’s THE RED QUEEN, Kristin Cashore’s GRACELING, and Sabaa Tahir’s AN EMBER IN THE ASHES won’t want to miss this visceral, immersive, and mesmerizing novel, the first in a trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO ONE EXPECTS A PRINCESS TO BE BRUTAL. And Lada Dragwlya likes it that way. Ever since she and her gentle younger brother, Radu, were wrenched from their homeland of Wallachia and abandoned by their father to be raised in the Ottoman courts, Lada has known that being ruthless is the key to survival. She and Radu are doomed to act as pawns in a vicious game, an unseen sword hovering over their every move. For the lineage that makes them special also makes them targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lada despises the Ottomans and bides her time, planning her vengeance for the day when she can return to Wallachia and claim her birthright. Radu longs only for a place where he feels safe. And when they meet Mehmed, the defiant and lonely son of the sultan, who’s expected to rule a nation, Radu feels that he’s made a true friend—and Lada wonders if she’s finally found someone worthy of her passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mehmed is heir to the very empire that Lada has sworn to fight against—and that Radu now considers home. Together, Lada, Radu, and Mehmed form a toxic triangle that strains the bonds of love and loyalty to the breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kiersten White comes the first book in a dark, sweeping new series in which heads will roll, bodies will be impaled . . . and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s come back to solve the mystery of her father’s death and confront her own dark past.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Detective Rebecca North left her rural hometown, she vowed never to return. Her father’s apparent suicide has changed that. The official report is that retired cop Noah North shot himself, knocked over a lantern, and set his isolated cabin ablaze. But Rebecca cannot believe he killed himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove it, she needs the help of Ash Haugen, the man she left behind. But Rebecca and Ash share more than broken hearts. Something darker lies between them, and the investigation is stirring it back to life. Clues lead them to the home of Olivia West and her deeply troubled twelve-year-old daughter, Tori. The child knows more about the murder than anyone can imagine, but she’s too terrified to say a word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a cold-blooded killer resurfaces from the past, Rebecca and Ash begin to fear that their own secrets may be even harder to survive.</description>

  <description>13 hours, 59 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years ago, Sarah Baker was abducted by the Watt Lake Killer and sexually assaulted for months before managing to escape. The killer was caught, but Sarah lost everything: her marriage, her child, and the life she loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling with PTSD, Sarah changes her name to Olivia West and finds sanctuary working on Broken Bar Ranch. But as her scars finally begin to heal, a cop involved with her horrific case remains convinced the Watt Lake Killer is still out there. He sets a lure for the murderer, and a fresh body is discovered. Now Olivia must face the impossible—could the butcher be back, this time to finish the job?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a frigid winter isolates the ranch, only one person can help Olivia: Cole McDonough, a writer, adventurer, and ranch heir who stirs long-dormant feelings in her. But this time, Olivia’s determination to shut out her past may destroy more than her chance at love. It could cost her her life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was my first read of Loreth Anne White, and I am definitely a new fan of hers! A Dark Lure really had about four different story lines to it, but she writes in such a way that it wasn't confusing at all. Yes, I figured out a lot of the twists pretty early, but the writing really captured me....]]>

  <description>The powerful and riveting new audiobook in the multimillion-selling "Killing" series by Bill O Reilly and Martin Dugard &lt;br /&gt;Autumn 1944. World War II is nearly over in Europe but is escalating in the Pacific, where American soldiers face an opponent who will go to any length to avoid defeat. The Japanese army follows the samurai code of Bushido, stipulating that surrender is a form of dishonor. "Killing the Rising Sun" takes readers to the bloody tropical-island battlefields of Peleliu and Iwo Jima and to the embattled Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur has made a triumphant return and is plotting a full-scale invasion of Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the globe in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are preparing to test the deadliest weapon known to mankind. In Washington, DC, FDR dies in office and Harry Truman ascends to the presidency, only to face the most important political decision in history: whether to use that weapon. And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito, who is considered a deity by his subjects, refuses to surrender, despite a massive and mounting death toll. Told in the same page-turning style of "Killing Lincoln," "Killing Kennedy," "Killing Jesus," "Killing Patton," and "Killing Reagan," this epic saga details the final moments of World War II like never before."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length: 12 hours and 15 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big-hearted romantic comedy in which First Son Alex falls in love with Prince Henry of Wales after an incident of international proportions forces them to pretend to be best friends...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz is the closest thing to a prince this side of the Atlantic. With his intrepid sister and the Veep’s genius granddaughter, they’re the White House Trio, a beautiful millennial marketing strategy for his mother, President Ellen Claremont. International socialite duties do have downsides—namely, when photos of a confrontation with his longtime nemesis Prince Henry at a royal wedding leak to the tabloids and threaten American/British relations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan for damage control: staging a fake friendship between the First Son and the Prince. Alex is busy enough handling his mother’s bloodthirsty opponents and his own political ambitions without an uptight royal slowing him down. But beneath Henry’s Prince Charming veneer, there’s a soft-hearted eccentric with a dry sense of humor and more than one ghost haunting him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As President Claremont kicks off her reelection bid, Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret relationship with Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations. And Henry throws everything into question for Alex, an impulsive, charming guy who thought he knew everything: What is worth the sacrifice? How do you do all the good you can do? And, most importantly, how will history remember you?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;President Reagan's dramatic battle to win the Cold War is revealed as never before by the #1 bestselling author and award-winning anchor of the #1 rated &lt;em&gt;Special Report with Bret Baier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An instant classic, if not the finest book to date on Ronald Reagan.” — Jay Winik&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moscow, 1988: 1,000 miles behind the Iron Curtain, Ronald Reagan stood for freedom and confronted the Soviet empire.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his acclaimed bestseller &lt;em&gt;Three Days in January&lt;/em&gt;, Bret Baier illuminated the extraordinary leadership of President Dwight Eisenhower at the dawn of the Cold War. Now in his highly anticipated new history, &lt;em&gt;Three Days in Moscow&lt;/em&gt;, Baier explores the dramatic endgame of America’s long struggle with the Soviet Union and President Ronald Reagan’s central role in shaping the world we live in today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 31, 1988, Reagan stood on Russian soil and addressed a packed audience at Moscow State University, delivering a remarkable—yet now largely forgotten—speech that capped his first visit to the Soviet capital. This fourth in a series of summits between Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, was a dramatic coda to their tireless efforts to reduce the nuclear threat. More than that, Reagan viewed it as “a grand historical moment”: an opportunity to light a path for the Soviet people—toward freedom, human rights, and a future he told them they could embrace if they chose. It was the first time an American president had given an address about human rights on Russian soil. Reagan had once called the Soviet Union an “evil empire.” Now, saying that depiction was from “another time,” he beckoned the Soviets to join him in a new vision of the future. The importance of Reagan’s Moscow speech was largely overlooked at the time, but the new world he spoke of was fast approaching; the following year, in November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, leaving the United States the sole superpower on the world stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, the end of the Cold War is perhaps the defining historical moment of the past half century, and must be understood if we are to make sense of America’s current place in the world, amid the re-emergence of US-Russian tensions during Vladimir Putin’s tenure. Using Reagan’s three days in Moscow to tell the larger story of the president’s critical and often misunderstood role in orchestrating a successful, peaceful ending to the Cold War, Baier illuminates the character of one of our nation’s most venerated leaders—and reveals the unique qualities that allowed him to succeed in forming an alliance for peace with the Soviet Union, when his predecessors had fallen short.</description>

  <description>After 103 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and with four million copies of The Kite Runner shipped, Khaled Hosseini returns with a beautiful, riveting, and haunting novel that confirms his place as one of the most important literary writers today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propelled by the same superb instinct for storytelling that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them—in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul—they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a woman's love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love, that is often the key to survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stunning accomplishment, A Thousand Splendid Suns is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love.&lt;br /&gt;--khaledhosseini.com</description>

  <description>A vicious assault. A devastating accusation. Who should she trust, her husband or her best friend?&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be the perfect reunion: six university friends together again after twenty years. Host Ali finally has the life she always wanted, a career she can be proud of and a wonderful family with her college boyfriend, now husband. But that night her best friend makes an accusation so shocking that nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Karen staggers in from the garden, bleeding and traumatised, she claims that she has been assaulted—by Ali’s husband, Mike. Ali must make a split-second decision: who should she believe? Her horrified husband, or her best friend? With Mike offering a very different version of events, Ali knows one of them is lying—but which? And why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ensuing chaos forces her to re-examine the golden era the group shared at university, Ali realises there are darker memories too. Memories that have lain dormant for decades. Memories someone would kill to protect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;12 hours and 6 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, 2017 Indie Reader Discovery Awards, Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in Africa, I kissed a king...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"And just like that, in an old red barn at the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, I discovered the elusive magic I had only ever glimpsed between the pages of great love stories. It fluttered around me like a newborn butterfly and settled in a corner of my heart. I held my breath, afraid to exhale for fear it would slip out, never to be found again.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a bomb explodes in a mall in East Africa, its aftershocks send two strangers on a collision course that neither one sees coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Warden, a divorced coffee farmer in Tanzania, loses his only daughter. An ocean away, in the English countryside, Rodel Emerson loses her only sibling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two ordinary people, bound by a tragic afternoon, set out to achieve the extraordinary, as they make three stops to rescue three children across the vast plains of the Serengeti—children who are worth more dead than alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even if they beat the odds, another challenge looms at the end of the line. Can they survive yet another loss—this time of a love that’s bound to slip through their fingers, like the mists that dissipate in the light of the sun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Sometimes you come across a rainbow story—one that spans your heart. You might not be able to grasp it or hold on to it, but you can never be sorry for the color and magic it brought.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blend of romance and women’s fiction, &lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Mists of The Serengeti &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is inspired by true events and contains emotional triggers, including the death of a child. Not recommended for sensitive readers. Standalone, contemporary fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2017 Leylah Attar (P)2017 Leylah Attar</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Harvard sociologist and MacArthur "Genius" Matthew Desmond, a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this brilliant,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;heartbreaking book, Matthew Desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge. Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, “Love don’t pay the bills.” She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced  into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America’s vast inequality—and to people’s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the first time ever, the beloved songs from &lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; are collected here in a charmingly-illustrated treasury, sure to be cherished by adults who grew up with Mister Rogers, and a new generation of children alike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mister Rogers' Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; had a revolutionary impact on children's television, and on millions of children themselves. Through songs, puppets, and frank conversations, Mister Rogers instilled the values of kindness, patience, and self-esteem in his viewers, and most of all, taught children how loved they were, just by being themselves. &lt;i&gt;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; reimagines the songs from the show as poetry, ranging from the iconic ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?") to the forgotten gems. The poem are funny, sweet, silly, and sincere, dealing with topics of difficult feelings, new siblings, everyday routines, imagination, and more. Perfect for bedtime, sing-along, or quiet time, this book of nostalgic and meaningful poetry is the perfect gift for every child--including the child in all of us.</description>

  <description>Very First Questions and Answers is a new series to sit below First Questions and Answers, aimed at preschool children and with more of a picture book approach. What is Poop? is the first title in the series that introduces young children to bodily functions, taking the "shame" away through a very funny flap book!</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Italy, 1943—Germany occupies much of the country, placing the Jewish population in grave danger during World War II.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As children, Eva Rosselli and Angelo Bianco were raised like family but divided by circumstance and religion. As the years go by, the two find themselves falling in love. But the church calls to Angelo and, despite his deep feelings for Eva, he chooses the priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, more than a decade later, Angelo is a Catholic priest and Eva is a woman with nowhere to turn. With the Gestapo closing in, Angelo hides Eva within the walls of a convent, where Eva discovers she is just one of many Jews being sheltered by the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Eva can’t quietly hide, waiting for deliverance, while Angelo risks everything to keep her safe. With the world at war and so many in need, Angelo and Eva face trial after trial, choice after agonizing choice, until fate and fortune finally collide, leaving them with the most difficult decision of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Hilarious best friends Cat and Nat created a massive online community of moms by sharing their ultra-real and just a bit R-rated dispatches from the mom trenches. From what not to eat a few days after giving birth (chicken wings) to the most effective ways to dodge post-partum sex, &lt;i&gt;Cat &amp;amp; Nat's Mom Truths&lt;/i&gt; shares everything no one will tell you about having kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing memoir, humor, and advice, Cat and Nat tell never-before-told stories about the stress, guilt, joy, and laundry (oh the laundry!) of being a mom in their first book. With seven kids between them and millions of fans on social media, they get real about the parts of parenting that somehow don't make the Instagram feed. Sharing their outrageous humor, fearless myth-busting, and genuine comfort on every page, they walk you from pregnancy to the toddler years and beyond. And they dole out ridiculously honest advice, like what you think you need at the hospital when you have your first baby (lip gloss) versus what you actually need (hemorrhoid pillow), and how worried you should really be about germs (less than you are). Fearless crusaders against the perfection myth and all the gluten-free, sugar-free baking it entails, Cat and Nat assure you that you're already doing a great job, making this an essential companion for moms everywhere.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beep! Beep! Beep!&lt;/i&gt; Meet Blue. A muddy country road is no match for this little pick up--that is, until he gets stuck while pushing a dump truck out of the muck. Luckily, Blue has made a pack of farm animal friends along his route. And they're willing to whatever it takes to get their pal back on the road. &lt;br /&gt;Filled with truck sounds and animals noises, here is a rollicking homage to the power of friendship and the rewards of helping others.</description>

  <description>Shake, shake, shudder, near the sludgy old swamp. The dinosaurs are coming. Get ready to romp. Join in with Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and friends as the dinosaurs stir up a Dinosaurumpus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where can you find a Deinosuchus that practically pirouettes on its tail and a T-Rex that bounds gracefully through the air? Between the pages of Tony Mitton's Dinosaurumpus, where dinosaurs run, boom, shake, and shudder their way to the "sludgy old swamp" and rock the night away.

  <description>The 26 characters in this rhythmic, rhyming baby book are a lowercase alphabet with attitude. "A told b, and b told c, 'I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree'"--which probably seemed like a good idea until the other 23 members of the gang decided to follow suit. The palm tree standing straight and tall on the first page begins to groan and bend under its alphabetical burden. First the coconuts fall off, then ("Chicka chicka... BOOM! BOOM!") all the letters also end up in a big heap underneath.</description>

  <description>A twisty, compelling novel about one woman's complicated relationship with her mother-in-law that ends in murder...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment Lucy met her husband's mother, Diana, she was kept at arm's length. Diana was exquisitely polite, and properly friendly, but Lucy knew that she was not what Diana envisioned. But who could fault Diana? She was a pillar of the community, an advocate for social justice who helped female refugees assimilate to their new country. Diana was happily married to Tom, and lived in wedded bliss for decades. Lucy wanted so much to please her new mother-in-law. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Diana has been found dead, a suicide note near her body. Diana claims that she no longer wanted to live because of a battle with cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the autopsy finds no cancer.&lt;br /&gt;The autopsy does find traces of poison and suffocation. &lt;br /&gt;Who could possibly want Diana dead? &lt;br /&gt;Why was her will changed at the eleventh hour to disinherit both of her adult children and their spouses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Lucy's secrets getting deeper and her relationship with her mother-in-law growing more complex as the pages turn, this new novel from Sally Hepworth is sure to add to her growing legion of fans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A missing child sets the lives of three women on a collision course in this powerful and compelling novel by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Bette Lee Crosby.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1971.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a music festival rolls through the sleepy town of Hesterville, Georgia, the Dixon family’s lives are forever changed. On the final night, a storm muffles the sound of the blaring music, and Rachel tucks her baby into bed before falling into a deep sleep. So deep, she doesn’t hear the kitchen door opening. When she and her husband wake up in the morning, the crib is empty. Emily is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicki Robart is one of the thousands at the festival, but she’s not feeling the music. She’s feeling the emptiness over the loss of her own baby several months before. When she leaves the festival and is faced with an opportunity to fill that void, she is driven to an act of desperation that will forever bind the lives of three women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the truth of what actually happened that fateful night is finally exposed, shattering the lives they’ve built, will they be able to pick up the pieces to put their families back together again?</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5/5 stars. I absolutely adored this book and cannot wait to read more of Bette Lee Crosby's works. The book follows multiple characters - a baby who is taken in the middle of the night, her birth family, and what transpires to the baby and her kidnapper after. It is honestly hard to write more...]]>

  <description>13 hours, 42 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In 1942, Europe remains in the relentless grip of war. Just beyond the tents of the Russian refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It's a decision that will alter her destiny...and it's a lie that will remain buried until the next century.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now fifteen and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina's tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate. Then, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents' farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative that weaves together two women's stories into a tapestry of perseverance, loyalty, love and honor. &lt;i&gt;The Things We Cannot Say&lt;/i&gt; is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced...and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A searing poetic memoir and call to action from the bestselling and award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt;, Laurie Halse Anderson!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Laurie Halse Anderson is known for the unflinching way she writes about, and advocates for, survivors of sexual assault. Now, inspired by her fans and enraged by how little in our culture has changed since her groundbreaking novel &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt; was first published twenty years ago, she has written a poetry memoir that is as vulnerable as it is rallying, as timely as it is timeless. In free verse, Anderson shares reflections, rants, and calls to action woven between deeply personal stories from her life that she's never written about before. Searing and soul-searching, this important memoir is a denouncement of our society's failures and a love letter to all the people with the courage to say #metoo and #timesup, whether aloud, online, or only in their own hearts. &lt;i&gt;Shout&lt;/i&gt; speaks truth to power in a loud, clear voice-- and once you hear it, it is impossible to ignore.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From award-winning &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;staff writer Patrick Radden Keefe, a stunning, intricate narrative about a notorious killing in Northern Ireland and its devastating repercussions&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In December, 1972, Jean McConville, a 37-year-old mother of ten, was dragged from her Belfast home by masked intruders, her children clinging to her legs. They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as "The Troubles." Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was her when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress - with so many kids, she always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.&lt;br /&gt; Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, who were scattered to orphanages, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists - or volunteers, depending on which side one was on - such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as "The Dark," to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace and denied his I.R.A. past, betraying his hardcore comrades - &lt;i&gt;Say Nothing&lt;/i&gt; conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.</description>

  <description>A deadly past refuses to stay buried in Olivia Kiernan’s masterful new novel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death is no stranger to Detective Chief Superintendent Frankie Sheehan, but she isn’t the only one from her small, coastal suburb to be intimately acquainted with it. Years ago, teenager Seán Hennessey shocked the tight-knit community when he was convicted of the brutal murder of his parents and attempted slaying of his sister, though he always maintained his innocence. Now, Seán is finally being released from prison—but when his newfound freedom coincides with the discovery of two bodies, the alleged connection between the cases only serves to pull Frankie further from answers even as it draws her closer to her town’s hidden darkness. With a television documentary revisiting Seán’s sentence pushing the public’s sympathies into conflict on a weekly basis, a rabid media pressuring the police like never before, and a rising body count, Frankie will need all of her resources if she is not only to catch a killer, but put to rest what really happened all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dark, irresistible cocktail of secrets, murder, and family, Olivia Kiernan’s latest is an impossible-to-put-down triumph.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Olivia Kiernan's tautly written debut novel immerses readers in a chilling murder case . . . and the tantalizing, enigmatic victim at the center of it all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quiet Dublin suburb, within her pristine home, Eleanor Costello is found hanging from a rope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Chief Superintendent Frankie Sheehan would be more than happy to declare it a suicide. Four months earlier, Frankie's pursuit of a killer almost ended her life and she isn't keen on investigating another homicide. But the autopsy reveals poorly healed bones and old stab wounds, absent from medical records. A new cut is carefully, deliberately covered in paint. Eleanor's husband, Peter, is unreachable, missing. A search of the couple's home reveals only two signs of personality: a much-loved book on art and a laptop with access to the Dark Web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the suspect pool growing, the carefully crafted profile of the victim crumbling with each new lead, and mysterious calls to Frankie's phone implying that the killer is closer than anyone would like, all Frankie knows is that Eleanor guarded her secrets as closely in life as she does in death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation grows more challenging, Frankie can't help but feel that something doesn't fit. And when another woman is found murdered, the same paint on her corpse, Frankie knows that unraveling Eleanor's life is the only way to find the murderer before he claims another victim . . . or finishes the fate Frankie only just managed to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engrossing, complex, and atmospheric, Olivia Kiernan's debut novel will leave readers breathless.</description>

  <description>Lina is just like any other fifteen-year-old Lithuanian girl in 1941. She paints, she draws, she gets crushes on boys. Until one night when Soviet officers barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they've known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin's orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lina finds solace in her art, meticulously--and at great risk--documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father's prison camp to let him know they are still alive. It is a long and harrowing journey, spanning years and covering 6,500 miles, but it is through incredible strength, love, and hope that Lina ultimately survives. &lt;i&gt;Between Shades of Gray&lt;/i&gt; is a novel that will steal your breath and capture your heart.</description>

  <description>From one of America's most inspiring political leaders, a book about the core truths that unite us, and the long struggle to discern what those truths are and how best to act upon them, in her own life and across the life of our country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senator Kamala Harris's commitment to speaking truth is informed by her upbringing. The daughter of immigrants, she was raised in an Oakland, California community that cared deeply about social justice; her parents--an esteemed economist from Jamaica and an admired cancer researcher from India--met as activists in the civil rights movement when they were graduate students at Berkeley. Growing up, Harris herself never hid her passion for justice, and when she became a prosecutor out of law school, a deputy district attorney, she quickly established herself as one of the most innovative change agents in American law enforcement. She progressed rapidly to become the elected District Attorney for San Francisco, and then the chief law enforcement officer of the state of California as a whole. Known for bringing a voice to the voiceless, she took on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis, winning a historic settlement for California's working families. Her hallmarks were applying a holistic, data-driven approach to many of California's thorniest issues, always eschewing stale "tough on crime" rhetoric as presenting a series of false choices. Neither "tough" nor "soft" but &lt;i&gt;smart&lt;/i&gt; on crime became her mantra. Being smart means learning the truths that can make us better as a community, and supporting those truths with all our might. That has been the pole star that guided Harris to a transformational career as the top law enforcement official in California, and it is guiding her now as a transformational United States Senator, grappling with an array of complex issues that affect her state, our country, and the world, from health care and the new economy to immigration, national security, the opioid crisis, and accelerating inequality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reckoning with the big challenges we face together, drawing on the hard-won wisdom and insight from her own career and the work of those who have most inspired her, Kamala Harris offers in THE TRUTHS WE HOLD a master class in problem solving, in crisis management, and leadership in challenging times. Through the arc of her own life, on into the great work of our day, she communicates a vision of shared struggle, shared purpose, and shared values. In a book rich in many home truths, not least is that a relatively small number of people work very hard to convince a great many of us that we have less in common than we actually do, but it falls to us to look past them and get on with the good work of living our common truth. When we do, our shared effort will continue to sustain us and this great nation, now and in the years to come.</description>

  <description>After excelling in her career as a photographer at a fashion magazine, Sophie is granted a new assignment: a photojournalism piece highlighting Small-Town Christmases. Being a city girl, she isn’t sure what to expect when she arrives in the mountain town of Stowe, Vermont. Everything about Stowe is perfect. From the tree in the town center, to the quaint Bed and Breakfast where she is staying. Even the inn’s charming handyman, Nick, is handsome and more than helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie couldn’t be happier with her project. But then, after a small misfortune, Sophie and Nick uncover a precious item from the past that leads them on a mission to discover the not so perfect truth about Stowe.</description>

  <description>Over the last 25 years, Liz Banner’s life has grown stagnant. Not that she hasn’t loved being a stay-at-home wife and mother, but she didn’t mean to lose herself in the process. And after surviving the most challenging time in her life, Liz realizes that life is too short, and second chances don’t come around very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a milestone birthday approaching, Liz is determined to live a little. And when her best friend, Anne, gifts her a ticket for a 10-day luxury cruise, Liz decides it’s the perfect excuse to experience new things, and just take some time to relax with some of her favorite women. But her idea of a relaxing vacation gets thrown overboard when a few surprise guests make an appearance and attempt to win their way back into Liz’s heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a second chance at life…and love, turning 50 never felt better.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this breakout book, Ijeoma Oluo explores the complex reality of today's racial landscape--from white privilege and police brutality to systemic discrimination and the Black Lives Matter movement--offering straightforward clarity that readers need to contribute to the dismantling of the racial divide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race,&lt;/i&gt; Editor at Large of The Establishment Ijeoma Oluo offers a contemporary, accessible take on the racial landscape in America, addressing head-on such issues as privilege, police brutality, intersectionality, micro-aggressions, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the "N" word. Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions readers don't dare ask, and explains the concepts that continue to elude everyday Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oluo is an exceptional writer with a rare ability to be straightforward, funny, and effective in her coverage of sensitive, hyper-charged issues in America. Her messages are passionate but finely tuned, and crystalize ideas that would otherwise be vague by empowering them with aha-moment clarity. Her writing brings to mind voices like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roxane Gay, and Jessica Valenti in &lt;i&gt;Full Frontal Feminism,&lt;/i&gt; and a young Gloria Naylor, particularly in Naylor's seminal essay "The Meaning of a Word."</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>A man receives the best Christmas present he could ask for: the chance to re-write the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Chercher is not doing well in love or life. Just two weeks after his wife leaves him he receives a phone call that his estranged mother has passed away, days before Christmas—leaving her home and all her belongings to him. Frankly, he would like to see everything just burned. But curiosity about his past and anxiety about his future fuels him to make the drive from Salt Lake City to her home in Medford, Oregon. Maybe cleaning out her house will be slightly less depressing than spending the holidays, alone, watching re-runs of Christmas classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While going through her things he comes upon her diary and the record of his childhood. He learns that his mother suffered from severe depression and during that difficult time he was taken care of by a young, unwed mother who was living with his family. The only clue he has to the woman’s identity is her name: Noel, which is an eerily fitting discovery on Christmas Eve. As Jason reads the diary he begins to uncover the source of his pain in relationships and understand that what he believed to be the truth of his past was actually a lie. That’s when he begins a journey to find Noel, wondering if she might hold the truth he needs to bring him peace and love.</description>

While not the worst narrator, I'm wondering if I would've liked the book better if I read it or there had been another narrator.

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>"Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a story of unforgettable perception, beautifully written and illustrated by the gifted and versatile Shel Silverstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Ellie Mack was the perfect daughter. She was beloved by her parents, friends, and teachers. She and her boyfriend made a teenage golden couple. She was days away from an idyllic summer vacation, with her whole life ahead of her. And then she was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now her mother, Laurel Mack, is trying to put her life back together. It's been 10 years since her daughter disappeared, seven years since her marriage ended, and only months since the last clue in Ellie's case was unearthed. So when she meets an unexpectedly charming man in a cafe, she is surprised at how quickly their flirtation develops into something deeper. Before she knows it, she's meeting Floyd's daughters - and his youngest, Poppy, takes her breath away. Looking at her is like looking at Ellie. And now the unanswered questions she has tried so hard to put to rest haunt her anew...as well as some new ones about Floyd and Poppy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2018 Lisa Jewell (P)2018 Dreamscape Media, LLC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 10 hrs and 12 mins</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The runaway bestseller &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/i&gt; introduced the world to the real-life heroine Caroline Ferriday. Now, a generation earlier, this sweeping new novel featuring Caroline's mother, Eliza, follows three equally indomitable women from St. Petersburg to Paris under the shadow of World War I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1914 and the world has been on the brink of war so many times, many New Yorkers treat the subject with only passing interest. Eliza Ferriday is thrilled to be traveling to St. Petersburg with Sofya Streshnayva, a cousin of the Romanovs. The two met years ago one summer in Paris and became close confidantes. Now Eliza embarks on the trip of a lifetime, home with Sofya to see the splendors of Russia: the church with the interior covered in jeweled mosaics, the Rembrandts at the Tsar's Winter Palace, the famous ballet. But when Austria declares war on Serbia and Russia's Imperial dynasty begins to fall, Eliza escapes back to America, while Sofya and her family flee to their estate outside the city. In need of domestic help, they hire the local fortuneteller's daughter, Varinka, unknowingly bringing intense danger into their home. On the other side of the Atlantic, Eliza is doing her part to help the White Russian families find safety as they escape the revolution. But when Sofya's letters suddenly stop coming she fears the worst for her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg and aristocratic estates of the countryside to the avenues of Paris and the society of fallen Russian émigrés there to the mansions of Long Island, the lives of Eliza, Sofya, and Varinka will intersect in profound ways, taking readers on a breathtaking ride through a momentous time in history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 19 hrs 3 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African-American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed &lt;i&gt;Carpool Karaoke&lt;/i&gt;, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, &lt;i&gt;Becoming&lt;/i&gt; is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>Why are guidebooks for employee engagement so useless?&lt;br /&gt;Too many are filled with empty theories, fabricated frameworks and lots and lots (and lots) of useless fluff. What if you could get the advice you need from a real expert in an easy to access format you can really use? The Non-Obvious Guide To Employee Engagement (For Millennials, Boomers And Everyone Else) is the guidebook you’ve been Googling for. &lt;br /&gt;Within these pages you’ll get the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about how inspire your team and transform your workplace culture. Do you really need ping pong tables? Why do so any employees struggle to be inspired at work and what can you do to help? What are the lessons you can learn (and steal) from the highest performing teams in the world? How can you improve collaboration between workers from different generations? Are the idea of millennial entitlement a reality or a myth? &lt;br /&gt;These are just a few of the common questions that you will get answers to in this book. Inspired by years of research and advising businesses of all sizes, well known corporate culture experts Maddie Grant and Jamie Notter have written a rare guide that is at least as useful as a great YouTube video or an epic blog post … and the only way you can get this useful advice in one place.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He calls me into his office and closes the door . . . to promote me. He promotes me again and again. I am wild with ecstasy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Imagine a world where erotica was written by feminists: Their daydreams include equal pay, a gender-balanced Congress, and Tom Hardy arriving at their doorstep to deliver a fresh case of LaCroix every week.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Both light-hearted and empowering, &lt;i&gt;New Erotica for Feminists&lt;/i&gt; is a sly, satirical take on all the things that turn feminists on. From a retelling of Adam and Eve to tales of respectful Tinder dates,&lt;i&gt; New Erotica for Feminists &lt;/i&gt;answers the question of “What do women &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want?” with stories of power, equality, and an immortal Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Five women revolutionize the modern art world in postwar America in this "gratifying, generous, and lush" true story from a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize finalist (Jennifer Szalai, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set amid the most turbulent social and political period of modern times, &lt;i&gt;Ninth Street Women&lt;/i&gt; is the impassioned, wild, sometimes tragic, always exhilarating chronicle of five women who dared to enter the male-dominated world of twentieth-century abstract painting--not as muses but as artists. From their cold-water lofts, where they worked, drank, fought, and loved, these pioneers burst open the door to the art world for themselves and countless others to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gutsy and indomitable, Lee Krasner was a hell-raising leader among artists long before she became part of the modern art world's first celebrity couple by marrying Jackson Pollock. Elaine de Kooning, whose brilliant mind and peerless charm made her the emotional center of the New York School, used her work and words to build a bridge between the avant-garde and a public that scorned abstract art as a hoax. &lt;br /&gt;Grace Hartigan fearlessly abandoned life as a New Jersey housewife and mother to achieve stardom as one of the boldest painters of her generation. Joan Mitchell, whose notoriously tough exterior shielded a vulnerable artist within, escaped a privileged but emotionally damaging Chicago childhood to translate her fierce vision into magnificent canvases. And Helen Frankenthaler, the beautiful daughter of a prominent New York family, chose the difficult path of the creative life. Her gamble paid off: At twenty-three she created a work so original it launched a new school of painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These women changed American art and society, tearing up the prevailing social code and replacing it with a doctrine of liberation. In &lt;i&gt;Ninth Street Women, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Mary Gabriel tells a remarkable and inspiring story of the power of art and artists in shaping not just postwar America but the future.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The autobiography of global human rights icon Nelson Mandela is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;"riveting...both a brilliant description of a diabolical system and a testament to the power of the spirit to transcend it" (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's antiapartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is his moving and exhilarating autobiography, destined to take its place among the finest memoirs of history's greatest figures. Here for the first time, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela tells the extraordinary story of his life--an epic of struggle, setback, renewed hope, and ultimate triumph. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The book that inspired the major new motion picture &lt;i&gt;Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Three ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't. &lt;br /&gt;(jacket flap)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>A poetic and powerful memoir about what it means to be a Black woman in America—and the co-founding of a movement that demands justice for all in the land of the free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised by a single mother in an impoverished neighborhood in Los Angeles, Patrisse Khan-Cullors experienced firsthand the prejudice and persecution Black Americans endure at the hands of law enforcement. For Patrisse, the most vulnerable people in the country are Black people. Deliberately and ruthlessly targeted by a criminal justice system serving a white privilege agenda, Black people are subjected to unjustifiable racial profiling and police brutality. In 2013, when Trayvon Martin’s killer went free, Patrisse’s outrage led her to co-found Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condemned as terrorists and as a threat to America, these loving women founded a hashtag that birthed the movement to demand accountability from the authorities who continually turn a blind eye to the injustices inflicted upon people of Black and Brown skin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Championing human rights in the face of violent racism, Patrisse is a survivor. She transformed her personal pain into political power, giving voice to a people suffering in equality and a movement fueled by her strength and love to tell the country—and the world—that Black Lives Matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When They Call You a Terrorist is Patrisse Khan-Cullors and asha bandele’s reflection on humanity. It is an empowering account of survival, strength and resilience and a call to action to change the culture that declares innocent Black life expendable.</description>

  <description>Length: 7 hrs and 38 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She went missing. He moved on. A whole world of secrets remained—until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They're driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla's sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there's something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla's past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen's house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn's trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, &lt;i&gt;Bring Me Back&lt;/i&gt; will have listeners questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.&lt;br /&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is the second book I've read by B.A. Paris, and I think she's just not the author to me. It's not that the story lines aren't good - I was kept guessing the entire time as to what happened to Layla. But both Bring Me Back and The Breakdown had one major plot element I really struggle with -...]]>

  <description>11 hours, 9 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author David Baldacci introduces a remarkable new character: Atlee Pine, an FBI special agent assigned to the remote wilds of the western United States. Ever since her twin sister was abducted by a notorious serial killer at age five, Atlee has spent her life hunting down those who hurt others. And she’s the best at it. She could be one of the Bureau’s top criminal profilers, if she didn’t prefer catching criminals in the vast wilderness of the West to climbing the career ladder in the D.C. office. Her chosen mission is a lonesome one–but that suits her just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Atlee is called in to investigate the mutilated carcass of a mule found in the Grand Canyon–and hopefully, solve the disappearance of its rider. But this isn’t the only recent disappearance. In fact, it may be just the first clue, the key to unraveling a rash of other similar missing persons cases in the canyon. . .</description>

      <![CDATA[I've listened to many of Baldacci's books and this new series has to be one of my favorites! To start, the narration is amazing. In addition to that, I love the female protagonist. Atlee's backstory has a lot more to give for the future of this series. ]]>

  <description>Alternate Cover Edition ISBN: 006267708X (ISBN13: 9780062677082)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, Angie Thomas’s searing debut about an ordinary girl in extraordinary circumstances addresses issues of racism and police violence with intelligence, heart, and unflinching honesty. Soon to be a major motion picture from Fox 2000/Temple Hill Productions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave. But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking…and what she’s hiding. As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>Mitch Albom creates his most unforgettable fictional character—Frankie Presto, the greatest guitarist to ever walk the earth—in this magical novel about the bands we join in life and the power of talent to change our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his most stunning novel yet, the voice of Music narrates the tale of its most beloved disciple, young Frankie Presto, a war orphan raised by a blind music teacher in a small Spanish town. At nine years old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a boat. His only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Frankie’s talent is touched by the gods, and his amazing journey weaves him through the musical landscape of the 20th century, from classical to jazz to rock and roll, with his stunning talent affecting numerous stars along the way, including Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Wynton Marsalis and even KISS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie becomes a pop star himself. He makes records. He is adored. But his gift is also his burden, as he realizes, through his music, he can actually affect people’s futures—with one string turning blue whenever a life is altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the height of his popularity, Frankie Presto vanishes. His legend grows. Only decades later, does he reappear—just before his spectacular death—to change one last life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its &lt;em&gt;Forest Gump&lt;/em&gt;-like romp through the music world, &lt;em&gt;The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto&lt;/em&gt; is a classic in the making. A lifelong musician himself, Mitch Albom delivers a remarkable novel, infused with the message that “everyone joins a band in this life” and those connections change us all.</description>

  <description>From the author of the phenomenal #1 New York Times bestseller Tuesdays with Morrie, a novel that explores the unexpected connections of our lives, and the idea that heaven is more than a place; it's an answer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination. It's a place where your life is explained to you by five people, some of whom you knew, others who may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"</description>

  <description>Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It-girl Betty White delivers a hilarious, slyly profound take on love, life, celebrity, and everything in between. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Drawing from a lifetime of lessons learned, seven-time Emmy winner Betty White's wit and wisdom take center stage as she tackles topics like friendship, romantic love, aging, television, fans, love for animals, and the brave new world of celebrity. &lt;i&gt;If You Ask Me&lt;/i&gt; mixes her thoughtful observations with humorous stories from a seven- decade career in Hollywood. Longtime fans and new fans alike will relish Betty's candid take on everything from her rumored crush on Robert Redford (true) to her beauty regimen (I have no idea what color my hair is and I never intend to find out") to the Facebook campaign that helped persuade her to host &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt; despite her having declined the hosting job three times already. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Featuring all-new material, with a focus on the past fifteen years of her life, &lt;i&gt;If You Ask Me&lt;/i&gt; is funny, sweet, and to the point-just like Betty White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"</description>

  <description>Your mom always said you were an angel. What if she was right? Jonah Stone has always thought of himself as average, but in seventh grade he learns a fascinating family secret, and his world turns upside down. Jonah’s mom is a nephilim, the daughter of a human and a fallen angel, which makes Jonah one-quarter angel. When his mom is kidnapped by fallen angels, it’s up to Jonah and his sister Eliza to rescue her. Guided by prayer and a guardian angel, Jonah and Eliza embark on an epic adventure through the streets of New York and come to understand that God plans in ways they never could have imagined. &lt;i&gt;Spirit Fighter&lt;/i&gt;, Book 1 in the Son of Angels: Jonah Stone series, is an imaginative adventure that is based on scripture in the book of Genesis.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green--cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow--spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--everywhere from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity, and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring from the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.</description>

  <description>9 Hours and 56 Minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Furies (which was another term for Erinyes, the Greek goddesses of vengeance and retribution) is appropriately all about female anger as it pertains to politics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketplace describes the upcoming work as "an examination of women's anger as both politically problematic and catalytic: from Shirley Chisholm's 1972 campaign to Anita Hill's 1991 testimony to Hillary Clinton's loss."</description>

  <description>A tanker steaming through the deep Northwest Providence Channel of the Bahamas comes across a shocking sight: a lone dinghy carrying Captain Julian Harvey and the body of a young girl. They are all that remain of the ketch &lt;i&gt;Bluebelle&lt;/i&gt;, a handsome sixty-foot sailing yacht chartered by the Duperrault family of Green Bay, Wisconsin. But their happy family vacation went terribly wrong when, according to Harvey, a violent and unexpected squall smashed the giant main mast, killed Harvey's wife and the others, and sank the boat. Harvey found the child floating dead and, as far as he knows, he is the only survivor. &lt;i&gt;Or is he?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Four days later, just as Captain Harvey is testifying at a Coast Guard hearing about the tragic accident, amazing news of another survivor arrives. Eleven-year-old Terry Jo Duperrault has been found barely alive on a flimsy cork-and-canvas float with no food or water. Harvey takes the news calmly, finishes his testimony, and leaves...to commit bloody suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the chillingly detailed inside story of what really happened during that trip and the decades-long courage of the sole survivor of a murderous crime.</description>

  <description>Who are the immensely wealthy right-wing ideologues shaping the fate of America today? From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Dark Side&lt;/i&gt;, an electrifying work of investigative journalism that uncovers the agenda of this powerful group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her new preface, Jane Mayer discusses the results of the most recent election and Donald Trump's victory, and how, despite much discussion to the contrary, this was a huge victory for the billionaires who have been pouring money in the American political system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is America living in an age of profound and widening economic inequality? Why have even modest attempts to address climate change been defeated again and again? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers? In a riveting and indelible feat of reporting, Jane Mayer illuminates the history of an elite cadre of plutocrats—headed by the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Olins, and the Bradleys—who have bankrolled a systematic plan to fundamentally alter the American political system. Mayer traces a byzantine trail of billions of dollars spent by the network, revealing a staggering conglomeration of think tanks, academic institutions, media groups, courthouses, and government allies that have fallen under their sphere of influence. Drawing from hundreds of exclusive interviews, as well as extensive scrutiny of public records, private papers, and court proceedings, Mayer provides vivid portraits of the secretive figures behind the new American oligarchy and a searing look at the carefully concealed agendas steering the nation. &lt;i&gt;Dark Money&lt;/i&gt; is an essential book for anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A CBS TV SERIES STARRING ALAN CUMMING -- PREMIERING MARCH 2018&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Previously published as&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
      &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Murder Games&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Dr. Dylan Reinhart wrote the book on criminal behavior. Literally--he's a renowned, bestselling Ivy League expert on the subject. When a copy of his book turns up at a gruesome murder scene--along with a threatening message from the killer--it looks like someone has been taking notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Needham is the headstrong and brilliant NYPD Detective in charge of the case who recruits Dylan to help investigate another souvenir left at the scene--a playing card. Another murder, another card--and now Dylan suspects that the cards aren't a signature, they're a deadly hint--pointing directly toward the next victim. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tabloid headlines about the killer known as "The Dealer" scream from newstands, New York City descends into panic. With the cops at a loss, it's up to Dylan to hunt down a serial killer unlike any the city has ever seen. Only someone with Dylan's expertise can hope to go inside the mind of a criminal and convince The Dealer to lay down his cards. But after thinking like a criminal--could Dylan become one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-pounding novel of suspense more shocking than any tabloid true crime story, &lt;i&gt;Instinct &lt;/i&gt;introduces the next unforgettable character from the imagination of James Patterson, the world's #1 bestselling author. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever? In Liane Moriarty’s latest page-turner, nine perfect strangers are about to find out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer – or should she run while she still can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a messed up book, but I freaking loved it. I'm also a huge Liane Moriarty fan. I don't even want to share too much of this book to prevent spoilers!<br /><br />Essentially, nine people book themselves to spend some time a health resort. Detox - mentally, physically and from their devices....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;*Named a Best Book of 2018 by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly, &lt;/i&gt;NPR, &lt;i&gt;Broadly&lt;/i&gt;, Buzzfeed (Nonfiction), The Undefeated, &lt;i&gt;Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;(Biography/Memoirs), &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;(Nonfiction), &lt;i&gt;Southern Living &lt;/i&gt;(Southern), &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Critics&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this powerful, provocative, and universally lauded memoir—winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal and finalist for the Kirkus Prize—genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon “provocatively meditates on his trauma growing up as a black man, and in turn crafts an essential polemic against American moral rot” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt;, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to time in New York as a college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. &lt;i&gt;Heavy&lt;/i&gt; is a “gorgeous, gutting…generous” (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) memoir that combines personal stories with piercing intellect to reflect both on the strife of American society and on Laymon’s experiences with abuse. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, he asks us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A book for people who appreciated Roxane Gay’s memoir &lt;i&gt;Hunger&lt;/i&gt;” (&lt;i&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Heavy &lt;/i&gt;is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family through years of haunting implosions and long reverberations. “You won’t be able to put [this memoir] down…It is packed with reminders of how black dreams get skewed and deferred, yet are also pregnant with the possibility that a kind of redemption may lie in intimate grappling with black realities” (&lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

      <![CDATA[Kiese Laymon is raw and real and brings about topics I have no experience in. His book was hard to listen to at times, but I appreciate his willingness to be real. Being black in America has so many layers, and Kiese tries to unroll them throughout this book. Good read.]]>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story... until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>After everything that the citizens of Beartown have gone through, they are struck yet another blow when they hear that their beloved local hockey team will soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in Hed, take in that fact. Amidst the mounting tension between the two rivals, a surprising newcomer is handpicked to be Beartown’s new hockey coach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon a new team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you’ll ever see; Benji, the intense lone wolf; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. But bringing this team together proves to be a challenge as old bonds are broken, new ones are formed, and the enmity with Hed grows more and more acute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the big match approaches, the not-so-innocent pranks and incidents between the communities pile up and their mutual contempt grows deeper. By the time the last game is finally played, a resident of Beartown will be dead, and the people of both towns will be forced to wonder if, after all they’ve been through, the game they love can ever return to something simple and innocent.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>As good a rifle company as any, Easy Company, 506th Airborne Division, US Army, kept getting tough assignments--responsible for everything from parachuting into France early DDay morning to the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. In "Band of Brothers," Ambrose tells of the men in this brave unit who fought, went hungry, froze &amp;amp; died, a company that took 150% casualties &amp;amp; considered the Purple Heart a badge of office. Drawing on hours of interviews with survivors as well as the soldiers' journals &amp;amp; letters, Stephen Ambrose recounts the stories, often in the men's own words, of these American heroes.&lt;br /&gt;Foreword&lt;br /&gt;"We wanted those wings"; Camp Toccoa, 7-12/42&lt;br /&gt;"Stand up &amp;amp; hook up"; Benning, Mackall, Bragg, Shanks, 12/42-9/43&lt;br /&gt;"Duties of the latrine orderly"; Aldbourne, 9/43-3/44&lt;br /&gt;"Look out, Hitler!

      <![CDATA[This was an incredible story and I loved the series on it. Because it’s military history and I don’t have that experience, I think I had a hard time following some of the book. I also couldn’t keep a lot of the characters straight. If you’re big into history, I’d definitely recommend it. ]]>

  <description>For fans of All the Light We Cannot See, Beneath a Scarlet Sky, and The Nightingale comes an emotionally gripping, beautifully written historical novel about extraordinary hope, redemption, and one man’s search for light during the darkest times of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany, 1942. Franciscan friar Anton Starzmann is stripped of his place in the world when his school is seized by the Nazis. He relocates to a small German hamlet to wed Elisabeth Herter, a widow who seeks a marriage—in name only—to a man who can help raise her three children. Anton seeks something too—atonement for failing to protect his young students from the wrath of the Nazis. But neither he nor Elisabeth expects their lives to be shaken once again by the inescapable rumble of war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Anton struggles to adapt to the roles of husband and father, he learns of the Red Orchestra, an underground network of resisters plotting to assassinate Hitler. Despite Elisabeth’s reservations, Anton joins this army of shadows. But when the SS discovers his schemes, Anton will embark on a final act of defiance that may cost him his life—even if it means saying goodbye to the family he has come to love more than he ever believed possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A former international hostage negotiator for the FBI offers a new, field-tested approach to high-stakes negotiations—whether in the boardroom or at home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a hostage negotiator brought him face-to-face with a range of criminals, including bank robbers and terrorists. Reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator. &lt;i&gt;Never Split the Difference&lt;/i&gt; takes you inside the world of high-stakes negotiations and into Voss’s head, revealing the skills that helped him and his colleagues to succeed where it mattered most: saving lives. In this practical guide, he shares the nine effective principles—counter-intuitive tactics and strategies—you too can use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is a series of negotiations you should be prepared for: buying a car; negotiating a salary; buying a home; renegotiating rent; deliberating with your partner. Taking emotional intelligence and intuition to the next level, &lt;i&gt;Never Split the Difference&lt;/i&gt; gives you the competitive edge in any discussion.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Want to make a move but scared to leave your comfort zone? &lt;i&gt;Go anyway.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Jessica's perspective of global sisterhood and the power of lifting each other up in the midst of fear and scarcity is exactly what we need today. This book is both an invitation and a challenge to bravely show up for ourselves, for the people we love, and for the strangers that we will one day call family. I say, Amen!"&lt;br /&gt; --Bren� Brown, Ph.D., Author of the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Braving the Wilderness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Imperfect Courage, &lt;/i&gt;the founder of the popular fair trade jewelry brand Noonday Collection shares her story of starting the rapid-growing business that impacts over 4,500 artisans in vulnerable communities across the globe--and invites readers on a journey of transformation, challenging them to trade their comfort zones for a life of impact and adventure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;In 2015, &lt;i&gt;Inc.&lt;/i&gt; magazine recognized Noonday Collection as one of the fastest-growing companies in America. But years earlier, as Jessica Honegger stood at a pawn-shop counter in Austin, Texas, and handed over her grandmother's gold jewelry, her goal was much more personal: to fund the adoption of her Rwandan son, Jack, by selling artisan-made jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first step launched an unexpected side-hustle that would grow into Noonday Collection. Jessica embarked on this new journey and teamed up with her first artisan partner, Jalia, a Ugandan jewelry maker. She saw the meaningful impact Noonday brought to Jalia's community and knew it was the right move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fear crept into Jessica's heart as she realized her success, or failure, meant the same for Jalia. But refusing to let fear hinder her goals, Jessica found the necessary (if imperfect) courage she needed along the way--the courage to leave comfort and embrace a life of risk and impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover Your &lt;i&gt;Imperfect Courage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In&lt;i&gt; Imperfect Courage&lt;/i&gt;, Jessica takes you by the hand and invites you to trade your comfort zone for a life of impact and meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - First, she invites you to draw a circle of compassion around yourself and leads you through some soul-searching aimed at setting you free from shame. &lt;br /&gt; - Next, she challenges all of us to come together, dare to be vulnerable with one another, and commit to building a culture of collaboration. &lt;br /&gt; - Finally, Jessica calls on you to broaden your circle of compassion to embrace the entire globe--and to bring your beautifully imperfect courage to a world that needs you.</description>

  <description>Jamie Glowacki—potty-training expert, Pied Piper of Poop, and author of the popular guide, &lt;i&gt;Oh Crap! Potty Training&lt;/i&gt;—shares her proven 6-step plan to help you toilet train your preschooler quickly and successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let Jamie Glowacki, potty-training expert and the popular "Pied Piper of Poop" show you how it's done. Her 6-step, proven process to get your toddler out of diapers and onto the toilet has already worked for tens of thousands of kids and their parents. Here's the good news: your child is probably ready to be potty trained EARLIER than you think (ideally, between 20-30 months), and it can be done FASTER than you expect (most kids get the basics in a few days—but Jamie's got you covered even if it takes a little longer). If you've ever said to yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** How do I know if my kid is ready?&lt;br /&gt; ** Why won't my child poop in the potty?&lt;br /&gt; ** How do I avoid "potty power struggles"?&lt;br /&gt; ** How can I get their daycare provider on board?&lt;br /&gt; ** My kid was doing so well—why is he regressing?&lt;br /&gt; ** And what about nighttime?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh Crap! Potty Training&lt;/i&gt; can solve all of these (and other) common issues. This isn't theory, you're not bribing with candy, and there are no gimmicks. This is real-world, from-the-trenches potty training information—all the questions and all the ANSWERS you need to do it once and be done with diapers for good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Based on the true story of a forgotten hero, &lt;i&gt;Beneath a Scarlet Sky&lt;/i&gt; is the triumphant, epic tale of one young man’s incredible courage and resilience during one of history’s darkest hours.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pino Lella wants nothing to do with the war or the Nazis. He’s a normal Italian teenager—obsessed with music, food, and girls—but his days of innocence are numbered. When his family home in Milan is destroyed by Allied bombs, Pino joins an underground railroad helping Jews escape over the Alps, and falls for Anna, a beautiful widow six years his senior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to protect him, Pino’s parents force him to enlist as a German soldier—a move they think will keep him out of combat. But after Pino is injured, he is recruited at the tender age of eighteen to become the personal driver for Adolf Hitler’s left hand in Italy, General Hans Leyers, one of the Third Reich’s most mysterious and powerful commanders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command, Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in secret, his courage bolstered by his love for Anna and for the life he dreams they will one day share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Unbroken&lt;/i&gt; will enjoy this riveting saga of history, suspense, and love.</description>

  <description>Jack Mullen is a driven student of the law. His brother Peter is a servant of the rich, parking the cars of the Hamptons' elite --- and perhaps satisfying their more intimate needs as well. Then Peter's body is found on the beach. Jack knows the drowning was no accident, but someone's unlimited power and money have bought the cops, the judges, the system. Now Jack is learning a lesson in justice he never got in law school ... and his astonishing plan to beat the billionaires will have you reeling --- and cheering --- to the very last page.</description>

  <description>One woman's remarkable odyssey from tragedy to prison to recovery - and recognition as a leading figure in the national justice reform movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Burton's world changed in an instant when her five-year-old son was killed by a van driving down their street. Consumed by grief and without access to professional help, Susan self-medicated, becoming addicted first to cocaine then to crack. As a resident of South Los Angeles, a black community under siege in the War on Drugs, it was but a matter of time before Susan was arrested. She cycled in and out of prison for over 15 years; never was she offered therapy or treatment for addiction. On her own, she eventually found a private drug rehabilitation facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once clean, Susan dedicated her life to supporting women facing similar struggles. Her organization, A New Way of Life, operates five safe homes in Los Angeles that supply a lifeline to hundreds of formerly incarcerated women and their children - setting them on the track to education and employment rather than returning to prison. Becoming Ms. Burton not only humanizes the deleterious impact of mass incarceration, it also points the way to the kind of structural and policy changes that will offer formerly incarcerated people the possibility of lives of meaning and dignity.</description>

  <description>Anthony Ray Hinton was poor and black when he was convicted of two murders he hadn't committed. For the next three decades he was trapped in solitary confinement in a tiny cell on death row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually his case was taken up by the award-winning lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, who managed to have him exonerated, though it took 15 years for this to happen. How did Hinton cope with the mental and emotional torture of his situation, and emerge full of compassion and forgiveness? This is a story of hope and the resilience of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>" I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers." "January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb.... &lt;br /&gt;As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends--and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society--born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island--boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. &lt;br /&gt;Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. &lt;br /&gt;Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways. "From the Hardcover edition.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The incredible true story of a boy living in war-torn Somalia who escapes to America--first by way of the movies; years later, through a miraculous green card.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdi Nor Iftin first fell in love with America from afar. As a child, he learned English by listening to American pop artists like Michael Jackson and watching films starring action heroes like Arnold Schwarzenegger. When U.S. marines landed in Mogadishu to take on the warlords, Abdi cheered the arrival of these real Americans, who seemed as heroic as those of the movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sporting American clothes and dance moves, he became known around Mogadishu as Abdi American, but when the radical Islamist group al-Shabaab rose to power in 2006, it suddenly became dangerous to celebrate Western culture. Desperate to make a living, Abdi used his language skills to post secret dispatches to NPR and the Internet, which found an audience of worldwide listeners. But as life in Somalia grew more dangerous, Abdi was left with no choice but to flee to Kenya as a refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an amazing stroke of luck, Abdi won entrance to the U.S. in the annual visa lottery, though his route to America--filled with twists and turns and a harrowing sequence of events that nearly stranded him in Nairobi--did not come easily. Parts of his story were first heard on the &lt;i&gt;BBC World Service&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;This American Life. &lt;/i&gt;Now a proud resident of Maine, on the path to citizenship, Abdi Nor Iftin's dramatic, deeply stirring memoir is truly a story for our time: a vivid reminder of why western democracies still beckon to those looking to make a better life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A classic of war reporting...The author’s stories give heart-rending meaning to the lives and deaths of these men and women, even if policymakers generally have not.” —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pulitzer Prize winner C.J. Chivers’s unvarnished account of modern combat, told through the eyes of the fighters who have waged America’s longest wars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 2.7 million Americans have served in Afghanistan or Iraq since September 11, 2001. C.J. Chivers reported from both wars from their beginnings. &lt;i&gt;The Fighters&lt;/i&gt; vividly conveys the physical and emotional experience of war as lived by six combatants: a fighter pilot, a corpsman, a scout helicopter pilot, a grunt, an infantry officer, and a Special Forces sergeant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chivers captures their courage, commitment, sense of purpose, and ultimately their suffering, frustration, and moral confusion as new enemies arise and invasions give way to counterinsurgency duties for which American forces were often not prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fighters&lt;/i&gt; is a tour de force, a portrait of modern warfare that parts from slogans to do for American troops what Stephen Ambrose did for the G.I.s of World War II and Michael Herr for the grunts in Vietnam. Told with the empathy and understanding of an author who is himself an infantry veteran, &lt;i&gt;The Fighters&lt;/i&gt; presents the long arc of two wars.</description>

  <description>From the author of the bestseller "The Disappearing Spoon" comes this tale of the brain and the history of neuroscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early studies of the functions of the human brain used a simple method: wait for misfortune to strike strokes, seizures, infectious diseases, lobotomies, horrendous accidents and see how the victim coped. In many cases survival was miraculous, and observers could only marvel at the transformations that took place afterward, altering victims personalities. An injury to one section can leave a person unable to recognize loved ones; some brain trauma can even make you a pathological gambler, pedophile, or liar. But a few scientists realized that these injuries were an opportunity for studying brain function at its extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lucid explanations and incisive wit, Sam Kean explains the brain s secret passageways while recounting forgotten stories of common people whose struggles, resiliency, and deep humanity made modern neuroscience possible."</description>

  <description>Greta Helsing inherited the family's highly specialized, and highly peculiar, medical practice. In her consulting rooms, Dr. Helsing treats the undead for a host of ills - vocal strain in banshees, arthritis in barrow-wights, and entropy in mummies. Although barely making ends meet, this is just the quiet, supernatural-adjacent life Greta's been groomed for since childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Until a sect of murderous monks emerges, killing human and undead Londoners alike. As terror takes hold of the city, Greta must use her unusual skills to stop the cult if she hopes to save her practice, and her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;11 hrs and 4 mins&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful true story about the potential for mercy to redeem us, and a clarion call to fix our broken system of justice—from one of the most brilliant and influential lawyers of our time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bryan Stevenson was a young lawyer when he founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice dedicated to defending those most desperate and in need: the poor, the wrongly condemned, and women and children trapped in the farthest reaches of our criminal justice system. One of his first cases was that of Walter McMillian, a young man who was sentenced to die for a notorious murder he insisted he didn’t commit. The case drew Bryan into a tangle of conspiracy, political machination, and legal brinksmanship—and transformed his understanding of mercy and justice forever.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Mercy &lt;/i&gt;is at once an unforgettable account of an idealistic, gifted young lawyer’s coming of age, a moving window into the lives of those he has defended, and an inspiring argument for compassion in the pursuit of true justice.</description>

      <![CDATA[I've really enjoyed this series. The writing is superb that it is told from multiple viewpoints seamlessly. There's a lot of great characters, but I really love each of them. Hoping this isn't the end of the Blackthorn clan.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How long can you protect your heart?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life - until the unthinkable happens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>Alvie Knightly is back . . . and she's hungover.&lt;p&gt;When Alvie discovers that her hit man boyfriend has driven off with the Lamborghini and two million euros, she does what any heartbroken, deserted, amateur assassin would do - she drinks everything in the mini-bar and trashes her hotel room. And then she gets to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perilous cat-and-mouse game takes the pair across Rome, leaving a trail of collateral damage in their wake. But as she wholeheartedly embraces her dark side Alvie will have to figure out if Nino is her nemesis . . . or the only man bad enough to handle her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a post-apocalyptic novel that reminds me of a cross between the movie AI and the Divergent series.

  <description>Cyril Avery is not a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Avery or at least that’s what his adoptive parents tell him. And he never will be. But if he isn’t a real Avery, then who is he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born out of wedlock to a teenage girl cast out from her rural Irish community and adopted by a well-to-do if eccentric Dublin couple via the intervention of a hunchbacked Redemptorist nun, Cyril is adrift in the world, anchored only tenuously by his heartfelt friendship with the infinitely more glamourous and dangerous Julian Woodbead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the mercy of fortune and coincidence, he will spend a lifetime coming to know himself and where he came from – and over his three score years and ten, will struggle to discover an identity, a home, a country and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this, Boyne's most transcendent work to date, we are shown the story of Ireland from the 1940s to today through the eyes of one ordinary man. &lt;i&gt;The Heart's Invisible Furies&lt;/i&gt; is a novel to make you laugh and cry while reminding us all of the redemptive power of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;On a bright January morning in the London suburbs, a family moves into the house they’ve just bought in Trinity Avenue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nothing strange about that. Except it is your house. And you didn’t sell it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona Lawson comes home to find strangers moving into her house, she's sure there's been a mistake. She and her estranged husband, Bram, have a modern co-parenting arrangement: bird's nest custody, where each parent spends a few nights a week with their two sons at the prized family home to maintain stability for their children. But the system built to protect their family ends up putting them in terrible jeopardy. In a domino effect of crimes and misdemeanors, the nest comes tumbling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bram has disappeared and so have Fiona's children. As events spiral well beyond her control, Fiona will discover just how many lies her husband was weaving and how little they truly knew each other. But Bram's not the only one with things to hide, and some secrets are best kept to oneself, safe as houses.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Unabridged, 22 CDs, 25 hours&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Read by Richard Poe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;The masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years-a vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his journal, Steinbeck called East of Eden "the first book," and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families-the Trasks and the Hamiltons-whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. Here is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;With wry wit and hard-earned wisdom, popular online personality and founder of TheChicSite.com founder Rachel Hollis helps readers break free from the lies keeping them from the joy-filled and exuberant life they are meant to have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Chic Media, Rachel Hollis has created an online fan base of hundreds of thousands of fans by sharing tips for living a better life while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own. Now comes her highly anticipated first book featuring her signature combination of honesty, humor, and direct, no-nonsense advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;Girl, Wash Your Face&lt;/em&gt; begins with a specific lie Hollis once believed that left her feeling overwhelmed, unworthy, or ready to give up. As a working mother, a former foster parent, and a woman who has dealt with insecurities about her body and relationships, she speaks with the insight and kindness of a BFF, helping women unpack the limiting mind-sets that destroy their self-confidence and keep them from moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her temporary obsession with marrying Matt Damon to a daydream involving hypnotic iguanas to her son’s request that she buy a necklace to “be like the other moms,” Hollis holds nothing back. With unflinching faith and tenacity, Hollis spurs other women to live with passion and hustle and to awaken their slumbering goals.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal, &lt;/i&gt; got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.</description>

  <description>When Sarah meets Eddie, they connect instantly and fall in love. To Sarah, it seems as though her life has finally begun. And it's mutual: It's as though Eddie has been waiting for her, too. Sarah has never been so certain of anything. So when Eddie leaves for a long-booked vacation and promises to call from the airport, she has no cause to doubt him. But he doesn't call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah's friends tell her to forget about him, but she can't. She knows something's happened--there must be an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minutes, days, weeks go by as Sarah becomes increasingly worried. But then she discovers she's right. There is a reason for Eddie's disappearance, and it's the one thing they didn't share with each other: the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A chilling thriller of serial murder and dark secrets that will leave you wondering, is the past really in the past?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Chicago women have been found strangled, embalmed, and posed as if still alive. Doubting the findings of the local PD’s profiler, The FBI calls on forensic psychologist Zoe Bentley to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe quickly gets off on the wrong foot with her new partner, Special Agent Tatum Gray. Zoe’s a hunter, intense and focused; Tatum’s a smug maverick with little respect for the rules. Together, they must descend into a serial killer’s psyche and untangle his twisted fantasies, or more women will die. But when the contents of three inconspicuous envelopes reveal a chilling connection to gruesome murders from Zoe’s childhood, suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Reading Georgia Hunter s &lt;i&gt;We Were the Lucky Ones&lt;/i&gt; is like being swung heart first into history. . . . A brave and mesmerizing debut, and a truly tremendous accomplishment. Paula McLain, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Paris Wife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An extraordinary, propulsive novel based on the true story of a family of Polish Jews who are separated at the start of the Second World War, determined to survive and to reunite &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer. The talk around the family Seder table is of new babies and budding romance, not of the increasing hardships threatening Jews in their hometown of Radom, Poland. But soon the horrors overtaking Europe will become inescapable and the Kurcs will be flung to the far corners of the world, each desperately trying to navigate his or her own path to safety. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As one sibling is forced into exile, another attempts to flee the continent, while others struggle to escape certain death, either by working grueling hours on empty stomachs in the factories of the ghetto or by hiding as gentiles in plain sight. Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A novel of breathtaking sweep and scope that spans five continents and six years and transports readers from the jazz clubs of Paris to Krakow s most brutal prison to the ports of Northern Africa and the farthest reaches of the Siberian gulag, &lt;i&gt;We Were the Lucky Ones &lt;/i&gt;demonstrates how in the face of the twentieth century's darkest moment, the human spirit can find a way to survive, and even triumph.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dramatic story of the Flint water crisis--an inspiring tale of scientific resistance by a relentless physician who stood up to power.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flint was already a troubled city in 2014 when the state of Michigan--in the name of austerity--shifted the source of its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River. Soon after, citizens began complaining about the water that flowed from their taps--but officials rebuffed them, insisting that the water was fine. Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician at the city's public hospital, took state officials at their word and encouraged the parents and children in her care to continue drinking the water--after all, it was American tap water, blessed with the state's seal of approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a conversation at a cookout with an old friend, leaked documents from a rogue environmental inspector, and the activism of a concerned mother raised red flags about lead--a neurotoxin whose irreversible effects fall most heavily on children. Even as circumstantial evidence mounted and protests grew, Dr. Mona knew that the only thing that could stop the lead poisoning was undeniable &lt;i&gt;proof--&lt;/i&gt; and that to get it, she'd have to enter the fight of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What the Eyes Don't See&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring story of how Dr. Mona--accompanied by an idiosyncratic team of researchers, parents, friends, and community leaders--proved that Flint's kids were exposed to lead and then fought her own government and a brutal backlash to expose that truth to the world. Paced like a scientific thriller, this book shows how misguided austerity policies, the withdrawal of democratic government, and callous bureaucratic indifference placed an entire city at risk. And at the center of the story is Dr. Mona herself--an immigrant, doctor, scientist, and mother whose family's activist roots inspired her pursuit of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What the Eyes Don't See&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting, beautifully rendered account of a shameful disaster that became a tale of hope, the story of a city on the ropes that came together to fight for justice, self-determination, and the right to build a better world for their--and all of our--children.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The incredible true story of a boy living in war-torn Somalia who escapes to America--first by way of the movies; years later, through a miraculous green card.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdi Nor Iftin first fell in love with America from afar. As a child, he learned English by listening to American pop artists like Michael Jackson and watching films starring action heroes like Arnold Schwarzenegger. When U.S. marines landed in Mogadishu to take on the warlords, Abdi cheered the arrival of these real Americans, who seemed as heroic as those of the movies. &lt;br /&gt;Sporting American clothes and dance moves, he became known around Mogadishu as Abdi American, but when the radical Islamist group al-Shabaab rose to power in 2006, it suddenly became dangerous to celebrate Western culture. Desperate to make a living, Abdi used his language skills to post secret dispatches to NPR and the Internet, which found an audience of worldwide listeners. But as life in Somalia grew more dangerous, Abdi was left with no choice but to flee to Kenya as a refugee.&lt;br /&gt;In an amazing stroke of luck, Abdi won entrance to the U.S. in the annual visa lottery, though his route to America--filled with twists and turns and a harrowing sequence of events that nearly stranded him in Nairobi--did not come easily. Parts of his story were first heard on the &lt;i&gt;BBC World Service&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;This American Life. &lt;/i&gt;Now a proud resident of Maine, on the path to citizenship, Abdi Nor Iftin's dramatic, deeply stirring memoir is truly a story for our time: a vivid reminder of why western democracies still beckon to those looking to make a better life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How do you hold on to hope &lt;br /&gt; when you don't get the ending &lt;br /&gt; you asked for?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Katie Davis Majors moved to Uganda, accidentally founded a booming organization, and later became the mother of thirteen girls through the miracle of adoption, she determined to weave her life together with the people she desired to serve. But joy often gave way to sorrow as she invested her heart fully in walking alongside people in the grip of poverty, addiction, desperation, and disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After unexpected tragedy shook her family, for the first time Katie began to wonder, &lt;i&gt;Is God really good? Does He really love us? &lt;/i&gt;When she turned to Him with her questions, God spoke truth to her heart and drew her even deeper into relationship with Him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daring to Hope&lt;/i&gt; is an invitation to cling to the God of the impossible--the God who whispers His love to us in the quiet, in the mundane, when our prayers are not answered the way we want or the miracle doesn't come. It's about a mother discovering the extraordinary strength it takes to be ordinary. It's about choosing faith no matter the circumstance and about encountering God's goodness in the least expected places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though your heartaches and dreams may take a different shape, you will find your own questions echoed in these pages. You'll be reminded of the gifts of joy in the midst of sorrow. And you'll hear God's whisper: &lt;i&gt; Hold on to hope. I will meet you here.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The practical, relatable, and humorous guide to surviving the difficult, awkward, and rewarding job of being a breastfeeding, working mom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                        &lt;br /&gt; Meet the frenemy of every working, breastfeeding mother: the breast pump. Many women are beyond “breast is best” and on to figuring out how to make milk while returning to demanding jobs. &lt;i&gt;Work. Pump. Repeat.&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to give women what they need to know beyond the noise of the “Mommy Wars” and judgment on breastfeeding choices. Jessica Shortall shares the nitty-gritty basics of surviving the working world as a breastfeeding mom, offering a road map for negotiating the pumping schedule with colleagues, navigating business travel, and problem-solving when forced to pump in less-than-desirable locales. Drawing on the war stories, hacks, and humor of working moms, and on her own stories from her demanding job and travel in developing countries, she gives women moral support for dealing with the stress and guilt that come with juggling working and breastfeeding. As she tells the reader in her witty, inspiring manifesto, “Your worth as a mother is not measured in ounces.”&lt;br /&gt;                                &lt;br /&gt; 2015 Axiom Business Book Award Winner (Silver) in the category of Women/Minorities</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A razor-sharp, exquisitely paced, madly fun debut thriller that gleefully lampoons Hollywood culture and introduces the highly eccentric yet brilliant ex-detective gone rogue: Charlie Waldo.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are run-of-the-mill eccentric Californians, and then there's former detective Charlie Waldo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waldo, a onetime LAPD superstar, now lives in solitude deep in the woods, pathologically committed to owning no more than one hundred possessions. He has left behind his career and his girlfriend, Lorena, to pay self-imposed penance for an awful misstep on an old murder case. But the old ghosts are about to come roaring back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of difficult actors in Hollywood, and then there's Alastair Pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alastair is a onetime Royal Shakespeare Company thespian who now slums it as the "wise" Southern judge on a tacky network show. He's absurdly rich, often belligerent, and typically drunk--a damning combination when Alastair's wife is found dead on their living room floor and he can't remember what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waldo's old flame Lorena, hiding peril of her own, draws him toward the case, and Alastair's greedy network convinces Waldo to take it on. But after such a long time away from both civilization and sleuthing--and plagued by a confounding array of assailants who want him gone--Waldo must navigate complicated webs of ego and deceit to clear Alastair's name . . . or confirm his guilt.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two-time Edgar Award-winning author Lori Roy spins a twisted, atmospheric tale about a small Southern town where girls disappear and boys run away.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lane Fielding fled her isolated Florida hometown after high school for the anonymity of New York City, she swore she'd never return. But twenty years later, newly divorced and with two daughters in tow, she finds herself tending bar at the local dive and living with her parents on the historic Fielding Plantation. Here, the past haunts her and the sinister crimes of her father--the former director of an infamous boys' school--make her as unwelcome in town as she was the day she left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ostracized by the people she was taught to trust, Lane's unsteady truce with the town is rattled when her older daughter suddenly vanishes. Ten days earlier, a college student went missing, and the two disappearances at first ignite fears that a serial killer who once preyed upon the town has returned. But when Lane's younger daughter admits to having made a new and unseemly friend, a desperate Lane attacks her hometown's façade to discover whether her daughter's disappearance is payback for her father's crimes--or for her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With reporters descending upon the town, police combing through the swamp, and events taking increasingly disturbing turns, Lane fears she faces too many enemies and too little time to bring her daughter safely home. Powerful and heart-pounding, &lt;i&gt;The Disappearing&lt;/i&gt; questions the endurance of family bonds, the dangers of dark rumors and small town gossip, and how sometimes home is the scariest place of all.</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this compulsively readable debut, set between London and Sicily over one blood-drenched week in the dead of summer, an identical twin reveals the crazy lies and twists she'll go through to not only steal her sister's perfect life, but to keep on living it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alvie Knightly is a trainwreck: aimless, haphazard, and pretty much constantly drunk. Alvie's existence is made even more futile in contrast to that of her identical and perfect twin sister, Beth. Alvie lives on social media, eats kebabs for breakfast, and gets stopped at security when the sex toy in her carry-on starts buzzing. Beth is married to a hot, rich Italian, dotes on her beautiful baby boy, and has always been their mother's favorite. The twins' days of having anything in common besides their looks are long gone. &lt;br /&gt;When Beth sends Alvie a first-class plane ticket to visit her in Italy, Alvie is reluctant to go. But when she gets fired from the job she hates and her flatmates kick her out on the streets, a luxury villa in glitzy Taormina suddenly sounds more appealing. Beth asks Alvie to swap places with her for just a few hours so she can go out unnoticed by her husband. Alvie jumps at the chance to take over her sister's life--if only temporarily. But when the night ends with Beth dead at the bottom of the pool, Alvie realizes that this is her chance to change her life. &lt;br /&gt;Alvie quickly discovers that living Beth's life is harder than she thought. What was her sister hiding from her husband? And why did Beth invite her to Italy at all? As Alvie digs deeper, she uncovers Mafia connections, secret lovers, attractive hitmen, and one extremely corrupt priest, all of whom are starting to catch on to her charade. Now Alvie has to rely on all the skills that made her unemployable--a turned-to-11 sex drive, a love of guns, lying to her mother--if she wants to keep her million-dollar prize. She is uncensored, unhinged, and unforgettable."</description>

Beth convinces Alvina to visit her and switch places for a night and craziness ensues. Sex, drugs, mafia, murder. <br /><br />Alvina as...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It takes more than a lie to hide the dark secrets of this picture-perfect family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the granddaughter of one of Florida’s most powerful judges disappears, it triggers a personal trauma for Detective Alice Garner: the kidnapping and murder of her own child. As a flood of painful memories comes rushing back, Alice sees herself in the guilt-ridden and emotionally fragile mother Charlotte Burke, who has become the target of a rush to judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All too familiar with Charlotte’s situation, Alice is reluctant to cast any blame. Her gut instincts tell her that Charlotte’s anguish is rooted in something else—somewhere too dark for the truth to be seen. And Alice believes that it’s hiding behind the facade of the illustrious and guarded Burke mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But uncovering Charlotte’s past comes with a risk. For Alice’s own life is becoming entangled in the secrets and lies of the picture-perfect family—an image that is about to be shattered in so many unexpected ways.</description>

  <description>A human drama unlike any other—the riveting and definitive full story of the worst sea disaster in United States naval history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after midnight on July 30, 1945, days after delivering the components of the atomic bomb from California to the Pacific Islands in the most highly classified naval mission of the war, USS &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis &lt;/i&gt;is sailing alone in the center of the Philippine Sea when she is struck by two Japanese torpedoes. The ship is instantly transformed into a fiery cauldron and sinks within minutes. Some 300 men go down with the ship. Nearly 900 make it into the water alive. For the next five nights and four days, almost three hundred miles from the nearest land, the men battle injuries, sharks, dehydration, insanity, and eventually each other. Only 316 will survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the better part of a century, the story of USS &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis &lt;/i&gt;has been understood as a sinking tale. The reality, however, is far more complicated—and compelling. Now, for the first time, thanks to a decade of original research and interviews with 107 survivors and eyewit­nesses, Lynn Vincent and Sara Vladic tell the complete story of the ship, her crew, and their final mission to save one of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It begins in 1932, when &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis &lt;/i&gt;is christened and launched as the ship of state for President Franklin Roosevelt. After Pearl Harbor, &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis &lt;/i&gt;leads the charge to the Pacific Islands, notching an unbroken string of victories in an uncharted theater of war. Then, under orders from President Harry Truman, the ship takes aboard a superspy and embarks on her final world-changing mission: delivering the core of the atomic bomb to the Pacific for the strike on Hiroshima. Vincent and Vladic provide a visceral, moment-by-moment account of the disaster that unfolds days later after the Japanese torpedo attack, from the chaos on board the sinking ship to the first moments of shock as the crew plunge into the remote waters of the Philippine Sea, to the long days and nights during which terror and hunger morph into delusion and desperation, and the men must band together to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then, for the first time, the authors go beyond the men’s rescue to chronicle &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/i&gt;’s extraordinary final mission: the survivors’ fifty-year fight for justice on behalf of their skipper, Captain Charles McVay III, who is wrongly court-martialed for the sinking. What follows is a captivating courtroom drama that weaves through generations of American presidents, from Harry Truman to George W. Bush, and forever entwines the lives of three captains—McVay, whose life and career are never the same after the scandal; Mochitsura Hashimoto, the Japanese sub commander who sinks &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis &lt;/i&gt;but later joins the battle to exonerate McVay; and William Toti, the captain of the modern-day submarine &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/i&gt;, who helps the survivors fight to vindicate their captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A sweeping saga of survival, sacrifice, justice, and love, &lt;i&gt;Indianapolis &lt;/i&gt;stands as both groundbreaking naval history and spellbinding narrative—and brings the ship and her heroic crew back to full, vivid, unforgettable life. It is the definitive account of one of the most remarkable episodes in American history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the premiere &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Washington correspondent, a stunning and incisive look into how cyberwarfare is influencing elections, threatening national security, and bringing us to the brink of global war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the Russian cyberattacks that may have thrown the 2016 election; behind the Sony hack; behind mysterious power outages around the world and the disappearance of thousands of personnel records from poorly guarded government servers are the traces of a new and powerful weapon, one that has the potential to remake global conflict like nothing since the invention of the atomic bomb. &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Weapon&lt;/i&gt; is the riveting story of how, in less than a decade, cyberwarfare displaced terrorism and nuclear attacks as the greatest threat to American national security. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cheap to acquire, difficult to defend against, and designed to shield their user's identities so as to complicate retaliation, these weapons are capable of an unprecedented range of offensive tactics; they can take us just short of war, allowing for everything from disruption to theft to the cause of widespread damage of essential infrastructure systems. And the vulnerability of those systems has created a related but equally urgent conflict: American companies like Apple and Cisco must claim allegiance to no government in the name of selling secure products around the globe yet the US intelligence agencies want the help of such companies in defending against future cyberattacks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reported and written with unprecedented access by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; chief Washington correspondent and bestselling author David Sanger, &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Weapon&lt;/i&gt; takes readers inside war rooms and boardrooms, into the secret cyberdens of American and Chinese military, to give the deep-background story of the increasingly pitched battle between nations, their governments, their cyberwarriors, and their corporations.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Could psychedelic drugs change our worldview? One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. &lt;i&gt;How to Change Your Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a report from what could very well be the future of human consciousness.</description>

  <description>ABBY AND CONOR EACH THOUGHT LOVE WOULD NEVER AGAIN STIR THEIR HEARTS. BUT THE ONE WHO KNOWS THEM BEST MAY HAVE OTHER PLANS ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abigail Stanton's whole life was rooted in her faith, a faith she now clings to solely to survive. In the wake of losing her husband and young son, Abby sets out alone, bereft and heartsick, to discover what God wants her to do. When he leads her to Conor MacKay's doorstep, though, the very foundation of her beliefs starts to shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the volatile rancher's new housekeeper, Abby is supposed to keep his affairs --- and his equally capricious little girl --- in order. Why, then, does she feel confusion, passion, desire, and anything but order every time they are together? Conor tries to hide his own seething emotions beneath a cold facade, but there is something about his prim new housekeeper that sets him on edge. And the more ruthlessly he attacks Abby's faith, the more his defenses crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Abby and Conor draw closer to the flame of their attraction, they must grapple with their deepest beliefs and fears. In opening their hearts again, both risk even greater loss for a chance at the greatest love of all.</description>

  <description>Those closest to us are often the most dangerous…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s every parent’s worst nightmare: the call that comes in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kat Jenkins awakens to the police on her doorstep, her greatest fear is realized. Her nine-year-old son, Ethan, is missing—vanished from the cabin where he’d been on an overnight field trip with his class. Shocked and distraught, Kat rushes to the campground where he was last seen. But she’s too late; the authorities have returned from their search empty-handed after losing Ethan’s trail in the mountain forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another mother from the school, Stef Huntington, seems like she has it all: money, prominence in the community, a popular son and a loving husband. She hardly knows Kat, except for the vicious gossip that swirls around Kat’s traumatic past. But as the police investigation unfolds, Ethan’s disappearance will have earth-shattering consequences in Stef’s own life—and the paths of these two mothers are about to cross in ways no one could have anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racing against the clock, their desperate search for answers begins—one where the greatest danger could lie behind the everyday smiles of those they trust the most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;14 hrs 16 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the "Dickens of our age" (Green Valley News) and New York Times best-selling author of Beartown and A Man Called Ove, a heart-wrenching story of how loyalty, friendship, and love carry a town through its darkest days.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After everything that the citizens of Beartown have gone through, they are struck yet another blow when they learn that their beloved local hockey team will soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in Hed, take in that fact. Amidst the mounting tension between the two rivals, a surprising newcomer is handpicked to be Beartown's new hockey coach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon a new team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you'll ever see; Benji, the crazed lone wolf; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. Bringing this team together is a challenge as old bonds are broken, new ones are formed, and the enmity with Hed grows more and more acute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the big match approaches, the not-so-innocent pranks and incidents between the communities pile up, and hatred grows deeper. When the last game is finally played, one of Beartown's key players will be dead, and residents of both towns are forced to wonder whether, after all they've been through, the game they love can ever return to something simple and innocent.</description>

  <description>13 hrs and 21 mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the &lt;i&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/i&gt; of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, &lt;i&gt;different.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An extraordinary memoir of one woman’s fight to find her true self between the life into which she was born and the one she was given.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christiana Mara Coelho was born into extreme poverty in Brazil. After spending the first seven years of her life with her loving mother in the forest caves outside São Paulo and then on the city streets, where they begged for food, she and her younger brother were suddenly put up for adoption. When one door closed on the only life Christiana had ever known and on the woman who protected her with all her heart, a new one opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Christina Rickardsson, she’s raised by caring adoptive parents in Sweden, far from the despairing favelas of her childhood. Accomplished and outwardly “normal,” Christina is also filled with rage over what she’s lost and having to adapt to a new reality while struggling with the traumas of her youth. When her world falls apart again as an adult, Christina returns to Brazil to finally confront her past and unlock the truth of what really happened to Christiana Mara Coelho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A memoir of two selves, &lt;i&gt;Never Stop Walking&lt;/i&gt; is the moving story of the profound love between families and one woman’s journey from grief and loss to survival and self-discovery.</description>

  <description>Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her "head-for-the-hills bag". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educated&lt;/em&gt; is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was an absolutely incredible novel. I listened to the audiobook and felt a shocking correlation to Kristin Hannah's "The Great Alone". I did figure out the narrators for the audiobook are one in the same so that added to the correlation. However, unlike Hannah's story, Westover's is true.<br...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He started the game. She’ll end it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI special agent Clarke Sinclair doesn’t give up easily. She’s spent years tracking serial killer Simon Cross, forced to follow his twisted clues and photographs across the country. Clarke knows that Cross selects only redheaded women and that he doesn’t target another victim until Clarke discovers the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s never broken pattern…until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl has already gone missing in upstate New York when a second one is kidnapped—a blonde. The killer’s MO has changed, sending Clarke back to the drawing board. The closer she gets to the truth, the deeper she’s drawn into an inescapable trap made just for Clarke. Whatever Cross’s ultimate game is, it ends with her.</description>

  <description>David Sedaris returns with his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny--it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet--and it just might be his very best.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Length: 11 hrs and 36 mins &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he was considered a CIA superagent, before he was thought of as a terrorist's worst nightmare, and before he was both loathed and admired by the politicians on Capitol Hill, Mitch Rapp was a gifted college athlete without a care in the world... and then tragedy struck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two decades of cutthroat, partisan politics has left the CIA and the country in an increasingly vulnerable position. Cold War veteran and CIA Operations Director Thomas Stansfield knows he must prepare his people for the next war. The rise of Islamic terrorism is coming, and it needs to be met abroad before it reaches America's shores. Stansfield directs his protégé, Irene Kennedy, and his old Cold War colleague, Stan Hurley, to form a new group of clandestine operatives who will work outside the normal chain of commandmen who do not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What type of man is willing to kill for his country without putting on a uniform? Kennedy finds him in the wake of the Pan Am Lockerbie terrorist attack. Two-hundred and seventy souls perished that cold December night, and thousands of family and friends were left searching for comfort. Mitch Rapp was one of them, but he was not interested in comfort. He wanted retribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months of intense training has prepared him to bring the war to the enemy's doorstep, and he does so with brutal efficiency. Rapp starts in Istanbul, where he assassinates the Turkish arms dealer who sold the explosives used in the Pan Am attack. Rapp then moves onto Hamburg with his team and across Europe, leaving a trail of bodies. All roads lead to Beirut, though, and what Rapp doesnt know is that the enemy is aware of his existence and has prepared a trap. The hunter is about to become the hunted, and Rapp will need every ounce of skill and cunning if he is to survive the war-ravaged city and its various terrorist factions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A delightful history of Americans' obsession with advice--from Poor Richard to Dr. Spock to Miss Manners&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americans, for all our talk of pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps, obsessively seek advice on matters large and small. Perhaps precisely because we believe in bettering ourselves and our circumstances in life, we ask for guidance constantly. And this has been true since our nation's earliest days: from the colonial era on, there have always been people eager to step up and offer advice, some of it lousy, some of it thoughtful, but all of it read and debated by generations of Americans.&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Weisberg takes readers on a tour of the advice-givers who have made their names, and sometimes their fortunes, by telling Americans what to do. You probably don't want to follow all the advice they proffered. Eating graham crackers will not make you a better person, and wearing blue to work won't guarantee a promotion. But for all that has changed in American life, it's a comfort to know that our hang-ups, fears, and hopes have not. We've always loved seeking advice--so long as it's anonymous, and as long as it's clear that we're not asking for ourselves; we're just asking for a friend.</description>

  <description>When widowed mule breeder Cy Bellman reads in the newspaper that colossal ancient bones have been discovered in the salty Kentucky mud, he sets out from his small Pennsylvania farm to see for himself if the rumors are true: that the giant monsters are still alive and roam the uncharted wilderness beyond the Mississippi River. Promising to write and to return in two years, he leaves behind his only daughter, Bess, to the tender mercies of his taciturn sister and heads west.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only a barnyard full of miserable animals and her dead mother’s gold ring to call her own, Bess, unprotected and approaching womanhood, fills lonely days tracing her father’s route on maps at the subscription library and waiting for his letters to arrive. Bellman, meanwhile, wanders farther and farther from home, across harsh and alien landscapes, in reckless pursuit of the unknown.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you can’t trust yourself, who can you trust?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cass is having a hard time since the night she saw the car in the woods, on the winding rural road, in the middle of a downpour, with the woman sitting inside―the woman who was killed. She’s been trying to put the crime out of her mind; what could she have done, really? It’s a dangerous road to be on in the middle of a storm. Her husband would be furious if he knew she’d broken her promise not to take that shortcut home. And she probably would only have been hurt herself if she’d stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since then, she’s been forgetting every little thing: where she left the car, if she took her pills, the alarm code, why she ordered a pram when she doesn’t have a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing she can’t forget is that woman, the woman she might have saved, and the terrible nagging guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or the silent calls she’s receiving, or the feeling that someone’s watching her…</description>

  <description>A handsome stranger moves to the small Pennsylvania town of Central Valley, and his name is Chris Brennan. He’s applying for a job as a teacher and varsity baseball coach at the local high school, and he looks perfect, on paper. But his name is an alias, his resume is false, and everything about him is a lie. And he has a secret plan - for which he needs a pawn on the baseball team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Sematov loves her younger son Raz, the quirky and free-spirited pitcher of the team. But Raz’s adored father died only a few months ago, and the family is grief-stricken. Secretly, Raz is looking to fill the Daddy-shaped hole in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather Larkin is a struggling single mother who’s dedicated to her only son Justin, the quiet rookie on the team. But Justin’s shy and reserved nature renders him vulnerable to attention, including that of a new father-figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mindy Kostis is the wife of a busy surgeon and the queen bee of the baseball boosters, where her super-popular son Evan is the star catcher. But she doesn’t realize that Evan’s sense of entitlement is becoming a full-blown case of affluenza, and after he gets his new BMW, it’s impossible to know where he’s going – or whom he’s spending time with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lives of these families revolve around the baseball team – and Chris Brennan. What does he really want? How far will he go to get it? Who among them will survive the lethal jeopardy threatening them, from the shadows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enthralling and suspenseful, &lt;i&gt;One Perfect Lie&lt;/i&gt; is an emotional thriller and a suburban crime story that will keep readers riveted to the shocking end, with killer twists and characters you won’t soon forget.</description>

  <description>the Angelus bell&lt;br /&gt; ringing out over its villages and townlands,&lt;br /&gt; over the fields and hills and bogs in between,&lt;br /&gt;  six chimes of three across a minute and a half, &lt;br /&gt; a summons struck &lt;br /&gt; on the lip of the void&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once a year, on All Souls’ Day, it is said in Ireland that the dead may return. Solar Bones is the story of one such visit. Marcus Conway, a middle-aged engineer, turns up one afternoon at his kitchen table and considers the events that took him away and then brought him home again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny and strange, McCormack’s ambitious and other-worldly novel plays with form and defies convention. This is profound new work is by one of Ireland’s most important contemporary novelists. A beautiful and haunting elegy, this story of order and chaos, love and loss captures how minor decisions ripple into waves and test our integrity every day.</description>

  <description>With empathy, grace, humor, and piercing insight, the author of &lt;em&gt;gods in Alabama&lt;/em&gt; pens a powerful, emotionally resonant novel of the South that confronts the truth about privilege, family, and the distinctions between perception and reality---the stories we tell ourselves about our origins and who we really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superheroes have always been Leia Birch Briggs’ weakness. One tequila-soaked night at a comics convention, the usually level-headed graphic novelist is swept off her barstool by a handsome and anonymous Batman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out the caped crusader has left her with more than just a nice, fuzzy memory. She’s having a baby boy—an unexpected but not unhappy development in the thirty-eight year-old’s life. But before Leia can break the news of her impending single-motherhood (including the fact that her baby is biracial) to her conventional, Southern family, her step-sister Rachel’s marriage implodes. Worse, she learns her beloved ninety-year-old grandmother, Birchie, is losing her mind, and she’s been hiding her dementia with the help of Wattie, her best friend since girlhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leia returns to Alabama to put her grandmother’s affairs in order, clean out the big Victorian that has been in the Birch family for generations, and tell her family that she’s pregnant. Yet just when Leia thinks she’s got it all under control, she learns that illness is not the only thing Birchie’s been hiding. Tucked in the attic is a dangerous secret with roots that reach all the way back to the Civil War. Its exposure threatens the family’s freedom and future, and it will change everything about how Leia sees herself and her sister, her son and his missing father, and the world she thinks she knows.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is one of the best books I've listened to/read in a long time! First, I LOVE the author's narration (yes, she does it herself). I was a bit hesitant at first as there was a lot of talk around the graphic novel the main character, Leia, is working on, and I am just not familiar with the graph...]]>

They are promises. They are the only way to walk from one night to the other. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poet and essayist Nina Riggs was just thirty-seven years old when initially diagnosed with breast cancer—one small spot. Within a year, she received the devastating news that her cancer was terminal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does a dying person learn to live each day “unattached to outcome”? How does one approach the moments, big and small, with both love and honesty? How does a young mother and wife prepare her two young children and adored husband for a loss that will shape the rest of their lives? How do we want to be remembered?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring motherhood, marriage, friendship, and memory, Nina asks: What makes a meaningful life when one has limited time? “Profound and poignant” (&lt;i&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;The Bright Hour&lt;/i&gt; is about how to make the most of all the days, even the painful ones. It’s about the way literature, especially Nina’s direct ancestor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and her other muse, Montaigne, can be a balm and a form of prayer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly written and exceptionally moving, it’s a “deeply affecting memoir, a simultaneously heartbreaking and funny account of living with loss and the specter of death. As Riggs lyrically, unflinchingly details her reality, she finds beauty and truth that comfort even amid the crushing sadness” (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Book of the Week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tender and heartwarming, &lt;i&gt;The Bright Hour&lt;/i&gt; “is a gentle reminder to cherish each day” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, Best New Books) and offers us this important perspective: “You can read a multitude books about how to die, but Riggs, a dying woman, will show you how to live” (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;, Editor’s Choice).</description>

  <description>For readers of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade's most anticipated debuts, to be published in thirty-six languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: a twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't paranoia if it's really happening . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn't, her world begins to crumble?and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, The Woman in the Window is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Exquisite. A must-read.” — Kristin Hannah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paperback edition includes a color reproduction of Andrew Wyeth’s painting &lt;i&gt;Christina’s World&lt;/i&gt;, along with a Q&amp;amp;A with bestselling author Kristin Hannah and a bonus short story, “Stranded in Ice.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the smash bestseller &lt;i&gt;Orphan Train&lt;/i&gt;, a stunning and atmospheric novel of friendship, passion, and art, inspired by Andrew Wyeth’s mysterious and iconic painting &lt;i&gt;Christina’s World&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Later he told me that he’d been afraid to show me the painting. He thought I wouldn’t like the way he portrayed me: dragging myself across the field, fingers clutching dirt, my legs twisted behind. The arid moonscape of wheatgrass and timothy. That dilapidated house in the distance, looming up like a secret that won’t stay hidden."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Christina Olson, the entire world is her family farm in the small coastal town of Cushing, Maine. The only daughter in a family of sons, Christina is tied to her home by health and circumstance, and seems destined for a small life. Instead, she becomes Andrew Wyeth’s first great inspiration, and the subject of one of the best-known paintings of the twentieth century, &lt;i&gt;Christina’s World&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she did in her beloved bestseller &lt;i&gt;Orphan Train&lt;/i&gt;, Christina Baker Kline interweaves fact and fiction to vividly reimagine a real moment in history. &lt;i&gt;A Piece of the World&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful story of the flesh-and-blood woman behind the portrait, her complicated relationship to her family and inheritance, and how artist and muse can come together to forge a new and timeless legacy.</description>

  <description>Memphis, 1939. Twelve-year-old Rill Foss and her four younger siblings live a magical life aboard their family’s Mississippi River shantyboat. But when their father must rush their mother to the hospital one stormy night, Rill is left in charge—until strangers arrive in force. Wrenched from all that is familiar and thrown into a Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage, the Foss children are assured that they will soon be returned to their parents—but they quickly realize the dark truth. At the mercy of the facility’s cruel director, Rill fights to keep her sisters and brother together in a world of danger and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiken, South Carolina, present day. Born into wealth and privilege, Avery Stafford seems to have it all: a successful career as a federal prosecutor, a handsome fiancé, and a lavish wedding on the horizon. But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family’s long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on one of America’s most notorious real-life scandals—in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country—Lisa Wingate’s riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong.</description>

      <![CDATA[I absolutely loved this book! It reminded me of two other historical fiction novels I loved, "The Orphan Train" by Christina Baker Kline and "Calling Me Home" by Julie Kibler. The story follows adoptions from the 1920s-1950s, specifically in Tennessee and the Tennessee Children's Home Society and...]]>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1974.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed.&lt;br /&gt;For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and danger. The Great Alone is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Jojo Moyes, a new book featuring her iconic heroine of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;After You&lt;/i&gt;, Louisa Clark.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisa Clark arrives in New York ready to start a new life, confident that she can embrace this new adventure and keep her relationship with Ambulance Sam alive across several thousand miles. She steps into the world of the superrich, working for Leonard Gopnik and his much younger second wife, Agnes. Lou is determined to get the most out of the experience and throws herself into her new job and New York life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she begins to mix in New York high society, Lou meets Joshua Ryan, a man who brings with him a whisper of her past. Before long, Lou finds herself torn between Fifth Avenue where she works and the treasure-filled vintage clothing store where she actually feels at home. And when matters come to a head, she has to ask herself: Who is Louisa Clark? And how do you find the courage to follow your heart—wherever that may lead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, romantic, and poignant, &lt;i&gt;Still Me&lt;/i&gt; follows Lou as she navigates how to stay true to herself, while pushing to live boldly in her brave new world.</description>

  <description>With Congressman Brady Maxwell up for reelection and journalist Liz Dougherty about to graduate into a promising career, the ambitious couple’s future is brighter than ever. They share a passion for their work…and for each other. But when Brady holds a press conference to officially introduce Liz as his girlfriend, reporters hungry for a scandal bombard her. Now, her every move is under a vicious magnifying glass, and her life feels like it’s falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the road to reelection, the passionate bond between the congressman and the journalist gets tested at every stop. Threatened by shameless media sensationalism and jealous exes, Brady and Liz now have to learn to trust each other despite what they read in the papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the finale to &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author K.A. Linde’s sexy &lt;i&gt;Record&lt;/i&gt; trilogy, Liz and Brady may be setting off fireworks along the campaign trail, but can their love transcend politics as usual?</description>

      <![CDATA[Just like the first book, the main character bothers me. She's very wishy washy. And makes stupid decisions. I actually called her a 'dimwit' out loud once or twice. I did like this book a bit better than the first, and am excited to see how the next book goes.]]>

  <description>Liz Dougherty has no idea a single question is about to change her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her first big reporting assignment for her North Carolina college newspaper has her covering a state senator’s impromptu press conference. Brady Maxwell may have everything it takes to be a politician—a winning pedigree, devastating good looks, a body made to wear suits—but his politics rub Liz the wrong way. When Liz’s hard-hitting question catches the upstart senator off-guard, it impresses Hayden Lane, Liz’s editor who feels she’s headed for a promising career as a reporter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Liz is also headed into a secret romance with Brady that could destroy both their ambitions. Though he’s a bachelor, potential voters might frown on Brady cozying up to a reporter. And Liz isn’t sure sneaking around is enough for her—especially when things between her and Hayden might be less platonic than she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleek, sexy, and smart, Off the Record ventures into a high-stakes campaign and an even higher-stakes affair to answer the question: When politics and love collide, can there ever be a winner?</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was what you expect from a romantic novel. The story line was a bit unbelievable and the sex scenes definitely were. I couldn’t stand the main character and her inner dialogue. She really never stood up for herself and let Brady Maxwell make all the decisions to keep her hidden. ]]>

  <description>In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this last remnant of the Wild West—where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, “the Phantom Terror,” roamed – virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization’s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history.</description>

  <description>A moving, exciting, and heartfelt American saga inspired by the author's own family memoirs, these words belong to Sarah Prine, a woman of spirit and fire who forges a full and remarkable existence in a harsh, unfamiliar frontier. Scrupulously recording her steps down the path Providence has set her upon--from child to determined young adult to loving mother--she shares the turbulent events, both joyous and tragic, that molded her and recalls the enduring love with cavalry officer Captain Jack Elliot that gave her strength and purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich in authentic everyday details and alive with truly unforgettable characters, &lt;i&gt;These Is My Words&lt;/i&gt; brilliantly brings a vanished world to breathtaking life again.</description>

  <description>On her way to Utah to see her dying mother, college student Darby Thorne gets caught in a fierce blizzard in the mountains of Colorado. With the roads impassable, she’s forced to wait out the storm at a remote highway rest stop. Inside, are some vending machines, a coffee maker, and four complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find a signal to call home, Darby goes back out into the storm . . . and makes a horrifying discovery. In the back of the van parked next to her car, a little girl is locked in an animal crate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the child? Why has she been taken? And how can Darby save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cell phone reception, no telephone, and no way out. One of her fellow travelers is a kidnapper. But which one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in an increasingly dangerous situation, with a child’s life and her own on the line, Darby must find a way to break the girl out of the van and escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who can she trust?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;End Game&lt;/i&gt; is the fifth book in the thrilling Will Robie series by international number one bestselling author David Baldacci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London is on red alert. Will Robie, as the US government’s most lethal assassin, is called in to foil a terrorist attack on the London Underground. An attack serving as a test run for a much larger plot to take place on US soil. Trained to neutralize threats without leaving a trace, he’s an indispensable asset to his country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then reports come in that his mentor, Blue Man, real name Roger Walton, has gone missing while visiting his home town in Colorado. Fearing he’s been kidnapped, Robie, and fellow agent Jessica Reel, are sent to investigate. The high-ranking CIA official holds secrets that could threaten national security if released and so only the best will do in tracking him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tight-knit community close to the Rocky Mountains holds many secrets and people there are more than willing to take the law into their own hands at the first sign of trouble. To them, two government agents are just that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their investigation deepens, Robie and Reel come into contact with white supremacists and a cult that call themselves the King’s Apostles. But are either group implicated in the disappearance of Walton? When the truth emerges it will test them both to their very limits . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1 New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0375869026 (ISBN13: 9780375869020)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this gripping page-turner, an ex-agent on the run from her former employers must take one more case to clear her name and save her life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used to work for the U.S. government, but very few people ever knew that. An expert in her field, she was one of the darkest secrets of an agency so clandestine it doesn't even have a name. And when they decided she was a liability, they came for her without warning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she rarely stays in the same place or uses the same name for long. They've killed the only other person she trusted, but something she knows still poses a threat. They want her dead, and soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her former handler offers her a way out, she realizes it's her only chance to erase the giant target on her back. But it means taking one last job for her ex-employers. To her horror, the information she acquires only makes her situation more dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resolving to meet the threat head-on, she prepares for the toughest fight of her life but finds herself falling for a man who can only complicate her likelihood of survival. As she sees her choices being rapidly whittled down, she must apply her unique talents in ways she never dreamed of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tautly plotted novel, Meyer creates a fierce and fascinating new heroine with a very specialized skill set. And she shows once again why she's one of the world's bestselling authors.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, college student Quincy Carpenter went on vacation with five friends and came back alone, the only survivor of a horror movie–scale massacre. In an instant, she became a member of a club no one wants to belong to—a group of similar survivors known in the press as the Final Girls. Lisa, who lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout's knife; Sam, who went up against the Sack Man during her shift at the Nightlight Inn; and now Quincy, who ran bleeding through the woods to escape Pine Cottage and the man she refers to only as Him. The three girls are all attempting to put their nightmares behind them, and, with that, one another. Despite the media's attempts, they never meet.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Now, Quincy is doing well—maybe even great, thanks to her Xanax prescription. She has a caring almost-fiancé, Jeff; a popular baking blog; a beautiful apartment; and a therapeutic presence in Coop, the police officer who saved her life all those years ago. Her memory won’t even allow her to recall the events of that night; the past is in the past. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; That is, until Lisa, the first Final Girl, is found dead in her bathtub, wrists slit, and Sam, the second, appears on Quincy's doorstep. Blowing through Quincy's life like a whirlwind, Sam seems intent on making Quincy relive the past, with increasingly dire consequences, all of which makes Quincy question why Sam is really seeking her out. And when new details about Lisa's death come to light, Quincy's life becomes a race against time as she tries to unravel Sam's truths from her lies, evade the police and hungry reporters, and, most crucially, remember what really happened at Pine Cottage, before what was started ten years ago is finished.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, &lt;i&gt;Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine&lt;/i&gt; is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>London, 1944. Two young nurses meet at a train station with a common purpose: to join the war effort. Scarlet longs for the chance to find her missing fiancé, Thomas, and to prove to her family—and to herself—that she’s stronger than everybody thinks. Nursing is in Ellie’s blood, but her humble background is vastly different from Scarlet’s privileged upbringing. Though Ellie puts on a brave face, she’s just as nervous as Scarlet about what awaits them in France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Normandy, the two friends soon encounter the seemingly unflappable Lucy. Scarlet and Ellie are in awe of her courage and competence, but the experienced nurse is well aware of the dangers of the job they’ve chosen—and even she is terrified they won’t make it home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pushed to their limits by the brutality of a world at war, Scarlet, Ellie and Lucy will need to rely on each other—and the power of their friendship—to survive.</description>

  <description>13 hours, 53 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/i&gt; is the outrageously funny debut novel about three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.&lt;br /&gt;When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, &lt;i&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/i&gt; is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, &lt;i&gt;crazily&lt;/i&gt; rich.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Adriana Trigiani, the beloved &lt;em&gt;New York Times-&lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of T&lt;em&gt;he Shoemaker’s Wife,&lt;/em&gt; comes an exhilarating epic novel of love, loyalty, and creativity&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;the story of an Italian-American family on the cusp of change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1949 and South Philadelphia bursts with opportunity during the post-war boom. &lt;em&gt;The Palazzini Cab Company &amp;amp; Western Union Telegraph Office&lt;/em&gt;, owned and operated by Dominic Palazzini and his three sons, is flourishing: business is good, they’re surrounded by sympathetic wives and daughters-in-law, with grandchildren on the way. But a decades-long feud that split Dominic and his brother Mike and their once-close families sets the stage for a re-match. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst the hoopla, the arrival of an urgent telegram from Italy upends the life of Nicky Castone (Dominic and his wife’s orphaned nephew) who lives and works with his Uncle Dom and his family. Nicky decides, at 30, that he wants more—more than just a job driving Car #4 and more than his longtime fiancée Peachy DePino, a bookkeeper, can offer. When he admits to his fiancée that he’s been secretly moonlighting at the local Shakespeare theater company, Nicky finds himself drawn to the stage, its colorful players and to the determined Calla Borelli, who inherited the enterprise from her father, Nicky must choose between the conventional life his family expects of him or chart a new course and risk losing everything he cherishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the dreamy mountaintop village of Roseto Valfortore in Italy, to the vibrant streets of South Philly, to the close-knit enclave of Roseto, Pennsylvania, to New York City during the birth of the golden age of television, &lt;em&gt;Kiss Carlo&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful, inter-generational story that celebrates the ties that bind, while staying true to oneself when all hope seems lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told against the backdrop of some of Shakespeare’s greatest comedies, this novel brims with romance as long buried secrets are revealed, mistaken identities are unmasked, scores are settled, broken hearts are mended and true love reigns. Trigiani’s consummate storytelling skill and her trademark wit, along with a dazzling cast of characters will enthrall readers. Once again, the author has returned to her own family garden to create an unforgettable feast. &lt;em&gt;Kiss Carlo&lt;/em&gt; is a jubilee, resplendent with hope, love, and the abiding power of &lt;em&gt;la famiglia&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Contemporary romance author Sarah Robinson brings readers a new standalone novel set in the glamorous hills of Hollywood and tackling challenging themes like the intersection of sexuality and female empowerment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ben Lawson is making a comeback...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few tabloid headlines, they think they know me. They don't know a damn thing.  As CEO of a movie production company, I'll show them who I really am when we hit it big at the box office. My ex thought her smear tactics would ruin me, but I'm unbreakable. Rising from the debris, I swore I'd never let a woman distract me like that again. But then, my leading actress walked on the set and changed everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seductive, sexy, and unapologetic, Aria Rose could break me. I wanted to help her, protect her...love her. Instead, I destroyed her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aria Rose is baring it all....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew better. I knew not to trust another Hollywood heartthrob with a reputation like his. He was my boss and became my ruin. I should have stayed far away from him. Ben Lawson promised me the world. He even promised me his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he destroyed everything--my heart, my career, us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: This novel is for 18+ years old as it contains graphic sexual content. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Los Angeles, 2012. It’s been five years since the events of the Mortal Instruments when Nephilim stood poised on the brink of oblivion and Shadowhunter Emma Carstairs lost her parents. After the blood and violence she witnessed as a child, Emma has dedicated her life to the eradication of demons and being the best, fastest and deadliest Shadowhunter since Jace Lightwood. Raised in the Los Angeles Institute, Emma is paired as a parabatai with her best friend, Julian. As Emma hunts those who caused the death of her parents, the trail they’re following leads back to those they’ve always been taught to trust. At the same time, Emma is falling in love with Julian — her closest friend and, because he is her parabatai, the one person in the world she’s absolutely forbidden by Shadowhunter Law to love. Set against the glittering backdrop of present-day Los Angeles, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches from the warlock-run nightclubs of the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is the second book in The Dark Artifices series, which I would consider of Young Adult/Fantasy genre. There is teenage romance, drama and conflict throughout the entire book. Cassandra Clare does a great job of telling the story of the Blackthorn family from multiple characters' perspectives...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful new statement about feminism today--written as a letter to a friend. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele &lt;/i&gt;is Adichie's letter of response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions--compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive--for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can "allow" women to have full careers, &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele&lt;/i&gt; goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nothing to Envy &lt;/i&gt;follows the lives of six North Koreans over fifteen years—a chaotic period that saw the death of Kim Il-sung, the unchallenged rise to power of his son Kim Jong-il, and the devastation of a far-ranging famine that killed one-fifth of the population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking us into a landscape most of us have never before seen, award-winning journalist Barbara Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime today—an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, in which radio and television dials are welded to the one government station, and where displays of affection are punished; a police state where informants are rewarded and where an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demick takes us deep inside the country, beyond the reach of government censors. Through meticulous and sensitive reporting, we see her six subjects—average North Korean citizens—fall in love, raise families, nurture ambitions, and struggle for survival. One by one, we experience the moments when they realize that their government has betrayed them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing to Envy &lt;/i&gt;is a groundbreaking addition to the literature of totalitarianism and an eye-opening look at a closed world that is of increasing global importance.</description>

  <description>People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever-encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded town. And that rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior hockey team is about to compete in the national championships, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of the town now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys. &lt;br /&gt;A victory would send star player Kevin onto a brilliant professional future in the NHL. It would mean everything to Amat, a scrawny fifteen-year-old treated like an outcast everywhere but on the ice. And it would justify the choice that Peter, the team's general manager, and his wife, Kira, made to return to his hometown and raise their children in this beautiful but isolated place. &lt;br /&gt;Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semifinal match is the catalyst for a violent act that leaves a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Hers is a story no one wants to believe since the truth would mean the end of the dream. Accusations are made, and like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Three women, haunted by the past and the secrets they hold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set at the end of World War II, in a crumbling Bavarian castle that once played host to all of German high society, a powerful and propulsive story of three widows whose lives and fates become intertwined an affecting, shocking, and ultimately redemptive novel from the author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Notable Book &lt;em&gt;The Hazards of Good Breeding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the ashes of Nazi Germany s defeat, Marianne von Lingenfels returns to the once-grand castle of her husband s ancestors, an imposing stone fortress now fallen into ruin following years of war. The widow of a resister murdered in the failed July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Marianne plans to uphold the promise she made to her husband s brave conspirators: to find and protect their wives, her fellow resistance widows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Marianne rescues six-year-old Martin, the son of her dearest childhood friend, from a Nazi reeducation home. Together, they make their way across the smoldering wreckage of their homeland to Berlin, where Martin s mother, the beautiful and naive Benita, has fallen into the hands of occupying Red Army soldiers. Then she locates Ania, another resister s wife, and her two boys, now refugees languishing in one of the many camps that house the millions displaced by the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Marianne assembles this makeshift family from the ruins of her husband s resistance movement, she is certain their shared pain and circumstances will hold them together. But she quickly discovers that the black-and-white, highly principled world of her privileged past has become infinitely more complicated, filled with secrets and dark passions that threaten to tear them apart. Eventually, all three women must come to terms with the choices that have defined their lives before, during, and after the war each with their own unique share of challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with the devastating emotional power of &lt;em&gt;The Nightingale, Sarah's Key&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Light Between Oceans&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Shattuck's evocative and utterly enthralling novel offers a fresh perspective on one of the most tumultuous periods in history. Combining piercing social insight and vivid historical atmosphere, &lt;em&gt;The Women in the Castle&lt;/em&gt; is a dramatic yet nuanced portrait of war and its repercussions that explores what it means to survive, love, and, ultimately, to forgive in the wake of unimaginable hardship."</description>

  <description>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive love affair and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exit West&lt;/i&gt; follows these characters as they emerge into an alien and uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely of our time and for all time.</description>

  <description>“&lt;i&gt;There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Kvothe.&lt;br /&gt;I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.&lt;br /&gt;You may have heard of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in &lt;i&gt;The Wise Man's Fear&lt;/i&gt;, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Wise Man's Fear&lt;/i&gt;, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the perfect marriage has its dark side… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris and Will's marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris's happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</description>

  <description>Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description>

  <description>Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in The Girl on the Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, Megan Miranda’s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women—a decade apart—told in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace. Back again to tie up loose ends and care for her ailing father, Nic is soon plunged into a shocking drama that reawakens Corinne’s case and breaks open old wounds long since stitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decade-old investigation focused on Nic, her brother Daniel, boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne’s boyfriend Jackson. Since then, only Nic has left Cooley Ridge. Daniel and his wife, Laura, are expecting a baby; Jackson works at the town bar; and Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, Nic’s younger neighbor and the group’s alibi the night Corinne disappeared. Then, within days of Nic’s return, Annaleise goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told backwards—Day 15 to Day 1—from the time Annaleise goes missing, Nic works to unravel the truth about her younger neighbor’s disappearance, revealing shocking truths about her friends, her family, and what really happened to Corinne that night ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like nothing you’ve ever read before, All the Missing Girls delivers in all the right ways. With twists and turns that lead down dark alleys and dead ends, you may think you’re walking a familiar path, but then Megan Miranda turns it all upside down and inside out and leaves us wondering just how far we would be willing to go to protect those we love.</description>

  <description>The Godfather—the epic tale of crime and betrayal that became a global phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost fifty years ago, a classic was born. A searing portrayal of the Mafia underworld, The Godfather introduced readers to the first family of American crime fiction, the Corleones, and their powerful legacy of tradition, blood, and honor. The seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed, and the allegiance to family—these are the themes that have resonated with millions of readers around the world and made The Godfather the definitive novel of the violent subculture that, steeped in intrigue and controversy, remains indelibly etched in our collective consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~penguin.com</description>

  <description>The Shadowhunters of Los Angeles star in the first novel in Cassandra Clare’s newest series, The Dark Artifices, a sequel to the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series. &lt;i&gt;Lady Midnight&lt;/i&gt; is a Shadowhunters novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been five years since the events of &lt;i&gt;City of Heavenly Fire&lt;/i&gt; that brought the Shadowhunters to the brink of oblivion. Emma Carstairs is no longer a child in mourning, but a young woman bent on discovering what killed her parents and avenging her losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with her parabatai Julian Blackthorn, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches across Los Angeles, from the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica. If only her heart didn’t lead her in treacherous directions…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making things even more complicated, Julian’s brother Mark—who was captured by the faeries five years ago—has been returned as a bargaining chip. The faeries are desperate to find out who is murdering their kind—and they need the Shadowhunters’ help to do it. But time works differently in faerie, so Mark has barely aged and doesn’t recognize his family. Can he ever truly return to them? Will the faeries really allow it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Glitz, glamours, and Shadowhunters abound in this heartrending opening to Cassandra Clare’s Dark Artifices series.</description>

  <description>World War II is drawing to a close in East Prussia and thousands of refugees are on a desperate trek toward freedom, many with something to hide. Among them are Joana, Emilia, and Florian, whose paths converge en route to the ship that promises salvation, the &lt;i&gt;Wilhelm Gustloff&lt;/i&gt;. Forced by circumstance to unite, the three find their strength, courage, and trust in each other tested with each step closer to safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when it seems freedom is within their grasp, tragedy strikes. Not country, nor culture, nor status matter as all ten thousand people—adults and children alike—aboard must fight for the same thing: survival.</description>

  <description>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies&lt;/i&gt;—a magnificent history of the gene and a response to the defining question of the future: What becomes of being human when we learn to “read” and “write” our own genetic information?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siddhartha Mukherjee has a written a biography of the gene as deft, brilliant, and illuminating as his extraordinarily successful biography of cancer. Weaving science, social history, and personal narrative to tell us the story of one of the most important conceptual breakthroughs of modern times, Mukherjee animates the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the narrative, the story of Mukherjee’s own family—with its tragic and bewildering history of mental illness—cuts like a bright, red line, reminding us of the many questions that hang over our ability to translate the science of genetics from the laboratory to the real world. In superb prose and with an instinct for the dramatic scene, he describes the centuries of research and experimentation—from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Mendel and Darwin, from Boveri and Morgan to Crick, Watson and Franklin, all the way through the revolutionary twenty-first century innovators who mapped the human genome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; said of &lt;i&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies&lt;/i&gt;, “It’s hard to think of many books for a general audience that have rendered any area of modern science and technology with such intelligence, accessibility, and compassion…An extraordinary achievement.” Riveting, revelatory, and magisterial history of a scientific idea coming to life, and an essential preparation for the moral complexity introduced by our ability to create or “write” the human genome, &lt;i&gt;The Gene&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for everyone concerned about the definition and future of humanity. This is the most crucial science of our time, intimately explained by a master.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Length: 6 hrs and 2 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Tony Award-winning composer-lyricist-star Lin-Manuel Miranda comes a backstage pass to his groundbreaking, hit musical &lt;i&gt;Hamilton.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hamilton&lt;/i&gt; has it all-romance, drama, violence, patriotism, adventure, and more-combine that with the foundational story of our nation, and you've got a book that's bound to be an American classic. "One of the most exhilarating experiences I've had in a theater." said David Brooks. "This show will be talked about in years to come as a benchmark experience," said Peter Marks, theater critic for the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;. Audience members leave &lt;i&gt;Hamilton &lt;/i&gt;wanting more--more details about the many dramatic episodes in Alexander Hamilton's life and further analysis of the musical's lyrics and their meaning. This book will include behind-the-scenes photos of the show and evokes the spirit of the musical, giving readers the same enthralling mix of history, personality, and inspiration that Miranda has achieved on stage. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

I re-read it recently after seeing Hamilton in Chicago and now listening to the soundtrack, pretty much on repeat. I've now updated my review to five stars!

  <description>A hilarious and affecting essay collection about race, gender, and pop culture from celebrated stand-up comedian and WNYC podcaster Phoebe Robinson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phoebe Robinson is a stand-up comic, which means that, often, her everyday experiences become points of comedic fodder. And as a black woman in America, she maintains, sometimes you need to have a sense of humor to deal with the absurdity you are handed on the daily. Robinson has experienced her fair share over the years: she's been unceremoniously relegated to the role of "the black friend," as if she is somehow the authority on all things racial; she's been questioned about her love of U2 and Billy Joel ("isn t that . . . white people music?"); she's been called "uppity" for having an opinion in the workplace; she's been followed around stores by security guards; and yes, people do ask her whether they can touch her hair all. the. time. Now, she's ready to take these topics to the page and she s going to make you laugh as she s doing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using her trademark wit alongside pop-culture references galore, Robinson explores everything from why Lisa Bonet is "Queen. Bae. Jesus," to breaking down the terrible nature of casting calls, to giving her less-than-traditional advice to the future female president, and demanding that the NFL clean up its act, all told in the same conversational voice that launched her podcast, "2 Dope Queens," to the top spot on iTunes. As personal as it is political, "You Can't Touch My Hair" examines our cultural climate and skewers our biases with humor and heart, announcing Robinson as a writer on the rise."</description>

  <description>Jason Dessen is walking home through the chilly Chicago streets one night, looking forward to a quiet evening in front of the fireplace with his wife, Daniela, and their son, Charlie—when his reality shatters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with a man in a mask kidnapping him at gunpoint, for reasons Jason can’t begin to fathom—what would anyone want with an ordinary physics professor?—and grows even more terrifying from there, as Jason’s abductor injects him with some unknown drug and watches while he loses consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jason awakes, he’s in a lab, strapped to a gurney—and a man he’s never seen before is cheerily telling him “welcome back!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason soon learns that in this world he’s woken up to, his house is not his house. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And someone is hunting him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by the life of a real World War II heroine, this debut novel reveals a story of love, redemption, and secrets that were hidden for decades.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But Caroline’s world is forever changed when Hitler’s army invades Poland in September 1939—and then sets its sights on France.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she is drawn deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspecting neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; For the ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. Once hired, though, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious Nazi concentration camp for women. Their stories cross continents—from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland—as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two great spiritual masters share their own hard-won wisdom about living with joy even in the face of adversity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The occasion was a big birthday. And it inspired two close friends to get together in Dharamsala for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake: their own stories and teachings about joy, the most recent findings in the science of deep happiness, and the daily practices that anchor their own emotional and spiritual lives. Both the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu have been tested by great personal and national adversity, and here they share their personal stories of struggle and renewal. Now that they are both in their eighties, they especially want to spread the core message that to have joy yourself, you must bring joy to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and humor how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of life.</description>

  <description>It's a prison unlike any other. Military discipline rules. Its security systems are unmatched. None of its prisoners dream of escaping. They know it's impossible.&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Puller's older brother, Robert, was convicted of treason and national security crimes. His inexplicable escape from prison makes him the most wanted criminal in the country. Some in the government believe that John Puller represents their best chance at capturing Robert alive, and so Puller takes on the burden of bringing his brother in to face justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Puller quickly discovers that there are others pursuing his brother, who only see Robert as a traitor and are unconcerned if he survives. Puller is in turn pushed into an uneasy, fraught partnership with another agent, who may have an agenda of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They dig more deeply into the case together, and Puller finds that not only are her allegiances unclear, but that there are troubling details about his brother's conviction....and that someone is out there who doesn't want the truth to ever come to light. As the nation-wide manhunt for Robert grows more urgent, Puller's masterful skills as an investigator and strength as a fighter may not be enough to save his brother-or himself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acclaimed, bestselling author—winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Orange Prize—tells the enthralling story of how an unexpected romantic encounter irrevocably changes two families’ lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Sunday afternoon in Southern California, Bert Cousins shows up at Franny Keating’s christening party uninvited. Before evening falls, he has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning five decades, &lt;em&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/em&gt; explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the lives of the four parents and six children involved. Spending summers together in Virginia, the Keating and Cousins children forge a lasting bond that is based on a shared disillusionment with their parents and the strange and genuine affection that grows up between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When, in her twenties, Franny begins an affair with the legendary author Leon Posen and tells him about her family, the story of her siblings is no longer hers to control. Their childhood becomes the basis for his wildly successful book, ultimately forcing them to come to terms with their losses, their guilt, and the deeply loyal connection they feel for one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with equal measures of humor and heartbreak, &lt;em&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/em&gt; is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories. It is a brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and responsibility that bind us together.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He can’t leave his hotel. You won’t want to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of Rules of Civility—a transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mega-bestseller with more than 1.5 million readers that is soon to be a major television series&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;Special Agent John Puller, combat veteran and the army's most tenacious investigator, is back in this action-packed thriller from worldwide #1 bestselling author David Baldacci.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO MAN'S LAND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two men. Thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Puller's mother, Jackie, vanished thirty years ago from Fort Monroe, Virginia, when Puller was just a boy. Paul Rogers has been in prison for ten years. But twenty years before that, he was at Fort Monroe. One night three decades ago, Puller's and Rogers' worlds collided with devastating results, and the truth has been buried ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military investigators, armed with a letter from a friend of Jackie's, arrive in the hospital room of Puller's father--a legendary three-star now sinking into dementia--and reveal that Puller Sr. has been accused of murdering Jackie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aided by his brother Robert Puller, an Air Force major, and Veronica Knox, who works for a shadowy U.S. intelligence organization, Puller begins a journey that will take him into his own past, to find the truth about his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Rogers' time is running out. With the clock ticking, he begins his own journey, one that will take him across the country to the place where all his troubles began: a mysterious building on the grounds of Fort Monroe. There, thirty years ago, the man Rogers had once been vanished too, and was replaced with a monster. And now the monster wants revenge. And the only person standing in his way is John Puller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started at a dinner party. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors—a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all—a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night, when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately lands on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they've kept for years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family—a chilling tale of  deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist.</description>

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Julie Whitaker was kidnapped from her bedroom in the middle of the night, witnessed only by her younger sister. Her family was shattered, but managed to stick together, hoping against hope that Julie is still alive. And then one night: the doorbell rings. A young woman who appears to be Julie is finally, miraculously, home safe. The family is ecstatic—but Anna, Julie’s mother, has whispers of doubts.  She hates to face them. She cannot avoid them. When she is contacted by a former detective turned private eye, she begins a torturous search for the truth about the woman she desperately hopes is her daughter.</description>

  <description>Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.</description>

  <description>This is the remarkable story of one endearing dog's search for his purpose over the course of several lives. More than just another charming dog story, this touches on the universal quest for an answer to life's most basic question: Why are we here? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised to find himself reborn as a rambunctious golden haired puppy after a tragically short life as a stray mutt, Bailey's search for his new life's meaning leads him into the loving arms of 8 year old Ethan. During their countless adventures Bailey joyously discovers how to be a good dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this life as a beloved family pet is not the end of Bailey's journey. Reborn as a puppy yet again, Bailey wonders, will he ever find his purpose? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartwarming, insightful, and often laugh out loud funny, this book is not only the emotional and hilarious story of a dog's many lives, but also a dog's eye commentary on human relationships and the unbreakable bonds between man and man's best friend. This story teaches us that love never dies, that our true friends are always with us, and that every creature on earth is born with a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;--front flap</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would you do in the last hour of your life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story of Welles Crowther, whose actions on 9/11 offer a lasting lesson on character, calling and courage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One Sunday morning before church, when Welles Crowther was a young boy, his father gave him a red handkerchief for his back pocket. Welles kept it with him that day, and just about every day to come; it became a fixture and his signature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standout athlete growing up in Upper Nyack, NY, Welles was also a volunteer at the local fire department, along with his father. He cherished the necessity and the camaraderie, the meaning of the role. Fresh from college, he took a Wall Street job on the 104th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, but the dream of becoming a firefighter with the FDNY remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Twin Towers fell, Welles's parents had no idea what happened to him. In the unbearable days that followed, they came to accept that he would never come home. But the mystery of his final hours persisted. Eight months after the attacks, however, Welles's mother read a news account from several survivors, badly hurt on the 78th floor of the South Tower, who said they and others had been led to safety by a stranger, carrying a woman on his back, down nearly twenty flights of stairs. After leading them down, the young man turned around. "I'm going back up," was all he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The survivors didn't know his name, but despite the smoke and panic, one of them remembered a single detail clearly: the man was wearing a red bandanna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Rinaldi's &lt;i&gt;The Red Bandanna&lt;/i&gt; is about a fearless choice, about a crucible of terror and the indomitable spirit to answer it. Examining one decision in the gravest situation, it celebrates the difference one life can make.</description>

  <description>For Ta-Nehisi Coates, history has always been personal. At every stage of his life, he's sought in his explorations of history answers to the mysteries that surrounded him -- most urgently, why he, and other black people he knew, seemed to live in fear. What were they afraid of? Coates takes readers along on his journey through America's history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings -- moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield with a rogue historian, a journey to Chicago's South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America's 'long war on black people,' or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police. In his trademark style -- a mix of lyrical personal narrative, reimagined history, essayistic argument, and reportage -- Coates provides readers a thrillingly illuminating new framework for understanding race: its history, our contemporary dilemma, and where we go from here.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the “twisty-mystery” (&lt;i&gt;Vulture&lt;/i&gt;) novel &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, an equally suspenseful and haunting novel from Ruth Ware—this time, set at sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tightly wound, enthralling story reminiscent of Agatha Christie’s works, Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo’s stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for—and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo’s desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With surprising twists, spine-tingling turns, and a setting that proves as uncomfortably claustrophobic as it is eerily beautiful, Ruth Ware offers up another taut and intense read in&lt;i&gt; The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;—one that will leave even the most sure-footed reader restlessly uneasy long after the last page is turned.</description>

  <description>A novel of breathtaking sweep and emotional power that traces three hundred years in Ghana and along the way also becomes a truly great American novel. Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control. &lt;i&gt;Homegoing&lt;/i&gt; is a tremendous reading experience, not to be missed, by an astonishingly gifted young writer.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Why Not Me?&lt;/i&gt;, Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it’s falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you’re constantly reminded that no one looks like you.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In “How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet’s Confessions,” Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, (“Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn’t the land of appropriate–this is Hollywood, baby. Out here, a dark-skinned woman’s traditional hair color is honey blonde.”) “Player” tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. (“I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.”) In “Unlikely Leading Lady,” she muses on America’s fixation with the weight of actresses, (“Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they’re walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.”) And in “Soup Snakes,” Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak (“I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.”)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who’s ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who’ve never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper.</description>

  <description>Will Robie is the government's most professional, disciplined, and lethal assassin. He infiltrates the most hostile countries in the world, defeats our enemies' advanced security measures, and eliminates threats before they ever reach our shores. &lt;br /&gt;But now, his skills have left him. Sent overseas on a critical assignment, he fails, unable to pull the trigger. Absent his talents, Robie is a man without a mission, and without a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;To recover what he has lost, Robie must confront what he has tried to forget for over twenty years: his own past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE GUILTY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Robie escaped his small Gulf Coast hometown of Cantrell, Mississippi, after high school, severing all personal ties, and never looked back. Not once. Not until the unimaginable occurs. His father, Dan Robie, has been arrested and charged with murder.&lt;br /&gt;Father and son haven't spoken or seen each other since the day Robie left town. In that time, Dan Robie--a local attorney and pillar of the community--has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed.&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty? &lt;br /&gt;With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism . . . and violence.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son. And this time, there may be no escape for either of them.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was probably my least favorite of the Will Robie series. It went much more into details of Robie's past, but almost too much. However, there was a twist I did not see coming. Hopefully there's another book in the series as we still really like the series!]]>

  <description>For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question What makes a life worth living?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student "possessed," as he wrote, "by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. "I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything," he wrote. "Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.</description>

  <description>Six responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It’s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit, busy life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there’s anything they can count on, it’s each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clementine and Erika are each other’s oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation. But theirs is a complicated relationship, so when Erika mentions a last minute invitation to a barbecue with her neighbors, Tiffany and Vid, Clementine and Sam don’t hesitate. Having Tiffany and Vid’s larger than life personalities there will be a welcome respite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later, it won’t stop raining, and Clementine and Sam can’t stop asking themselves the question: What if we hadn’t gone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty takes on the foundations of our lives: marriage, sex, parenthood, and friendship. She shows how guilt can expose the fault lines in the most seemingly strong relationships, how what we don’t say can be more powerful than what we do, and how sometimes it is the most innocent of moments that can do the greatest harm.</description>

This one was not one of my favorites though.<br /><br />She tries to pull you in at the beginning by not sharing a lot of the details...]]>
