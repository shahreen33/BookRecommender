  <description>The last thing Jamie Watson wants is a rugby scholarship to Sherringford, a Connecticut prep school just an hour away from his estranged father. But that’s not the only complication: Sherringford is also home to Charlotte Holmes, the famous detective’s great-great-great-granddaughter, who has inherited not only Sherlock’s genius but also his volatile temperament. From everything Jamie has heard about Charlotte, it seems safer to admire her from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they meet, there’s a tense energy between them, and they seem more destined to be rivals than anything else. But when a Sherringford student dies under suspicious circumstances, ripped straight from the most terrifying of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Jamie can no longer afford to keep his distance. Jamie and Charlotte are being framed for murder, and only Charlotte can clear their names. But danger is mounting and nowhere is safe—and the only people they can trust are each other.</description>

  <description>Baghdad falls . . . and armed men are seen looting the city zoo. Amid a hail of bullets, a concealed underground lab is ransacked--and something horrific is set loose upon the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years later, Louisiana state veterinarian Lorna Polk investigates an abandoned shipwrecked fishing trawler carrying exotic caged animals, part of a black market smuggling ring. But there is something disturbingly wrong with these beasts--each an unsettling mutation of the natural order, all sharing one uncanny trait: incredibly heightened intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining forces with U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jack Menard--a man who shares with her a dark and bloody past--Lorna sets out to uncover the truth about this strange cargo and the terrorist threat it poses. Because a beast escaped the shipwreck and is running amok--and what is about to be born upon the altar of Eden could threaten not only the future of the world but the very foundation of what it means to be human.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Folly Beach, South Carolina, has survived despite hurricanes and war. But it's the personal battles of Folly Beach's residents that have left the most scars, and why a young widow has been beckoned there to heal her own... &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To most people, Folly Beach is simply the last barrier island before reaching the great Atlantic. To some, it's a sanctuary for lost souls, which is why Emmy Hamilton's mother encourages her to buy the local book store, Folly's Finds, hoping it will distract Emmy from the loss of her husband. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Emmy is at first resistant. So much has already changed. But after finding love letters and an image of a beautiful bottle tree in a box of used books from Folly's Finds, she decides to take the plunge. But the seller insists on one condition: Emmy must allow Lulu, the late owner's difficult sister, to continue selling her bottle trees from its back yard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the most part Emmy ignores Lulu as she sifts through the love letters, wanting to learn more. But the more she discovers about the letters, the more she understands Lulu. As details of a possible murder and a mysterious disappearance during WWII are revealed, the two women discover that circumstances beyond their control, sixty years apart, have brought them together, here on Folly Beach. And it is here that their war-ravaged hearts can find hope for a second chance...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Tradd Street novels comes the sequel to &lt;i&gt;Falling Home&lt;/i&gt;, a novel set in the picaresque town of Walton, Georgia, where one woman is about to discover that the best journey is the one that brings you home.…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freelance photographer Suzanne Paris has been on her own since she was fourteen—and she has no intention of settling down, especially not in a tiny town like Walton. She’s here to hide out for a little while, not to form connections. Her survival depends on her ability to slip in and out of people’s lives, on never staying in one place for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Walton is a town where everyone knows everyone else—and they all seem intent on making Suzanne feel right at home. She can’t help but feel drawn to this tight-knit community—or to the town’s mayor, Joe Warner, and his six kids. But Suzanne can’t afford to stick around, even if she’s finally found a place where she belongs. Because someone is looking for her—someone who won’t stop until her life is destroyed…</description>

But she's going to have to accept it. An old man she recently met has died, leaving her his historic Tradd Street home, complete with housekeeper, dog—and a family of ghosts anxious to tell her their secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enter Jack Trenholm, a gorgeous writer obsessed with unsolved mysteries. He has reason to believe that diamonds from the Confederate Treasury are hidden in the house. So he turns the charm on with Melanie, only to discover &lt;i&gt;he'&lt;/i&gt;s the smitten one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It turns out Jack's search has caught the attention of a malevolent ghost. Now, Jack and Melanie must unravel a mystery of passion, heartbreak—and even murder.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Facing her future as a single mother, psychic Realtor Melanie Middleton is determined to be strong and leave her past with writer Jack Trenholm behind her. But history has a tendency of catching up with Melanie, whether she likes it or not.…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Melanie is only going through the motions of living since refusing Jack’s marriage proposal. She misses him desperately, but her broken heart is the least of her problems. Despite an insistence that she can raise their child alone, Melanie is completely unprepared for motherhood, and she struggles to complete renovations on her house on Tradd Street before the baby arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Melanie is roused one night by the sound of a ghostly infant crying, she chooses to ignore it. She simply does not have the energy to deal with one more crisis. That is, until the remains of a newborn buried in an old christening gown are found hidden in the foundation of her house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the hauntings on Tradd Street slowly become more violent, Melanie decides to find out what caused the baby’s untimely death, uncovering the love, loss, and betrayal that color the house’s history—and threaten her claim of ownership. But can she seek Jack’s help without risking her heart? For in revealing the secrets of the past, Melanie also awakens the malevolent presence that has tried to keep the truth hidden for decades.…</description>

  <description>You know that saying about how sometimes you're the windshield and sometimes you're the bug? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's true. Take me, for example. I shook the Georgia dust from my feet fifteen years ago,vowing never to leave Manhattan. I traded sweet tea for Chardonnay, fried chicken for nouvelle cuisine, lazy days on my aunt's front porch for ad campaigns and board meetings, and the guy who broke my heart for my handsome boss, who soon became my fiance. Perfect, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until my sister called. We haven't spoken since I left home--because she married the guy who broke my heart. What's more, she called to say my father is dying--but he refuses to finish until I show up. So I'm back in the hottest, dinkiest small town in Georgia, facing my sister and my old boyfriend over the heads of their--count them--five children. It couldn't get weirder, right? Unless you count Sam Parker--a long-forgotten classmate, now the town doctor--and how good he's beginning to look to me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm falling apart, I think, wondering why resentment &lt;br /&gt;and wounded pride seem silly here in Walton, where forgiveness and acceptance go hand-in-hand with homecoming. And I'm beginning to suspect that I'm falling in love for real this time, with a man whose touch is so right, I feel like I'm... &lt;br /&gt;Falling Home.</description>

  <description>A novel of family, Midwestern values, hard work, fate and the secrets of making a world-class beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two sisters, one farm. A family is split when their father leaves their shared inheritance entirely to Helen, his younger daughter. Despite baking award-winning pies at the local nursing home, her older sister, Edith, struggles to make what most people would call a living. So she can't help wondering what her life would have been like with even a portion of the farm money her sister kept for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the proceeds from the farm, Helen builds one of the most successful light breweries in the country, and makes their company motto ubiquitous: "Drink lots. It's Blotz." Where Edith has a heart as big as Minnesota, Helen's is as rigid as a steel keg. Yet one day, Helen will find she needs some help herself, and she could find a potential savior close to home. . . if it's not too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Edith's granddaughter, Diana, grows up knowing that the real world requires a tougher constitution than her grandmother possesses. She earns a shot at learning the IPA business from the ground up--will that change their fortunes forever, and perhaps reunite her splintered family?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we meet a cast of lovable, funny, quintessentially American characters eager to make their mark in a world that's often stacked against them. In this deeply affecting family saga, resolution can take generations, but when it finally comes, we're surprised, moved, and delighted.</description>

  <description>New York Times" bestselling author Karen White invites you to explore the brick-walked streets of Charleston, where historic mansions house the memories of years gone by, and restless spirits refuse to fade away... &lt;br /&gt;With her extended maternity leave at its end, Melanie Trenholm is less than thrilled to leave her new husband and beautiful twins to return to work, especially when she s awoken by a phone call with no voice on the other end and the uneasy feeling that the ghostly apparitions that have stayed silent for more than a year are about to invade her life once more. &lt;br /&gt; But her return to the realty office goes better than she could have hoped, with a new client eager to sell the home she recently inherited on South Battery. Most would treasure living in one of the grandest old homes in the famous historic district of Charleston, but Jayne Smith would rather sell hers as soon as possible, guaranteeing Melanie a quick commission. &lt;br /&gt; Despite her stroke of luck, Melanie can t deny that spirits both malevolent and benign have started to show themselves to her again. One is shrouded from sight, but appears whenever Jayne is near. Another arrives when an old cistern is discovered in Melanie s backyard on Tradd Street. &lt;br /&gt; Melanie knows nothing good can come from unearthing the past. But some secrets refuse to stay buried....</description>

Ginnette Prioleau Middleton left Charleston thirty-five years ago. She's returned wanting to protect the daughter she's never really known after receiving an ominous premonition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Melanie never wanted to see her mother again, but with some prodding from her partner, Jack Trenholm, she agrees - and begins to rebuild their relationship. Together Melanie and Ginnette buy back their old home. With their combined psychic abilities they expect to unearth some ghosts. But what they find is a vengeful dark spirit whose strength has been growing for decades. It will take unearthing long buried secrets to beat this demon and save what's left of Melanie's family.</description>

  <description>After the death of her beloved grandmother, a Cuban-American woman travels to Havana, where she discovers the roots of her identity--and unearths a family secret hidden since the revolution...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Havana, 1958. The daughter of a sugar baron, nineteen-year-old Elisa Perez is part of Cuba's high society, where she is largely sheltered from the country's growing political unrest--until she embarks on a clandestine affair with a passionate revolutionary...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miami, 2017. Freelance writer Marisol Ferrera grew up hearing romantic stories of Cuba from her late grandmother Elisa, who was forced to flee with her family during the revolution. Elisa's last wish was for Marisol to scatter her ashes in the country of her birth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Havana, Marisol comes face-to-face with the contrast of Cuba's tropical, timeless beauty and its perilous political climate. When more family history comes to light and Marisol finds herself attracted to a man with secrets of his own, she'll need the lessons of her grandmother's past to help her understand the true meaning of courage.</description>

  <description>Fans of Nora Roberts, LaVyrle Spencer and Kristin Hannah will enjoy this story -- humorous, heartwarming and suspenseful -- by RITA-award winning author Antoinette Stockenberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A COTTAGE BY THE SEA: it's a dream come true for Jane Drew. Too bad it comes with a ghost -- and a soulfully seductive neighbor who would just as soon boot Jane off the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you're seriously unattached and recently unemployed, the inheritance of a cottage on Nantucket Island might seem like a really Good Thing. The fact that the house is ramshackle and possibly haunted? Mere details. Jane Drew never actually believed the neighbors' murmurs about her great-aunt being a psychic or a witch, much less a psychic witch. Still, a series of eerie events soon has her convinced that the spirit of a beautiful Quaker is roaming the place, and it seems clear that it will take more than a smile and a wave goodbye to make the spirit leave. If Jane is to move things along, she's going to have to think like an islander. But she's a Boston graphic designer with no experience of the island or its history, and she could use a little local knowledge in her quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no one more local than the aloof, wary, and impossibly seductive Mac McKenzie. Descended from generations of hard-working islanders, Mac has very clear opinions of off-islanders, and he's not afraid to express them. He has little patience for New Age types, moneyed types, and those for whom "antiquing" is a verb. He regards spaghetti as noodles, not pasta, and he drinks water from a tap, not a bottle. He's suspicious of people who design graphics, whatever those are. And he doesn't believe in ghosts. Period. When he finds himself up against the insistent, persistent, infinitely irritating Jane Drew with her knack for complicating his life, he does what any self-respecting islander would and shrugs her off -- for a while, anyway. But Mac understands, as Jane does not, that not every force is benign ... and not every force is otherworldly.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beneath the quiet charm of Martha's Vineyard, trouble is brewing. A beautiful con woman has brought her latest scheme to the exclusive island community and is wreaking havoc with several lives. Talented local artist Holly Anderson has a vested interest in exposing this conniving vixen who brazenly seduced her father into a scandalous affair and a reckless game of theft, blackmail and possible murder. Then there's Sam Steadman, a man with a few secrets of his own. The darkly handsome photographer has come to the island to track down the thief who stole the only worthwhile possession his parents owned. Soon it's clear that Sam and Holly are after the same woman. As their lives and hearts collide, they've got to decide if they're enemies or allies, strangers...or something much, much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn's story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. &lt;i&gt;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means--and what it costs--to face the truth.</description>

  <description>Wendy Hodene wants for nothing except, like every woman, extra closet space. But even that whim lies within reach when she and her devoted husband Jim win the lottery and launch a renovation of the cozy, antique New England home that has been in the family for generations. Wendy is certain life can't get any better than this, until a surprise comes her way--surprise that will change her world forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, winning the lottery jackpot seems to be the answer to the Hodenes' unspoken prayers. Now they can secure their son's college education, pay off debts--perhaps even splurge a little. But the sudden windfall will drastically alter the most reliable reassuring aspects of Wendy's life, as well as the people who master most in it. Now everything hangs in the balance: her home, her child, her marriage. It isn't long before Wendy realizes that the mans he thought she knew best has become a virtual stranger, and that a mans he hardly knows at all holds the key to her husband's startling past--and her family's precarious future...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology and religious iconology, arrives at the ultramodern Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao to attend a major announcement—the unveiling of a discovery that “will change the face of science forever.” The evening’s host is Edmond Kirsch, a forty-year-old billionaire and futurist whose dazzling high-tech inventions and audacious predictions have made him a renowned global figure. Kirsch, who was one of Langdon’s first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence.&lt;p&gt;As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch’s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch’s secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain’s Royal Palace itself... and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch. On a trail marked by modern art and enigmatic symbols, Langdon and Vidal uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch’s shocking discovery... and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A sinister fire in a Copenhagen bookstore ignites a relentless hunt across four continents. Arson and murder reveal an insidious plot to steal a Bible that once belonged to Charles Darwin, the father of evolutionary theory. And Commander Gray Pierce dives headlong into a mystery that dates back to Nazi Germany . . . and to horrific experiments performed in a now-abandoned laboratory buried in a hollowed-out mountain in Poland.&lt;p&gt;A continent away, madness ravages a remote monastery high in Nepal, as Buddhist monks turn to cannibalism and torture. Lisa Cummings, a young American doctor investigating the atrocity, is suddenly a target of a brutal assassin working for clandestine forces that want the affair buried at any cost. Lisa's only ally is a hidden pilgrim, Painter Crowe -- director of SIGMA Force, an elite command of American scientists and Special Forces operatives -- who is already showing signs of the baffling malady that destroyed the minds of the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it is up to Gray Pierce to save both Painter and Lisa -- and a world in jeopardy -- as SIGMA Force races to expose a century-old plot that threatens to destroy the current world order . . . and alter the destiny of humankind forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the historic scope of &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; with the relentless thrills of today's best action novels, James Rollins's &lt;i&gt;Black Order&lt;/i&gt; is a classic adventure -- an ingenious and breathtaking tour de force that explodes with revelations . . . while offering a startling new view of our place in the grand scheme of existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bones lead to ancient mysteries and present-day terror . . . To follow them means death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a crowded service at a cathedral in Germany, armed intruders in monks' robes unleash a nightmare of blood and destruction. But the killers have not come for gold; they seek a more valuable prize: the bones of the Magi who once paid homage to a newborn savior . . . a treasure that could reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Vatican in turmoil, Sigma Force under the command of Grayson Pierce leaps into action, pursuing a deadly mystery that weaves through sites of the Seven Wonders of the World and ends at the doorstep of an ancient, mystical, and terrifying secret order. For there are those with dark plans for the stolen sacred remains that will alter the future of humankind . . . when science and religion unite to unleash a horror not seen since the beginning of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“There are books that are suitable for a million people, others for only a hundred. There are even remedies—I mean books—that were written for one person only…A book is both medic and medicine at once. It makes a diagnosis as well as offering therapy. Putting the right novels to the appropriate ailments: that’s how I sell books.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Monsieur Perdu calls himself a literary apothecary. From his floating bookstore in a barge on the Seine, he prescribes novels for the hardships of life. Using his intuitive feel for the exact book a reader needs, Perdu mends broken hearts and souls. The only person he can't seem to heal through literature is himself; he's still haunted by heartbreak after his great love disappeared. She left him with only a letter, which he has never opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Perdu is finally tempted to read the letter, he hauls anchor and departs on a mission to the south of France, hoping to make peace with his loss and discover the end of the story. Joined by a bestselling but blocked author and a lovelorn Italian chef, Perdu travels along the country’s rivers, dispensing his wisdom and his books, showing that the literary world can take the human soul on a journey to heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internationally bestselling and filled with warmth and adventure, &lt;i&gt;The Little Paris Bookshop&lt;/i&gt; is a love letter to books, meant for anyone who believes in the power of stories to shape people's lives.</description>

  <description>What if the Shadow that destroyed Atlantis 10,000 years ago, comes back to threaten our present world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A war beyond time. An enemy beyond space. A thriller beyond your wildest dreams. Three areas on the Earth’s surface defy explanation: the Bermuda Triangle, the Devil’s Sea of Japan, and a small region of Cambodia. Inside these realms, planes have disappeared, ships have vanished, and, in Cambodia, an entire civilization has been lost leaving behind Angkor Wat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1945, Training Flight 19 disappears in the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;br /&gt;In 1963, the USS Thresher, a nuclear submarine, is lost under unusual circumstances, part of a secret government investigation into mysterious gates.&lt;br /&gt;Near the end of of the Vietnam War, Green Beret Eric Dane led a team of operatives deep into Cambodia and encountered a strange fog near the legendary city of Angkor Kol Ker. His entire team disappears, attacked by strange creatures out of the fog. Only Dane survives to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a plane goes down. In the same area Dane lost his team. He’s called back. To find out who is the darkness behind these gates to our planet. What does this Shadow force want? It is a threat that will take on the world’s greatest military forces and defeat them. A power that will overwhelm our science and technology. A merciless enemy that will lead Dane—and the whole planet—into the final desperate battle for survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Spell-binding! Will keep you on the edge of your seat. Call it techno-thriller, call it science fiction, call it just terrific story-telling.” Terry Brooks, #1 NY Times Bestselling author of the Shannara series and Star Wars Phantom Menace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoyed LOST, you’ll love this book and be amazed at the similarities in concept (although this book was published before Lost).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atlantis Series:&lt;br /&gt;Atlantis&lt;br /&gt;Atlantis Bermuda Triangle&lt;br /&gt;Atlantis Devil's Sea&lt;br /&gt;Atlantis Gate&lt;br /&gt;Assault on Atlantis&lt;br /&gt;Battle for Atlantis</description>

  <description>An inexplicable explosion rocks the antiquities collection of a London museum, setting off alarms in clandestine organizations around the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the search for answers is leading Lady Kara Kensington; her friend Safia al-Maaz, the gallery's brilliant and beautiful curator; and their guide, the international adventurer Omaha Dunn, into a world they never dreamed existed: a lost city buried beneath the Arabian desert. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But others are being drawn there as well, some with dark and sinister purposes. And the many perils of a death-defying trek deep into the savage heart of the Arabian Peninsula pale before the nightmare waiting to be unearthed at journey's end: an ageless and awesome power that could create a utopia... or destroy everything humankind has built over countless millennia.</description>

  <description>All Stevie Bell wanted was to find the key to the Ellingham mystery, but instead she found her classmate dead. And while she solved that murder, the crimes of the past are still waiting in the dark. Just as Stevie feels she’s on the cusp of putting it together, her parents pull her out of Ellingham academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her own safety they say. She must move past this obsession with crime. Now that Stevie’s away from the school of topiaries and secret tunnels, and her strange and endearing friends, she begins to feel disconnected from the rest of the world. At least she won’t have to see David anymore. David, who she kissed. David, who lied to her about his identity—son of despised politician Edward King. Then King himself arrives at her house to offer a deal: He will bring Stevie back to Ellingham immediately. In return, she must play nice with David. King is in the midst of a campaign and can’t afford his son stirring up trouble. If Stevie’s at school, David will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tantalizing riddles behind the Ellingham murders are still waiting to be unraveled, and Stevie knows she’s so close. But the path to the truth has more twists and turns than she can imagine—and moving forward involves hurting someone she cares for. In New York Times bestselling author Maureen Johnson’s second novel of the &lt;i&gt;Truly Devious&lt;/i&gt; series, nothing is free, and someone will pay for the truth with their life.</description>

  <description>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

      <![CDATA[Loved, loved, loved this book! I loved the two different time lines; the expectation of how the two would converge kept me turning the pages. I most loved the vivid descriptions of the marshland, animals, creatures, and environment as a whole. None of it was contrived. It helped the story flow as...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A missing God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A library with the secrets to the universe. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A woman too busy to notice her heart slipping away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn's not so different from the other people around her. She likes guacamole and cigarettes and steak. She knows how to use a phone. Clothes are a bit tricky, but everyone says nice things about her outfit with the Christmas sweater over the gold bicycle shorts. After all, she was a normal American herself once.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a long time ago, of course. Before her parents died. Before she and the others were taken in by the man they called Father. In the years since then, Carolyn hasn't had a chance to get out much. Instead, she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient customs. They've studied the books in his Library and learned some of the secrets of his power. And sometimes, they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God.  Now, Father is missing—perhaps even dead—and the Library that holds his secrets stands unguarded. And with it, control over all of creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her, all of them with powers that far exceed her own. But Carolyn has accounted for this. And Carolyn has a plan. The only trouble is that in the war to make a new God, she's forgotten to protect the things that make her human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Populated by an unforgettable cast of characters and propelled by a plot that will shock you again and again, &lt;i&gt;The Library at Mount Char&lt;/i&gt; is at once horrifying and hilarious, mind-blowingly alien and heartbreakingly human, sweepingly visionary and nail-bitingly thrilling—and signals the arrival of a major new voice in fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What happens if both the president and vice-president-elect die before taking the oath of office? The answer is far from certain—in fact, what follows would be nothing short of total political chaos.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot down over Siberia, ex-Justice Department agent Cotton Malone is forced into a fight for survival against Aleksandr Zorin, a man whose loyalty to the former Soviet Union has festered for decades into an intense hatred of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before escaping, Malone learns that Zorin and another ex-KGB officer, this one a sleeper still embedded in the West, are headed overseas to Washington D.C. Noon on January 20th—Inauguration Day—is only hours away. A flaw in the Constitution, and an even more flawed presidential succession act, have opened the door to disaster and Zorin intends to exploit both weaknesses to their fullest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with a weapon leftover from the Cold War, one long thought to be just a myth, Zorin plans to attack. He’s aided by a shocking secret hidden in the archives of America’s oldest fraternal organization—the Society of Cincinnati—a group that once lent out its military savvy to presidents, including helping to formulate three invasion plans of what was intended to be America’s 14th colony—Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a race against the clock that starts in the frozen extremes of Russia and ultimately ends at the White House itself, Malone must not only battle Zorin, he must also confront a crippling fear that he’s long denied, but which now jeopardizes everything. Steve Berry’s trademark mix of history and speculation is all here in this provocative new thriller.</description>

No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.</description>

  <description>Can she write a world gone wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A certain pen, a certain book, and a certain person can craft entirely new worlds through a branch of science called scriptology. Elsa comes from one such world that was written into creation, where her mother―a noted scriptologist―constantly alters and expands their reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her home is attacked and her mother kidnapped, Elsa is forced to cross into the real world and use her own scriptology gifts to find her. In an alternative Victorian Italy, Elsa finds a secret society of young scientists with a gift for mechanics, alchemy, or scriptology―and meets Leo, a gorgeous mechanist with a smart mouth and tragic past. She recruits the help of these fellow geniuses just as an assassin arrives on their doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this thrilling debut, worlds collide as Elsa unveils a deep political conspiracy seeking to unlock the most dangerous weapon ever created―and only she can stop it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An enchanting urban fantasy middle-grade debut―the first book in a trilogy―set in a magical hotel full of secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphan Elizabeth Somers’s malevolent aunt and uncle ship her off to the ominous Winterhouse Hotel, owned by the peculiar Norbridge Falls. Upon arrival, Elizabeth quickly discovers that Winterhouse has many charms―most notably its massive library. It’s not long before she locates a magical book of puzzles that will unlock a mystery involving Norbridge and his sinister family. But the deeper she delves into the hotel’s secrets, the more Elizabeth starts to realize that she is somehow connected to Winterhouse. As fate would have it, Elizabeth is the only person who can break the hotel’s curse and solve the mystery. But will it be at the cost of losing the people she has come to care for, and even Winterhouse itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystery, adventure, and beautiful writing combine in this exciting debut richly set in a hotel full of secrets.</description>

  <description>For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn’t just a game—it’s a way of life. The obsession started ten years ago and its fan base now spans the globe, some eager to escape from reality and others hoping to make a profit. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. But the bounty hunting world is a competitive one, and survival has not been easy. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships—only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced she’s going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game’s creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. He needs a spy on the inside of this year’s tournament in order to uncover a security problem . . . and he wants Emika for the job. With no time to lose, Emika’s whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she’s only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</description>

  <description>From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Somewhere in France&lt;/em&gt; comes an enthralling historical novel about one of the most famous wedding dresses of the twentieth century—Queen Elizabeth’s wedding gown—and the fascinating women who made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Millions will welcome this joyous event as a flash of color on the long road we have to travel.”&lt;/em&gt;—Sir Winston Churchill on the news of Princess Elizabeth’s forthcoming wedding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London, 1947: Besieged by the harshest winter in living memory, burdened by onerous shortages and rationing, the people of postwar Britain are enduring lives of quiet desperation despite their nation’s recent victory. Among them are Ann Hughes and Miriam Dassin, embroiderers at the famed Mayfair fashion house of Norman Hartnell. Together they forge an unlikely friendship, but their nascent hopes for a brighter future are tested when they are chosen for a once-in-a-lifetime honor: taking part in the creation of Princess Elizabeth’s wedding gown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toronto, 2016: More than half a century later, Heather Mackenzie seeks to unravel the mystery of a set of embroidered flowers, a legacy from her late grandmother. How did her beloved Nan, a woman who never spoke of her old life in Britain, come to possess the priceless embroideries that so closely resemble the motifs on the stunning gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at her wedding almost seventy years before? And what was her Nan’s connection to the celebrated textile artist and holocaust survivor Miriam Dassin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With The Gown&lt;/em&gt;, Jennifer Robson takes us inside the workrooms where one of the most famous wedding gowns in history was created. Balancing behind-the-scenes details with a sweeping portrait of a society left reeling by the calamitous costs of victory, she introduces readers to three unforgettable heroines, their points of view alternating and intersecting throughout its pages, whose lives are woven together by the pain of survival, the bonds of friendship, and the redemptive power of love.</description>

  <description>Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon awakens in an Italian hospital, disoriented and with no recollection of the past thirty-six hours, including the origin of the macabre object hidden in his belongings. With a relentless female assassin trailing them through Florence, he and his resourceful doctor, Sienna Brooks, are forced to flee. Embarking on a harrowing journey, they must unravel a series of codes, which are the work of a brilliant scientist whose obsession with the end of the world is matched only by his passion for one of the most influential masterpieces ever written, Dante Alighieri's The Inferno. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dan Brown has raised the bar yet again, combining classical Italian art, history, and literature with cutting-edge science in this sumptuously entertaining thriller.</description>

  <description>Librarian Martha Storm has always found it easier to connect with books than people--though not for lack of trying. She keeps careful lists of how to help others in her superhero-themed notebook. And yet, sometimes it feels like she's invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that changes when a book of fairy tales arrives on her doorstep. Inside, Martha finds a dedication written to her by her best friend--her grandmother Zelda--who died under mysterious circumstances years earlier. When Martha discovers a clue within the book that her grandmother may still be alive, she becomes determined to discover the truth. As she delves deeper into Zelda's past, she unwittingly reveals a family secret that will change her life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with Phaedra Patrick's signature charm and vivid characters, &lt;em&gt;The Library of Lost and Found&lt;/em&gt; is a heartwarming and poignant tale of how one woman must take control of her destiny to write her own happy ending.</description>

  <description>Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.&lt;p&gt;Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, &lt;i&gt;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&lt;/i&gt; captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. "A place" he said, "where learning is a game."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym, Truly Devious. It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.</description>

  <description>For seventeen-year-old Opal Hopper, code is magic. She builds entire worlds from scratch: Mars craters, shimmering lakes, any virtual experience her heart desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she can't code her dad back into her life. When he disappeared after her tenth birthday, leaving only a cryptic note, Opal tried desperately to find him. And when he never turned up, she enrolled at a boarding school for technical prodigies and tried to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. Because WAVE, the world's biggest virtual reality platform, has announced a contest where the winner gets to meet its billionaire founder. The same billionaire who worked closely with Opal's dad. The one she always believed might know where he went. The one who maybe even murdered him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins as a small data hack to win the contest spirals out of control when Opal goes viral, digging her deeper into a hole of lies, hacks, and manipulation. How far will Opal go for the answers--or is it the attention--she's wanted for years?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She inherited a magical destiny—and a mission to stop a powerful family of dark sorcerers. She never expected to fall in love with one of them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's still so much Daire Santos has to learn about being the last Soul Seeker….and about herself. As her magical training becomes more intense, so does her relationship with Dace. But when she learns that his connection to the evil Richter family goes far deeper than she ever imagined, she begins to question if love really can conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dace is painfully aware that he wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the Richters' dark magic—and now his brother Cade is determined to use his love for Daire against him. Dace is willing to sacrifice anything to protect the girl he loves —including his own life. But will Daire allow it? And what if defeating Cade costs not only his life, but his soul too?</description>

  <description>In a New Jersey suburb, two women die of brain aneurysms within twenty-four hours--events that cause the government to suspect that a terrorist cell has unleashed a deadly biochemical agent. With each glass of water they drink, the people of Trinity Falls are poisoning themselves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A world away in Pakistan, a sixteen-year-old computer genius working as a virtual spy for the United States sees an influx of chatter from extremists about a substance they call Red Vinegar that will lead to many deaths in Colony One. Can he warn the victims before it's too late?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Printz Honor Award winner and two-time Edgar Allan Poe Award finalist, Carol Plum-Ucci explores disturbing new terrain in this riveting novel that examines the heroes and victims involved in a terrifying act of bioterrorism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He is a Legend.&lt;br /&gt;She is a Prodigy.&lt;br /&gt;Who will be Champion?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic—and each other—and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government’s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic’s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country’s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu’s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion.</description>

Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths—until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Cover edition for ISBN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29863705-legend" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780399256752&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alt Cover for ISBN 0380802309&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant Morgan is one of London's most eligible and unattainable bachelors. He's also a powerful member of the Bow Street Runners, and when he's called to the waterfront late one night to investigate a drowning victim, Grant is stunned to recognize the face of Vivien Rose Duvall, a well-known woman of the night. He's even more startled when he realizes that she's alive. With no one to care for her, Grant carries Vivien to his home and revives her, only to learn that she is suffering from amnesia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivien hesitantly accepts her handsome rescuer's claim that she is his mistress, despite her misgivings about her true identity. Nevertheless, she can't deny the marks on her throat that prove her near-drowning in the Thames was not an accident, and now she must trust the man who claims her as his paramour, for her life is in danger. As Grant searches for Vivien's attacker, the two find themselves falling in love, all the while struggling to stay one step ahead of the evil forces that will stop at nothing to see Vivien dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44526809-lord-john-and-the-hand-of-devils" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A keepsake collection of Lord John Grey's shorter adventures and a spectacular addition to any Gabaldon fan's library, &lt;i&gt;Lord John and the Hand of the Devils &lt;/i&gt;brings these three unique novellas together for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lord John and the Hellfire Club&lt;/i&gt; marks the first appearance of Lord John outside the Outlander novels (and chronologically precedes the novel &lt;i&gt;Lord John and the Private Matter&lt;/i&gt;). A young diplomat is killed in the street as he begs Lord John for help. Witnessing the murder, Grey vows to avenge the young man, as the trail leads to the notorious Hellfire Club and the dark caves beneath Medmenham Abbey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lord John and the Succubus&lt;/i&gt;, Grey's assignment as liaison to a Hanoverian regiment in Germany finds him caught between two threats: the advancing French and Austrian army, and the menace of a mysterious 'night-hag,' who spreads fear and death among the troops. Acknowledging that he is unlikely to fall victim to a succubus, Lord John is obliged to contend with the marauding night-hag before the enemy arrives. This tale with a touch of the supernatural bridges the action between Gabaldon's two full-length Lord John tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in &lt;i&gt;Lord John and the Haunted Soldier&lt;/i&gt;, Lord John is called to the Arsenal at Woolwich to answer a Royal Commission of Enquiry's questions regarding a cannon that exploded during the battle of Krefeld (a central action in &lt;i&gt;Lord John and the Brotherhood of the Blade&lt;/i&gt;). Accusations ensue, and Lord John finds himself knee-deep in a morass of gunpowder, treason, and plot-haunted by a dead lieutenant, and followed by a man with no face.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Irene must be at the top of her game or she'll be off the case - permanently...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene is a professional spy for the mysterious Library, which harvests fiction from different realities. And along with her enigmatic assistant Kai, she's posted to an alternative London. Their mission - to retrieve a dangerous book. But when they arrive, it's already been stolen. London's underground factions seem prepared to fight to the very death to find her book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the jeopardy, this world is chaos-infested - the laws of nature bent to allow supernatural creatures and unpredictable magic. Irene's new assistant is also hiding secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, she's up to her eyebrows in a heady mix of danger, clues and secret societies. Yet failure is not an option - the nature of reality itself is at stake.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Fans of Star Wars and &lt;em&gt;Divergent &lt;/em&gt;will revel in internationally bestselling author Veronica Roth’s stunning new science-fiction fantasy series.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a planet where violence and vengeance rule, in a galaxy where some are favored by fate, everyone develops a currentgift, a unique power meant to shape the future. While most benefit from their currentgifts, Akos and Cyra do not—their gifts make them vulnerable to others’ control. Can they reclaim their gifts, their fates, and their lives, and reset the balance of power in this world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyra is the sister of the brutal tyrant who rules the Shotet people. Cyra’s currentgift gives her pain and power—something her brother exploits, using her to torture his enemies. But Cyra is much more than just a blade in her brother’s hand: she is resilient, quick on her feet, and smarter than he knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akos is from the peace-loving nation of Thuvhe, and his loyalty to his family is limitless. Though protected by his unusual currentgift, once Akos and his brother are captured by enemy Shotet soldiers, Akos is desperate to get his brother out alive—no matter what the cost. When Akos is thrust into Cyra’s world, the enmity between their countries and families seems insurmountable. They must decide to help each other to survive—or to destroy one another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Will Robie and Jessica Reel are two of the most lethal people alive. They're the ones the government calls in when the utmost secrecy is required to take out those who plot violence and mass destruction against the United States. And through every mission, one man has always had their backs: their handler, code-named Blue Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, Blue Man is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last seen in rural Colorado, Blue Man had taken a rare vacation to go fly fishing in his hometown when he disappeared off the grid. With no communications since, the team can't help but fear the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent to investigate, Robie and Reel arrive in the small town of Grand to discover that it has its own share of problems. A stagnant local economy and a woefully understaffed police force have made this small community a magnet for crime, drugs, and a growing number of militant fringe groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lying in wait in Grand is an even more insidious and sweeping threat, one that may shake the very foundations of America. And when Robie and Reel find themselves up against an adversary with superior firepower and a home-court advantage, they'll be lucky if they make it out alive, with or without Blue Man...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;To save humanity, they must give up their own.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam's muscular dystrophy has stolen his mobility, his friends, and in a few short years, it will take his life. Virtual reality games are Adam's only escape from his wheelchair. In his alternate world, he can defeat anyone. Running, jumping, scoring touchdowns: Adam is always the hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an artificial intelligence program, Sigma, hacks into Adam's game. Created by Adam's computer-genius father, Sigma has gone rogue, threatening Adam's life-and world domination. Their one chance to stop Sigma is using technology Adam's dad developed to digitally preserve the mind of his dying son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with a select group of other terminally ill teens, Adam becomes one of the Six who have forfeited their bodies to inhabit weaponized robots. But with time running short, the Six must learn to manipulate their new mechanical forms and work together to train for epic combat...before Sigma destroys humanity.</description>

  <description>Alarick Brandon is the powerful wizard who operates The Keep, a refuge for magical people fleeing the persecution of the Ministry. A bitter realist, Alarick knows it’s only a matter of time until the Ministry succeeds in eradicating magic from the world—and exterminating all magical beings—so he has been careful to avoid any personal involvement with the people who pass through his sanctuary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Elissa Stone arrives at The Keep, her village a smoldering ruin, and only her magical talent and a forbidden library left to her name, Alarick’s ordered world descends into chaos. Elissa is a Book Mesmer, a magical talent long believed extinct. She can enchant books, making them indestructible, unreadable…even deadly to unauthorized readers. But while her magic can secure a legacy for future magical generations, it’s not a skill that’s good in a fight, and certainly not one that Alarick sees any real use for. But there’s something compelling about a woman who defies the Ministry’s edicts against female literacy, and she seems determined to prove that knowledge is a weapon in its own right…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first installment in an enticing new fantasy series by author Jennifer Derrick, The Library of Absolution is a compelling story of perseverance and determination in the face of persecution, in a Dark Age where hope is lost—and knowledge is the only thing left to fight for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Games are Forever!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;It’s one thing to Qualify and Compete…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now she must Win.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gwen Lark&lt;/b&gt;, nerd, geek, and awkward smart girl, is among the lucky ones. She’s one of several million teenage refugees to escape the extinction-level asteroid barreling towards Earth and reach the ancient colony planet of &lt;b&gt;Atlantis&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Atlantis is a strange new world with higher gravity and a blazing white sun, where nothing is as expected. The new arrivals from Earth will now belong to the majority class of non-citizens who face a lifetime of hard work and limited rights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, Gwen’s rare and powerful talent, her &lt;b&gt;Logos voice&lt;/b&gt;, is viewed as a potential weapon to be exploited by the &lt;b&gt;Imperator&lt;/b&gt;, as well as a threat to the &lt;b&gt;Kassiopei Imperial Dynasty&lt;/b&gt; and its uncompromising control over the people of Atlantis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A last-minute heartbreak prior to arrival turns to joy, when Gwen receives a declaration of love from an unexpected source. The &lt;b&gt;Wedding date&lt;/b&gt; is set, but before she can be joined with &lt;b&gt;her true love&lt;/b&gt;, she is forced to compete in the brutal and deadly &lt;b&gt;Games of the Atlantis Grail&lt;/b&gt; to save herself, her family, friends, and everything she cares about. Once again, her intelligence, quick thinking skills, resilience, and creativity are challenged to the breaking point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Games are monumental, intricate, lethal . . . and the Games are Forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This time Gwen must fight and figure her way through the most difficult and sophisticated contest she has ever faced. Terrifying Ordeals and impossible Challenges, ruthless skilled Competitors, vicious secret assassins, and dubious teammates she must work with but cannot trust, are just the beginning. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, as the Games rage, the fate of two worlds is at stake as a &lt;b&gt;new alien threat&lt;/b&gt; looms over Earth and Atlantis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Gwen Lark has a secret weapon of her own. It’s not her Logos voice and its untapped power to control orichalcum technology and perpetuate change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is Gwen herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WIN is the third book in The Atlantis Grail series.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's one thing to Qualify…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But do you have what it takes to Compete?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Earth about to be destroyed by an extinction level asteroid, teenage nerd, geek, and awkward smart girl &lt;b&gt;Gwen Lark&lt;/b&gt;, and a few of her friends and loved ones, barely Qualified for rescue onboard one of the thousands of ark-ships headed to the ancient colony planet Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now faced with a year-long journey in space, life in a wondrously alien environment, and many tough life choices, Gwen must decide who or what she will become. Fleet Cadet or Civilian? Friend or lover? Average or extraordinary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she make new friends? Can she trust the old ones, such as &lt;b&gt;Logan Sangre&lt;/b&gt;, her sexy high school crush and an Earth special operative?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time and time again, Gwen's uncanny ability to come up with the best answer in a crisis saves her life and others. And now, her unique Logos voice makes her an extremely valuable commodity to the Atlanteans -- so much so that her enigmatic commanding officer &lt;b&gt;Aeson Kassiopei&lt;/b&gt;, who is also the Imperial Prince of Atlantis, has taken an increasingly personal interest in her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the end of the journey, Gwen must convince him that she has what it takes to compete in the deadly &lt;b&gt;Games of the Atlantis Grail&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's becoming apparent -- the life of her family and all of Earth depends on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;COMPETE is the second book in The Atlantis Grail series.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;You have two options. You die, or you Qualify.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2047. An extinction-level asteroid is hurtling toward Earth, and the descendants of ancient Atlantis have returned from the stars in their silver ships to offer humanity help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's a catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can only take a tiny percent of the Earth's population back to the colony planet Atlantis. And in order to be chosen, you must be a teen, you must be bright, talented, and athletic, and you must &lt;b&gt;Qualify&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old &lt;b&gt;Gwenevere Lark&lt;/b&gt; is determined not only to Qualify but to rescue her entire family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there's a loophole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are good enough to Qualify, you are eligible to compete in the brutal games of the &lt;b&gt;Atlantis Grail&lt;/b&gt;, which grants all winners the laurels, high tech luxuries, and full privileges of Atlantis Citizenship. And if you are in the &lt;b&gt;Top Ten&lt;/b&gt;, then all your wildest wishes are granted... Such as curing your mother's cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gwen Lark&lt;/b&gt; is known as a klutz and a nerd. While she's a hotshot in classics, history, science, and languages, the closest she's come to sports is a backyard pool and a skateboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time she is in over her head, and in for a fight of her life, against impossible odds and world-class competition--including &lt;b&gt;Logan Sangre&lt;/b&gt;, the most amazing guy in her school, the one she's been crushing on, and who doesn't seem to know she exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because every other teen on Earth has the same idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;You Qualify or you die&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>When the Great Famine threatened the existence of mankind, the Creators saved humanity. Humanity has been their loyal subject ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This history has been ingrained in seventeen-year-old Dara Morrow since her first day of Creator-sponsored school. Grateful for the life-giving necessities her Creator provides, Dara is thrilled to be one of three students chosen for an elite, year-long apprenticeship program. Now is her chance to prove herself a devoted Contributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Dara’s competition is ruthless and will stop at nothing to win the competition. Worse yet, her exacting master has little patience for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Dara’s mother is seriously injured, and Dara realizes the price of being a Contributor: once you’ve outlived your usefulness, you’re discarded. Can Dara learn to manipulate the system to save not only herself, but everyone she loves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contributor is the first book in the YA dystopian Contributor trilogy.</description>

  <description>Surviving her apprenticeship was just the first step. Now that Dara has joined the Free Thinkers, her life is about to become much more dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Frustrated by her seemingly pointless efforts to prove her worth to the Free Thinkers, she wonders if she made the right choice. Yet she can’t go back to her old life, can’t forgive Magnum for what it did to her mother. Then she discovers a crucial piece of intelligence: Andersen has been hard at work on a clandestine project that’s caught the attention of the Creators. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At last Dara is made a Free Thinker operative, trained and taught the truth about the Great Famine and its aftermath, but she must conceal her knowledge at all cost. Andersen must believe she’s no more than the sacrificial lamb he thinks she is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as the Creators’ interest in the project deepens, Dara is placed under surveillance and cut off from her Free Thinker lifeline. When she makes one last, desperate attempt at exposing his secret project, the repercussions are enormous.</description>

  <description>The final book in the post-apocalyptic and dystopian young adult/new adult Contributor trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disillusioned and angry at the revelation of the Free Thinkers’ secret patron, Dara isn’t sure whether her decision to join them was the right choice. Guilt over Letizia’s loss plagues her, and she feels betrayed by one of the few people in whom she placed her trust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjusting to life outside of the domes hasn’t been easy over the past six months, especially because the Free Thinkers’ progress is so frustratingly slow. Nothing has changed, and she doesn’t know how much longer she can deny her searing need for vengeance, or even whether she should place her faith in the Free Thinkers. The more the truth about both them and the Creators is revealed, the less certain she is that the two are all that different. What if she handed them the incriminating evidence they need to exploit to ensure a future that looks a lot like what the Creators envisioned?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Dara has never been more certain of one thing: the Creators must pay—for what they did to her mother, for what they did to Letizia, and for what they’ve done to humanity.</description>

  <description>Don't miss the heartwarming, laugh-out-loud conclusion of The Crown Jewels Romantic Comedy Trilogy for fans of both Bridget Jones and The Shopaholic… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After one year of marriage, Crown Prince Arthur and his lovely, albeit accident-prone wife, Princess Tessa, are preparing to bring an heir to the tiny kingdom of Avonia. With all eyes on Tessa, she's determined to be one of those fabulously fit pregnant women. She could do it too if it weren't for all the freshly-baked scones. Soon dubbed the Cowntess of Camembert, Tessa wants to go into hiding until after the baby is born, but royal life won't wait, and she needs to figure out how to make the best of a desperate situation and win the people over once and for all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Prince Author never thought he'd find himself involved in horribly awkward conversations about the first day of his wife's last period, but that's precisely what happens after that plus sign shows up on the pregnancy test. With a baby on the way, Arthur’s overprotective streak comes out in spades, and he finds himself attributing ill-intentions to everyone he meets, from the vagina-fixated obstetricians to the potential pedos everywhere. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Arthur calm down in time to welcome the baby? Will Tessa manage to figure out how to be mother to the kingdom’s next heir? And most importantly, will the happy couple still be happy when the baby arrives?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Don't miss the irresistibly funny conclusion of The Crown Jewels Romantic Comedy Duo for fans of both &lt;i&gt;Bridget Jones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Princess Diaries&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When most girls get engaged, at most they face a disapproving mother-in-law, but in Tessa Sharpe’s case, it’s a disapproving nation. No one in the tiny kingdom of Avonia wants the former anti-royal blogger to wed Prince Arthur. The anti-royals haven’t forgiven her for abandoning ship and swimming over to the Prince’s yacht, and the royal watchers won’t ever forget all the horrible things she wrote about their beloved Royal Family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up against all odds, Tessa has only six months to prove herself worthy of the title of Princess. Her nasty father-in-law is going to throw every obstacle in her way, including the beautiful, poised, and highly accomplished Lady Doctor Brooke Beddingfield. But Tessa is determined to make this work and keep her fledgling career as a reporter intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Tessa manage to fight her way down the aisle and find her Prince Charming waiting? Or will one of them succumb to mounting pressure and run the other way before they can say I do?</description>

  <description>Ultra-private, ridiculously handsome Crown Prince Arthur has always gotten by on his charm. But that won’t be enough now that the Royal Family is about to be ousted from power once and for all. When Prince Arthur has to rely on the one woman in the kingdom who hates him most, he must learn that earning the love of a nation means first risking his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight-year-old Tessa Sharpe, a.k.a. The Royal Watchdog, hates everything about Prince Arthur. As far as she’s concerned, he’s an arrogant, lazy leech on the kingdom of Avonia. When he shocks the nation by giving her the keys to the castle, Tessa has no choice but to accept and move in for two months. It’s lust at first sight, but there’s no way she can give in to her feelings—not if she wants to have a career or a shred of pride left when her time at the palace ends… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can two natural enemies find their forever in each other’s arms, or will they ruin each other to save themselves? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;Jerusalem Maiden&lt;/i&gt; comes a mesmerizing, thought-provoking novel that tells the riveting story of an American woman--the daughter of Holocaust survivors--who travels to Russia shortly after the fall of communism, and finds herself embroiled in a perilous mafia conspiracy that could irrevocably destroy her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke Fielding, a thirty-eight year old New York investment manager and daughter of Jewish Holocaust survivors, finds her life suddenly upended in late September 1993 when her job is unexpectedly put in jeopardy. Brooke accepts an invitation to join a friend on a mission to Moscow to teach entrepreneurial skills to Russian business women, which will also give her a chance to gain expertise in the new, vast emerging Russian market. Though excited by the opportunity to save her job and be one of the first Americans to visit Russia after the fall of communism, she also wonders what awaits her in the country that persecuted her mother just a generation ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the women she meets, Brooke becomes committed to helping them investigate the crime that threatens their businesses. But as the uprising of the Russian parliament against President Boris Yeltsin turns Moscow into a volatile war zone, Brooke will find that her involvement comes at a high cost. For in a city where "capitalism" is still a dirty word, where neighbors spy on neighbors and the new economy is in the hands of a few dangerous men, nothing Brooke does goes unnoticed--and a mistake in her past may now compromise her future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A moving, poignant, and rich novel, Hotel Moscow is an eye-opening portrait of post-communist Russia and a profound exploration of faith, family, and heritage.</description>

  <description>In an enthralling new historical novel from national bestselling author Kate Quinn, two women—a female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional American socialite searching for her cousin in 1947—are brought together in a mesmerizing story of courage and redemption. &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1947.&lt;/em&gt; In the chaotic aftermath of World War II, American college girl Charlie St. Clair is pregnant, unmarried, and on the verge of being thrown out of her very proper family. She's also nursing a desperate hope that her beloved cousin Rose, who disappeared in Nazi-occupied France during the war, might still be alive. So when Charlie's parents banish her to Europe to have her "little problem" taken care of, Charlie breaks free and heads to London, determined to find out what happened to the cousin she loves like a sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1915&lt;/em&gt;. A year into the Great War, Eve Gardiner burns to join the fight against the Germans and unexpectedly gets her chance when she's recruited to work as a spy. Sent into enemy-occupied France, she's trained by the mesmerizing Lili, the "Queen of Spies", who manages a vast network of secret agents right under the enemy's nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty years later, haunted by the betrayal that ultimately tore apart the Alice Network, Eve spends her days drunk and secluded in her crumbling London house. Until a young American barges in uttering a name Eve hasn't heard in decades, and launches them both on a mission to find the truth...no matter where it leads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In modern-day Britain, magic users control everything: wealth, politics, power—and you. If you’re not one of the ultimate one-percenters—the magical elite—you owe them ten years of service. Do those years when you’re old, and you’ll never get through them. Do them young, and you’ll never get over them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the darkly decadent world of &lt;i&gt;Gilded Cage&lt;/i&gt;. In its glittering milieu move the all-powerful Jardines and the everyday Hadleys. The families have only one thing in common: Each has three children. But their destinies entwine when one family enters the service of the other. They will all discover whether any magic is more powerful than the human spirit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have a quick ten years. . . .</description>

Jess Brightwell has put himself in direct peril, with only his wits and skill to aid him in a game of cat and mouse with the Archivist Magister of the Great Library. With the world catching fire, and words printed on paper the spark that lights rebellion, it falls to smugglers, thieves, and scholars to save a library thousands of years in the making...if they can stay alive long enough to outwit their enemies.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Words can kill.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hoarding all the knowledge of the world, the Great Library jealously guards its secrets. But now a group of rebels poses a dangerous threat to its tyranny…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jess Brightwell and his band of exiles have fled London, only to find themselves imprisoned in Philadelphia, a city led by those who would rather burn books than submit. But Jess and his friends have a bargaining chip: the knowledge to build a machine that will break the Library’s rule.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their time is running out. To survive, they’ll have to choose to live or die as one, to take the fight to their enemies—and to save the very soul of the Great Library…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Let the world burn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an iron fist, the Great Library controls the knowledge of the world, ruthlessly stamping out all rebellion and, in the name of the greater good, forbidding the personal ownership of books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess Brightwell has survived his introduction to the sinister, seductive world of the Library, but serving in its army is nothing like he envisioned. His life and the lives of those he cares for have been altered forever. His best friend is lost, and Morgan, the girl he loves, is locked away in the Iron Tower, doomed to a life apart from everything she knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After embarking on a mission to save one of their own, Jess and his band of allies make one wrong move and suddenly find themselves hunted by the Library’s deadly automata and forced to flee Alexandria, all the way to London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jess’s home isn’t safe anymore. The Welsh army is coming, London is burning, and soon, Jess must choose between his friends, his family, and the Library, which is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone in the search for ultimate control…</description>

  <description>Ruthless and supremely powerful, the Great Library is now a presence in every major city, governing the flow of knowledge to the masses. Alchemy allows the Library to deliver the content of the greatest works of history instantly—but the personal ownership of books is expressly forbidden.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jess Brightwell believes in the value of the Library, but the majority of his knowledge comes from illegal books obtained by his family, who are involved in the thriving black market. Jess has been sent to be his family’s spy, but his loyalties are tested in the final months of his training to enter the Library’s service.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When his friend inadvertently commits heresy by creating a device that could change the world, Jess discovers that those who control the Great Library believe that knowledge is more valuable than any human life—and soon both heretics and books will burn…</description>

  <description>Set in London during the swinging sixties and Italy’s Amalfi coast after Word War II, &lt;i&gt;The Last Voyage&lt;/i&gt; of the Valentina is an epic romance with a dark uncercurrent of suspense from an author the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; (UK) has declared “is the new Rosamunde Pilcher.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exotically beautiful but desperately unhappy, Alba lives on a houseboat on the Thames, where she enjoys a life of leisure and entertains an endless and unfulfilling succession of lovers. But then she discovers a portrait of her dead mother, Valentina—a woman she'd hardly known, whose story has been kept from her by her still grieving father. Determined to learn the truth about Valentina, Alba returns to the olive groves of the Amalfi coast of Italy. There she uncovers a mysterious tale of decadence, deception, murder, and betrayal involving partisans and Nazis, peasants, and counts. Alba's journey leads her not only to the truth of her mother’s hidden past but to the possibility of happiness in her own future.</description>

  <description>In this exhilarating cross between The Da Vinci Code and The Birth of Venus, an irrepressible young woman in 15th-century Italy must flee for her life after stumbling upon a deadly secret when she serves as a model for Botticelli...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When part-time model and full-time prostitute Luciana Vetra is asked by one of her most exalted clients to pose for a painter friend, she doesn't mind serving as the model for the central figure of Flora in Sandro Botticelli's masterpiece "Primavera." But when the artist dismisses her without payment, Luciana impulsively steals an unfinished version of the painting--only to find that somone is ready to kill her to get it back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could possibly be so valuable about the picture? As friends and clients are slaughtered around her, Luciana turns to the one man who has never desired her beauty, novice librarian Brother Guido. Fleeing Venice together, Luciana and Guido race through the nine cities of Renaissance Italy, pursued by ruthless foes who are determined to keep them from decoding the painting's secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloriously fresh and vivid, with a deliciously irreverent heroine, The Botticelli Secret is an irresistible blend of history, wit, and suspense.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Let Elizabeth Adler sweep you away to the dramatic cliffs and azure waters of &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Italy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;'s Amalfi coast, in this &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling novel of secrets, memories, and love…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The secrets of her past lie in &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Italy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lamour Harrington's husband died two years ago. It is the second time she has lost a man she loved to a tragedy: her father died in a mysterious boating accident when she was seventeen. When a devastating discovery about her husband's death leaves Lamour feeling stunned and betrayed, she returns to the house on the lush Amalfi coast where she'd lived with her father during the happiest years of her childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;and so does unexpected love…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the house of her memories has secrets all its own, forcing her to face new truths about another man she once loved. Was her father's death truly accidental? Or was he hiding something that caused his early demise? Torn between two mysterious and compelling men who have now entered her life, Lamour discovers that the past has a way of returning when you least expect it. And someone wants to ensure that Lamour doesn't uncover the secrets of this idyllic, dreamy coastal getaway. As the past and the present collide in a shattering and suspenseful climax, Lamour must face the things she fears the most, in order to find the courage to live life to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Magnificent!"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Affaire de Coeur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Adler's colorful descriptions of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Italy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; are as enticing as the story. Romance and mystery fill this magnetic novel, perfect escapist fare."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>"But you do," he went on, not waiting for contradiction. "You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it ..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy has her rigid, middle-class life mapped out for her, until she visits Florence with her uptight cousin Charlotte, and finds her neatly ordered existence thrown off balance. Her eyes are opened by the unconventional characters she meets at the Pension Bertolini: flamboyant romantic novelist Eleanor Lavish, the Cockney Signora, curious Mr Emerson and, most of all, his passionate son George.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy finds herself torn between the intensity of life in Italy and the repressed morals of Edwardian England, personified in her terminally dull fiancé Cecil Vyse. Will she ever learn to follow her own heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The White Goddess: An Encounter&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerising tale of sex, lies and divided loyalties. Set between the magic of a bohemian Majorca and the horror of Franco's Madrid, it is a haunting evocation of a lost time and place, dominated by the extraordinary power of Robert Graves, one of the 20th century’s greatest writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 10-year-old Simon Gough went to Majorca in 1953 he thought he had landed in paradise. Far from the misery of his English boarding school and his parent’s divorce, he fell in love – with the tiny village of Deya, with his wild cousin Juan and most of all with his beloved ”Grand-Uncle” Robert Graves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he returned in 1960, paradise had been overrun by beatniks and marijuana – and Simon liked it all the more. But soon he fell for the enchanting Margot Callas, Robert Graves' muse. He found himself entangled in a web of lies and deceit and playing a game whose rules he didn’t understand. The repercussions would haunt him for the rest of his life.</description>

  <description>For the Posts, a two-week trip to the Balearic island of Mallorca with their extended family and friends is a celebration: Franny and Jim are observing their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, and their daughter, Sylvia, has graduated from high school. The sunlit island, its mountains and beaches, its tapas and tennis courts, also promise an escape from the tensions simmering at home in Manhattan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all does not go according to plan: over the course of the vacation, secrets come to light, old and new humiliations are experienced, childhood rivalries resurface, and ancient wounds are exacerbated.</description>

  <description>“Montalbán writes with authority and compassion—a le Carré-like sorrow.”—&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights go out during a meeting of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party; Fernando Garrido, the general secretary, has been murdered. Pepe Carvalho, who has worked for both the party and the CIA, is well-suited to track down Garrido’s murderer. This, the best-known title in the Pepe Carvalho series, features everything that is wonderful about the books: sex, politics and a most vivid sense of Spain.</description>

  <description>¿Qué ocurre cuando Pablo Baloo Miralles, treintañero inadaptado y vacilón, holgazán, misógino, prostibulario, además de pariente pobre y conocido filósofo en la Red, se topa de hocicos con el misterio en un barrio pijo de Barcelona?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bordo de un deportivo con aire de pantera Bagheera, y con un humor inteligente, excéntrico y mordaz, Miralles nos conduce por una intrigante trama salpicada de alegrías etílicas, escarceos venéreos y páginas Web de dudoso contenido: el esclarecimiento de la repentina desaparición de su hermano, The First, presidente de Miralles &amp;amp; Miralles, la prospera empresa familiar. ¿Una fuga con la amante?, ¿la venganza de algún competidor estafado?, ¿un secuestro? Siempre de la mano de este tan impresentable como simpático Baloo de entre siglos, conoceremos a muchos personajes pintorescos: Gloria, la cuñada alcohólica con veleidades literarias; el patriarca Miralles, «difícil síntesis entre Winston Churchill y Jesús Gil»; el iracundo John, profesor de ontología en Dublín y coautor de una Teoría de la Realidad Inventada a medio postular; o la inefable Fina, heroína naïf de busto meritorio, cuyas aspiraciones románticas sobreviven a cualquier desaire. Pero lo que empezó como una misteriosa desaparición irá adquiriendo calidades oníricas y terminará llevando a nuestro Pablo Baloo hasta la Fortaleza: una invisible ciudadela incardinada en la entraña misma de esta nueva Barcelona de los prodigios.</description>

  <description>With his trademark elegance and intelligence Robert Harris recreates a world on the brink of disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire's richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world's largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta's sixty-mile main line—somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attilius—decent, practical, and incorruptible—promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Gabriel Allon, art restorer and spy, has been widely acclaimed as one of the most fascinating characters in the genre and now he is about to face the greatest challenge of his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Allon is recovering from a grueling showdown with a Palestinian master terrorist, when a figure from his past arrives in Jerusalem. Monsignor Luigi Donati is the private secretary to His Holiness Pope Paul VII, and a man as ruthless as he is intelligent. Now, however, he has come to seek Allon's help. A young Swiss guard has been found dead in St. Peter's Basilica, and although Donati has allowed the official inquiry to determine that it is suicide, his instinct tells him that it is murder-and that his master is in grave danger. He has trusted Allon in the past, and he is the only man he trusts now.&lt;p&gt;Allon reluctantly agrees to get involved, but once he begins to investigate he concludes that Donati has every right to be concerned, as, following the trail from the heart of the Vatican to the valleys of Switzerland and beyond, he slowly unravels a conspiracy of lies and deception. An extraordinary enemy walks among them, with but one goal: the most spectacular assassination ever attempted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Barcelona, 1945. Just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother’s face. To console his only child, Daniel’s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona’s guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel’s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, 'The Shadow of the Wind', by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax’s work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn’t find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.</description>

  <description>XIV century. The city of Barcelona is at its moment of greatest prosperity; has grown towards the Ribera, the humble neighborhood of fishermen, whose inhabitants decide to build, with the money of some and the effort of others, the largest Maria cathedral ever known.&lt;br /&gt;A construction that moves parallel to the hazardous story of Arnau, son of a peasant serf, who flees from the abuses of his feudal lord and takes refuge in Barcelona, ​​where he becomes a citizen and, with it, a free man.&lt;br /&gt;While his best friend and adopted brother Joan studies to become a priest, young Arnau becomes a member of the guild of the stone-workers, soldier and moneychanger. A strenuous life which leads him from the misery of the fugitive to nobility and wealth. But with this privileged position he also gets the envy of his peers, who devise a sordid plot that puts his life in the hands of the Inquisition. He finds himself face-to-face with his own brother. Will he lose his life just as his beloved Cathedral of the Sea is finally completed?</description>

  <description>BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Steve Berry’s &lt;i&gt;The Emperor’s Tomb &lt;/i&gt;and a Cotton Malone dossier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cotton Malone retired from the high-risk world of elite operatives for the U.S. Justice Department to lead the low-key life of a rare-book dealer. But his quiet existence is shattered when he receives an anonymous e-mail: “You have something I want. You’ re the only person on earth who knows where to find it. Go get it. You have 72 hours. If I don’t hear from you, you will be childless.” His horrified ex-wife confirms that the threat is real: Their teenage son has been kidnapped. When Malone’s Copenhagen bookshop is burned to the ground, it becomes brutally clear that those responsible will stop at nothing to get what they want. And what they want is nothing less than the lost Library of Alexandria.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A cradle of ideas–historical, philosophical, literary, scientific, and religious–the Library of Alexandria was unparalleled in the world. But fifteen hundred years ago, it vanished into the mists of myth and legend–its vast bounty of wisdom coveted ever since by scholars, fortune hunters, and those who believe its untold secrets hold the key to ultimate power.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now a cartel of wealthy international moguls, bent on altering the course of history, is desperate to breach the library’s hallowed halls–and only Malone possesses the information they need to succeed. At stake is an explosive ancient document with the potential not only to change the destiny of the Middle East but to shake the world’s three major religions to their very foundations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Pursued by a lethal mercenary, Malone crosses the globe in search of answers. His quest will lead him to England and Portugal, even to the highest levels of American government–and the shattering outcome, deep in the Sinai desert, will have worldwide repercussions.</description>

  <description>IT HAPPENED FAST.&lt;br /&gt;THIRTY-TWO MINUTES FOR ONE WORLD TO DIE, ANOTHER TO BE BORN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S. government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear--of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he's done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. Wolgast is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors, but for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey--spanning miles and decades--toward the time an place where she must finish what should never have begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger. Its inventive storytelling, masterly prose, and depth of human insight mark it as a crucial and transcendent work of modern fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An ingenious, fast-paced historical thriller from the author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Last Templar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cold, bleak day in 1916, all hell breaks loose in a mining pit in the Ural Mountains. Overcome by a strange paranoia, the miners attack one another, savagely and ferociously. Minutes later, two men—a horrified scientist and Grigory Rasputin, trusted confidant of the tsar—hit a detonator, blowing up the mine to conceal all evidence of the carnage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the present day, FBI agent Sean Reilly’s search for Reed Corrigan, the CIA mindcontrol spook who brainwashed Reilly’s son, takes a backseat to a new, disturbing case. A Russian embassy attaché seems to have committed suicide by jumping out of a fourth-floor window in Queens. The apartment’s owners, a retired physics teacher from Russia and his wife, have gone missing, and further investigation reveals that the former may not be who the FBI believe him to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joined by Russian Federal Security Service agent Larisa Tchoumitcheva, Reilly’s investigation of the old man’s identity will uncover a desperate search for a small, mysterious device, with consequences that reach back in time and which, in the wrong hands, could have a devastating impact on the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with the twists, intrigue, and excitement that Khoury’s many fans have come to expect, &lt;i&gt;Rasputin’s Shadow&lt;/i&gt; will keep readers turning pages long into the night.</description>

  <description>"It has served us well, this myth of Christ."&lt;br /&gt;Pope Leo X, 16th Century&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a hail of fire and flashing sword, as the burning city of Acre falls from the hands of the West in 1291, The Last Templar opens with a young Templar knight, his mentor, and a handful of others escaping to the sea carrying a mysterious chest entrusted to them by the Order's dying Grand Master. The ship vanishes without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In present day Manhattan, four masked horsemen dressed as Templar Knights emerge from Central Park and ride up the Fifth Avenue steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art during the blacktie opening of a Treasures of the Vatican exhibit. Storming through the crowds, the horsemen brutally attack anyone standing between them and their prize. Attending the gala, archaeologist Tess Chaykin watches in silent terror as the leader of the horsemen hones in on one piece in particular, a strange geared device. He utters a few cryptic Latin words as he takes hold of it with reverence before leading the horsemen out and disappearing into the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath, an FBI investigation is led by anti-terrorist specialist Sean Reilly. Soon, he and Tess are drawn into the dark, hidden history of the crusading Knights, plunging them into a deadly game of cat and mouse with ruthless killers as they race across three continents to recover the lost secret of the Templars.</description>

  <description>A Chinese plot to destroy the US economy...&lt;br /&gt;The growing threat of war with Iran...&lt;br /&gt;One man's race to protect America, and save his brother...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The origin of bitcoin, the world’s first widely adopted digital currency, is shrouded in mystery. Its founder has not been heard from since 2011. Yet as global financial markets suffer, several nations agree to start backing their currencies with bitcoin in a desperate attempt to stabilize their economies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soon-to-open Dubai Financial Exchange will make this possible. Financed by the Chinese megabank, the AIIB, and pushed by Cheng Jinshan, a powerful Chinese investor, the dawn of a new era of global currency trade is upon the world. But if Jinshan’s plan works, the value of the US dollar – and the American economy with it – will tumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weeks before the Dubai Financial Exchange opens, a US Navy destroyer sinks an Iranian patrol craft during a controversial exchange in the Persian Gulf. With tensions soaring between the two nations, an Iranian politician secretly contacts the CIA with a chilling revelation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chase Manning is a rugged ex-SEAL working for the CIA’s Special Operations Group in the Middle East. Now, he is tasked with uncovering the truth behind the Iranian claims before it is too late. But in the midst of battling deadly assassins and uncovering the layers of intrigue surrounding the bitcoin-backed currency, Chase discovers that his own brother, David Manning, is right at the heart of the conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The War Stage is the sequel to The War Planners*</description>

Deception and misinformation are everywhere. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, in order to save America, the leaders in the CIA and Pentagon have set up a secretive task force at the CIA headquarters.

David Manning is brought in to the CIA task force. Chase Manning is sent to team up with a US Marine Corps special operations unit. Admiral Manning leads the USS Ford Carrier Strike Group, filled with America's latest and greatest naval technology. And Lieutenant Commander Victoria Manning is the officer in charge of a helicopter detachment on the navy destroyer, the USS Farragut - the only ship that stands in the way of a Chinese onslaught. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Filled with pulse-pounding action, well-rounded characters, and unpredictable twists, Pawns of the Pacific delivers a satisfying third chapter to The War Planners series. &lt;br /&gt;--------------- &lt;br /&gt;The War Planners series is best enjoyed when read in the correct order.

  <description>In an expensive London restaurant Julia Lovat receives a gift that will change her life. It appears to be a book of exquisite 17th-century embroidery patterns but on closer examination Julia finds it also contains faint diary entries. In these, Cat Tregenna, an embroideress, tells how she and others were stolen out of a Cornish church in 1625 by Muslim pirates and taken on a brutal voyage to Morocco to be auctioned off as slaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captivated by this dramatic discovery, Julia sets off to North Africa to determine the authenticity of the book and to uncover more of Cat’s story. There, in the company of a charismatic Moroccan guide, amid the sultry heat, the spice markets, and exotic ruins, Julia discovers buried secrets. And in Morocco – just as Cat did before her – she loses her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost 400 years apart, the stories of the two women converge in an extraordinary and haunting manner that will make readers wonder – is history fated to repeat itself?</description>

  <description>In the dawning light of a late-summer morning, the people of lower Manhattan stand hushed, staring up in disbelief at the Twin Towers. It is August 1974, and a mysterious tightrope walker is running, dancing, leaping between the towers, suspended a quarter mile above the ground. In the streets below, a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary in bestselling novelist Colum McCann’s stunningly intricate portrait of a city and its people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the Great World Spin&lt;/b&gt; is the critically acclaimed author’s most ambitious novel yet: a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain, loveliness, mystery, and promise of New York City in the 1970s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corrigan, a radical young Irish monk, struggles with his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx. A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died in Vietnam, only to discover just how much divides them even in grief. A young artist finds herself at the scene of a hit-and-run that sends her own life careening sideways. Tillie, a thirty-eight-year-old grandmother, turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter, determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elegantly weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann’s powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city’s people, unexpectedly drawn together by hope, beauty, and the “artistic crime of the century.” A sweeping and radical social novel, &lt;b&gt;Let the Great World Spin&lt;/b&gt; captures the spirit of America in a time of transition, extraordinary promise, and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence. Hailed as a “fiercely original talent” (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.</description>

  <description>A Cotton Malone adventure involving a flaw in the United States Constitution, a mystery about Abraham Lincoln, and a political issue that’s as explosive as it is timely—not only in Malone’s world, but in ours.&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;September 1861: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;All is not as it seems.&lt;/i&gt;With these cryptic words, a shocking secret passed down from president to president comes to rest in the hands of Abraham Lincoln. And as the first bloody clashes of the Civil War unfold, Lincoln alone must decide how best to use this volatile knowledge: save thousands of American lives, or keep the young nation from being torn apart forever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The present: &lt;/b&gt;In Utah, the fabled remains of Mormon pioneers whose nineteenth-century expedition across the desert met with a murderous end have been uncovered. In Washington, D.C., the official investigation of an international entrepreneur, an elder in the Mormon church, has sparked a political battle between the White House and a powerful United States senator. In Denmark, a Justice Department agent, missing in action, has fallen into the hands of a dangerous zealot—a man driven by divine visions to make a prophet’s words reality. And in a matter of a few short hours, Cotton Malone has gone from quietly selling books at his shop in Denmark to dodging bullets in a high-speed boat chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All it takes is a phone call from his former boss in Washington, and suddenly the ex-agent is racing to rescue an informant carrying critical intelligence. It’s just the kind of perilous business that Malone has been trying to leave behind, ever since he retired from the Justice Department. But once he draws enemy blood, Malone is plunged into a deadly conflict—a constitutional war secretly set in motion more than two hundred years ago by America’s Founding Fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the streets of Copenhagen to the catacombs of Salzburg to the rugged mountains of Utah, the grim specter of the Civil War looms as a dangerous conspiracy gathers power. Malone risks life, liberty, and his greatest love in a race for the truth about Abraham Lincoln—while the fate of the United States of America hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The ancient order of the Knights Templar possessed untold wealth and absolute power over kings and popes . . . until the Inquisition, when they were wiped from the face of the earth, their hidden riches lost. But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was–and its true nature could change the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts–and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he’d left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton’s former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who’s far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she’s not alone. Competing for the historic prize–and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses–is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake. At the end of a lethal game of conquest, rife with intrigue, treachery, and craven lust for power, lies a shattering discovery that could rock the civilized world–and, in the wrong hands, bring it to its knees.</description>

  <description>Writing at the height of her narrative and imaginative gifts, Sue Monk Kidd presents a masterpiece of hope, daring, the quest for freedom, and the desire to have a voice in the world—and it is now the newest Oprah’s Book Club 2.0 selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hetty “Handful” Grimke, an urban slave in early nineteenth century Charleston, yearns for life beyond the suffocating walls that enclose her within the wealthy Grimke household. The Grimke’s daughter, Sarah, has known from an early age she is meant to do something large in the world, but she is hemmed in by the limits imposed on women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidd’s sweeping novel is set in motion on Sarah’s eleventh birthday, when she is given ownership of ten year old Handful, who is to be her handmaid. We follow their remarkable journeys over the next thirty five years, as both strive for a life of their own, dramatically shaping each other’s destinies and forming a complex relationship marked by guilt, defiance, estrangement and the uneasy ways of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the stories build to a riveting climax, Handful will endure loss and sorrow, finding courage and a sense of self in the process. Sarah will experience crushed hopes, betrayal, unrequited love, and ostracism before leaving Charleston to find her place alongside her fearless younger sister, Angelina, as one of the early pioneers in the abolition and women’s rights movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the historical figure of Sarah Grimke, Kidd goes beyond the record to flesh out the rich interior lives of all of her characters, both real and invented, including Handful’s cunning mother, Charlotte, who courts danger in her search for something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This exquisitely written novel is a triumph of storytelling that looks with unswerving eyes at a devastating wound in American history, through women whose struggles for liberation, empowerment, and expression will leave no reader unmoved.</description>

  <description>In Whitehall, Giles Barrington discovers the truth about his wife Karin from the Cabinet Secretary. Is she a spy or a pawn in a larger game? Harry Clifton sets out to write his magnum opus, while his wife Emma completes her ten years as Chairman of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and receives an unexpected call from Margaret Thatcher offering her a job. Sebastian Clifton becomes chairman of Farthings Kaufman bank, but only after Hakim Bishara has to resign for personal reasons. Sebastian and Samantha's talented daughter Jessica is expelled from the Slade School of Fine Art, but her aunt Grace comes to her rescue. Meanwhile, Lady Virginia is about to flee the country to avoid her creditors when the Duchess of Hertford dies, and she sees another opportunity to clear her debts and finally trump the Cliftons and Barringtons.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;A bomb goes off, but how many passengers on the MV Buckingham have lost their lives? You will find out only if you read the opening chapter of &lt;i&gt;Mightier than the Sword&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;When Harry arrives in New York, his publisher Harold Guinzberg tells him he has been elected as the next president of English PEN, which will give him the opportunity to launch a campaign for the release of a fellow author, Anatoly Babakov, who is languishing in a Russian Gulag in Siberia. His crime, writing a book Uncle Joe, which gives an insight into what it was like to work for Josef Stalin. So determined is he to see Babakov released, Harry puts his own life in danger.&lt;p&gt;Emma Clifton, now Chairman of Barrington Shipping, is having to face the repercussions of the IRA bombing her ship. &lt;br /&gt; Some board members feel she should resign while others, including Sebastian Clifton, newly elected to the board, are determined to see she remains as Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giles Barrington is now a Minister of the Crown, and looks set for high office, but a trip to East Germany does not end as a diplomatic success, and once again Giles' political career is thrown off balance by none other than Major Alex Fisher. Fisher decides to stand against Giles at the forthcoming general election. But this time who wins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Clifton asks his girlfriend Samantha to marry him. She happily accepts, but then later changes her mind after she discovers what Seb has been up to behind her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book ends with two court trials: one at the high court in London, a libel case pitting Emma Clifton against Lady Virginia Fenwick; while another, a show trial, takes place in Russia after Harry has been arrested as a spy. Thus continues book five of the Clifton Chronicles, Jeffrey Archer's most accomplished work to date, with all the trademark twists and turns that have made him one of the most successful authors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It is June 1778, and the world seems to be turning upside-down. The British Army is withdrawing from Philadelphia, with George Washington in pursuit, and for the first time, it looks as if the rebels might actually win. But for Claire Fraser and her family, there are even more tumultuous revolutions that have to be accommodated.Her former husband, Jamie, has returned from the dead, demanding to know why in his absence she married his best friend, Lord John Grey. Lord John's son, the ninth Earl of Ellesmere, is no less shocked to discover that his real father is actually the newly resurrected Jamie Fraser, and Jamie's nephew Ian Murray discovers that his new-found cousin has an eye for the woman who has just agreed to marry him.&lt;br /&gt;And while Claire is terrified that one of her husbands may be about to murder the other, in the 20th century her descendants face even more desperate turns of events. Her daughter Brianna is trying to protect her son from a vicious criminal with murder on his mind, while her husband Roger has disappeared into the past . . .</description>

  <description>A riotously funny, emotionally raw novel about love, marriage, divorce, family, and the ties that bind—whether we like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The death of Judd Foxman’s father marks the first time that the entire Foxman family—including Judd’s mother, brothers, and sister—have been together in years. Conspicuously absent: Judd’s wife, Jen, whose fourteen-month affair with Judd’s radio-shock-jock boss has recently become painfully public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simultaneously mourning the death of his father and the demise of his marriage, Judd joins the rest of the Foxmans as they reluctantly submit to their patriarch’s dying request: to spend the seven days following the funeral together. In the same house. Like a family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the week quickly spins out of control, longstanding grudges resurface, secrets are revealed, and old passions reawakened. For Judd, it’s a weeklong attempt to make sense of the mess his life has become while trying in vain not to get sucked into the regressive battles of his madly dysfunctional family. All of which would be hard enough without the bomb Jen dropped the day Judd’s father died: She’s pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is Where I Leave You is Jonathan Tropper's most accomplished work to date, a riotously funny, emotionally raw novel about love, marriage, divorce, family, and the ties that bind—whether we like it or not.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poland, 1909&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanislaw is determined to escape the Russians and follow his brother to America, a land where anything seems possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wisconsin, 1941&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the men off to war, Fritzi and her sisters must learn men’s work -- from fixing flats to driving the tow truck. They add their own touches, too: neat little caps, short skirts and roller skates, and the All-Girl Filling Station is born. Their peace doesn’t last long though: skilled women are needed to fly planes for the war effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alabama, 2005&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Sookie Earle has just married off the last of her daughters and is looking forward to putting her feet up. But then one day a package arrives. Its contents knock Sookie sideways, propelling her back to the 1940s, and four irrepressible sisters whose wartime adventures force them to reimagine who they are, and what they are capable of.</description>

  <description>Kim Rockwell, Toby Lee, Genright Selsor, and Tuktu Barnes are all aboard the work sub Adam I and ready to continue accepting the unusual as normal. In their latest adventure, the Hydronauts are the guests of the Kirl, the strong, agile, four-footed Ocean People. The crew had accomplished their mission to find Kirl, but are disregarding their orders to eliminate them. Also on board is a cryo, a well preserved U. S. Army major who died in 1999 and is revived in the era of the Hydronauts.&lt;br /&gt;The Hydronauts must now be able to relay the information stored in the Kirl Archives and the knowledge of thermal energy-geologist Major Bruce Bell that there is a vast new livable continent free of bomb sickness that has plagued the earth since its nuclear decimation to the World Council.&lt;br /&gt;A fast paced, exciting, and humorous science fiction novel, “Escape From The Crater” is the third in Carl L. Biemiller's Hydronaut series.</description>

  <description>The range was not the entire world. But it was more than 80% of it, and all water. The nuclear war had long since melted much of the polar ice caps. Whole sections of continents were long gone. Hive cities had been set up under the surface of the water.&lt;br /&gt;Set in this world of the future, The Hydronauts tells of a team of marine wardens picked by the International Marine Counsel.&lt;br /&gt;There is Kim, the leader of the group; Toby, whose ancestors had come from the forgotten country once called Japan. Tuktu, who came from McKinley City in what once was Alaska; and Genright, who had been selected for warden training in the Hive City deep within a plateau of ancient Ethiopia.&lt;br /&gt;Carl L. Biemiller tells of a future environment in which men live beneath the sea, can communicate with dolphins, and can preserve human beings in a state of suspended animation for centuries.</description>

  <description>If you are twelve years old and accidentally locked up in the Smithsonian Institution for the night, well you just have to do something. And Gib did it by striking up a conversation with Owney, the famous canine mascot of the Post Office. Owney tells Gib his life story, embellished with Owney's own estimate of his brilliance and bravery. And what a life story: Owney surf-rides a whale; he meets and charms the emperor of Japan; he outwits Chinese bandits; he saves the Illinois railroad yards from a bomb explosion. Owney really did travel, so not all the tales are quite as tall as they seem.</description>

  <description>He was five seconds away from the incredible, from the awesome; from a beauty he would remember all of his life. Fourteen-year-old Kent Palmer was also five seconds away from a decision which would change his summer and his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began when Kent caught an albino bluefish, the first albino ever seen, as he was fishing with his father. Faced with an instantaneous decision, he chose to free the fish rather than turn it over for scientific investigation. His action led to a summer job working on an oceanographic laboratory's research boat, a confrontation with sensationalistic newsmen and exploiters who wished to make money off his discovery, and a chance to appear on a national television program to argue against the offering of a reward for the capture of "his fish." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ALBINO BLUE is a story abounding in good nature, lore and marine biology. Yet it is also a story of a young man whose relationship with his father and the people he meets helps him bridge the gap between boyhood and manhood.</description>

  <description>The Hydronauts, Kim, Toby Lee, Tuktu and Genright Selsor are back together again for another futuristic adventure under the sea. This time Kim and his group receive special orders to become Sea Rovers, in search of the mankind created men-fish, who seem to be "managing" certain forms of sea life already under "management" by the Warden Service of the Hive Cities. Research has indicated that the best clues to the whereabouts and behavior of the men-fish may be by following the whale herds. Carrying out their orders to see if the men-fish should be allowed to live or not, the chase begins.&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel to The Hydronauts, Carl L. Biemiller continues where he left off with the adventures of this group in a future environment where men live beneath the sea, can communicate with dolphins and other sea creatures, and can preserve human beings in a state of suspended animation for centuries. In this book he adds much cetalogical lore as well as the adventure of the chase.&lt;br /&gt;A solid science fiction book filled with suspense and drama.</description>

In New York City, beautiful stay-at-home mom Vanessa is obsessively searching the Internet for news of an old flame. And in San Francisco, Dani, the aspiring writer who can't seem to put down a book--or a cocktail--long enough to open her laptop, has just been fired... again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to regroup, Kate, Vanessa, and Dani retreat to the New Jersey beach town where they once spent their summers. Emboldened by the seductive cadences of the shore, the women being to realize how much their lives, and friendships, have been shaped by the choices they made one fateful night on the beach eight years earlier--and the secrets that only now threaten to surface.</description>

So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready.

And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;Bestselling author Jeffrey Archer's &lt;i&gt;Be Careful What You Wish For&lt;/i&gt; opens with Harry Clifton and his wife Emma rushing to hospital to learn the fate of their son Sebastian, who has been involved in a fatal car accident. But who died, Sebastian or his best friend Bruno?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;When Ross Buchanan is forced to resign as chairman of the Barrington Shipping Company, Emma Clifton wants to replace him. But Don Pedro Martinez intends to install his puppet, the egregious Major Alex Fisher, in order to destroy the Barrington family firm just as the company plans to build its new luxury liner, the &lt;i&gt;MV Buckingham&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Back in London, Harry and Emma's adopted daughter wins a scholarship to the Slade Academy of Art where she falls in love with a fellow student, Clive Bingham, who asks her to marry him. Both families are delighted until Priscilla Bingham, Jessica's future mother-in-law, has a visit from an old friend, Lady Virginia Fenwick, who drops her particular brand of poison into the wedding chalice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, without warning, Cedric Hardcastle, a bluff Yorkshireman who no one has come across before, takes his place on the board of Barringtons. This causes an upheaval that none of them could have anticipated, and will change the lives of every member of the Clifton and Barrington families. Hardcastle's first decision is who to support to become the next chairman of the board: Emma Clifton or Major Alex Fisher? And with that decision, the story takes yet another twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be Careful What You Wish For&lt;/i&gt; showcases the master storyteller's talent as never before – when the Clifton and Barrington families march forward into the sixties, in this epic tale of love, revenge, ambition and betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The third novel in Jeffrey Archer’s compelling saga, the Clifton Chronicles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1945. The vote in the House of Lords as to who should inherit the Barrington family fortune has ended in a tie. The Lord Chancellor’s deciding vote will cast a long shadow on the lives of Harry Clifton and Giles Barrington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry returns to America to promote his latest novel, while his beloved Emma goes in search of the little girl who was found abandoned in her father’s office on the night he was killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the General Election is called, Giles Barrington has to defend his seat in the House of Commons and is horrified to discover who the Conservatives select to stand against him. But it is Sebastian Clifton, Harry and Emma’s son, who ultimately influences his uncle’s fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1957, Sebastian wins a scholarship to Cambridge, and a new generation of the Clifton family march onto the page. After Sebastian is expelled from school, he unwittingly becomes caught up in an international art fraud involving a Rodin statue that is worth far more than the sum it raises at auction. Does he become a millionaire? Does he go to Cambridge? Is his life in danger?</description>

  <description>On the heels of the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;Only Time Will Tell&lt;/i&gt;, Jeffrey Archer picks up the sweeping story of the Clifton Chronicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only days before Britain declares war on Germany, Harry Clifton, hoping to escape the consequences of long-buried family secrets, and forced to accept that his desire to marry Emma Barrington will never be fulfilled, has joined the Merchant Navy. &lt;br /&gt; But his ship is sunk in the Atlantic by a German U-boat, drowning almost the entire crew.  An American cruise liner, the SS Kansas Star, rescues a handful of sailors, among them Harry and the third officer, an American named Tom Bradshaw.  When Bradshaw dies in the night, Harry seizes on the chance to escape his tangled past and assumes his identity.&lt;p&gt;But on landing in America, he quickly learns the mistake he has made, when he discovers what is awaiting Bradshaw in New York.  Without any way of proving his true identity, Harry Clifton is now chained to a past that could be far worse than the one he had hoped to escape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Kane and Abel&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Prisoner of Birth&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;Only Time Will Tell&lt;/i&gt;, the first in an ambitious new series that tells the story of one family across generations, across oceans, from heartbreak to triumph.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;The epic tale of Harry Clifton’s life begins in 1920, with the words “I was told that my father was killed in the war.” A dock worker in Bristol, Harry never knew his father, but he learns about life on the docks from his uncle, who expects Harry to join him at the shipyard once he’s left school. But then an unexpected gift wins him a scholarship to an exclusive boys’ school, and his life will never be the same again.&lt;p&gt;As he enters into adulthood, Harry finally learns how his father really died, but the awful truth only leads him to question, was he even his father? Is he the son of Arthur Clifton, a stevedore who spent his whole life on the docks, or the firstborn son of a scion of West Country society, whose family owns a shipping line?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This introductory novel in Archer’s ambitious series The Clifton Chronicles includes a cast of colorful characters and takes us from the ravages of the Great War to the outbreak of the Second World War, when Harry must decide whether to take up a place at Oxford or join the navy and go to war with Hitler’s Germany. From the docks of working-class England to the bustling streets of 1940 New York City, &lt;i&gt;Only Time Will Tell&lt;/i&gt; takes readers on a journey through to future volumes, which will bring to life one hundred years of recent history to reveal a family story that neither the reader nor Harry Clifton himself could ever have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>She Needs a Hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken hostage while teaching abroad, Amanda Warren was convinced she was going to die until U.S. Navy SEAL Will Gerard charged in to rescue her. Now she wonders if she'll ever feel safe and whole again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her injuries left her with few memories of her ordeal, except the fear. Striving to heal, she's driven to find Will and ask him for help once again -- and discovers there's something familiar and reassuring about him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Amanda considers him her hero, Will tells himself he was just doing his job – to save her, then forget about her. But he admires her courage, wants her to feel safe in his arms. It’s up to Amanda to convince Will that he is her hero, the hero of her heart.</description>

  <description>A CHRISTMAS GIFT FROM THE HEART... THE RETURN OF THE HAPPY ENDING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As snow falls on the picture-perfect town of Baxter, Ohio, as carolers stroll along the festive streets, Rachel McRae longs for how things were. For times when Christmas meant sweet magic, for times when her husband, Sam, filled her with joy. But this season her marriage is at a turning point. Her hope for a family has all but disappeared. This Christmas, the man she has loved since childhood is saying good-bye forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam McRae believes that Rachel deserves the world-and that without him, she'd have the chance to find a man who could offer it. But with his sacrifice comes a valuable lesson in love. Now two hearts are coming in from the cold to discover the true meaning of Christmas, of forgiving the past, of embracing the future, and the courage it takes to trust in the most precious gift of all....</description>

  <description>Fantasy, friendship, and fate await you in Collin Earl’s The House of Grey, based on the popular audio fiction by the same name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14-year-old Monson Grey faces the same challenges that any freshman high school kid would: difficult classes, weird teachers, food fights…girls. Except, Monson Grey is not Monson Grey. At least, when he looks at himself in the mirror, the scarred face staring back is not someone he recognizes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he finds himself attending an extraordinary school, the recipient of an incredible scholarship, among ridiculously rich classmates, all with no memory of how he got there or what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he has from his former life are the flashes of haunting images that plague his dreams and the echoing voices that he hears, but cannot see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Monson finds fast friendship in two of his classmates, Casey and Artorius. Little does Monson know, they too carry their own skeletons. Yet, as bizarre events start to unfold around them, Monson wonders what secrets lay buried in his mind or if he will ever be able to share his true fears with his newfound friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join our three heroes as they roam the halls of the most prestigious high school in the country, finding love, mystery, and answers to their algebra homework- all while peeling away the layers of Monson’s shadowy past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: The House of Grey was originally a serialized audio fiction. The Volume system begins the written adaptation of that story. Individual volumes do not contain the complete story. The Volumes contain 50,000 to 70,000 word chucks and are divided into ARCS. (ARC ONE, the Coren University Arc, consists of Volumes 1 through 6 and corresponds to the original podcast fiction) Each ARC will be available for a reduced price in an omnibus format. Original material for the continuation of the story starts in Volume 7</description>

  <description>Volume 3 in The House of Grey Series &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fantasy, friendship, and fate await you in Collin Earl’s The House of Grey, based on the popular audio fiction by the same name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;14-year-old Monson Grey faces the same challenges that any freshman high school kid would: difficult classes, weird teachers, food fights…girls. Except, Monson Grey is not Monson Grey. At least, when he looks at himself in the mirror, the scarred face staring back is not someone he recognizes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now he finds himself attending an extraordinary school, the recipient of an incredible scholarship, among ridiculously rich classmates, all with no memory of how he got there or what to expect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All he has from his former life are the flashes of haunting images that plague his dreams and the echoing voices that he hears, but cannot see. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Monson finds fast friendship in two of his classmates, Casey and Artorius. Little does Monson know, they too carry their own skeletons. Yet, as bizarre events start to unfold around them, Monson wonders what secrets lay buried in his mind or if he will ever be able to share his true fears with his newfound friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Join our three heroes as they roam the halls of the most prestigious high school in the country, finding love, mystery, and answers to their algebra homework- all while peeling away the layers of Monson’s shadowy past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: The House of Grey was originally a serialized audio fiction. The Volume system begins the written adaptation of that story. Individual volumes do not contain the complete story. The Volumes contain 50,000 to 70,000 word chucks and are divided into ARCS. (ARC ONE, the Coren University Arc, consists of Volumes 1 through 6 and corresponds to the original podcast fiction) Each ARC will be available for a reduced price in an omnibus format. Original material for the continuation of the story starts in Volume 7</description>

  <description>14-year-old Monson Grey faces the same challenges that any freshman high school kid would. Difficult classes, weird teachers, food fights...girls. Except Monson Grey is not Monson Grey. At least, when he looks at himself in the mirror, the scarred face staring back is not someone he recognizes. Now he finds himself attending an extraordinary school, the recipient of an incredible scholarship, among ridiculously rich classmates, and with no memory of how he got there or what to expect. As bizarre events start to unfold around him, Monson wonders what secrets lay locked in his hidden past. Add all this to a mysterious silver stone, an Indiana-Jones-copycat professor, Merlin the wizard, and even Atlantis, and you'll find yourself in a fantastic tale in which magic does exist and everything is never as it seems.</description>

  <description>In this rich and deeply satisfying novel by the beloved author of &lt;i&gt;The Art of Mending&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Open House&lt;/i&gt;, a resilient woman embarks upon an unforgettable journey of adventure, self-discovery, and renewal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betta Nolan moves to a small town after the death of her husband to try to begin anew. Pursuing a dream of a different kind of life, she is determined to find pleasure in her simple daily routines. Among those who help her in both expected and unexpected ways are the ten-year-old boy next door, three wild women friends from her college days, a twenty-year-old who is struggling to find his place in the world, and a handsome man who is ready for love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Berg's &lt;i&gt;The Year of Pleasures&lt;/i&gt;is about acknowledging the solace found in ordinary things: a warm bath, good food, the beauty of nature, music, friends, and art. "Berg writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, loneliness, love, and hope. And the transcendence that redeems," said Andre Dubus about &lt;i&gt;Durable Goods&lt;/i&gt;. And the same could be said about &lt;i&gt;The Year of Pleasures&lt;/i&gt;. </description>

  <description>A daughter of the forest and loyal to no clan, Seana has been whispered to be a child of the faeries, but not even a little Gael magic can help her claim what she truly desires--a home and hearth... before it's too late for her ailing Da.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seana pins all her hopes on Broc Ceannfhionn, and to win Broc's heart, she strikes a bargain with Colin Mac Brodie--the biggest rogue in all of Scotia. Although Colin has already broken Seana's heart once... this time around, he's powerless to resist the girl he once shunned... and he finds himself where he never thought to be... on bended knee.</description>

  <description>Descended of the legendary sons of MacAlpin, Iain MacKinnon refuses to bow to the English. When his young son is captured by a minion of the English king, the fierce Scottish chieftain vows to stop at nothing to secure the lad's return. Retaliating in kind, he captures the daughter of his enemy, planning to bargain with the devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FitzSimon's daughter has lived her entire life in the shadow of the man she called father--yet never would she have imagined he would forsake his only daughter. Even as Page blames her captor for welching on a contract with her father, she suspects the truth. But the shadows hold secrets ... now only the love of her reluctant champion can save the MacKinnon's Bride.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Truth is No Fairy Tale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I am not the sort of person about whom stories are told. Those of humble birth suffer their heartbreaks and celebrate their triumphs unnoticed by the bards, leaving no trace in the fables of their time....&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so begins Elise Dalriss's story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she hears her great-granddaughter recount a tale about a beautiful princess awakened by a handsome prince, it pushes open a door to the past, a door Elise has long kept locked. For Elise was the companion to the real princess who slumbered - and she is the only one left who knows the truth of what happened so many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the memories start to unfold, Elise is plunged back in to the magnificent world behind the opulent palace walls. Fleeing a hardscrabble existence and personal tragedy, she builds a new life for herself as a servant to the royal family and quickly rises within the castle hierarchy. As Elise proves herself a loyal confidante, she is drawn into the lives of an extraordinary cast of women: a beautiful queen who wakes each morning with tears on her pillow, an elderly spinster who in heartache shuts herself away, a princess who yearns to be free, and the ambitious and frightening sister who cannot accept the fact that she will never rule. Elise has guarded their secrets - and her own - for a lifetime. &lt;i&gt;While Beauty Slept&lt;/i&gt; is her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this rich and compelling novel of love and terror, friendship and fate, we are introduced to a heroine of extraordinary determination - the true heart of a legend - who reveals what it really takes to reach happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It's 1946 and author Juliet Ashton can't think what to write next. Out of the blue, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - by chance, he's acquired a book that once belonged to her - and, spurred on by their mutual love of reading, they begin a correspondence. When Dawsey reveals that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, her curiosity is piqued and it's not long before she begins to hear from other members. As letters fly back and forth with stories of life in Guernsey under the German Occupation, Juliet soon realizes that the society is every bit as extraordinary as its name.</description>

  <description>Read the first book in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series, perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/i&gt; and Percy Jackson and the Olympians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He holds the secret that can end the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth: Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on September 28, 1330. Nearly 700 years later, he is acknowledged as the greatest Alchemyst of his day. It is said that he discovered the secret of eternal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The records show that he died in 1418.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his tomb is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legend: Nicholas Flamel lives. But only because he has been making the elixir of life for centuries. The secret of eternal life is hidden within the book he protects—the Book of Abraham the Mage. It's the most powerful book that has ever existed. In the wrong hands, it will destroy the world. That's exactly what Dr. John Dee plans to do when he steals it. Humankind won't know what's happening until it's too late. And if the prophecy is right, Sophie and Josh Newman are the only ones with the power to save the world as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes legends are true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Sophie and Josh Newman are about to find themselves in the middle of the greatest legend of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alchemyst&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;b&gt;STAR&lt;/b&gt;] “[A] A riveting fantasy…While there is plenty here to send readers rushing to their encyclopedias…those who read the book at face value will simply be caught up in the enthralling story. A fabulous read.”—&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;, Starred&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Magician&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;b&gt;STAR&lt;/b&gt;] “Readers will be swept up by a plot that moves smartly along, leaving a wide trailer of destruction and well-timed revelations.”—&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reveiws&lt;/i&gt;, Starred&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sorceress&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Master yarnspinner that he is, Scott expertly cranks up the suspense while keeping his now-large cast in quick motion….This page –turner promises plenty of action to come.”—&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Necromancer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Unrelenting forward momentum….This book will thrill fans.”—&lt;b&gt;

  <description>Acclaimed by many as the world's greatest novel, &lt;i&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/i&gt; provides a vast panorama of contemporary life in Russia and of humanity in general. In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch. As Rosemary Edmonds comments, 'He leaves the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope to bring home the meaning of the brooding words following the title, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.</description>

  <description>It is the world of the near future, and Offred is a Handmaid in the home of the Commander and his wife. She is allowed out once a day to the food market, she is not permitted to read, and she is hoping the Commander makes her pregnant, because she is only valued if her ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she was an independent woman, had a job of her own, a husband and child. But all of that is gone now...everything has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorothea Benton Frank returns to the enchanted landscape of South Carolina's Lowcountry made famous in her beloved &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Sullivans Island&lt;/em&gt; to tell the story of the next generation of Hamiltons and Hayes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return to Sullivans Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whether you were away from the Lowcountry for a week or for years, it was impossible to remember how gorgeous it was. It never changed and everyone depended on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly graduated from college and an aspiring writer, Beth Hayes craves independence and has a world to conquer. But her notions of travel, graduate study, and writing the great American novel will have to be postponed. With her mother, Susan, leaving to fulfill her own dreams in Paris and her Aunt Maggie, Uncle Grant, and stepfather, Simon, moving to California, Beth is elected by her elders to house-sit the Island Gamble. Surrounded by the shimmering blue waters of the Atlantic, the white clapboards, silver tin roof, and confessional porch have seen and heard the stories of generations of Hamiltons. But will the ghosts of the Island Gamble be watching over Beth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buoyed by sentimental memories of growing up on this tiny sandbar that seems to be untouched by time, Beth vows to give herself over to the Lowcountry force and discover the wisdom it holds. She will rest, rejuvenate, and then reenter the outside world. Just as she vows she will never give into the delusional world of white picket fences, minivans, and eternal love, she meets Max Mitchell. And all her convictions and plans begin to unravel with lightning speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is so much about life and her family's past that she does not know. Her ignorance and naiveté nearly cost her both her inheritance and her family's respect. But Beth finds unexpected friends to help her through the disaster she faces: her wise and charming Aunt Sophie; Cecily Singleton, the granddaughter of Livvie Singleton; and Woody Morrison, the solid young investment banker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful ensemble of characters could be your own family, but watch what unfolds as they succumb to the island's spell. If everything happens for a reason, then Beth's return to Sullivans Island teaches her that betrayal and tragedy are most easily handled when you surround yourself with loyal family and friends in a magical place that loves you so much that it wants to claim you as its own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dorothea Benton Frank presents a refreshingly honest and funny novel about friendship, family, and finding happiness by becoming who you're meant to be.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catapulted from her home, her marriage and her children, artist Rebecca Simms has come to Pawleys Island, South Carolina, to hide herself from herself. Little does she know that on this "arrogantly shabby" family playground, she'll encounter three people who will change her life: a wise and irresistible octogenarian who will pry her secrets from her, a gallery owner who caters to interior decorators and heaven save us, tourists, and a retired attorney from Columbia who's complacent in her fat and sassy life until Rebecca's stormy advent...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The New York Times bestseller—in paperback for the first time!&lt;/b&gt;Set in the steamy, stormy landscape of South Carolina, &lt;b&gt;Sullivan's Island&lt;/b&gt; tells the unforgettable story of one woman's courageous journey toward truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born and raised on idyllic Sullivan's Island, Susan Hayes navigated through her turbulent childhood with humor, spunk, and characteristic Southern sass. But years later, she is a conflicted woman with an unfaithful husband, a sometimes resentful teenage daughter, and a heart that aches with painful, poignant memories. And as Susan faces her uncertain future, she realizes that she must go back to her past. To the beachfront house where her sister welcomes her with open arms. To the only place she can truly call home.</description>

  <description>Little Altars Everywhere is a national best-seller, a companion to Rebecca Wells' celebrated novel Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Originally published in 1992, Little Altars introduces Sidda, Vivi, the rest of the spirited Walker clan, and the indomitable Ya-Yas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating voices of Vivi and her husband, Big Shep, along with Sidda, her siblings Little Shep, Lulu, Baylor, and Cheney and Willetta — the black couple who impact the Walkers' lives in ways they never fully comprehend — Little Altars embraces nearly thirty years of life on the plantation in Thorton, Louisiana, where the cloying air of the bayou and a web of family secrets at once shelter, trap and define an utterly original community of souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can resist such cadences of Sidda Walker and her flamboyant, secretive mother, ViVi? Here the young Sidda — a precocious reader and an eloquent observer of the fault lines that divide her family — leads us on a mischievous adventures at Our Lady of Divine Compassion parochial school and beyond. A Catholic girl of pristine manners, devotion, and provocative ideas, Sidda is the very essence of childhood joy and sorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a series of luminous reminiscences, we also hear Little Shep's stories of his eccentric grandmother, Lulu's matter-of-fact account of her shoplifting skills, and Baylor's memories of Vivi and her friends, the Ya-Yas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beneath the humor and tight-knit bonds of family and friendship lie the undercurrents of alcoholism, abuse, and violence. The overlapping recollections of how the Walkers' charming life uncoils to convey their heart-breaking confusion are oat once unsettling and familiar. Wells creates an unforgettable portrait of the eccentric cast of characters and exposes their poignant and funny attempts to keep reality at arm's length. Through our laughter we feel their inevitable pain, with a glimmer of hope for forgiveness and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An arresting combination of colloquialism, poetry, and grace, Little Altars Everywhere is an insightful, piercing and unflinching evocation of childhood, a loving tribute to the transformative power of faith, and a thoroughly fresh chronicle of a family that is as haunted as it is blessed.</description>

  <description>A sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the "soul of pampered self-absorption"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.</description>

  <description>Rukhsana is a spirited young journalist working for the &lt;em&gt;Kabul Daily&lt;/em&gt; in Afghanistan. She takes care of her ill, widowed mother and her younger brother, Jahan. With the arrival of a summons for Rukhsana to appear before the infamous Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, the family’s world is shattered. The Minister, zorak Wahidi, has two goals in mind: to threaten the anti-Taliban news reporters and to announce the Taliban’s intention to hold a cricket tournament, the winner of which will represent Afghanistan in international cricket and give the brutal regime a cloak of respectability in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rukhsana knows this is a ludicrous idea—the Taliban could never embrace a game rooted in civility, fair play and equality. And no one in Afghanistan even plays cricket—no one, that is, except Rukhsana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be, however, a way to get her male cousins and her brother out of Afghanistan for good. But Wahidi has a third goal in mind—to marry Rukhsana. The union would be her death sentence, wrenching her away from her family and placing her under Wahidi’s complete control. Forced into hiding and desperate to escape the country, Rukhsana realizes that Wahidi may have given her a way out, too. When her loyal, beloved cousins ask for her help, she sets about teaching them how to win their own freedom—with a bat and a ball.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;At the heart of The Husband’s Secret is a letter that’s not meant to be read&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My darling Cecilia, if you’re reading this, then I’ve died...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret—something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all—she’s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia—or each other—but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband’s secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spouses—and, ultimately, ourselves.</description>

When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Love Story&lt;/i&gt; for this generation and perfect for fans of John Green’s &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt; brings to life two people who couldn’t have less in common—a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, &lt;i&gt;What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy, his family was overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how "really, really big" God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, "Heaven is for Real" offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, "Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Heaven is for Real" will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering you the chance to see, and believe, like a child.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/i&gt; is the forthcoming sixth novel in the epic fantasy series &lt;i&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/i&gt; by George R.R. Martin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous installment, &lt;i&gt;A Dance with Dragons&lt;/i&gt;, covered less story than Martin intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliffhangers. Martin intends to resolve these cliffhangers "very early" in &lt;i&gt;The Winds of Winter&lt;/i&gt;, saying "I'm going to open with the two big battles that I was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle at Meereen—the battle of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there."</description>

  <description>Marriage can be a real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.&lt;br /&gt;Source: gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>In 1928, Rose Wilder Lane—world traveler, journalist, much-published magazine writer—returned from an Albanian sojourn to her parents’ Ozark farm. Almanzo Wilder was 71, Laura 61, and Rose felt obligated to stay and help. To make life easier, she built them a new home, while she and Helen Boylston transformed the farmhouse into a rural writing retreat and filled it with visiting New Yorkers. Rose sold magazine stories to pay the bills for both households, and despite the subterranean tension between mother and daughter, life seemed good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the Crash. Rose’s money vanished, the magazine market dried up, and the Depression darkened the nation. That’s when Laura wrote her autobiography, “Pioneer Girl,” the story of growing up in the Big Woods of Wisconsin, on the Kansas prairie, and by the shores of Silver Lake. The rest—the eight remarkable books that followed—is literary history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it isn’t the history we thought we knew. For the surprising truth is that Laura’s stories were publishable only with Rose’s expert rewriting. Based on Rose’s unpublished diaries and Laura’s letters, A Wilder Rose tells the true story of the decade-long, intensive, and often troubled collaboration that produced the Little House books—the collaboration that Rose and Laura deliberately hid from their agent, editors, reviewers, and readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did the two women conceal their writing partnership? What made them commit what amounts to one of the longest-running deceptions in American literature? And what happened in those years to change Rose from a left-leaning liberal to a passionate Libertarian?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this impeccably researched novel and with a deep insight into the book-writing business gained from her own experience as an author and coauthor, Susan Wittig Albert follows the clues that take us straight to the heart of this fascinating literary mystery.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of The 25th Hour, a captivating novel about war, courage, survival — and a remarkable friendship that ripples across a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Nazis’ brutal siege of Leningrad, Lev Beniov is arrested for looting and thrown into the same cell as a handsome deserter named Kolya. Instead of being executed, Lev and Kolya are given a shot at saving their own lives by complying with an outrageous directive: secure a dozen eggs for a powerful Soviet colonel to use in his daughter’s wedding cake. In a city cut off from all supplies and suffering unbelievable deprivation, Lev and Kolya embark on a hunt through the dire lawlessness of Leningrad and behind enemy lines to find the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns insightful and funny, thrilling and terrifying, &lt;i&gt;City of Thieves&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping, cinematic World War II adventure and an intimate coming-of-age story with an utterly contemporary feel for how boys become men.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once An Eagle&lt;/em&gt; is the story of one special man, a soldier named Sam Damon, and his adversary over a lifetime, fellow officer Courtney Massengale. Damon is a professional who puts duty, honor, and the men he commands above self interest. Massengale, however, brilliantly advances by making the right connections behind the lines and in Washington's corridors of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the French countryside during the Great War, the conflict between these adversaries solidifies in the isolated garrison life marking peacetime, intensifies in the deadly Pacific jungles of World War II, and reaches its treacherous conclusion in the last major battleground of the Cold War -- Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in character and values, courage, nobility, honesty, and selflessness, here is an unforgettable story about a man who embdies the best in our nation -- and in us all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.</description>

  <description>Award-winning author William Landay has written the consummate novel of an embattled family in crisis - a suspenseful, character-driven mystery that is also a spellbinding tale of guilt, betrayal, and the terrifying speed at which our lives can spin out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Barber has been an assistant district attorney in his suburban Massachusetts county for more than twenty years. He is respected in his community, tenacious in the courtroom, and happy at home with his wife, Laurie, and son, Jacob. But when a shocking crime shatters their New England town, Andy is blindsided by what happens next: His fourteen-year-old son is charged with the murder of a fellow student.</description>

  <description>A debut of extraordinary distinction: Ayana Mathis tells the story of the children of the Great Migration through the trials of one unforgettable family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 1923, fifteen-year-old Hattie Shepherd flees Georgia and settles in Philadelphia, hoping for a chance at a better life. Instead, she marries a man who will bring her nothing but disappointment and watches helplessly as her firstborn twins succumb to an illness a few pennies could have prevented.  Hattie gives birth to nine more children whom she raises with grit and mettle and not an ounce of the tenderness they crave.  She vows to prepare them for the calamitous difficulty they are sure to face in their later lives, to meet a world that will not love them, a world that will not be kind. Captured here in twelve luminous narrative threads, their lives tell the story of a mother’s monumental courage and the journey of a nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beautiful and devastating, Ayana Mathis’s &lt;i&gt;The Twelve Tribes of Hattie&lt;/i&gt; is wondrous from first to last—glorious, harrowing, unexpectedly uplifting, and blazing with life. An emotionally transfixing page-turner, a searing portrait of striving in the face of insurmountable adversity, an indelible encounter with the resilience of the human spirit and the driving force of the American dream, Mathis’s first novel heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction. </description>

  <description>Hig somehow survived the flu pandemic that killed everyone he knows. Now his wife is gone, his friends are dead, and he lives in the hangar of a small abandoned airport with his dog, Jasper, and a mercurial, gun-toting misanthrope named Bangley.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when a random transmission beams through the radio of his 1956 Cessna, the voice ignites a hope deep inside him that a better life exists outside their tightly controlled perimeter. Risking everything, he flies past his point of no return and follows its static-broken trail, only to find something that is both better and worse than anything he could ever hope for.</description>

  <description>In Paradise, nothing is what it seems...&lt;p&gt;Army Special Agent John Puller is the best there is. A combat veteran, Puller is the man the U.S. Army relies on to investigate the toughest crimes facing the nation. Now he has a new case-but this time, the crime is personal: His aunt has been found dead in Paradise, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A picture-perfect town on Florida's Gulf Coast, Paradise thrives on the wealthy tourists and retirees drawn to its gorgeous weather and beaches. The local police have ruled his aunt's death an unfortunate, tragic accident. But just before she died, she mailed a letter to Puller's father, telling him that beneath its beautiful veneer, Paradise is not all it seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Puller finds convinces him that his aunt's death was no accident . . . and that the palm trees and sandy beaches of Paradise may hide a conspiracy so shocking that some will go to unthinkable lengths to make sure the truth is never revealed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On the last night of 1937, twenty-five-year-old Katey Kontent is in a second-rate Greenwich Village jazz bar with her boardinghouse roommate stretching three dollars as far as it will go when Tinker Grey, a handsome banker with royal blue eyes and a tempered smile, happens to sit at the neighboring table. This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of Condé Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wooed in turn by a shy, principled multi-millionaire, and an irrepressible Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, befriended by a single-minded widow who is ahead of her time, and challenged by an imperious mentor, Katey experiences firsthand the poise secured by wealth and station and the failed aspirations that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her life, she begins to realize how our most promising choices inevitably lay the groundwork for our regrets.</description>

  <description>In this dazzling and long-awaited conclusion to the acclaimed Mortal Instruments series, Clary and her friends fight the greatest evil they have ever faced: Clary's own brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Morgenstern is on the move, systematically turning Shadowhunter against Shadowhunter. Bearing the Infernal Cup, he transforms Shadowhunters into creatures out of nightmare, tearing apart families and lovers as the ranks of his Endarkened army swell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The embattled Shadowhunters withdraw to Idris - but not even the famed demon towers of Alicante can keep Sebastian at bay. And with the Nephilim trapped in Idris, who will guard the world against demons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of the greatest betrayals the Nephilim have ever known is revealed, Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Simon, and Alec must flee - even if their journey takes them deep into the demon realms, where no Shadowhunter has set foot before, and from which no human being has ever returned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love will be sacrificed and lives lost in the terrible battle for the fate of the word in the thrilling final installment of the classic urban fantasy series The Mortal Instruments!</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Mortal Instruments continues—and so do the thrills and danger for Jace, Clary, and Simon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What price is too high to pay, even for love? When Jace and Clary meet again, Clary is horrified to discover that the demon Lilith’s magic has bound her beloved Jace together with her evil brother Sebastian, and that Jace has become a servant of evil. The Clave is out to destroy Sebastian, but there is no way to harm one boy without destroying the other. As Alec, Magnus, Simon, and Isabelle wheedle and bargain with Seelies, demons, and the merciless Iron Sisters to try to save Jace, Clary plays a dangerous game of her own. The price of losing is not just her own life, but Jace’s soul. She’s willing to do anything for Jace, but can she still trust him? Or is he truly lost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love. Blood. Betrayal. Revenge. Darkness threatens to claim the Shadowhunters in the harrowing fifth book of the Mortal Instruments series.</description>

  <description>The Mortal War is over, and sixteen-year-old Clary Fray is back home in New York, excited about all the possibilities before her. She’s training to become a Shadowhunter and to use her unique power. Her mother is getting married to the love of her life. Downworlders and Shadowhunters are at peace at last. And—most importantly of all—she can finally call Jace her boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing comes without a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is murdering Shadowhunters, provoking tensions between Downworlders and Shadowhunters that could lead to a second, bloody war. Clary’s best friend, Simon, can’t help her—his mother just found out that he’s a vampire, and now he’s homeless. When Jace begins to pull away from her without explaining why, Clary is forced to delve into the heart of a mystery whose solution reveals her worst nightmare: she herself has set in motion a terrible chain of events that could lead to her losing everything she loves. Even Jace.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go — especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this breathtaking sequel to &lt;i&gt;City of Bones&lt;/i&gt;, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadowhunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City - whatever the cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is a mortal sin and the secrets of the past prove deadly as Clary and Jace face down Valentine in the third installment of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series The Mortal Instruments.</description>

  <description>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder― much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...</description>

  <description>The inspiring story of a son and his dying mother, who form a "book club" that brings them together as her life comes to a close. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Anne Schwalbe is waiting for her chemotherapy treatments when Will casually asks her what she's reading. The conversation they have grows into tradition: soon they are reading the same books so they can have something to talk about in the hospital waiting room. The ones they choose range from classic to popular, from fantastic to spiritual, and we hear their passion for reading and their love for each other in their intimate and searching discussions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A profoundly moving testament to the power of love between a child and parent, and the power of reading in our lives.</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2007 BookBrowse Award for Most Popular Book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An atmospheric, gritty, and compelling novel of star-crossed lovers, set in the circus world circa 1932, by the bestselling author of Riding Lessons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jacob Jankowski, recently orphaned and suddenly adrift, jumps onto a passing train, he enters a world of freaks, drifters, and misfits, a second-rate circus struggling to survive during the Great Depression, making one-night stands in town after endless town. A veterinary student who almost earned his degree, Jacob is put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It is there that he meets Marlena, the beautiful young star of the equestrian act, who is married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. He also meets Rosie, an elephant who seems untrainable until he discovers a way to reach her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully written, Water for Elephants is illuminated by a wonderful sense of time and place. It tells a story of a love between two people that overcomes incredible odds in a world in which even love is a luxury that few can afford.</description>

  <description>Against the unforgettable backdrop of New York near the turn of the twentieth century, from the Gilded Age world of formal balls and opera to the immigrant poverty of the Lower East Side, bestselling author Susan Vreeland again breathes life into a work of art in this extraordinary novel, which brings a woman once lost in the shadows into vivid color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1893, and at the Chicago World’s Fair, Louis Comfort Tiffany makes his debut with a luminous exhibition of innovative stained-glass windows, which he hopes will honor his family business and earn him a place on the international artistic stage. But behind the scenes in his New York studio is the freethinking Clara Driscoll, head of his women’s division. Publicly unrecognized by Tiffany, Clara conceives of and designs nearly all of the iconic leaded-glass lamps for which he is long remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clara struggles with her desire for artistic recognition and the seemingly insurmountable challenges that she faces as a professional woman, which ultimately force her to protest against the company she has worked so hard to cultivate. She also yearns for love and companionship, and is devoted in different ways to five men, including Tiffany, who enforces to a strict policy: he does not hire married women, and any who do marry while under his employ must resign immediately. Eventually, like many women, Clara must decide what makes her happiest—the professional world of her hands or the personal world of her heart.</description>

Still, in that instant, I felt &lt;/i&gt;well&lt;i&gt;. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen.

  <description>To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt;, then scattered and torn in &lt;i&gt;New Moon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt; - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An ingenious code hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</description>

  <description>At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”</description>

  &lt;i&gt;'Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; -- the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!'&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition uses the text as it appeared in its serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens's vision, and includes the original illustrations by H. K. Browne ('Phiz'). Richard Maxwell's introduction discusses the intricate interweaving of epic drama with personal tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia"—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>The hero-narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt; is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</description>

  <description>Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of &lt;i&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/i&gt; who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from &lt;i&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide&lt;/i&gt; ("A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox—the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A BIG NOVEL ABOUT A SMALL TOWN ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty façade is a town at war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils ... Pagford is not what it first seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations?</description>

While in space, an accident occurs that cuts all contact between the men and earth for two minutes. Both men return from the trip with no memory of those crucial minutes, and soon thereafter Streck mysteriously dies. Little by little, Spencer's wife Jillian, pregnant with twins, begins to suspect that something happened on the mission during those two minutes...something that changed Spencer into something other than the man she loves...something that might mean the end of us all...</description>

  <description>Anne Tyler gives us a wise, haunting, and deeply moving new novel in which she explores how a middle-aged man, ripped apart by the death of his wife, is gradually restored by her frequent appearances—in their house, on the roadway, in the market.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Crippled in his right arm and leg, Aaron spent his childhood fending off a sister who wants to manage him. So when he meets Dorothy, a plain, outspoken, self-dependent young woman, she is like a breath of fresh air. Unhesitatingly he marries her, and they have a relatively happy, unremarkable marriage. But when a tree crashes into their house and Dorothy is killed, Aaron feels as though he has been erased forever. Only Dorothy’s unexpected appearances from the dead help him to live in the moment and to find some peace. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Gradually he discovers, as he works in the family’s vanity-publishing business, turning out titles that presume to guide beginners through the trials of life, that maybe for this beginner there is a way of saying goodbye. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A beautiful, subtle exploration of loss and recovery, pierced throughout with Anne Tyler’s humor, wisdom, and always penetrating look at human foibles.</description>

  <description>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/b&gt;</description>
