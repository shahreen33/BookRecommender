  <description>Do you know your desert-island, all-time, top five most memorable split-ups?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob does. He keeps a list, in fact. But Laura isn't on it - even though she's just become his latest ex. He's got his life back, you see. He can just do what he wants when he wants: like listen to whatever music he likes, look up the girls that are on his list, and generally behaves as if Laura never mattered. But Rob finds he can't move on. He's stuck in a really deep groove - and it's called Laura. Soon, he's asking himself some big questions: about love, about life - and about why we choose to share ours with the people we do.</description>

  <description>The serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay, and their children and assorted guests are on holiday on the Isle of Skye. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and the conflict between men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and simultaneously, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumph—the human capacity for change.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of &lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39664819-in-a-dark-dark-wood" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B00Q102M8Q&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should be a cozy and fun-filled weekend deep in the English countryside takes a sinister turn in Ruth Ware’s suspenseful, compulsive, and darkly twisted psychological thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leonora, known to some as Lee and others as Nora, is a reclusive crime writer, unwilling to leave her “nest” of an apartment unless it is absolutely necessary. When a friend she hasn’t seen or spoken to in years unexpectedly invites Nora (Lee?) to a weekend away in an eerie glass house deep in the English countryside, she reluctantly agrees to make the trip. Forty-eight hours later, she wakes up in a hospital bed injured but alive, with the knowledge that someone is dead. Wondering not “what happened?” but “what have I done?”, Nora (Lee?) tries to piece together the events of the past weekend. Working to uncover secrets, reveal motives, and find answers, Nora (Lee?) must revisit parts of herself that she would much rather leave buried where they belong: in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of Paula Hawkins's instant New York Times bestseller The Girl On the Train and S. J. Watson’s riveting national sensation Before I Go To Sleep, this gripping literary debut from UK novelist Ruth Ware will leave you on the edge of your seat through the very last page.</description>

  <description>In 1865, English author CHARLES LUTWIDGE DODGSON (1832-1898), aka Lewis Carroll, wrote a fantastical adventure story for the young daughters of a friend. The adventures of Alice-named for one of the little girls to whom the book was dedicated-who journeys down a rabbit hole and into a whimsical underworld realm instantly struck a chord with the British public, and then with readers around the world. In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson's wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters. In many ways, this sequel has had an even greater impact on today's pop culture than the first book.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers.</description>

  <description>Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery" is a memorable and terrifying masterpiece, fueled by a tension that creeps up on you slowly without any clear indication of why. This is just a townful of people, after all, choosing their numbers for the annual lottery. What's there to be scared of?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Should some secrets stay buried?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as Cassie Hunt can remember her Aunt Aggie has spoken about the forgotten world that exists just below their feet, in the tunnels and catacombs of the Sand House. The story is what inspired Cassie to become an archaeologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Aggie has a secret that she’s buried as deep as the tunnels and when excavation work begins on the site, Cassie is the only one who can help her keep it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the assistance of her old university friend, Noah Flanagan, she puts into action a plan to honour Aggie’s wishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the deeper Noah and Cassie dig, the more shocking the secrets uncovered – and danger is never far away, both above and below the ground …</description>

      <![CDATA[I was really looking forward to reading this book from the moment the author first told me about it, because it is based around a bit of history of my home town that I had no idea about. Sometimes a book which I am so highly anticipating can fall a little flat in reality, but this one did not dis...]]>

  <description>I loved this book. It made my heart sing. Written by a woman in the law with compassion, wit and legal know-how, these true life courtroom stories tell it like it is. - Helena Kennedy QC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Langford is a barrister. Her job is to stand in court representing the mad and the bad, the vulnerable, the heartbroken and the hopeful. She must become their voice: weave their story around the black and white of the law and tell it to the courtroom. These stories may not make headlines but they will change the lives of ordinary people in extraordinary ways. They are stories which, but for a twist of luck, might have been yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With remarkable candour, Sarah describes eleven cases which reveal what goes on in our criminal and family courts: these are tales of domestic fall out, everyday burglary, sexual indiscretion, and children caught up in the law. They are sometimes shocking and they are often heart-stopping. She examines how she feels as she defends the person standing in the dock. She also shows us how our attitudes and actions can shape not only the outcome of a case, but the legal system itself.</description>

  <description>This little book is a primer - an entry level aid for the writer who has a story to tell, but is struggling to get it out of her head and onto paper. To quote the theme song for the movie of Erich Segal’s bestselling book Love Story, “How do you begin. . . ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how that feels, I’ve been there and I have written the book I wish I’d had when I was starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purpose is to explain, in the simplest terms — no jargon! — and using examples from my own work, how to make the transition from the story in your head to words on paper. How to write a compelling opening, deepen conflict, write honest emotion, hopefully with a touch of humour to leaven the mix. How to write crisp dialogue, develop the romance, add a little sizzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be useful to anyone who wants to write popular fiction but, before we get down to the nitty-gritty, I’d like to say a few words about romantic fiction in particular. Why readers love it and come back for more.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;October 1946, Clanton, Mississippi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pete Banning was Clanton, Mississippi's favorite son--a decorated World War II hero, the patriarch of a prominent family, a farmer, father, neighbor, and a faithful member of the Methodist church. Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, walked into the church, and calmly shot and killed his pastor and friend, the Reverend Dexter Bell. As if the murder weren't shocking enough, it was even more baffling that Pete's only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: "I have nothing to say." He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave.&lt;br /&gt; In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete's defense attorney tries desperately to save him. &lt;br /&gt; Reminiscent of the finest tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling, &lt;i&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/i&gt; would not be complete without Grisham's signature layers of legal suspense, and he delivers on every page.</description>

  <description>The shadows grow long in the crisp autumn air, and soon the summer will be a distant memory. In the dim light of a fading sun the night has returned to reclaim its own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From hayrides to corn mazes, and Jekyll n Hyde. With warped games and witches, demons, and Death personified. “Autumn Nights: 13 Spooky Fall Reads” brings together the very best in chilling tales to tell under a harvest moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Created for those who get excited for Halloween and crisp Fall weather (and yes, even Pumpkin Spice Lattes). Are you the type to dream of windy nights and tumbling leaves even while summer days stretch on? Do you want scary bonfire stories with doses of humor and twists on classical tales? This collection is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These thirteen plus one (bonus!) spooky short stories originate from the talents of fourteen impressive new and published authors. Each twisted tale glimmers with a different sinister face of Autumn to bring new chills to your spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better- your purchase helps animals in need. All profits generated through the sales of Autumn Nights will be donated to the ASPCA as part of their ongoing mission to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals.</description>

  <description>Escape to Notting Hill this Christmas…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of Covent Garden in the Snow, this is the most romantic and charming book you’ll read this Christmas…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Notting Hill nativity… what could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viola Smith plays the viola in an orchestra (yes really!) but this year she's been asked to stretch her musical talents to organising Notting Hill's local nativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nate Williams isn't looking forward to Christmas but as his small daughter, Grace, has the starring role in the show, he's forced to stop being a Grinch and volunteer with Viola.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the sparks between them hotter than the chestnuts roasting in Portobello market, Nate and Viola can't deny their feelings. And as the snow starts to fall over London, they find themselves trapped together in more ways than one…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gorgeously heartwarming and uplifting Christmas romance, perfect for fans of Sue Moorcroft, Isabelle Broom or any Hugh Grant romcom… From Four Weddings and a Funeral to Notting Hill!</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is a follow up to Covent Garden in the Snow insofar as it has some of the same characters, but it is a whole new story with the focus on a new set of main characters and is easily read as a standalone book. However, you should definitely use this new book to catch up on the previous one...]]>

  <description>A missing barrister, a severed thumb and fat chance of finding out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Fitzwilliam’s world is about to spiral out of control. She’s not cut out to be a private investigator. With little or no aptitude for the job, she’s been sent undercover to expose the hidden lives of two men who meet nearly every week at Buxham’s - a private members’ club where portions are large and secrets are held in strictest confidence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of those men is Harry Drysdale, a defence barrister, and the other is Marcus Carver, an eminent surgeon with a tarnished past and much to lose. Ella knows he has unhealthy appetites, she’s sure he’s feeding his perverted habits and putting his female patients at risk but she has to prove it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Harry Drysdale goes missing, Konrad Neale TV journalist tries to reveal the truth behind the lies, but some of the secrets start to reveal themselves… and they are big.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; The arrival of a meteorite in a small Finnish town causes chaos and crime in this poignant, chilling and hilarious new thriller from the King of Helsinki Noir&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man with dark thoughts on his mind is racing along the remote snowy roads of Hurmevaara in Finland, when there is flash in the sky and something crashes into the car. That something turns about to be a highly valuable meteorite. With euro signs lighting up the eyes of the locals, the unexpected treasure is temporarily placed in a neighbourhood museum, under the watchful eye of a priest named Joel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Joel has a lot more on his mind than simply protecting the riches that have apparently rained down from heaven. His wife has just revealed that she is pregnant. Unfortunately Joel has strong reason to think the baby isn’t his. As Joel tries to fend off repeated and bungled attempts to steal the meteorite, he must also come to terms with his own situation, and discover who the father of the baby really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transporting the reader to the culture, landscape and mores of northern Finland &lt;i&gt;Little Siberia&lt;/i&gt; is both a crime novel and a hilarious, blacker-than-black comedy about faith and disbelief, love and death, and what to do when bolts from the blue – both literal and figurative – turn your life upside down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Hive: a brand-new thriller for 2019 from Kindle #1 bestseller Jane Holland&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scarred by fire from infancy, with a persistent stammer, Charlotte has always been in the shadow of her glamorous theatrical parents.

But an old photo suggests another, more sinister possibility ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jane Holland's bestselling thrillers have sold more than 220,000 paid downloads across several continents, and she loves finding brave new readers! &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Jane Holland's previous psychological thrillers:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'I really cannot get enough of this fabulous author ... &lt;strong&gt;highly recommend &lt;/strong&gt;any of her thrillers.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'A fab read!!!' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'&lt;strong&gt;Gripping story, &lt;/strong&gt;keeps you on the edge of your seat.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'I &lt;strong&gt;couldn't put out the light &lt;/strong&gt;until I'd finished reading this.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'&lt;strong&gt;Didn't guess the ending ... &lt;/strong&gt;well-written, cleverly interwoven.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'&lt;strong&gt;Brilliant ending!'&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'A very &lt;strong&gt;creepy &lt;/strong&gt;storyline.' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'A &lt;strong&gt;fast paced and twisty &lt;/strong&gt;novel with a satisfying ending ...' &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A read which wraps you in a blanket of mistrust and unease, taking you to a &lt;strong&gt;thrilling end&lt;/strong&gt;.’ —Sue Fortin, author of USA Today bestselling thriller The Girl Who Lied, and Sister Sister &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Utterly believable, scary as hell. &lt;strong&gt;Simply compelling.&lt;/strong&gt;’ —Andy Martin, Cambridge academic and expert on crime writing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'An amazing &lt;strong&gt;5-star read&lt;/strong&gt;!'</description>

  <description> This Christmas, the villagers of Middledip are off on a very Swiss adventure… &lt;p&gt;Family means everything to &lt;strong&gt;Lily&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;strong&gt; Zinnia &lt;/strong&gt;Cortez and, growing up in their non-conventional family unit, they and their two mums couldn’t have been closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s a bolt out of the blue when Lily finds her father wasn’t the anonymous one-night stand she’s always believed. She is in fact the result of her mum's reckless affair with a married man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confused, but determined to discover her true roots, Lily sets out to find the family she’s never known – an adventure that takes her from the frosted, thatched cottages of Middledip to the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland, via a Christmas market or two along the way…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Katherine Rundell – Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and prize-winning author of five novels for children – explores how children's books ignite, and can re-ignite, the imagination; how children's fiction, with its unabashed emotion and playfulness, can awaken old hungers and create new perspectives on the world. This delightful and persuasive essay is for adult readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Rundell is the real deal, a writer of boundless gifts and extraordinary imaginative power whose novels will be read, cherished and reread long after most so-called “serious” novels are forgotten' &lt;i&gt;Observer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> ‘A delicious Christmas delight’ – &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Katie Fforde &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The perfect Christmas romance for fans of Karen Swan.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilly Hunter has fabulous friends, her dream job as a make-up artist with a prestigious opera company and Felix, her kind and caring husband to be. It looks set to be the most perfect Christmas yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a monumental blunder forces her to work closely with new IT director Marcus Walker, it's not only the roast chestnut stalls on the cobbles of her beloved Covent Garden that cause sparks to fly…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super serious and brooding, Marcus hasn’t got a creative bone in his sharp-suited body. For technophobe Tilly, it's a match made in hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, when Tilly discovers her fiancé isn’t at all what he seems, it's Marcus who's there for her with a hot chocolate and a surprisingly strong shoulder to cry on … He might just be the best Christmas present she’s ever had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Outer London, September 2016, and neighbouring eight-year-olds have homework: prepare a traditional story to perform with their families at a school festival. But Nathan's father thinks his son would be better off doing sums; Sky's mother's enthusiasm is as fleeting as her bank balance, and there's a threatening shadow hanging over poor Alka's family. Only Mandeep's fragile grandmother and new girl Xoriyo really understand the magical powers of storytelling. As national events and individual challenges jostle for the adults' attention, can these two bring everyone together to ensure the show will go on?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When strangers take part in a series of group suicides, everything suggests that a cult is to blame. How do you stop a cult when nobody knows they are a member?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine suicides&lt;br /&gt;One Cult&lt;br /&gt;No leader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people arrive one night on Chelsea Bridge. They’ve never met. But at the same time, they run, and leap to their deaths. Each of them received a letter in the post that morning, a pre-written suicide note, and a page containing only four words: Nothing important happened today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is how they knew they had been chosen to become a part of the People Of Choice: A mysterious suicide cult whose members have no knowledge of one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-two people on that train witness the event. Two of them will be next. By the morning, People Of Choice are appearing around the globe; it becomes a movement. A social media page that has lain dormant for four years suddenly has thousands of followers. The police are under pressure to find a link between the cult members, to locate a leader that does not seem to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you stop a cult when nobody knows they are a member?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A shocking, mesmerisingly original and pitch-black thriller, &lt;i&gt;Nothing Important Happened Today&lt;/i&gt; confirms Will Carver as one of the most extraordinary, exciting authors in crime fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[There is always a risk with a sequel to a book that you have loved as much as I loved Battlestar Suburbia that it isn’t going to live up to expectations. The ‘difficult second book’ syndrome. I am delighted to report that any such fears are unfounded with this book, it was every bit as mad, funny...]]>

  <description>Suspenseful and outlandish, absorbing and fun - a novel unlike any other and an introduction to the imagination of a most distinctive writer and his singular fictional universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Britain circa 1985: time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously. Baconians are trying to convince the world that Francis Bacon really wrote Shakespeare, there are riots between the Surrealists and Impressionists, and thousands of men are named John Milton, an homage to the real Milton and a very confusing situation for the police. Amidst all this, Acheron Hades, Third Most Wanted Man In the World, steals the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and kills a minor character, who then disappears from every volume of the novel ever printed! But that's just a prelude . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hades' real target is the beloved Jane Eyre, and it's not long before he plucks her from the pages of Bronte's novel. Enter Thursday Next. She's the Special Operative's renowned literary detective, and she drives a Porsche. With the help of her uncle Mycroft's Prose Portal, Thursday enters the novel to rescue Jane Eyre from this heinous act of literary homicide. It's tricky business, all these interlopers running about Thornfield, and deceptions run rampant as their paths cross with Jane, Rochester, and Miss Fairfax. Can Thursday save Jane Eyre and Bronte's masterpiece? And what of the Crimean War? Will it ever end? And what about those annoying black holes that pop up now and again, sucking things into time-space voids . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspenseful and outlandish, absorbing and fun, The Eyre Affair is a caper unlike any other and an introduction to the imagination of a most distinctive writer and his singular fictional universe.</description>

  <description>A charming, irresistible debut novel set in London during World War II about an adventurous young woman who becomes a secret advice columnist—a warm, funny, and enormously moving story for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London 1940, bombs are falling. Emmy Lake is Doing Her Bit for the war effort, volunteering as a telephone operator with the Auxiliary Fire Services. When Emmy sees an advertisement for a job at the &lt;i&gt;London Evening Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;, her dreams of becoming a Lady War Correspondent seem suddenly achievable. But the job turns out to be typist to the fierce and renowned advice columnist, Henrietta Bird. Emmy is disappointed, but gamely bucks up and buckles down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mrs Bird is very clear: Any letters containing Unpleasantness—must go straight in the bin. But when Emmy reads poignant letters from women who are lonely, may have Gone Too Far with the wrong men and found themselves in trouble, or who can’t bear to let their children be evacuated, she is unable to resist responding. As the German planes make their nightly raids, and London picks up the smoldering pieces each morning, Emmy secretly begins to write letters back to the women of all ages who have spilled out their troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Prepare to fall head over heels with Emmy and her best friend, Bunty, who are spirited and gutsy, even in the face of events that bring a terrible blow. As the bombs continue to fall, the irrepressible Emmy keeps writing, and readers are transformed by AJ Pearce’s hilarious, heartwarming, and enormously moving tale of friendship, the kindness of strangers, and ordinary people in extraordinary times.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Emily Parker is set to have the worst Christmas ever!  &lt;p&gt;Her flatmate's moved out, she's closed her heart to love and she's been put in charge of the school original Christmas show – with zero musical ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disgraced superstar, Ray Stone is in desperate need of a quick PR turnaround. Waking up from a drunken stupor to a class of ten-year-olds snapping pics and Emily looking at him was not what he had in mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray needs Emily's help to delete the photos, and she needs his with the show. As they learn to work together they may just open their hearts to more than a second chance... &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Following a year in the life of a twenty-something British woman who falls hard for her London flat mate, this clever, fun, and unforgettable romantic comedy is the perfect feel-good holiday read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two people. One house. A year that changes everything. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Jess is following her dream and moving to London. It’s December, and she’s taking a room in a crumbling, but grand, Notting Hill house-share with four virtual strangers. On her first night, Jess meets Alex, the guy sharing her floor, at a Christmas dinner hosted by her landlord. They don’t kiss, but as far as Jess is concerned the connection is clear. She starts planning how they will knock down the wall between them to spend more time together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jess returns from a two-week Christmas holiday, she finds Alex has started dating someone else—beautiful Emma, who lives on the floor above them. Now Jess faces a year of bumping into (hell, sharing a bathroom with) the man of her dreams…and the woman of his.</description>

  <description>Alice has been playing the perfect Southern wife for over twenty-five years. So when Bob dumps her for some blonde bimbo twenty years her junior, Alice figures she's entitled to every dollar she can bleed from him. And, once she's got the money, she's entitled to use it on a much-needed vacation to Nanm Paradi, a Caribbean resort that sells itself as her "soul's paradise".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's never experienced anything as luxurious as Nanm Paradi. The staff know her every desire and cater to her every need before she even knows she needs it. She figures this is how the really rich live and she's ready to take advantage of all of it--the fabulous drinks, the beautiful views, and the handsome men. And when she discovers that voodoo magic is also on offer... well, Bob hurt her bad. She can take some time away from paradise to exact a little pain. Alice would have been happy to leave things at that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she gets hit where it hurts--her bank account--Alice's game changes. It's no longer about post-divorce romance. Now it's about revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Goes Around is a little bit thriller, a little bit witchy, a little bit romance, and a whole lot of sass.</description>

  <description>A historian of fascism offers a guide for surviving and resisting America’s turn towards authoritarianism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 9th, millions of Americans woke up to the impossible: the election of Donald Trump as president. Against all predictions, one of the most-disliked presidential candidates in history had swept the electoral college, elevating a man with open contempt for democratic norms and institutions to the height of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timothy Snyder is one of the most celebrated historians of the Holocaust. In his books &lt;i&gt;Bloodlands&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Black Earth&lt;/i&gt;, he has carefully dissected the events and values that enabled the rise of Hitler and Stalin and the execution of their catastrophic policies. With &lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt;, Snyder draws from the darkest hours of the twentieth century to provide hope for the twenty-first. As he writes, “Americans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism and communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twenty Lessons&lt;/i&gt; is a call to arms and a guide to resistance, with invaluable ideas for how we can preserve our freedoms in the uncertain years to come.</description>

  <description>1869, Sutherland, Scotland &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years the people of this remote community have been abused and mistreated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of the century the Countess of Sutherland cleared fifteen thousand people off the land to make way for her own estate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were moved to the towns of Brora and Helmsdale, shoved down the mines, and put to work in the quarries and the lime kilns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just as they were getting settled, the people of Brora once more had everything taken away from them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1828 the mines were closed, and the population left destitute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, a local gold rush has attracted the Pan-European Mining Company of Lundt and McCleery’s back to the area, and Solveig McCleery is determined to get the Brora mines reopened, and give the population back everything they were robbed of forty years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when work starts on reopening the Brora mines, a body of a prospector is found tied up in a sack. And inscriptions are found on stones near the corpse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before the meaning of these strange marks can be deciphered, another body is found. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these attacks connected to the re-opening of the Brora mine? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Solveig’s plan bring peace and prosperity to the people of Sutherland? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or has she started something much more sinister…? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Deadly Prospects’ is a well-researched and satisfying mystery story that explores the rich history and heritage of the Scottish Highlands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A engrossing page-turner that takes the reader back into a different place and time.' - Robert Foster, best-selling author of 'The Lunar Code'. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clio Gray lives in the Highlands. She works part time in the local library, and spends the rest of her time writing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent publisher of digital books.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Desire as we’ve never seen it before: a riveting true story about the sex lives of three real American women, based on nearly a decade of reporting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts and destroys our lives. It’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt;, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, &lt;i&gt;Three Women&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.</description>

  <description>South Africa is under attack from all sides when Elanza, a politically connected heiress blinded by disease and looking for love before it is too late, meets a naïve English boy. Ralph, eighteen and innocent, has accidentally stumbled upon Elanza – and South Africa’s biggest secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ralph disappears into the darkest part of the Continent to walk home overland, a Swazi spy, the only black African agent working for the apartheid era National Intelligence Service, comes into both of their lives. Angel Rots is uniquely qualified for his official mission to find Ralph and a private mission to settle an old score, but in a pursuit from Cape Town to Cairo, Ralph is always one step ahead and Angel starts to ask questions. Why is this kid so important? What has he found? Looking for answers, Angel discovers a secret that challenges his own loyalties - and could change the course of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From illegal nightclubs in South Africa to poachers in Zimbabwe and the Batwa pygmies of Burundi, from arrests in Uganda and drugged hit men in Kenya to thieving Sudanese nuns and a final confrontation in the bazaars of Old Cairo, no one would make it home without an angel watching over them. This pulse-pounding thriller will delight fans of espionage fiction as well as keen readers who see the parallels of the nuclear weapons threat in the book and modern day politics.</description>

  <description>The last novel Ernest Hemingway saw published, The Old Man and the Sea has proved itself to be one of the enduring works of American fiction. It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple, powerful language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A gripping literary thriller and the first of a new crime series, from the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Before We Met&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Inspector Robin Lyons is going home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dismissed for misconduct from the Met’s Homicide Command after refusing to follow orders, unable to pay her bills (or hold down a relationship), she has no choice but to take her teenage daughter Lennie and move back in with her parents in the city she thought she’d escaped forever at 18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Birmingham, sharing a bunkbed with Lennie and navigating the stormy relationship with her mother, Robin works as a benefit-fraud investigator – to the delight of those wanting to see her cut down to size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Corinna, her best friend of 20 years, seems happy to have Robin back. But when Corinna’s family is engulfed by violence and her missing husband becomes a murder suspect, Robin can’t bear to stand idly by as the police investigate. Can she trust them to find the truth of what happened? And why does it bother her so much that the officer in charge is her ex-boyfriend – the love of her teenage life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Robin launches her own unofficial investigation and realises there may be a link to the disappearance of a young woman, she starts to wonder how well we can really know the people we love – and how far any of us will go to protect our own.</description>

  <description>At a time when women around the world are raising their voices in the fight for equality, there is still one taboo where there remains a deafening silence: periods. &lt;i&gt;Period.&lt;/i&gt; is an agenda-setting manifesto to remove the stigma and myths continuing to surround the female body. Bold and unapologetic, Emma Barnett is on a crusade to ignite conversation among women--and men--everywhere.</description>

  <description>Welcome to California. Weed is legal. Grow it. Sell it. Smoke it. Eat it. But the money you make off it—there's the rub. Bank it, and the Feds will ask questions. Keep it around, and you’ll get robbed. LaDon and Jessie—two hustlers who make selling primo weed a regular gig—hire a private security detail to move and hold their money. Ex-soldiers Glanson and Echo target the cash—they start a ripoff business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the wild, wild west. Except this time, everybody’s high. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their guns and guts, Glanson and Echo don’t expect much trouble from a mean son-of-a-gun like LaDon Charles. But that’s exactly what they get. In this industry, no matter how much money there is for the taking—and no matter who gets it—there's always somebody counting backwards...to zero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From acclaimed pulp writer Matt Phillips, &lt;i&gt;Countdown&lt;/i&gt; is a head-spinning hit of Southern California’s lucrative and not-quite-regulated marijuana industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Praise for COUNTDOWN: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A slab of rare pulp, served nice and bloody. &lt;i&gt;Countdown&lt;/i&gt; reads like an homage to Elmore Leonard from one of the hottest new voices on the crime fiction scene.” —Anthony Neil Smith, author of &lt;i&gt;Yellow Medicine&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All the Young Warriors&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for the Books by Matt Phillips &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Matt Phillips speaks fluently the language of the dispossessed... His whiskey-soaked prose can at times be as slick as a man slinging snake-oil, and other times as brutal as a baseball bat to the head.” —Eryk Pruitt, author of &lt;i&gt;Hashtag&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dirtbags&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Phillips’ writing is so multi-layered and deep... An author to watch out for.” —Regular Guy Reading Noir</description>

  <description>Forensic psychologist Paul Britton asks himself four questions when he is faced with a crime scene: what happened: who is the victim: how was it done, and why? Only when he has the answers to these questions can he address the fifth: who is responsible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An intensely private and unassuming man, Britton has an almost mythic status in the field of crime deduction because of his ability to 'walk through the minds' of those who stalk, abduct, torture, rape and kill other human beings. What he searches for at the scene of a crime are not fingerprints, fibres or blood stains - he looks for the 'mind trace' left behind by those responsible; the psychological characteristics that can help police to identify and understand the nature of the perpetrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past dozen years he has been at the centre of more than 100 headline-making investigations, from the murder of Jamie Bulger to the abduction of baby Abbie Humphries, the slaying of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common, the pursuit of the Green Chain rapist and the Heinz baby food extortionist, the notorious Gloucester House of Horror and most recently, the murder of Naomi Smith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with humanity and insight, The Jigsaw Man is Paul Britton's absorbing first-hand account of those cases, and of his groundbreaking analysis and treatment of the criminal mind. It combines the heart-stopping tension of the best detective thriller with his unique and profound understanding of the dark side of the human condition.</description>

Also an ideal tool for writing groups.&lt;br /&gt;With a combination of six first-person, six second-person, six third-person and three non-specific point of view starts per week, there are plenty to choose from. Beginning at ‘Day 1’ this book has been designed to be started at any time of the year, and regardless of whether the sentences are used in order or not. With a choice of three per day a writer can select one, two or all and see where it leads them.</description>

  <description>Set in her beloved city of Cambridge where she enjoyed a very happy childhood, this novel from Anne Atkins follows the life of autistic junior fellow, Theo, and a first year undergraduate, Charlotte. Their growing friendship becomes tested when a threat to their beloved city comes to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, we meet their respective families and friends, such as Suki, who fights a battle in court against a senior researcher; Hui, whose family in China turn out to have a vital role to play in the foiling of the bomb plot, as well as in Theo's belief in cryptocurrency; and Peter, who is attempting to keep Cambridge's Christmas Eve tradition going in his new role for the university. We also have the antagonist: Harry, who comes from Theo's past and threatens both his present and his future with his goal of changing the cityscape and the lives of Cambridge and its inhabitants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Elegant Solution&lt;/em&gt; has threats to life and pursuit of a mystery that link it to a thriller, but equally it feels at times like a romantic comedy with the relationship that blooms between Theo and Charlie, as well as the obstacles that lay in its path. Furthermore, it covers sensitive issues such as autism and sexual assault, and more intellectual topics with maths, theorems, and bitcoin.</description>

  <description>In 2014, award-winning journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge wrote about her frustration with the way that discussions of race and racism in Britain were being led by those who weren't affected by it. She posted a piece on her blog, entitled: 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race' that led to this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring issues from eradicated black history to the political purpose of white dominance, whitewashed feminism to the inextricable link between class and race, Reni Eddo-Lodge offers a timely and essential new framework for how to see, acknowledge and counter racism. It is a searing, illuminating, absolutely necessary exploration of what it is to be a person of colour in Britain today.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;"&lt;/b&gt;Equal parts wry comedy and touching family drama, it's ultimately a heartbreaker that'll stay with you long after you're done&lt;b&gt;." --&lt;i&gt;Marie Claire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Glass of chilled ros�, check. Comfy chair, check. Box of tissues, check. &lt;i&gt;You Me Everythin&lt;/i&gt;g is everything you need for a moving, funny, heartbreaking, and ultimately joyous read." --Susan Wiggs, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Map of the Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the French countryside on an idyllic summer vacation, a delicious, tender novel about finding joy and love even in the most unexpected places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess and her ten-year-old son William set off to spend the summer at Ch�teau de Roussignol, deep in the rich, sunlit hills of the Dordogne. There, Jess's ex-boyfriend--and William's father--Adam, runs a beautiful hotel in a restored castle. Lush gardens, a gorgeous pool, delectable French food, and a seemingly never-ending wine list--what's not to like? Jess is bowled over by what Adam has accomplished, but she's in France for a much more urgent reason: to make Adam fall in love with his own son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Adam has other ideas, and another girlfriend--and he doesn't seem inclined to change the habits of a lifetime just because Jess and William have appeared on the scene. Jess isn't surprised, but William--who has quickly come to idolize his father--wants nothing more than to spend time with him. But Jess can't allow Adam to let their son down--because she is tormented by a secret of her own, one that nobody--especially William--must discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns heartwrenching and hopeful, &lt;i&gt;You Me Everything&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about one woman's fierce determination to grab hold of the family she has and never let go, and a romantic story as heady as a crisp Sancerre on a summer day.</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>James Nealy is haunted by irrational fears and inescapable compulsions. A successful software developer, he's thrown himself into a new goal-to finally conquer the noise in his mind. And he has a plan. He'll confront his darkest fears and build something beautiful: a garden. When he meets Tilly Silverberg, he knows she holds the key...even if she doesn't think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her husband's death, gardening became Tilly's livelihood and her salvation. Her thriving North Carolina business and her young son, Isaac, are the excuses she needs to hide from the world. So when oddly attractive, incredibly tenacious James demands that she take him on as a client, her answer is a flat no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a family emergency lures Tilly back to England, she's secretly glad. With Isaac in tow, she retreats to her childhood village, which has always stayed obligingly the same. Until now. Her best friend is keeping secrets. Her mother is plotting. Her first love is unexpectedly, temptingly available. And then James appears on her doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Away from home, James and Tilly forge an unlikely bond, tenuous at first but taking root every day. And as they work to build a garden together, something begins to blossom between them-despite all the reasons against it.</description>

Passionately in love, they embark on a dream honeymoon to the tropical island of Bora Bora, where they enjoy the sun, the sand, and each other. Then, while scuba diving in the crystal blue sea, they find something in the water. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could the life of your dreams be the stuff of nightmares?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the newlyweds must make a dangerous choice: to speak out or to protect their secret.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Jake's last job was never going to be open and shut&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrepid private investigator Jake comes out of retirement to help mob boss, Don Michael retrieve a bag from a business associate. Only Jake discovers he is not the only one on its trail as he joins forces with an FBI agent and a British spy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reasons Jake wishes he could figure out, the CIA, the FBI, the KKK, the British Secret Service and the mob want to get their hands on the leather briefcase and whatever secrets lurk inside. Can Jake find the bag and make it back to New York before he is killed or are the dark forces circling overhead too powerful for anyone to stop them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This standalone pulp fiction novel flits around Jake's life weaving a tale which spreads from the 1940s to the 1990s as he tries to piece together the clues to discover what is so valuable that government agencies and organized criminals might want to get their hands on a crummy old case. Before the story is over, Jake witnesses incest, robbery, kidnapping, torture and murder: a typical day in the life of a private dick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains violence, some profanity and surprisingly few scenes of a sexual nature.</description>

  <description>SET AT THE LEGENDARY HOTEL DEL CORONADO...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There's something about Belinda Jones's writing that takes you away to whatever beautiful setting she's evoking and holds you there right until you reach the last page.” The Daily Express&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a very particular reason why Chloe Sinclair has not met her Mr Right - he was never born. And the reason he was never born is because the right couples in history did not get together. It now falls to Chloe to travel back in time to matchmake like her love-life depended on it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of Chloe’s trips revolves around the iconic Hotel Del Coronado - part historic landmark, part Californian fairytale. Here she experiences the Victorian era when the doors first opened, the Roaring Twenties, the Fifties during the filming of Some Like It Hot and the Eighties karaoke party of your dreams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very special friendship has guided her to this point but the adventures go way beyond Chloe's expectations and she soon learns that, when it comes to love, it’s all in the timing…</description>

  &lt;em&gt;‘We’ll meet again at St Pancras station, a year from today. If we’re meant to be together, we’ll both be there. If we’re not, it was never meant to be . . .’&lt;/em&gt;

Heading in opposite directions, both seeking their own adventures, meeting the love of their lives wasn’t part of the plan. So they make a promise: to meet again in the same place in twelve months' time if they still want to be together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is life ever as simple as that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a story of what-ifs and maybes – and how one decision can change your life forever…&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Remember the words of Ivan Rogers the next time you hear some plausible posh boy in a suit telling you ‘no deal’ wouldn’t hurt at all and might even be a jolly good thing.” J.K. Rowling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two and a half years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the political debate over Brexit seems as intense and as complicated as ever. Who and what can we trust? And how on earth do we make sense of it all?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivan Rogers, the UK’s former ambassador to the EU, is uniquely placed to tell some home truths about the failure of the British political class and the flaws, dishonesty and confusion inherent in the UK’s approach to Brexit so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this short, elegant essay, Rogers draws up nine lessons that we, as a soon-to-be ‘third country’, need to learn from the last few years, if the next few years – indeed the next decade – are not to be even more painful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a beautiful book. Truly. I enjoyed every single second I spent between its pages and I was incredibly sad when it was over. I wanted to linger in the story, and in the lives of the five women who were the main characters of the book, what better endorsement could you possibly give a book?...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Amanda Prowse comes a heartwarming tale of first impressions and lasting love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomasina ‘Hitch’ Waycott loves living and working on the remote family farm and B&amp;amp;B. But she also wants more. To see the world. To own her own home. To fall madly in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those are fairy tales, and if her life is a fairy tale, then she’s the ugly duckling. Her deformed lip, her crooked limbs and her weak heart have kept her from taking chances. But that’s about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Grayson Potts comes to stay, he’s unlike anyone Thomasina has ever met. He’s aloof, eccentric and exceptionally kind. He’s also totally unconcerned with the physical flaws that have always defined Thomasina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two form a bond that neither has had before. It’s possible that it could become something more, but Thomasina also wonders if it’s too good to be true. By putting her heart on the line, Thomasina may open herself to heartbreak. But she may also open herself to so much more.</description>

      <![CDATA[Amanda Prowse is the queen of emotionally intricate women’s fiction and this book is another fine example of the genre. I loved it from start to finish.

  <description>Amber Patterson is fed up. She’s tired of being a nobody: a plain, invisible woman who blends into the background. She deserves more—a life of money and power like the one blond-haired, blue-eyed goddess Daphne Parrish takes for granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To everyone in the exclusive town of Bishops Harbor, Connecticut, Daphne—a socialite and philanthropist—and her real-estate mogul husband, Jackson, are a couple straight out of a fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber’s envy could eat her alive . . . if she didn't have a plan. Amber uses Daphne’s compassion and caring to insinuate herself into the family’s life—the first step in a meticulous scheme to undermine her. Before long, Amber is Daphne’s closest confidante, traveling to Europe with the Parrishes and their lovely young daughters, and growing closer to Jackson. But a skeleton from her past may undermine everything that Amber has worked towards, and if it is discovered, her well-laid plan may fall to pieces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With shocking turns and dark secrets that will keep you guessing until the very end, &lt;em&gt;The Last Mrs. Parrish&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh, juicy, and utterly addictive thriller from a diabolically imaginative talent.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In this riveting tale of psychological suspense, a divorce lawyer risks her career, her sanity, and her life when she falls into an illicit, all-consuming affair with her client—who becomes the primary suspect in his estranged wife’s sudden disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young divorce lawyer Francine Day has methodically built her career doing everything right. She’s one big case away from securing her place among London’s legal elite. But when she meets her new client, Martin Joy, the natural caution that has protected Francine and fueled her rise melts away. Powerless to fight the irresistible magnetism between them, client and counsel tumble into a blistering affair that breaks every rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Martin insists his marriage is over, Francine doesn’t believe him. Certain details he’s told her don’t quite add up. Consumed with a passion she cannot control and increasingly obsessed with Martin’s relationship with his wife, Donna, Francine follows the woman one night . . . and discovers her having dinner with her supposedly soon-to-be-ex-husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Francine awakens in her neighbor’s apartment with blood on her clothes and no recollection of what transpired after she spied Donna and Martin together. Then Francine receives more devastating news: Martin’s wife has vanished. That dinner was the last place anyone has seen Donna Joy alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Francine finds herself caught in a dangerous labyrinth of deception, lies, and secrets, in which one false move could lead to her undoing. What happened that night and why can’t Francine remember? Where is Donna and who is responsible for her disappearance? The further Francine goes to find answers, the tighter the net seems to draw—around her lover, herself, and the life she’s meticulously built.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So cue a trip to a sun-drenched Greek island, ouzo cocktails, a trip down memory lane... and Alex Hallas, the man Beth has never quite forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they dance under the stars, the sand beneath their toes, old feelings begin to resurface and Beth might just have a chance to take back her life. If they can learn to love the people they've become... &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a sweet, gentle story of lost love, re-evaluating life and new beginnings and it was charming from start to finish. I loved the fact that this was not a book about twenty-somethings, but people slightly later on in life who have made mistakes, lived life a little and are making decisions...]]>

  <description>Not just another romance, but a story of escapism, coincidences, friendship, luck and most of all... love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chickens Eat Pasta is the tale of how a young Englishwoman starts a new life after watching a video showing a chicken eating spaghetti in a mediaeval hill village in central Italy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Here I was, 26 years old, alone and numb with boredom at the prospect of a future which until recently had seemed to be just what I wanted.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some recent bestsellers, this is not simply an account of a foreigner’s move to Italy, but a love story written from the unusual perspective of both within and outside of the story. As events unfold, the strong storyline carries with it a rich portrayal of Italian life from the inside, with a supporting cast of memorable characters. Along the way, the book explores and captures the warmth and colour of Italy, as well as some of the cultural differences – between England and Italy, but also between regional Italian lifestyles and behaviour. It is a story with a happy ending. The author and her husband are still married, with three children, who love the old house on the hill (now much restored) almost as much as she does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chickens Eat Pasta is Clare’s autobiography, and ultimately a love story – with the house itself and with the man that Clare met there and went on to marry. If you yearn for a happy ending, you won’t be disappointed. It’s a story that proves anything is possible if you only try.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s taking her life back, one step at a time…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grace&lt;/b&gt; thought she had it all. Living in the beautiful village of Little Ollington, along with head teacher husband &lt;b&gt;Mark&lt;/b&gt; and gorgeous son, &lt;b&gt;Archie&lt;/b&gt;, she devoted herself to being the perfect mum and the perfect wife, her little family giving her everything she ever wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until that fateful day when she walked in on Mark kissing his secretary - and her perfect life fell apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now she's a single mum to Archie, trying to find her way in life and keep things together for his sake. Saturday nights consist of a Chinese takeaway eaten in front of the TV clad in greying pyjamas, and she can’t remember the last time she had a kiss from anyone aside from her dog, &lt;b&gt;Becks&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grace’s life needs a shake up – fast. So when gorgeous gardener &lt;b&gt;Vinnie&lt;/b&gt; turns up on her doorstep, his twinkling eyes suggesting that he might be interested in more than just her conifers, she might just have found the answer to her prayers. But as Grace falls deeper for Vinnie, ten-year-old Archie fears that his mum finding love means she’ll never reconcile with the dad he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when ex-husband Mark begs her for another chance, telling her he’s changed from the man that broke her heart, Grace finds herself with an impossible dilemma. Should she take back Mark and reunite the family that Archie loves? Or risk it all for a new chance of happiness? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A funny, feel good romance about finding your own path and changing your life for the better – readers of Cathy Bramley, Jill Mansell and Josie Silver will love this uplifting read. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if you had a second chance at first love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;She feels lost in social situations, saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way. She just can't read people. She prefers the quiet solitude of books or playing chess to being around others. Apart from Jonathan. She liked being around him, but she hasn't seen him for ten years. Until now that is. And she's not sure he'll want to see her again after what happened all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annika Rose likes being alone. &lt;br /&gt;Except that, actually, she doesn't like being alone at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Girl He Used to Know&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting novel full of surprising revelations that keep you turning the page. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Jojo Moyes, Gail Honeyman, Jill Santopolo and &lt;i&gt;Sliding Doors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Sunshine Hideaway, with its big bay windows and stunning view of Sunflower Island’s golden beaches, is the only place Madison Skylar has ever truly thought of as home. Could returning to the island be the second chance she needs? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When &lt;b&gt;twenty-three-year-old Madison &lt;/b&gt;arrives at The Sunshine Hideaway, she discovers the beautiful little guesthouse is falling into disrepair. With the help of old friends &lt;b&gt;Amy&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Connor&lt;/b&gt;, Madison throws herself into creating a gorgeous wellness retreat, introducing yoga sessions, adventure walks and ice-cream sundaes with a delicious twist. &lt;b&gt;But will it be enough to save her childhood home?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Handsome and mysterious&lt;b&gt; Connor &lt;/b&gt;has lived on Sunflower Island his whole life. He works hard as a builder, with his faithful dog Jaws by his side, but something is missing and he dreams of bigger things. As Connor helps to revamp The Sunshine Hideaway, this could be his opportunity to tell the woman he’s secretly been in love with for years how he really feels… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As spontaneous and fun-loving Madison settles into life on the close-knit island, sparks fly between her and shy Connor as they clash on the reinvention of the guesthouse. Are the they too different to make things work or will Madison and Connor finally find true love this year? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An utterly perfect, feel-good romance about the power of friendship, the meaning of home and the joy of falling in love in the sunshine.

  <description>Most stories begin with either an unforeseen turn of events or a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krank has a problem. For centuries, the people of the island have lived on the animals and plants to be found there. It was bliss and so the population grew. It was not until very recently anyone noticed that the quantity of plants and animals had not. The delicate balance of the ecosystem has tipped and food is dwindling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The King assigned the island's two resident self-proclaimed geniuses, the Creators, to find a solution. The fruits of their labour ripen into the invention of the world's first aquatic transportation device and promises to provide passage from the island to search further afield for food and resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there it is. Problem solved. End of story. Barring any unforeseen turn of events...</description>

  <description>When successful jewellery designer Isla Ashton unexpectedly inherits her eccentric Aunt Kate’s Caribbean island, she is obligated to return to the place she associates with heartache and regret. To where she grew up and fell in love with her childhood friend, Leo Fernandez. Fully intent on selling the island and finally putting the past behind her, Isla is soon compelled to put together the pieces of what really happened on a fateful night ten-years before. She begins to believe that in going to prison, Leo hadn’t only been shielding her from the same fate. She also starts to suspect that her late Aunt hadn’t been entirely honest in sending her away under the guise of recriminations. Who had they both been protecting and why?</description>

Exotic locales, mystery, scandal, a whiff of piracy and romance – what more could one ask from one little book?...]]>

  <description>You don't read the book. It reads you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumors of a deadly book have been floating around the dark corners of the deep web. A disturbing tale about a mysterious figure who preys on those who read the book and subjects them to a world of personalized terror. Jesse Wheeler--former guitarist of the heavy metal group The Rising Dead--was quick to discount the ominous folklore associated with the book. It takes more than some urban legend to frighten him. Hell, reality is scary enough. Seven years ago his greatest responsibility was the nightly guitar solo. Then one night when Jesse was blackout drunk, he accidentally injured his son, leaving him permanently disabled. Dreams of being a rock star died when he destroyed his son's future. Now he cuts radio jingles and fights to stay clean. But Jesse is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legend is real--and tonight he will become the protagonist in an elaborate scheme specifically tailored to prey on his fears and resurrect the ghosts from his past. Jesse is not the only one in danger, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By reading the book, you have volunteered to participate in the author's deadly game, with every page drawing you closer to your own personalized nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real horror doesn't begin until you reach the end. That's when the evil comes for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flame Tree Press is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is my first book by David F. Ross and I had no idea what to expect so I have to say that what I discovered kind of took my breath away.

  <description>Aside from a quaint amusement park, the small town of Lakeview offers little excitement for Duane, Savannah, and their friends. They're about to endure their ten-year high school reunion when their lives are shattered by the arrival of an ancient, vengeful evil. The werewolf. The first attack leaves seven dead and four wounded. And though the beast remains on the loose and eager to spill more blood, the sleepy resort town is about to face an even greater terror. Because the four victims of the werewolf's fury are changing. They're experiencing unholy desires and unimaginable cravings. They'll prey on the innocent and the depraved. They'll settle old scores and act on their basest desires. Soon, they'll plunge the entire town into nightmare. Lakeview is about to become Wolf Land. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launching in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

I have never read anything by this author before, not being a huge reader of horror, but I have heard my fellow bloggers praising him as being an exciting voice in the genre and now I can see why.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The path of true love never did run smooth…did it?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kelsey Anderson&lt;/b&gt; is stuck in a rut so big, she’ll need a 4-wheel drive to get out. She’s just been made redundant from her dead-end job, and boyfriend Fran is so busy climbing up the career ladder that he’s forgotten how to have fun. She needs to change her life – and fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stumbling across an advert for tour guides in Stratford-Upon-Avon seems like the perfect way to bring the sunshine back. In an impulsive move, she moves from her small Scottish village to Shakespeare’s birthplace, armed only with a suitcase and her battered copy of Shakespeare’s &lt;i&gt;Sonnets&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kelsey quickly falls in love with the place, her job as a tourist guide allowing her to explore every inch of the picture-perfect town, from cosy cafes to the picturesque banks of the river. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it’s not just the town that captures her heart, as she finds herself torn between the actors &lt;b&gt;Will&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jonathan&lt;/b&gt; who both vie for her affections. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But will beautiful &lt;b&gt;Peony&lt;/b&gt;, the lead actress at the Oklahoma theatre company where Jonathan is playing Oberon in &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream&lt;/i&gt;, play a role in keeping Kelsey and Jonathan apart? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or will flirtatious, charming Will, the fellow tour guide who has set his sights on Kelsey, keep the star-crossed lovers from finding their happy ending? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A gorgeously uplifting, feel good romance that will captivate readers of Holly Martin, Cathy Bramley and Milly Johnson. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

It was a breath of fresh air that I needed after a heavy weekend of thrillers, emotional reads and a lot of intense working on my own book.

  <description>The bullet in his brain isn't the problem. She is. &lt;br /&gt; Michael North is a hero, with a bullet in the brain to prove it. A bullet which has rewired his neural pathways and heightened his sense of intuition. A bullet which is driving him mad. Working for an extra-governmental agency called The Board, North knows one thing for sure. He is very good at killing very bad guys. But what happens when a hero is ordered to kill a good woman rather than a bad man? Because it turns out that rising political star, Honor Jones, MP, can't stop asking the right questions about the wrong people. &lt;br /&gt; He should follow orders. &lt;br /&gt; Shouldn't he? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Beautiful, intensely moving and laugh-out-loud funny. ‘Where’d You Go, Bernadette meets Britt-Marie Was Here… This lovely unexpected read left me questioning – could I leave all I know behind for a chance at love?’ NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Eliza Bloom: She likes to live life by the rules: long, blue skirt on Thursdays, dinner with mother on Fridays and if someone tells you a Valentine should be anonymous, give your new husband a blank card. Nothing is out of place in her ordered life… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But last night her teenage daughter found something in a hidden shoebox that no-one was supposed to see and started asking questions. Questions that might just change everything in Eliza’s carefully constructed world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Eliza as she shows you how to run away with the love of your life (quite fast actually, as your family are coming after you), how to make your grandfather happy (this might involve a little bit of lying), how to let someone you love go (actually, this never gets easier) and how (now, this is a bad idea) to keep secrets from your new husband. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to truly live is to learn how to open your heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An uplifting and heartbreaking novel about finding yourself, perfect for fans of Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, The Keeper of Lost Things and The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers absolutely love The Two Hearts of Eliza Bloom: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Charming and, ultimately, uplifting… laugh-out-loud funny yet also, at times, heartbreaking… a feel-good story about staying true to yourself.’ Goodreads Reviewer &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A sweet &amp;amp; refreshing read. I flew through this book really enjoyed it! Would recommend this to anyone.’ NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘It’s light, is heartfelt, it’s sensitive, it’s funny (at times laugh out loud)... I really enjoyed it. I got lost in their world and wanted to keep learning about their lives… This is the perfect read for when you’re chilling on the beach, preferably with a cocktail within arm’s reach.’ Reading with KT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A stellar read with suspense and intrigue up until the very end. Delightful!’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A lovely story, showing us life is not lived on a straight line, and sometimes we have to go back in order to move forward.’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars</description>

      <![CDATA[The blurb of this book doesn’t really give you a clue what to expect between the covers and gives very little hint of the main plot device of the novel, so it is going to be quite difficult to write a comprehensive, spoiler-free review. Still, I’m up for a challenge so let’s give it a go.<br /><b...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The sky is cornflower blue, the air is scented with the smell of fresh apple blossom and Lizzie Lovell can’t wait to start her new life in the mill on Magnolia Lane. But is she just about to fall in love with someone she shouldn’t? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Lizzie loses her larger-than-life Dad she doesn’t know how to move forward. Encouraged by a childhood dream she shared with her beloved father, she is determined to continue his legacy and moves to the old Mill on Magnolia lane, a place he had always longed to own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Restoring the old windmill is a much bigger job than Lizzie bargained for, especially when she is distracted by her new next door neighbour Jude, who has temptingly twinkly eyes and a body to die for. But when Jude’s ex- girlfriend Harriet arrives back on the scene, Lizzie begins to wonder if life wasn’t far simpler before she moved to the mill. Especially when it emerges that Harriet knows something about Jude’s past, something that could shatter her new start and her heart into smithereens … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If your heart is warmed by Jenny Colgan, Lucy Diamond and Josie Silver’s &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt;, you’ll fall in love with this beautiful feel-good story about finding love when you least expect it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about Tilly Tennant’s books: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;An absolute gem&lt;/b&gt;! … Spellbinding! … totally addictive reading … an enchanting tale that will &lt;b&gt;fill you full of emotions and set your pulse racing … truly amazing’&lt;/b&gt; Goodreads Reviewer, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Absolutely stunning … you instantly get drawn into the story … &lt;b&gt;I couldn't put it down.&lt;/b&gt; It's heart-warming and will &lt;b&gt;leave you with that warm fuzzy feeling&lt;/b&gt;. A beautiful novel!’ &lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, 5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I was hooked … I just love it …&lt;/b&gt; Gave me a warm feeling inside and it’s full of heart, passion and love, just perfect!’ &lt;i&gt;Simona’s Corner of Dreams&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I'm fully in love with this story and Alessandro is my new book boyfriend 🇮🇹❤️️🇮🇹❤️️ … It's such a fluffy, romantic read, it'll give you a cavity. It also had me longing to go back to Italy … It should also come with the warning "this book will give you travelitis – read with caution"’ &lt;i&gt;Darcy’s Book Blog&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Bloody brilliant &lt;/b&gt;… I loved being back with the characters … Oh I just enjoyed everything about it!’ &lt;b&gt;5 Stars&lt;/b&gt; – &lt;i&gt;I Love Reading&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I loved every minute of it …&lt;b&gt; I was glued to my Kindle for a few days that's for sure! &lt;/b&gt;... A really brilliant read that will leave you hooked even after a few pages’ &lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I absolutely loved it. The story weaves together a tale of love, friendship, trust, desire and so much more. &lt;b&gt;I will be reading more by this talented author&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Haven’t Got a Clue&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

For Gatsby - young, handsome, fabulously rich - always seems alone in the crowd, watching and waiting, although no one knows what for. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life he is hiding a secret longing that can never be fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt;, Fitzgerald brilliantly captures both the disillusionment of post-war America and the moral failure of a society obsessed with wealth and status. But he does more than render the essence of a particular time and place, for in chronicling Gatsby's tragic pursuit of his dream, Fitzgerald re-creates the universal conflict between illusion and reality.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A joyously romantic, feel-good summer read that will make you laugh, cry and fall in love. Eva Blue is about to go on a trip of a lifetime, but one adventure she didn't count on was falling in love...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva is quite content with her life in London. In her job as a cover designer, she works at home, and often in her cosy pyjamas. She's happy to stay in her safe little world and not explore much outside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is the opposite of her mum, a free spirit who craved finding adventure and thrills in all corners of the world. But on the day her mum’s will is finalised, Eva finds a list of all the dreams her mum wanted to achieve in her life. Things she never did because she fell pregnant with Eva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva decides these dreams will not go unfulfilled — she is going to be brave and complete them for her mum. As Eva has no experience travelling the world, she hires a guide to go with her on this holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous but rude Thor Anderson is not the person she would choose to accompany her on this journey, but somehow she gets stuck with him. As they discover the world together Eva starts to think he might not be as bad as she first thought. She is swept away by Thor's kindness and mischievous sense of humour. But will it be a simple holiday romance or could this wonderful adventure lead to so much more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stunning new story from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Cottage on Sunshine Beach&lt;/i&gt;. Discover an unforgettable romance this summer. If you enjoy reading Sarah Morgan, Miranda Dickinson and Jill Mansell, this book is for you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fans of Cathy Bramley, Debbie Johnson and Jenny Colgan will fall in love with the Cosy Kettle café, where slices of lemon meringue pie are served in the sun-dappled garden – and where Callie’s new beginning collides with an old flame…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After yet another failed romance, twenty-six-year-old &lt;b&gt;Callie Fulbright&lt;/b&gt; is giving up on love. She’s determined to throw all her efforts into her very own, brand-new café: &lt;b&gt;The Cosy Kettle. &lt;/b&gt;Serving hot tea, cherry tarts and a welcoming smile to the friendly locals proves to be the perfect distraction, and Callie feels a flush of pride at the fledging business she’s built. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But her new-found confidence is soon put to the test when her gorgeous ex reappears in the quaint little village. She’ll never forget the heartache &lt;b&gt;Noah&lt;/b&gt; caused her years ago, but when they bump into each other on the cobbled streets of Honeyford she can’t help but feel a flutter in her chest… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Callie and Noah share laughter and memories, she starts to wonder if this could be her second chance at happiness. But when Callie discovers that someone is mysteriously trying to ruin the café’s reputation… she has an awful suspicion that Noah knows who’s involved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Was she wrong to ever trust him again? And can she find out who’s behind the lies and rumours, before it’s too late for the Cosy Kettle? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers are loving Liz Eeles’ books:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Stunning… Perfect… Serious laugh-out-loud moments… Absolutely gorgeous.’ &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Magical…&lt;/b&gt; A gorgeous read, perfect for snuggling up in a blanket with a warm drink. &lt;b&gt;I enjoyed every second of this wonderful story!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Simona’s Corner of Dreams&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;An idyllic, beautifully written, heart-warming story that made my heart swell with joy… Absolutely beautiful; I love everything about this book.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;The Writing Garnet Blog&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I absolutely adored this book!!&lt;/b&gt;… It's just too good!!… &lt;b&gt;A very special feel good book&lt;/b&gt;, that &lt;b&gt;will have you laughing out loud, shedding a tear, falling in love&lt;/b&gt; … &lt;b&gt;I really can't recommend this book enough!!!… A perfect read.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Dash Fan Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Completely delightful&lt;/b&gt;… enveloped me with &lt;b&gt;a huge hug&lt;/b&gt;… I &lt;b&gt;loved&lt;/b&gt; the whole feel of the book… had me smiling… &lt;b&gt;gave me a warm fuzzy feeling&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Rachel’s Random Reads&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Fantastic… Hilarious…&lt;/b&gt; I am loving Liz Eeles’ writing style, she has a great way of describing her characters so that they feel so real.’ &lt;i&gt;Rachel’s Random Reads&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A breath of fresh air… &lt;b&gt;I knew I was going to love this book&lt;/b&gt; and I wasn't wrong.

  <description>An international sensation, this hilarious, feel-good novel is narrated by an oddly charming and socially challenged genetics professor on an unusual quest: to find out if he is capable of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Tillman, professor of genetics, has never been on a second date. He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/i&gt; is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges.</description>

  <description>In a quiet village surrounded by ancient woods and the imposing Italian Alps, a man is found naked with his eyes gouged out. It is the first in a string of gruesome murders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superintendent Teresa Battaglia, a detective with a background in criminal profiling, is called to investigate. Battaglia is in her mid-sixties, her rank and expertise hard-won from decades of battling for respect in the male-dominated Italian police force. While she’s not sure she trusts the young city inspector assigned to assist her, she sees right away that this is no ordinary case: buried deep in these mountains are whispers of a dark and dangerous history, possibly tied to a group of eight-year-old children toward whom the killer seems to gravitate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Teresa inches closer to the truth, she must also confront the possibility that her body and mind, worn down by age and illness, may fail her before the chase is over.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is the debut novel by Ilaria Tuti, and the first novel featuring Detective Teresa Battaglia, and I have to say it is impressive to see such a strong and unique novel coming from the pen of a brand new author. Everything about this book is accomplished and confident, you would be forgiven for...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“A pool of blood, an abduction, swirling blizzards, a haunting mystery, yes, Wes Markin’s One Last Prayer for the Rays has all the makings of an absorbing thriller. I recommend that you give it a go.” –Bestselling Author Alan Gibbons &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School should be the safest place in the world. Not this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DCI Michael Yorke faces his most harrowing case yet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 12-year-old Paul disappears from school, Yorke’s only clue is a pool of animal blood. Fearing the worst, he turns toward the most obvious suspect, recently released local murderer, Thomas Ray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the snow in Salisbury worsens, Ray’s mutilated body is discovered, and Yorke is left with no choice but to journey into the sinister heart of a demented family that has plagued the community for generations. Can he save the boy? Or will the evil he discovers change him forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Last Prayer for the Rays, introducing DCI Michael Yorke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are readers saying about One Last Prayer for the Rays?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“WOW!! what a page turner. I stayed up waaaay later than I should have done to find out what was going to happen next. The characters were "real" but with not too much detail so it was boring and the storyline was gripping. I can't wait to find out what happens next with DCI Yorke!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Great twist and a lot of on the edge of your seat action. if you like a great who done it story then this is a must read.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I recommend this great page turner, original style and good in-depth research that all makes for a great read.”</description>

  <description>As the UK's top forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd has spent a lifetime uncovering the secrets of the dead. When death is sudden or unexplained, it falls to Shepherd to establish the cause. Each post-mortem is a detective story in its own right - and Shepherd has performed over 23,000 of them. Through his skill, dedication and insight, Dr Shepherd solves the puzzle to answer our most pressing question: how did this person die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From serial killer to natural disaster, 'perfect murder' to freak accident, Shepherd takes nothing for granted in pursuit of truth. And while he's been involved in some of the most high-profile cases of recent times, it's often the less well known encounters that prove the most perplexing, intriguing and even bizarre. In or out of the public eye, his evidence has put killers behind bars, freed the innocent and turned open-and-shut cases on their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a life in death, bearing witness to some of humanity's darkest corners, exacts a price and Shepherd doesn't flinch from counting the cost to him and his family.</description>

  <description>Sail away to beautiful Croatia for summer sun, sparkling turquoise seas and a will-they-won’t-they romance you won’t be able to put down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When no-nonsense, down-to-earth Maddie Wilcox is offered the chance to work on a luxury yacht for the summer, she can’t say no. Yes she’ll be waiting on the posh guests… But island-hopping around the Adriatic sea will more than make up for it – especially when Nick, her best friend Nina’s brother, is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly when they meet on board and Maddie can’t believe self-entitled jerk Nick is really related to Nina. But in a secret, picture-perfect cove, away from the real world, Maddie and Nick discover they might have more in common than they realise…</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  The feel-good read of 2019, perfect for fans of Lucy Diamond and Karen Swan.  &lt;p&gt;Bestselling Brianna Middleton has won the hearts of millions of readers with her sweeping - and steamy - love stories. But the girl behind the typewriter is struggling... Not only does she have writer's block, but she's a world-famous romance author with zero romance in her own life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the opportunity to spend the summer teaching at a writer's retreat in an idyllic villa on the shores of Lake Garda - owned by superstar author Arran Jamieson - could this be just the thing to fire up Brie's writing - and romantic - mojo? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brie's sun-drenched Italian summer could be the beginning of this writer's very own happy-ever-after... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Escape the January blues with this sun-drenched, heart-warming story from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Snowflakes Over Holly Cove&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What readers are saying about Lucy Coleman...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I adored this book. A wonderful escapist read ... For me, it's a 5 star read!' Katherine, Katherine's Book Universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I adored this beautifully written tale. The score is a well deserved and easy 5* out of 5*' Ginger Book Geek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This book gives you all the feels. It'll make you want to move to France and start a new life ... Lucy Coleman has a way of writing where it feels like you're actually there standing beside Anna and you mentally really feel involved in the story' Stacey, The Cosiest Corner. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The new must-read standalone crime thriller from the author of &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Widow&lt;/i&gt;, and the Richard &amp;amp; Judy No. 1 bestseller, &lt;i&gt;The Child&lt;/i&gt; - featuring unforgettable journalist, Kate Waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The police belonged to another world – the world they saw on the television or in the papers. Not theirs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two eighteen-year-old girls go missing on their gap year in Thailand, their families are thrust into the international spotlight: desperate, bereft and frantic with worry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Kate Waters always does everything she can to be first to the story, first with the exclusive, first to discover the truth – and this time is no exception. But she can’t help but think of her own son, who she hasn’t seen in two years since he left home to go traveling. This time it’s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the case of the missing girls unfolds, they will all find that even this far away, danger can lie closer to home than you might think . . .</description>

  <description>Home Is Where The Nightmare Is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful double room to let to single person&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa, a troubled young woman with a past, can’t believe her luck when she finds a beautiful room to rent in a large house. The live-in owners are a kind and welcoming couple. Everything is fine until she finds a suicide note hidden in her room. But when the couple insist this man didn’t exist and that Lisa is their first tenant, Lisa begins to doubt herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compelled to undercover the secrets of the man who lived in the room before her, Lisa is alarmed when increasingly disturbing incidents start to happen. Someone doesn’t want Lisa to find out the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the four walls of this house and its secrets begin to close in on Lisa, she descends into a hellish hall of mirrors where she’s not sure what’s real and what’s not as she claws her way towards the truth…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did this room already claim one victim?&lt;br /&gt;Is it about to take another?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;I'm Eddie Collins, a CSI. This is the story of how I saw a dead man die.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was finishing up at a sudden death in an old house, waiting for the body snatchers to arrive, when I heard a noise from the cellar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had time to kill, so I went to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out I wasn't the only one with killing on his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like fast-paced crime thrillers with a forensic slant, raw emotions, and characters that reach out of the book and grab you by the throat, you’ll love Andrew Barrett’s CSI Eddie Collins series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out what's in that cellar, buy &lt;i&gt;The Lock&lt;/i&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Andrew Barrett is the best-selling author of the Eddie Collins Series. It will appeal to fans of authors like Ian Rankin, Robert Bryndza and Kathy Reichs.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;What people are saying about &lt;i&gt;The Lock&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Barrett, you know how to snatch the breath from a reader’s chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is dark and ugly but has just enough humour dotted around to make you giggle when you know you really shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writing, as strong as always, is crisp, immediate and loaded with sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This novella sucks you right in from the first page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barrett is the master of tension with laugh out loud moments interspersed throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to remind myself to breathe. The Lock is graphic, imaginative, and brilliantly written. Truly breath-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love how the tension escalates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to stop reading....you can’t!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Barrett is a master of his game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Lock” by Andrew Barrett is a macabre little thriller of a novella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the class of Alfred Hitchcock, a seriously disturbing black and white story that will keep you awake after you hit the sack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my favourite Eddie Collins CSI novella yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the way Andrew Barrett adds the wit and humour into the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliant story, great humour and very scary! Loved It!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had me scared out of my wits one minute laughing myself silly the next!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh how I love Andy's writing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is dark and twisted; it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this book is a novella it packs a mighty punch and will keep you hooked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is the third book in a series featuring private detective Maier. I haven’t read books one and two but this did not hinder my enjoyment of this book which can easily be read as a standalone. However, reading books one and two first would fill in some back story and give a deeper understanding...]]>

  &lt;strong&gt;Preorder the brand new romantic comedy from bestselling author Christie Barlow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Love Heart Lane…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Flick Simons returns to the small village of Heartcross she only expected to stay for a few days. The white-washed cottages of Love Heart Lane might be her home, but the place holds too many painful memories, and of one man in particular – Fergus Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a winter storm sweeps in, the only bridge connecting the village to the main land is swept away! As the villagers pull together, Flick finds herself welcomed back by the friends she once left behind. And as the snow begins to melt, maybe there is a chance that Fergus’s heart will thaw too…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The second book in the Sean Denton series. A young woman is trying to rebuild her life after prison, but someone is out there who won't let her forget what she's done. Racial tension is bubbling up on the Chasebridge Estate and Sean is drawn back into a web of family and neighbours he'd rather avoid. When a body is found in the stairwell of a block of flats, Sean is right at the heart of the case.</description>

She is more at home reading and knitting in her cluttered little flat than going out partying and socialising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;79-year-old Brenda is full of wise and wonderful advice, but when she’s diagnosed with dementia her life begins to change. Before her memories slip away for ever, Brenda is desperate to fulfil one last wish – to see Lucy happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gifting Lucy the locket that helped Brenda find her own true love, she hopes to push her reticent neighbour in the right direction. But is Lucy Baker ready for the opportunities and heartbreaks of the real world? It’s about time she put her knitting needles aside and found out…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hopes and Dreams of Lucy Baker will be the most charming, heart-warming and feel-good novel you will read this year, perfect for fans of Ruth Hogan and Gail Honeyman.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim. Upsetting, you say? Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school. Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed. But what the reader knows, her family does not. Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some. But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part. To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>Pride and Prejudice is a novel of manners by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman, Mr. Bennet living in Longbourn. Page 2 of a letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions. Set in England in the early 19th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr and Mrs Bennet's five unmarried daughters after the rich and eligible Mr Bingley and his status-conscious friend, Mr Darcy, have moved into their neighbourhood. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy has difficulty adapting to local society and repeatedly clashes with the second-eldest Bennet daughter, Elizabeth. Pride and Prejudice retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of "most loved books." It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes.</description>

  <description>Marginalized by previous antics, Sam Shephard is on the bottom rung of detective training in Dunedin, and her boss makes sure she knows it. She gets involved in her first homicide investigation, when a university student is murdered in the Botanic Gardens, and Sam soon discovers this is not an isolated incident. There is a chilling prospect of a predator loose in Dunedin, and a very strong possibility that the deaths are linked to a visiting circus . . . Determined to find out who’s running the show, and to prove herself, Sam throws herself into an investigation that can have only one ending . . . Rich with atmosphere, humor, and a dark, shocking plot, &lt;i&gt;The Ringmaster&lt;/i&gt; marks the return of passionate, headstrong police officer, Sam Shephard, in the next installment of Vanda Symon’s evocative series.</description>

  <description>Yvonne Carmichael sits in the witness box. The charge is murder. Before all of this, she was happily married, a successful scientist, a mother of two. Now she's a suspect, squirming under fluorescent lights and the penetrating gaze of the alleged accomplice who's sitting across from her, watching: a man who's also her lover. As Yvonne faces hostile questioning, she must piece together the story of her affair with this unnamed figure who has charmed and haunted her. This is a tale of sexual intrigue, ruthless urges, and danger, which has blindsided her from a seemingly innocuous angle. Here in the courtroom, everything hinges on one night in a dark alley called &lt;i&gt;Apple Tree Yard.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description> Linn B. Halton also writes as Lucy Coleman, the top ten bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Snowflakes Over Holly Cove&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;More than just a holiday romance?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daughter, her job and divorcing her untrustworthy ex are Leah’s main priorities. She isn’t really bothered that her life might be missing a few things. But after winning a prestigious travel blogger award, she’s inundated with offers to review glamorous holiday destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lying around drinking exotic cocktails and being paid for it … what could be better? Perhaps a romantic trip to idyllic Greece to find the one man who might make Leah risk her heart again…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Catching him will make her career - and change her forever.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;August, 1999&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the hottest day of the year, Assistant Commissioner Florence Lovelady attends the funeral of Larry Glassbrook, the convicted murderer she arrested thirty years earlier. A master carpenter and funeral director, Larry imprisoned his victims, alive, in the caskets he made himself. Clay effigies found entombed with their bodies suggested a motive beyond the worst human depravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;June, 1969&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13-year- old Patsy Wood has been missing for two days, the third teenager to disappear in as many months. New to the Lancashire police force and struggling to fit in, WPC Lovelady is sent to investigate an unlikely report from school children claiming to have heard a voice calling for help. A voice from deep within a recent grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;August, 1999&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she tries to lay her ghosts to rest, Florence is drawn back to the Glassbrooks' old house, in the shadow of Pendle Hill, where she once lodged with the family. She is chilled by the discovery of another effigy - one bearing a remarkable resemblance to herself. Is the killer still at large? Is Florence once again in terrible danger? Or, this time, could the fate in store be worse than even her darkest imaginings?</description>

  <description>‘Exquisite’ Veronica Henry&lt;br /&gt;Before &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt; there was…&lt;em&gt; Miss Marley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A seasonal tale of kindness and goodwill&lt;br /&gt;Orphans Clara and Jacob Marley live by their wits, scavenging for scraps in the poorest alleyways of London, in the shadow of the workhouse. Every night, Jake promises his little sister ‘tomorrow will be better’ and when the chance to escape poverty comes their way, he seizes it despite the terrible price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so Jacob Marley is set on a path that leads to his infamous partnership with Ebenezer Scrooge. As Jacob builds a fortress of wealth to keep the world out, only Clara can warn him of the hideous fate that awaits him if he refuses to let love and kindness into his heart…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Miss Marley&lt;/em&gt;, Vanessa Lafaye weaves a spellbinding Dickensian tale of ghosts, goodwill and hope – a perfect prequel to &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Every day, James O’Brien listens to people blaming benefits scroungers, the EU, Muslims, feminists and immigrants. But what makes James’s daily LBC show such essential listening – and has made James a standout social media star – is the careful way he punctures their assumptions and dismantles their arguments live on air, every single morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;How To Be Right&lt;/i&gt;, James provides a hilarious and invigorating guide to talking to people with faulty opinions. With chapters on every lightning-rod issue, James shows how people have been fooled into thinking the way they do, and in each case outlines the key questions to ask to reveal fallacies, inconsistencies and double standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get cornered by ardent Brexiteers, &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail &lt;/i&gt;disciples or little England patriots, this book is your conversation survival guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘I have had a ringside seat as a significant swathe of the British population was persuaded that their failures were the fault of foreigners, that unisex lavatories threatened their peace of mind and that ‘all Muslims’ must somehow apologise for terror attacks by extremists. I have tried to dissuade them and sometimes succeeded… The challenge is to distinguish sharply between the people who told lies and the people whose only offence was to believe them.’&lt;br /&gt;James O’Brien</description>

  <description>Two people. Ten chances. One unforgettable love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic... and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

  <description>Her eyes were closed. From a distance the blood around her neck might have looked like a necklace, but up close her body told a different tale. She had been murdered. A tiny songbird lay beside her, its neck broken… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Tom Fabian’s past is catching up with him. It has been years since the most famous case of his career – when his evidence put infamous serial killer Christopher Wisher behind bars forever. But when Wisher summons a reluctant Fabian to his prison cell to hand over a diary, he realises that Wisher’s twisted games are far from over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after Fabian’s visit, Wisher is found dead in his cell. And a few days later, the police find a woman's body bearing Wisher’s signature, a dead songbird. But the police never released this detail to the public … so who has Wisher been talking to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabian is desperate to find the killer before another innocent life is taken. But as more bodies turn up, Fabian begins to realise that Wisher may have handed him the clues before he died. Is the twisted serial killer still pulling the strings from beyond the grave…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can’t get enough of crime thrillers by Adam Croft, Rachel Caine or Melinda Leigh, you will love The Songbird Girls. &lt;br /&gt;* Previously Titled: The Songbird *</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When Audrey Marshall sends her daughter Emily to the religious boarding school where she herself was educated a generation before, memories return - memories of a culture of child sexual abuse presided over by a highly-regarded priest.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Watching her friend dragged away in handcuffs, Josie couldn't believe for one second that Gretchen had killed that poor boy. Confession or not, someone else was involved. She would find out who…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the body of a young student is found on the driveway of a local Denton home, a photograph pinned to his collar, &lt;b&gt;Detective Josie Quinn&lt;/b&gt; is first on the scene. The house belongs to &lt;b&gt;Gretchen Palmer, &lt;/b&gt;a dedicated member of Josie’s team, missing for the last twenty-four hours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Working around the clock, Josie is stopped in her tracks when Gretchen hands herself in to the police.&lt;b&gt; She knows that there’s no way Gretchen could ever be a killer, so why would she confess to a murder she didn’t commit? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Digging deep into Gretchen’s secretive life, Josie uncovers a link between the boy, the photograph and a devastating case in Gretchen’s past. But just when Josie thinks she has it all figured out, the bodies of a young couple surface on the other side of town. &lt;b&gt;Can Josie get to the truth in time to save her friend from a life in prison or certain death? &lt;/b&gt;</description>

It’s &lt;b&gt;a rural backwater&lt;/b&gt; deep in the forests of south western Australia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lucy tries to enlist the help of the local police, but &lt;b&gt;she is met with hostility&lt;/b&gt;. She befriends a man who might help her cause. Yet he is not quite who he says he is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the locals begin to resent her presence in the town, &lt;b&gt;danger quickly mounts&lt;/b&gt;. The town has secrets and they seem to centre on the enigmatic Samuel Nightmesser, its wealthy benefactor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What connects her missing brother to this &lt;b&gt;grim boondock&lt;/b&gt;? And why do the townsfolk want rid of Lucy? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the story unfolds we are &lt;b&gt;immersed in a creepy, claustrophobic drama&lt;/b&gt; in which everything is at stake. If you like books with a strong female lead that keep you on the edge of your seat, you’ve found your next favourite read. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anna Willett is the author of several &lt;b&gt;suspense thrillers that focus on women trying to overcome difficult and dangerous situations&lt;/b&gt;. The full list of her books, in order of publication, is as follows: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BACKWOODS RIPPER &lt;br /&gt;RETRIBUTION RIDGE &lt;br /&gt;UNWELCOME GUESTS &lt;br /&gt;FORGOTTEN CRIMES &lt;br /&gt;CRUELTY’S DAUGHTER &lt;br /&gt;SMALL TOWN NIGHTMARE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of these books are FREE with Kindle Unlimited and, as this one shall soon be, available in paperback. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Britain is a country under surveillance. Neighbours spy on neighbours. Schools enforce loyalty to the state. And children are encouraged to inform on their parents. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Disgraced MP Jennifer Sinclair has earned her freedom but returns home to find everything changed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rita Gurumurthy has been sent to a high security prison. When a sympathetic guard helps her escape she becomes a fugitive, forced to go into hiding. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To reunite her family and win freedom for her son and her friend, Jennifer must challenge her old colleague and rival, the new Prime Minister Catherine Moore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Catherine listen to reason and remove the country from its yoke of fear and suspicion? Or will Jennifer have to reveal the secret only she knows about Catherine, and risk plunging the country into turmoil?</description>

But she can’t catch the culprit alone. Together with facial recognition expert Joe Russell, she strives to get a lead on the elusive murderer, who is always one step ahead of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time is not on their side. The body count is rising, and the attacks are striking closer and closer to home.

  <description>When writer, comedian and Red Dwarf actor Robert Llewellyn's son scrawled a picture of him at Christmas and titled it 'Some Old Bloke', Robert was cast deep into thought about life and what it means to be a bloke and an old one at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this lighthearted, revealing and occasionally philosophical autobiography, we take a meandering route through Robert's life and career: from the sensitive young boy at odds with his ex-military father, through his stint as a hippy and his years of arrested development in the world of fringe comedy, all the way up to the full-body medicals and hard-earned insights of middle age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether he is waxing lyrical about fresh laundry, making an impassioned case for the importance of alternative energy or recounting a detailed history of the dogs in his life, Robert presents a refreshingly open and un-cynical look at the world at large and, of course, the joys of being a bloke.</description>

  <description>A fierce connection… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle Dare is in a good place. She landed a sweet job, teaching at the quaint Fox River Elementary School. She has everything she needs: teaching music and sharing an apartment with her best friend. A simple life, she’s convinced, is all she needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asher Grace knows who he is and what he has to offer. Nothing. A poor boy from the wrong side of town, steel worker, with too much weight on his shoulders as he is trying to hold his family together. Best choice is avoiding too-sweet-for-her-own-good Annabelle at all costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle falls in love with the way she comes to life with Asher. He awakens a hunger for life and love in her that she didn’t know she possessed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asher must learn his worth beyond his upbringing and his past. Annabelle must learn to stoke the fire of life as it burns within her and learn how close she can get before the flames lick her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: In Fierce Grace you will revisit the town of Fox River, NC and a few of the characters from The Guilt of a Sparrow - but this is a stand alone novel with all new characters introduced as well.</description>

  <description>When I was a kid and I’d lost something, my dad always said ‘Go back to the place you last had it’. The problem is that what I’ve lost is… me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate loves her family more than anything, but recently she has started to feel invisible. Lying awake at three a.m. as her husband snores, panicking about shopping lists, birthday parties, and the school bake sale… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She finds herself in the kitchen, gulping water, staring at a postcard of the Eiffel Tower from Shannon, her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, with its red wine, slippery cobbles and curly lampposts. Where the scent of freshly-baked croissants hangs in the air, and Kate last remembers feeling like herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The postcard is a year old. It has just one line on it: When are you coming?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inspiring, feel-good tale of friendship, love, and what happens when running away is the only way you can find your way home. Perfect for fans of Sophie Kinsella, Jane Green and Marian Keyes.</description>

  <description>Are you one of the elect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Helen Hope is a lecturer in eschatology - the study of death, judgement, and the destiny of humankind. She is also a Calvinist nun, her life devoted to atoning for a secret crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a body is found crucified on a Liverpool beach, she forms an unlikely alliance with suspect Mikko Kristensen, lead guitarist in death metal band Total Depravity. Together, they go on the trail of a rogue geneticist who they believe holds the key - not just to the murder, but to something much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the trail is cynical Scouse detective Darren Swift. In his first murder case, he must confront his own lack of faith as a series of horrific crimes drag the city of two cathedrals to the gates of hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science meets religious belief in this gripping murder mystery.</description>

  <description>The 2:00 a.m. call is the first time Lexie Vidler has heard her sister’s voice in years. Annie is a drug addict, a thief, a liar—and in trouble, again. Lexie has always bailed Annie out, given her money, a place to sleep, sent her to every kind of rehab. But this time, she’s not just strung out—she’s pregnant and in premature labor. If she goes to the hospital, she’ll lose custody of her baby—maybe even go to prison. But the alternative is unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As weeks unfold, Lexie finds herself caring for her fragile newborn niece while her carefully ordered life is collapsing around her. She’s in danger of losing her job, and her fiancé only has so much patience for Annie’s drama. In court-ordered rehab, Annie attempts to halt her downward spiral by confronting long-buried secrets from the sisters’ childhood, ghosts that Lexie doesn’t want to face. But will the journey heal Annie, or lead her down a darker path?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both candid and compassionate, Before I Let You Go explores a hotly divisive topic and asks how far the ties of family love can be stretched before they finally break.</description>

  <description>Jennifer Sinclair’s fight to save her political career, her family and her freedom has failed. Traumatised by prison violence, she agrees to transfer to the mysterious British Values Centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rita Gurumurthy has betrayed her country and failed the children in her care. Unlike Jennifer, she has no choice, but finds herself in the centre against her will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both women are expected to conform, to prove their loyalty to the state and to betray everything they hold dear. One attempts to comply, while the other rebels. Will either succeed in regaining her freedom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divide and Rule is 1984 for the 21st century - a chilling thriller examining the ruthless measures the state will take to ensure obedience, and the impact on two women.</description>

  <description>A private jet violently crash-lands on a deserted island. Captain Newton and his stewardess Rebecca are reluctantly forced to band together with the Vanderbach family as a means of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They soon discover the island holds a dark secret the mainland has kept hidden since the 70s. Something monstrous was genetically engineered nearly forty years ago that even nature couldn’t destroy. Now it stalks the group as they venture further into the jungle in search of rescue and escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the group of misfit survivors manage to work together to find a way off the island? As the tension, suspense, and horror rise, they realize time is not on their side … the ravenous creations are drawing closer, and their appetite is insatiable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Such wonderful children. Such a beautiful mother. Such a lovely house. Such endless terror!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't that she didn't love her children. She did. But there was a fortune at stake—a fortune that would assure their later happiness if she could keep the children a secret from her dying father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she and her mother hid her darlings away in an unused attic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the brutal days swelled into agonizing years. Now Cathy, Chris, and the twins wait in their cramped and helpless world, stirred by adult dreams, adult desires, served a meager sustenance by an angry, superstitious grandmother who knows that the Devil works in dark and devious ways. Sometimes he sends children to do his work—children who—one by one—must be destroyed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Way upstairs there are four secrets hidden. Blond, beautiful, innocent struggling to stay alive....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Snow is falling in Little Pondale, lights are twinkling and the smell of pine trees and roasting chestnuts fills the air…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But &lt;b&gt;Mia Ward&lt;/b&gt; is in a bit of a jam. She’d planned to rent out Corner Cottage for Christmas but thanks to best friend, Ella Swann, it’s double-booked. Now Mia’s got to let one ‘party’ down, or find another cottage – fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best friends and single mums, Cathy Cole and Christy Franks want their kids to have an old-fashioned Christmas. Ice-skating, carol singing, making decorations, and tobogganing are on their list of festive fun … but their kids have other things in mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;City bankers, Leo and Hal Hardman are wondering if renting a cottage for Christmas and their parents’ anniversary is such a good idea. Little Pondale is tiny, there’s only one pub, mobile phone reception is non-existent and the cottage doesn’t even have a TV. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Jenny Lake in settling in at her cousin’s bakery, but she’s left her (broken) heart in Florence, and Christmas was never her favourite time of year. And Reverend Glen Fox has taken over at St Michael and All Angels. He’s glad it’s a temporary post because village life is definitely not for him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But luckily, for locals and visitors alike, there’s a sleigh-load of Christmas magic heading for Lily Pond Lane; enough to put a sparkle in everyone’s festive season. Although Christmas may not go quite as each of them has planned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This utterly addictive new novel from bestselling author Holly Martin will make you smile until your cheeks hurt, sob tears of pure joy and fall head over heels in love with a totally unforgettable romance…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isla Rosewood&lt;/b&gt; is creating a new life for herself and her sweet nephew &lt;b&gt;Elliot&lt;/b&gt; in their cosy, yellow-brick family cottage, brimming with special memories. Living in Sandcastle Bay was never part of Isla’s plan but, after her brother Matthew’s tragic accident, her whole world changed as she unexpectedly became a mother to the little boy she adores so much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leo Jackson&lt;/b&gt; was always known as Matthew’s fun-loving and wild best friend. But now Matthew is gone, it’s time to put his colourful past behind him. His role as Elliot’s godfather is the most important thing to him. And even though Leo and Isla are two very different people, they both want to give Elliot the childhood he deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the three of them enjoy time together watching fireworks, baking cakes and collecting conkers, Isla begins to see a softer side to charming Leo, with his twinkling eyes and mischievous sense of humour. And, despite herself, she begins to fall for him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But does Leo feel the same way? Isla knows their situation is complicated but is it too complicated for true love… or will the year end with a happy new beginning for them all? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A glorious, feel-good romance that will make you want to snuggle up under a warm blanket with a hot chocolate and the one you love. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you enjoy reading Sarah Morgan, Jenny Oliver and Lucy Diamond this book is for you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>An elderly artist and her six-year-old granddaughter while away a summer together on a tiny island in the gulf of Finland. Gradually, the two learn to adjust to each other's fears, whims and yearnings for independence, and a fierce yet understated love emerges - one that encompasses not only the summer inhabitants but the island itself, with its mossy rocks, windswept firs and unpredictable seas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of brusque humour and wisdom, &lt;i&gt;The Summer Book&lt;/i&gt; is a profoundly life-affirming story. Tove Jansson captured much of her own experience and spirit in the book, which was her favourite of the novels she wrote for adults. This new edition sees the return of a European literary gem - fresh, authentic and deeply humane.</description>

  <description>Fen has always hated being the centre of attention. &lt;br /&gt;She loves her new job, working behind the scenes at the Little Duck Pond Cafe and baking the scrumptious cakes that have helped its reputation soar. But frankly, she'd rather scrub the public toilet floor with a toothbrush than have to come out and talk to the customers. &lt;br /&gt;She's always been happy to stay in the background as long as she has a good supply of books to escape into. That's her kind of romance - the fictional sort where she can read about other people taking a chance on love, but she doesn't have to risk her own heart. &lt;br /&gt;But that was before Ethan Fox arrived in the village and turned her world upside down. Ethan is a leading light in the local amateur dramatics theatre company and Fen knows he's way out of her league. &lt;br /&gt;But when the popular village Christmas pantomime hits a crisis, Fen and Ethan find themselves thrown together. Can Fen overcome her shyness and find the courage to step on stage and save the day?</description>

  <description>When Tess finds herself unexpectedly alone and back in Ribblemill, the childhood village she thought she’d escaped, she’s sure she can survive a temporary stay. She’s spent a lifetime making the best of things, hasn’t she? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Determined to throw herself into village life, Tess starts a choir and gathers a team of volunteers to restore the walled garden at Ramblings, the local stately home. Everything could be perfect, if she weren’t sharing a cottage and a cat with a man whose manner is more prickly than the nettles she’s removing… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As winter approaches, Tess finds herself putting down her own roots as fast as she’s pulling them up in the garden. But the ghosts of the past hover close by, and Tess must face them if she’s to discover whether home is where her heart has been all along.</description>

  <description>Megan finds mayhem when she arrives in France to bury her Gran and sort out her affairs. She expected difficult encounters with civil servants and red tape but not with wandering chickens, an imperious policeman and a dead body. Together with her unlikely new friend, the elderly and grumpy Alphonse and his canine equivalent, Monsieur Moustache, Megan becomes involved in investigating the fowl-related foul play that’s at work in this sleepy part of rural France.&lt;br /&gt;She’s helped but mainly hindered by the people she comes across. These include the local mayor, who wants Megan to stay and set up a hair salon in his village to help keep it alive. There are the cousins Romain, the gendarme, and Nico, the clumsy but hunky farmer. They have always clashed, but do so constantly now that Megan is on the scene. Michelle, Romain’s terrifying ex who wants him back, appears along the way, as does Claudette, a wheelchair-bound old lady, and Kayla, Megan’s best friend, who is hugely pregnant but not above taking on the forces of French law and order when Megan finds herself the prime suspect after Alphonse is stabbed.&lt;br /&gt;There’s excitement, humour and lots of ruffled feathers in this rom-com slash cosy mystery, the first in a projected series.</description>

  <description>Gifted criminal profiler Nathan Radley has a unique way of thinking that allows him to empathize with the twisted killers he helps capture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nathan a dark secret. He has more in common with the criminals he hunts than anyone could dare to imagine. He lives in constant fear of losing control of his own dark desires...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the headless body of a policeman is dragged from the Thames – an exact enactment of one of his oldest and darkest fantasies, only ever confessed in the pages of his teenage diary – Nathan finds himself the main suspect in the most twisted case of his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone has his diary and is leaking pages to frame him for the disturbing murders he has spent his whole career trying not to commit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more bodies surface and more extracts are released, Nathan has no choice but to go in search of the killer to clear his name. He knows it’s someone dangerous, he knows it’s someone he trusted, but how many precious lives will be lost before he can work out who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nail-biting and unputdownable thriller that fans of Peter James, Angela Marsons and Rachel Abbott will adore.</description>

  <description>Daisy Diamond is a big television star, and she's finally going home. After ten long years away. Back to the gorgeous seaside resort of Port Pol in sunny Cornwall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she's not home five minutes before she realises the mistake she's made. Because her childhood sweetheart Nick Old - affectionately known as 'Devil' in Port Pol - is still living there, running the local bookshop, and has no intention of letting her forget what they once felt for each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daisy is no longer the dewy-eyed romantic of her school days, though. And she's not afraid to show Nick how much she's grown up. Even if it means bending her heart out of shape a little ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another 'Oddest Little Shop' romantic comedy novella from the quirky pen of popular author Beth Good.</description>

Hurrah, we can concentrate on the contents rather than the cover, which is fabulous because the contents are well worth your attention.<br /><br />I loved everything about this little novella.

  <description>In space, no one can hear you clean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Darren's charge-cart gets knocked off the Earth-to-Mars highway and lost in space forever, he thinks his day can't get any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kelly sees Darren accidentally short-circuit a talking lamppost, and its camera captures her face as it expires, she thinks her day can't get any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Pamasonic Teffal, a sentient breadmaker, is sent on a top-secret mission into the depths of the internet and betrayed by her boss, a power-crazed smartphone, she knows this is only the beginning of a day that isn't going to get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Darren, Kelly and Pam in an anarchic comic adventure that takes them from the shining skyscrapers of Singulopolis to the sewers of the Dolestar Discovery, and find out what happens when a person puts down their mop and bucket and says No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battlestar Suburbia will be loved by fans of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Jasper Fforde, as well as anyone who's ever wondered just how long someone can stay under one of those old-fashioned hairdryers.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The answer is: a really very, very long time.</description>

  <description>Sylvia Blackwell is tired. Her grandchildren are being kept away from her, and the expected inheritance that might finally get her middle-aged son to move out has failed to materialise – thanks to her mother's cat. It is becoming increasingly difficult to remain composed. On a romantic clifftop walk for her 47th Wedding Anniversary, an unexpected opportunity leads to a momentous decision that will irretrievably change the course of her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Craft Room is a darkly comic tale of sex, crepe paper, murder and knitting in a sleepy Devon town, with a 'truly original' premise and genuinely jaw-dropping moments. What would you do if unexpectedly freed from bondage you never knew you were in? How would your children cope? How far would you go to protect them from an uncomfortable truth? &lt;br /&gt;You can only push a grandmother so far... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Praise for Weekend Rockstars:- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A classic British romantic comedy in fact, that I genuinely think stands up against the best out there - if Nick Hornby had written this, it would already have been optioned for a film, hit the Bestsellers list and wouldn’t be half as good as it is, because what the hell does he know about being in a covers band? I ask you.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Well written and accessible, this is a study of human nature as much a take on the foibles of budding rockstars.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Great characters, well-written and believable, lots of in-jokes, familiar circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;If you've ever been in a band, wanted to be in a band, even seen a band play, you should read this book” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A fabulous, well written, funny and uplifting read. Totally believable characters. It is hard to believe that this is a debut novel.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I was expecting a niche book, only read by aspiring musicians. Instead I was surprised at the quality of the writing, especially the conversations. Potential film here.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Very accurately captures the euphoria/self loathing of playing "Sex on fire" to a room full of drunken divorcees.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“It is a special book, and they don’t come along too often.”</description>

  <description>Sam Shephard, a young sole-charge police constable in Mataura, is the main character in a new series of crime novels set in New Zealand. When a young mother in the town is brutally murdered (it seems to be a professional job), Sam is at the heart of the police hunt to find the killer. But then Sam's past relationship with the dead woman's husband is revealed. Sam is stood down from the case and is now a prime murder suspect. Frustrated, Sam loses her cool. She can't stop herself making murder inquiries and gets into serious trouble with her police superiors. But then the young constable stumbles onto something. The murdered woman was working as a journalist and had uncovered a local scandal. She'd been killed to keep her quiet. When Sam enters this world she's in real physical danger, until at last a conspiracy is uncovered and the killer revealed. Disillusioned, Sam prepares to leave town. What will she do next?</description>

  <description>Is hunting down every man you’ve kissed the answer to finding Mr Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Evie is invited to the wedding of the guy she’d fancied throughout her teens, it’s the final straw. What’s wrong with her and why can’t she keep a man? &lt;br /&gt;In between consoling herself with ice cream and chocolate, and sobbing her heart out to her cousin Chamaine, Evie has a brainwave – and it all centres around her ‘little black book’ (well, more floral patterned notebook really) – which contains the details of every man she’s ever kissed or dated. Perhaps the cure for her disastrous love life has been nestled within its pages all along … &lt;br /&gt;Does Evie’s little black book really hold the answers, or will she learn that exes are exes for a reason?</description>

  <description>Sasha is just about managing to hold her life together. She is raising her teenage son Zac, coping with an absent husband and caring for her ageing, temperamental and alcoholic mother, as well as holding down her own job. But when Zac begins to suspect that he has a secret sibling, Sasha realises that she must relive the events of a devastating night which she has done her best to forget for the past nineteen years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sasha’s mother, Annie, is old and finds it difficult to distinguish between past and present and between truth and lies. As Annie sinks deeper back into her past, she revisits the key events in her life which have shaped her emotionally. Through it all, she remains convinced that her dead husband Joe is watching and waiting for her. But there’s one thing she never told him, and as painful as it is for her to admit the truth, Annie is determined to go to Joe with a guilt-free conscience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the plot unfurls, traumas are revealed and lies uncovered, revealing long-buried secrets which are at the root of Annie and Sasha’s fractious relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel spans several decades, telling the history of the Stein family from the turn of the twentieth century to the present day. Speaking of her inspiration for her novel, Deborah says; ‘My own mother was evacuated at the age of five during World War Two and my father was a young man working as an ARP warden. This novel is purely fictitious, but I wanted to explore the traumas that many ordinary people of the war generation suffered, experiences which would be quite unimaginable to many of us today and then to contrast them with the issues we all face in the modern day.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deborah Stone read English Literature at Durham University. She lives in North London with her husband, two sons and her dog.</description>

  <description>‘A wistfully entertaining romantic comedy spanning forty years of social and cinematic history, which offers a hommage to one of Billy Wilder’s greatest films and does it proud.’ Jonathan Coe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1969. Hollywood descends on a tiny Scottish village for the making of Billy Wilder’s most ambitious picture yet: a sprawling epic detailing The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. But the formidable director and his crew soon come into conflict with Jim Outhwaite, a young scientist seeking evidence for monsters...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014. Stuck just a short walk from the East London street where she grew up, ambitious Film Studies lecturer Gemma MacDonald is restless and hungry for change. A job offer in the Highlands seems to offer escape – but only at a cost to her relationships with family and an equally ambitious American boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a lost print of Gemma’s favourite film turns up, and with it, an idea…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stories, separated by 45 years, are set on collision course – on the surface of Loch Ness, under the shadow of a castle – by the reappearance of the continuity girl herself: April Bloom.</description>

  <description>North Uist, Outer Hebrides, 1848&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess MacKay has led a privileged life as the daughter of a local landowner, sheltered from the harsher aspects of life. Courted by the eligible Patrick Cooper, the Laird's new commissioner, Jess's future is mapped out, until Lachlan Macdonald arrives on North Uist, amid rumours of forced evictions on islands just to the south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the uncompromising brutality of the Clearances reaches the islands, and Jess sees her friends ripped from their homes, she must decide where her heart, and her loyalties, truly lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against the evocative backdrop of the Hebrides and inspired by the true story of Jessie Balranald, The False Men is a compelling tale of love in a turbulent past that resonates with the upheavals of the modern world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Escape to the seaside village of Little Pondale with Part Four of this heart-warming and romantic, four-part serial. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mia Ward&lt;/b&gt; was amazed to inherit her great-aunt Matilda’s thatched cottage in the tiny seaside village of Little Pondale – especially as Mia didn’t know she had a great-aunt Matilda. She was even more astonished to discover she’d only inherit the place if she lives there for a year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But a lot can happen in a very short time, and life in Little Pondale is not going quite as Mia hoped. She may have finally beaten one fear, but now heartbreak threatens to drown her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when at last, she starts to unravel the mystery of Matilda’s past, she uncovers an extraordinary plan for her own future. Now just who can Mia trust? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the nights draw in and cold winds steal through Sunbeam Cottage, she turns to an unlikely source for comfort and support. But with the fortune teller’s warning still ringing in her ears, is Mia about to make the biggest mistake of her life? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; What everyone is saying about this bestselling serial&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Escape the world for a few hours with this brilliant series where the friendships are real, the romance is believable and the village is just gorgeous. Emily you are quickly becoming one of my favourite authors!” – Katie’s Book Cave - Reviewer&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Charming and engaging read that I struggled to put down." – By the letter book reviews - Reviewer &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The storyline keeps getting better with each moment that passes." -Jess bookish life – Reviewer. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"With a beautiful setting, romance and intrigue, this really is a fantastic series." -Sibzzreads. – Reviewer &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Emily Harvale is a truly wonderful writer and I wish I had discovered her books much earlier."

An absolutely unputdownable mystery novel for fans of Agatha Christie and Faith Martin.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Everything is coming up roses for Robbie Munro, newly married and living in the country with his wife and child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until his wife takes up employment abroad just as old flame, Jill Green, asks him to investigate the unexplained death of her partner. Suspecting foul play, Jill insists Robbie does whatever it takes to find the killer. As Robbie begins his investigation, his father, ex-Police Sergeant Alex Munro, comes under scrutiny. Was the evidence at the trial of a man found guilty of child murder twenty years ago fabricated? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Robbie juggle his duties as a father, investigate his ex’s claims, and prove his father’s innocence?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;b&gt;One moment of carelessness. Four shattered lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychological suspense that explores a labyrinth of lies, manipulation and revenge. Perfect for fans of Louise Jenson and Katerina Diamond. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Literary agent Viola Matthews is sure she's met Katherine Baxter before. So when her husband and bestselling novelist Samuel Morton introduces Viola to the quiet, unassuming woman he has offered to mentor, she knows their paths have crossed before. The question is where? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their worlds collide and the bond between Samuel and Katherine deepens, Viola realises she must take control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Viola is right, then Katherine needs to pay for something that happened twelve years ago. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The all NEW heart-stopping, un-put-downable serial killer thriller from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Mummy's Favourite&lt;/i&gt;. Perfect for the fans of Angela Marsons. &lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A baby lies abandoned amongst the rubbish; her tiny face as white as alabaster, her body as stiff as a miniature doll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young prostitute lies beaten, her figure lying like a mannequin on the frozen concrete, her blood spilt, her life ebbing away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As DC 'Charlie' Stafford and her boss DI Hunter struggle to identify the victim from the violator their hunt brings them to the crack houses of Lambeth, littered with damaged people, their lives scarred by tragedy and violence, most broken beyond repair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As further lives hang in the balance Charlie must enpower the weak to speak out against those who seek to cause harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But can a broken doll ever truly be mended; or will the wounds of the past, fashion the events of the future? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Escape to the seaside village of Little Pondale with Part Three of this heart-warming and romantic, four-part serial. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mia Ward&lt;/b&gt; was amazed to inherit her great-aunt Matilda’s thatched cottage in the tiny seaside village of Little Pondale – especially as Mia didn’t know she had a great-aunt Matilda. She was equally astonished to discover she’d only inherit the place if she lives there for a year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it didn’t take long for Mia and her friends, Ella and Garrick to settle in. Now Mia’s mum, Lori has joined them, and they’re all enjoying village life. Mia’s keen to overcome her fear of water and with Garrick by her side, she’s confident about the future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until a fortune teller’s predictions give everyone cause for concern. Now Mia’s not so sure of anything, except that someone still wants her to leave. That makes her more determined to learn all she can about Matilda – and the codicil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as the mists roll in over the sea, are autumn winds making passions cool? And when more than one unexpected visitor gives Mia a shocking surprise, is everything about to change? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What people are saying about this serial:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; “Absolutely recommend this charming serial… A perfect summer read.” &lt;/b&gt; audiokilledthebookmark - Reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; “With a beautiful setting, romance and intrigue, this really is a fantastic series.

  <description>All the Hidden Truths is the story of a tragic shooting at an Edinburgh college and its aftermath. It is narrated by three women at the heart of the story - the mother of a victim and the mother of the shooter, and DI Helen Birch who is tasked in solving the case. The book is both a "knotty crime novel" and a story of grief "trying to make sense of something that defies reason".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of Kate Atkinson, Denise Mina and Susie Steiner will love it – along with anyone who wants their fiction both moving and gripping.</description>

However, when she discovers that the cosy apartment by the sea, which her grandmother left to her, is under threat from neighbour and property developer, Charlie Hobson, Clemmie realises she can't abandon her home in its time of need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her childhood friends encouraging her, Clemmie decides to turn the apartment into 'The Little Cornish Kitchen' – a boutique pop up pudding club raising money for the repairs to the building in an effort to stop Charlie once and for all. But when Charlie and his easy charm won't seem to go away, everything soon becomes even messier than the state of Clemmie's Cornish kitchen…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why readers love &lt;em&gt;The Little Cornish Kitchen&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Have you ever liked a book so much that you &lt;strong&gt;wanted to give it a hug&lt;/strong&gt;…chicklit GOLD’ &lt;em&gt;Pretty Little Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Jane Linfoot combines &lt;strong&gt;fabulous friendship with gorgeous true love&lt;/strong&gt;…a fantastic captivating story with a sweet romantic ending’ &lt;em&gt;With Love for Books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A character that you &lt;strong&gt;genuinely like&lt;/strong&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Mrs Wheddon Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘The &lt;strong&gt;perfect holiday read&lt;/strong&gt;…you feel as if you are part of the group friends’ &lt;em&gt;Coffee and Kindle Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Where should I begin with this &lt;strong&gt;wonderful, delicious novel.&lt;/strong&gt;..a stunning, fabulous read’ &lt;em&gt;Kat, Goodreads &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘An &lt;strong&gt;uplifting, warm and romantic&lt;/strong&gt; story that was a real pleasure to read’ &lt;em&gt;Rae Reads&lt;/em&gt;</description>
