  <description>It was the worst day of my life. &lt;br /&gt;I know most people say that about something obviously horrific—a first heartbreak, the discovery of a fatal illness, or the funeral of a loved one—but my situation was a little different. &lt;br /&gt;Not only was it my wedding day, but it was also the day I chose to die. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;The first, my Master, my captor, and my impossible love. &lt;br /&gt;The other, his brother, a mafioso I was meant to ensnare and ruin. &lt;br /&gt;If I had any hope of living a normal life reunited with my family, I had to make a choice. &lt;br /&gt;End my old life as I knew it and start fresh, or take down the monsters that hunted me and haunted my Master. &lt;br /&gt;In the end, the decision was never really mine to make. Because Alexander Davenport would come to claim me even in death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;** The Enslaved Duet is a standalone dark romance duet about Cosima Lombardi from The Evolution of Sin Trilogy. Enthralled must be read before Enamoured.**</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;My professor gave me my first D.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Now my next assignment is due…in nine months.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when you meet your new professor, and he ends up being the same man you had a one-night stand with three months ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, maybe not. Let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t intended to sleep with my professor. I might be known as the impulsive, prankster daugh-ter in my family, but I’m not insane. I just wanted to have some fun in Ireland at my sister’s wed-ding, and maybe lose my virginity, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I met Lochlann Gallagher at a pub one night, I couldn’t resist him. He was hot, Irish, and en-tirely set on seducing me. One unforgettable night under the sheets with him, and my V-card went up in smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that night had one itty bitty consequence because Lochlann totally made my eggo preggo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if this story isn’t crazy enough, Lochlann is not just my baby daddy: he’s now my professor and my advisor for grad school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow we have to figure out a way not to reveal this rapidly gestating secret while re-sisting the explosive attraction between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except there’s just one more complication to this story: I think I’m totally falling for my baby daddy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oopsie daisy.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I knew one thing. He was the boss. &lt;br /&gt;He walked like one, like he owned the ground his feet stepped on. Like he owned the air that we all breathed in. Like he could eat up the universe, if he wanted to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone killed Rumi, the Russian Mafia’s top washer in New York. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kazimir, the head of the Bratva, has come to NY to find the murderer. They call him The Russian Lion, known for having over two hundred kills. By the age of twenty, the FBI placed him ten steps away from Usama Bin Laden on the Most Wanted List. To kill his washer begins a dark and deadly war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Emily falls on Kazimir’s radar. Her brother is suspected of being involved in the murder. To save her brother, she is forced to launder Kazimir’s money; but she’s a perfect fit for the job. Known as a con to others, called a hustler by many, she’s the best washer in Harlem, keeping low-key gangsters on their toes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first, Kazimir and Emily have a tricky arrangement based on fear and danger. Her working for him is like balancing on a tight rope. He’s a monster wrapped in a gorgeous package. Still, there’s an air of sensuality around him that makes her forget sometimes how terrifying he can be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sexual tension heats up between the two, but one violent night changes everything, pitting everyone against each other—Russians, Jamaicans...anyone in Harlem with a gun. Kazimir and Emily must somehow learn to trust each other before they end up being one of the dozens of dead bodies left on the streets of New York. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there are hidden secrets and twists intertwined with Rumi’s murders. When the truth comes to light, Kazimir’s money won’t be the only thing that’s dirty. And, unfortunately, their rising attraction may not survive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the Erotica Bestselling Author of No Ordinary Love, Filthy Lies, and Power. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Steamy sex and mind-blowing suspense collide in this BWWM Romance of a Russian mafia boss and the one street smart woman he can’t control.</description>

  <description>It was the worst day of my life. &lt;br /&gt;I know most people say that about something obviously horrific—a first heartbreak, the discovery of a fatal illness, or the funeral of a loved one—but my situation was a little different. &lt;br /&gt;Not only was it my wedding day, but it was also the day I chose to die. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;The first, my Master, my captor, and my impossible love. &lt;br /&gt;The other, his brother, a mafioso I was meant to ensnare and ruin. &lt;br /&gt;If I had any hope of living a normal life reunited with my family, I had to make a choice. &lt;br /&gt;End my old life as I knew it and start fresh, or take down the monsters that hunted me and haunted my Master. &lt;br /&gt;In the end, the decision was never really mine to make. Because Alexander Davenport would come to claim me even in death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The Enslaved Duet is a standalone dark romance duet about Cosima Lombardi from The Evolution of Sin Trilogy.**</description>

  <description>Stephen Hastings is a control freak. &lt;br /&gt;He’s arrogant. He’s smart as a whip and &lt;i&gt;sexy AF.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has too much money. He’s bossy, and he’s usually right. &lt;br /&gt;All I saw were his clear blue eyes, tight ass, and ripped torso. &lt;br /&gt;I gladly handed him my V-card that night, ten years ago. &lt;br /&gt;I was so stupid. I swore I’d never be that stupid again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmy Barton works for a dry cleaner? &lt;br /&gt;Yes, that Emmy Barton—long, blonde hair, bright blue eyes, pretty smile… &lt;br /&gt;Sexy little ass. Smart mouth.&lt;br /&gt;She was the only girl who interested me, but I was leaving to be an officer in the Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m home, running my business, my life is perfectly ordered until I bump into her, divorced and struggling to make ends meet. &lt;br /&gt;I hate seeing her like this. I hate that she married Burt “The Dick” Dickerson. &lt;i&gt;What an asshole.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she hates me, but when we fight, it's all heat and lust.&lt;br /&gt;I won’t leave her this way. &lt;br /&gt;She &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; let me help her and her son. She will &lt;i&gt;stay&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;br /&gt;It’s a thin line between love and hate, and this line is &lt;i&gt;on fire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(STAY is a STAND-ALONE enemies-to-lovers, second-chance, marriage of convenience romance. No cheating. No cliffhangers.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The former Tin Gypsy motorcycle club has everyone in Clifton Forge, Montana convinced they’ve locked their clubhouse doors and ripped off their patches. Everyone but Bryce Ryan. There’s more happening at the club’s garage than muscle car restorations and Harley rebuilds. Her instincts are screaming there’s a story—one she’s going to tell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the new owner of the small town’s newspaper, Bryce is hungry for more than birth announcements and obituaries. When a woman is brutally killed and all signs point to the Tin Gypsies, Bryce is determined to expose the club and their leader, Kingston “Dash” Slater, as murderers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bryce bests Dash match after match, disappointed her rugged and handsome opponent turns out to be an underwhelming adversary. Secrets are exposed. Truths defeat lies. Bryce is poised to win this battle in a landslide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Dash breaks all the rules and tips the scales. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss, and she’s fighting to save more than just her story. She’s fighting to save her heart from the Gypsy King.</description>

      <![CDATA[Anyways.i read Gypsy King last week and duuuuuddeeee it was good. Admittedly I haven't read many MC romances, I can only think of 3 right now. But this one was super different. It read more like a crime novel with romance.<br /><br />Y'all I was here for it. So new reporter (Bryce) comes to town...]]>

  <description>Five years. One month. And three days after the bonfire from hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAINT&lt;br /&gt;Post college bliss was actually hell.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t using my degree.&lt;br /&gt;I was so lonely I looked for his face in crowded places.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t have anything figured out, let alone my feelings. &lt;br /&gt;I was stuck between two tall, dangerous, and handsome men – times two. &lt;br /&gt;One showed me how to survive trauma, proved things aren’t what they appear, and no matter how much I didn’t fall head over heels he was always there for me.&lt;br /&gt;The other taught me how live.&lt;br /&gt;But I taught myself how to love.&lt;br /&gt;No one was going to be able to take away my growth, my bravery, or my comfort again. Oliver or not – I was standing on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SINNER&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t wait to leave Amherst, to only return a few years later as a professor at my Alma Mater.&lt;br /&gt;The barn fire from hell acted like a bomb, detonating and throwing us all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;Lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;Pro baseball player.&lt;br /&gt;Book store manager.&lt;br /&gt;Artist.&lt;br /&gt;Soon to be wife. &lt;br /&gt;We were all struggling to find our way back to each other while juggling life, love, sex, hardship.&lt;br /&gt;I’m sober, a dad, but something was missing - Layla. &lt;br /&gt;She kicked started my heart when we first met in college, lighting it on fire and branding her name until she run away when things got messy. My son, Arsen, stoked the fire in her absence. &lt;br /&gt;She was always mine and it was time to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;Third time is a charm.</description>

  <description>C O M I N G S O O N . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAINT &lt;br /&gt;College turned out to be my first everything. &lt;br /&gt;Love.&lt;br /&gt;Sex.&lt;br /&gt;Heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;Giving up and running home wasn’t an option.&lt;br /&gt;I was in too deep.&lt;br /&gt;My life was strained before I met Oliver – no father figure, an absentee mom, a night of regret haunting me, and living life so controlled I barely let myself live at all.&lt;br /&gt;But all I wanted was to save Oliver more than myself. &lt;br /&gt;Isn’t that what unconditional love is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SINNER&lt;br /&gt;College was suppose to be my second chance.&lt;br /&gt;I was working on my third.&lt;br /&gt;I broke her heart in record time.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone leaves and no one ever comes back. Even Layla.&lt;br /&gt;The guilt and pressure of another self destructive regret weighted too heavy. So heavy I invited my demons back in to soften the blow.&lt;br /&gt;I added mistakes to my bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;I was proving everyone right about me.&lt;br /&gt;It was never the demons driving my decisions, she was never the cure, and I’m simply a pretty face with an ugly past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SAINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College. My one chance to escape. And I ran as far and fast as I could. &lt;br /&gt;Straight into the arms of something more dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;Oliver. &lt;br /&gt;He thinks I’m a good girl. But he doesn’t know what I’m running from. &lt;br /&gt;He thinks I should stay away from him. But I can’t. &lt;br /&gt;I like his cruel words. And his intoxicating smile. &lt;br /&gt;He’s a temptation I can’t resist.&lt;br /&gt;Am I a sinner or saint?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SINNER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College. Second year. &lt;br /&gt;There are bad decisions at every turn. &lt;br /&gt;Including the new freshman, Layla.&lt;br /&gt;Temptations I can’t fight. Shackles I can’t escape. &lt;br /&gt;I’m only comfortable with the cruelty that slips from my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Her innocent charm isn’t going to polish away my bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;This wasn’t going to end well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We all have secrets. What’s your sin?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Emily was a cop's daughter, and I was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks. At eighteen, our affair was wild and completely secret. Until she left town for college and a better life, and I hit the road to nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years later, we're both back in town. My father is in prison; she's selflessly helping her sister. We should be farther apart than we've ever been. But I've never been able to resist temptation, especially when that temptation is Emily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn't go near her. But I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She shouldn't say yes. But she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our chemistry is hotter than ever, but she’s hiding something from me. Just like I’m hiding something from her. It’s hard to tell whose secrets are more dangerous, until it all goes to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can save her - and she can save me. But we’ll have to break the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're from different worlds. We don't belong together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, Emily and I are going to have to get dirty.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A buttoned-up counsellor. A hot ex-con with secrets. One session that changes everything.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be simple: Let Jace Riggs walk into my counseling office, tell me how he’s adjusting to post-prison life, and let him walk out again. But the first thing I've learned is that nothing is simple with Jace. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s tall, muscled, bearded and tatted. He’s smarter than anyone else in the room and ten times more guarded. He’s hiding things that would break any other man to pieces. He’s a loner, a bad boy, and an infamous Riggs brother from the wrong side of the tracks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a hundred kinds of wrong for me. And even when I’m not his counsellor anymore, I still want to break down his defenses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jace has never trusted anyone - until me. He says I’m the only woman he wants close to him. The only woman he’s wanted in his bed - ever. And when he looks at me with that look of white-hot fire, I believe everything he says. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My own secrets could get Jace sent back to prison - or get him killed. And he doesn’t care. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We had so little time. We might not have until morning. But with the fire ignited between Jace and me, forever wouldn’t be long enough…</description>

  <description>BRIAR &lt;br /&gt;I was infatuated with Asher Kelley the moment he came tumbling through my brother’s window five years ago. &lt;br /&gt;Even bruised and bloodied, he was the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;We couldn't ever be together. &lt;br /&gt;I was too young, and he was too untouchable. &lt;br /&gt;He was too troubled, and I was too naive. &lt;br /&gt;But the heart is rebellious, and mine decided it didn’t care about any of those things. &lt;br /&gt;As I got older, harmless flirting turned to stolen moments in dark corners. &lt;br /&gt;Until one day, he was gone without a trace. &lt;br /&gt;Now, three years later, he’s back. &lt;br /&gt;Callous and cruel. &lt;br /&gt;He’s my brother’s best friend. My parents’ worst nightmare. &lt;br /&gt;I should hate him. &lt;br /&gt;But like a Bad Habit, I can’t quit him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ASHER &lt;br /&gt;I was drawn to Briar Vale from the first time she looked up at me with stars in her big, blue eyes. &lt;br /&gt;She was just a kid, nothing but elbows and knees, but she was the most beautiful creature I'd ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;We could never be together. &lt;br /&gt;I was too old and she was too off limits. &lt;br /&gt;She was too good and I was too fucked up. &lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the temptation became too much to resist. &lt;br /&gt;I risked everything for a kiss and she betrayed me. &lt;br /&gt;Three years have passed and I’m forced to see her again, but now she's all grown up. &lt;br /&gt;She’s my best friend’s baby sister. My downfall. &lt;br /&gt;I hate her for what she did. &lt;br /&gt;But she's always been my drug of choice</description>

  <description>You've heard of these groups - the secretive ones that only the crème de la crème are invited into, the ones outsiders speculate about for centuries - I'm the second in my family invited to attend, but to them, I'm fresh meat. New blood. New money, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They think they'll elbow past me, that I'm here for their amusement, for them to walk all over, they'll find out soon enough that I'm not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may look like one of them, with my designer bags and clothes straight from the Parisian runways, but I'm not. I'm here for answers, to take revenge for blood spilled on their centuries-old Persian rugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I transferred here in search for answers about what happened to my older brother, who hightailed out of here, and my friend who seemingly disappeared into thin air. I certainly wasn't here for the attention of the star hockey player, regardless of how much he willed my eyes his way. I wasn't here for his scrutiny or his judgment or to read into his mysterious aura. I was here for the society, because only they held the answers I needed. That was, until I found out that in order to get those answers, I needed to to go through him. He's saying if I want in, I have to play by their rules, follow their lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a game I'm willing to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be the second person I know of to be invited into their society, but I'll be the first to make it out intact.</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;I wanted to fall for a man. Instead, I fell for a legend...&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;Jax and Haley’s addictive, emotional rockstar romance trilogy is in ONE PLACE for the first time! Books 1 and 2 contain cliffhangers that build to book 3’s explosive, unmissable HEA. Immerse yourself in more than 500 pages of smoldering tension and enthralling romance that promise to leave you “dazed and a little crazed.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42204576.Good_Girl" title="Good Girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Good Girl&lt;/a&gt; (Wicked #1): &lt;/b&gt;I wanted to fall for a man. Instead, I fell for a legend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The month I wrote my first piece of code, Jax Jamieson launched his third platinum album. &lt;br /&gt;The week I drank my first beer, he spent in jail. &lt;br /&gt;The day I got under his skin, I wound up on his tour.&lt;br /&gt;And the night he gave me his hoodie… I fell in love forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42204612.Bad_Girl" title="Bad Girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bad Girl&lt;/a&gt; (Wicked #2): &lt;/b&gt; Rockstars don't chase college students. But Jax Jamieson’s never followed the rules. I thought I knew Jax's secrets. I was wrong. When the fans go home and the lights fade to black, it's just me and him and the people we left behind. I want to escape, until I realize...We can do a lot in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42204655.Wicked_Girl" title="Wicked Girl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wicked Girl&lt;/a&gt; (Wicked #3):&lt;/b&gt; He was a legend, until he walked away.  I was nobody, until I was dragged into the light. I was never supposed to be part of Wicked, but it was always part of me. Now it's my turn to do something that matters. Even if the man I love hates me for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jax and Haley’s all-consuming, smoldering, emotional, slow burn love story has sold more than 100,000 copies and “takes rock star romance to a whole new level.” &lt;b&gt;Binge read the complete WICKED trilogy now! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reviews:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Holy crap. Piper Lawson takes the rock star trope to a whole new level.” -Dawn&lt;br /&gt;“One word to describe this series: HOOKED.” -Danielle, Short and Sassy&lt;br /&gt;Hot damn, this series is amazing. Funny, sweet, raw, emotional and freaking hot!” -Debbie&lt;br /&gt;“So sweet and completely real.” -Tamanna&lt;br /&gt;“I’m an emotional wreck.”&lt;br /&gt;“Oh my goodness this was brilliant. Cannot wait for the finale! Need. It. Now.” -Anna&lt;br /&gt;“An all consuming love story that is sure to leave you a little dazed and crazed.” -Catherine&lt;br /&gt;“A sweet, slow burn story.” -Peggy&lt;br /&gt;“Good Girl is all repressed sexual tension and “what could be's” but Bad Girl was smoldering and explosive… I am like a crazed fan waiting in line all night.” -Catherine&lt;br /&gt;“If you love rock star romances...reading this series is a must!!” -KaraLee&lt;br /&gt;“There aren't enough words to describe this series, I could try with: amazing, romantic, emotional, enthralling. All I know is that I couldn't stop reading.” -Helen&lt;br /&gt;“This is binge reading at its finest.” -Always Write</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author W Winters comes an emotionally captivating and thrilling, romantic suspense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He holds a power over me like no one else ever could. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’s because my heart begs to beat in time with his. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’s because my body bows to his and his alone. &lt;br /&gt;Maybe it’s because he thought he loved me before he even laid eyes on me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He thought wrong, it wasn’t me he thought he loved, and nothing has made me suffer like that little secret has. He thought I belonged to him, but he was wrong. It was never supposed to be me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our memories are deceiving, but I know what I want now. &lt;br /&gt;What I need more than anything. &lt;br /&gt;I won’t rest until he’s as much mine as I am his. &lt;br /&gt;It’s always been him.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author W Winters comes an emotionally captivating and thrilling, romantic suspense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first, his words were harsh and his touch cold. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t want to be in his presence any more than he wanted me there. &lt;br /&gt;I knew he was a dangerous man and he could destroy me if only he wanted to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s not what he wanted though. It’s not what he needed. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not what I desired either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s so easy to get lost in the touch of a man who’s powerful and unattainable. &lt;br /&gt;A man who wants for nothing … except me. &lt;br /&gt;Soft touches and stolen glances made my blood heat and my heart beat in a way I never knew it could. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, it’s easy to fall into a haze of lust and desire. &lt;br /&gt;But there’s a reason his reputation is one of a heartless man. &lt;br /&gt;And I should have known better.</description>

  <description>From USA Today bestselling author W Winters comes an emotionally captivating and thrilling, romantic suspense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her lips tasted like Cabernet and her touch was like fire. &lt;br /&gt;I was blinded by what she did to me. I so easily fell for something I thought I’d never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was weak for her and should’ve known better. I should’ve known she could never love a man like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She brought out a side of me that I wish had stayed dead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won’t make the same mistake twice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t care how much she begs me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t care that I crave her more than anything else...</description>

  <description>I should’ve known she would ruin me the moment I saw her. &lt;br /&gt;Women like her are made to destroy men like me. &lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t resist her though. &lt;br /&gt;Given to me to start a war; I was too eager to accept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t know what she’d do to me. That she would change everything. &lt;br /&gt;She sees through me in a way no one else ever has. &lt;br /&gt;Her innocence and vulnerability make me weak for her and I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;I know better than to give in to temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ruthless man doesn’t let a soul close to him.&lt;br /&gt;A cold-hearted man doesn’t risk anything for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;A powerful man with a beautiful woman at his mercy… he doesn’t fall for her.</description>

  <description>I was naïve to think my marriage to Luka Catano might work.&lt;br /&gt;I was infatuated with him from afar…&lt;br /&gt;Until I met him.&lt;br /&gt;He loved the challenge of his next conquest, anyone would do...&lt;br /&gt;Except me.&lt;br /&gt;A wife was never something he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torturous was not a strong enough word to describe how I felt when I was in a room with Luka. Besides hating nearly every word that came out of his mouth, I also drowned with lust every time I looked at him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times I thought he might feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing prepared me for what his family would make me become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*There will be four books in the Kingdoms of Sin series. Each book can be read as a standalone though there are interconnecting characters.*</description>

  <description>Poppy Maysen carries a journal in her purse. Its pages were filled long ago by a man who craved adventure, lived life to the fullest and never failed to make her laugh. The journal is his birthday list—one she vows to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’ll do the things he wanted to do most. Because maybe, just maybe, if she can finish his list, she can start to live again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy expects going through the birthday list will be hard. She expects it to hurt. But what she doesn’t expect is Cole. Could the man who watched her heart shatter be the one to put it back together again?</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Meghan March comes a story of untold truths and one man’s redemption in the Dirty Mafia Duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every family has a black sheep. &lt;br /&gt;In the infamous Casso crime family, that black sheep is me—Cannon Freeman. &lt;br /&gt;Except I’m not a free man. I’ve never been free. Not since the day I was born. &lt;br /&gt;I owe my loyalty to my father, Dominic Casso, even if he won’t publicly acknowledge me as his blood. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve never had a reason to go against his wishes… until I met her. &lt;br /&gt;Drew Carson turned my world upside when she walked into my club looking for a job. &lt;br /&gt;Now, my honor and my life are on the line. &lt;br /&gt;Going against my father’s wishes might buy me a bullet straight from his gun, but black sheep or not, it’s time to make my stand. &lt;br /&gt;She's worth the fallout. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>I’m Beatrice Kennedy, but everyone calls me Beat. I live a low-key life, fresh out of college and drifting from town to town until I find my home. &lt;br /&gt;I love music, and how it stirs even the deepest and untouched parts of your soul. Depending on what you choose to listen to, would depend on what it touches. It’s the drug we all damper in, only different strains. My strain is Jazz. The smooth instrumental strums that take over me. The sound of cigar smoke, bourbon and an old dusty fedora hat. My strain wasn’t rap, and it sure wasn’t laced with some A-class shit like murky blue eyes casted down from the Lord and the Devil’s handcrafted smile. I knew who he was—the whole world did. One fateful night set off a chain of events, events that no one was coming back from. You can’t save people who don’t want to be saved. You can’t pull them up from the ocean when they’ve latched themselves to an anchor. Love was my anchor, destruction was the water that was drowning me, and the rope that was so tightly clamped around my ankles, was woven with the lyrics of Aeron Romanov-Reed, also known as, 'Manik. He steals hearts from all around the world, but one night, he stole something that wasn’t his to steal. &lt;br /&gt;Me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this is a full length standalone.</description>

Saman comes a sizzling hot new full-length STANDALONE romance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It starts out as a bet. &lt;br /&gt;A way to forget about my latest in a string of bad relationships and move on. I know it’s a mistake. My head and heart are just not into the game. Especially when I have a terrible knack for picking the wrong men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I see him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The gorgeous man in the dark suit, drowning his sorrows in a glass of scotch is only supposed to be one night of fun. No strings. Zero expectations. No one gets hurts. Sounds perfect, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when I wake up alone the next morning, it appears I’ve gotten everything I was after. That is until I find the shiny gold cufflinks he left behind. Oh, and discover that he's my new boss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With our ugly pasts still heavy on our shoulders, it should be easy to stay away from each other. To be one hundred percent professional. To ignore the way his heated glances set my skin ablaze, even from across the room. Yep. Impervious is my new middle name. &lt;br /&gt;Even if tempting is his... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;WARNING: This story is a full-length STANDALONE romance that was previously published as part of the ILLICIT boxed set. If you've already purchased that set, please do not purchase this book.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Weston Kincaid was my first…everything.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother's best friend should have come with a warning label. &lt;br /&gt;The man was a cautionary tale and we were the ill-fated cliché. The star quarterback to my loner art geek. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn't listen. Not to the warnings. Not to my instincts. &lt;br /&gt;I fell, and I fell hard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he left and I was forced to pick up the pieces of my broken heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade and a lifetime later, he's back. &lt;br /&gt;Only instead of being the star jock, he's now a surgeon. &lt;br /&gt;A sexy, irresistible surgeon who happens to save my friend's life. As if all that isn't bad enough, he has it in his determined, arrogant head that we should pick up where we left off all those years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time, it'll take more than devouring looks and the rush of his touch to temp me back into his bed. &lt;br /&gt;And my heart? Not an option.&lt;br /&gt;He's about to figure out, I'm not the same girl he left behind.</description>

  <description>On November 27, 2013, Kat Savage’s life forever changed. Her little sister, Angela, was brutally murdered and Savage has been searching for the strength to write her grief down ever since. Finally, just shy of six years later, and one year after justice finally rained down upon the man to blame, Savage found the courage to try. This collection is an 18-poem narrative of the very real and raw emotions felt by the author over the years since the tragedy. Here, she pays homage to her baby sister and bleeds her own pain onto paper for anyone who might need help finding their own strength.</description>

  <description>From Wall Street Journal &amp;amp; USA Bestselling Author M. Robinson. A coming of age, enemies to lovers, contemporary romance filled with angst and all the feels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t remember a time before her... Harley Jameson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before she owned me.&lt;br /&gt;Hated Me.&lt;br /&gt;Needed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I hated her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things were simple. &lt;br /&gt;We had an understanding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bully. Fight. Hate. It’s what we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind. Body. Soul. It’s how we loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought nothing would ever change that, until everything did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She was mine. &lt;br /&gt;Always had been. &lt;br /&gt;Always would be. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing altered that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not how much I hated her.&lt;br /&gt;Not how much she hated me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially, not how much I hated… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That I LOVED her.</description>

  <description>My name is Dove Hendry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mine is Kingston Axton.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was captured by darkness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She has always been ours…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They groomed me for Midnight Mayhem. Like a trained possession, weak against their control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She has been conditioned with our blood for years. She just doesn’t know it yet...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Midnight Mayhem was the stained glass that concealed a very dark culture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A culture that she is about to become the center of.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Brothers of Kiznitch come in fours, and they’re not happy about me being hustled into their acts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or are we? Careful, Little Bird. A warning is a warning for a reason…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mind-tricks. &lt;br /&gt;Stunts. &lt;br /&gt;Deceit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Power.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there’s something uglier that has been haunting me for years upon years. So ugly that I have never seen its face. I never had to. I’d hear his whispers through my internal screams, feel his shadow brush against my nightmares. He was my the monster that tormented me. &lt;br /&gt;And maybe lived under your bed… &lt;br /&gt;When I started Midnight Mayhem, his presence faded. &lt;br /&gt;His whispers were silenced. &lt;br /&gt;His shadow dissolving without a trace. &lt;br /&gt;I wondered why that was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; She didn’t have to wonder for long…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I should have told her everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much I loved her. &lt;br /&gt;How much I’ve always loved her. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t. &lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t. &lt;br /&gt;I just wasn’t made that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead... I claimed her. &lt;br /&gt;Teased her.&lt;br /&gt;Taunted her.&lt;br /&gt;Worshipped her.&lt;br /&gt;Until... I broke her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best friend. &lt;br /&gt;My savior. &lt;br /&gt;My girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my mind to my heart, to every single bone in my body. &lt;br /&gt;She owned me. &lt;br /&gt;I was hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every look. &lt;br /&gt;Every kiss. &lt;br /&gt;Every touch. &lt;br /&gt;Every tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I feared more than losing her was forgetting her.&lt;br /&gt;I hated how much I needed her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was mine. &lt;br /&gt;Always and forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated her then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Harley Jameson was about to find out how much…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED her now.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sam Wylde is ready to prove he’s more than just the privileged son of a wealthy Southern dynasty. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wyldefire Whiskey is poised to take Nashville by storm—and with any luck, overshadow the scandal of his cheating ex-girlfriend marrying his brother. The only problem? This gruff country boy has no idea how to throw a launch party that will get people talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer to everything might just be Holly Glen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A party wrapped up in one tiny woman, Holly is tattooed, tempting, and exactly the event planner Sam needs to liven up his brand—and his life. He can give her what she needs, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it will take is a ring on her finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in real love with his fake wife was not part of the plan—but one shot of Holly isn’t going to be enough.</description>

  <description>Not all love stories are written the same way. Ours had torn chapters, missing paragraphs, and a bittersweet ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna Rexroth is everyone’s favorite wallflower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Caring.&lt;br /&gt;Charitable.&lt;br /&gt;Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Fake.&lt;br /&gt;Underneath the meek, tomboy exterior everyone loves (yet pities) is a girl who knows exactly what, and who, she wants—namely, the boy from the treehouse who taught her how to curse in sign language.&lt;br /&gt;Who taught her how to laugh.&lt;br /&gt;To live.&lt;br /&gt;To love.&lt;br /&gt;Knight Cole is everyone’s favorite football hero.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Athletic.&lt;br /&gt;Rugged.&lt;br /&gt;Popular.&lt;br /&gt;Liar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This daredevil hell-raiser could knock you up with his gaze alone, but he only has eyes for the girl across the street: Luna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Luna is not who she used to be. She doesn’t need his protection anymore.&lt;br /&gt;When life throws a curveball at All Saints’ golden boy, he’s forced to realize not all knights are heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the greatest love stories flourish in tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“When I kissed you last night, I wasn’t pretending.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everly Dalton is a walking, talking, martini-drinking dating disaster. Forget kissing frogs. She can’t even get past the first date. But at work, she’s a badass—the longest-running assistant billionaire Shepherd Calloway has ever had. Her coworkers wonder how she handles the big bad wolf—and never gets bit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shepherd Calloway isn’t interested in being anyone’s sugar daddy. Tired of women who only want him for his money, he swears off dating, determined to focus on running his empire. Until his gold-digging ex hits him where it hurts, putting him in a difficult position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His solution—to have Everly pose as his live-in girlfriend—is obviously crazy. But the timing is uncanny. It just so happens Everly needs a favor from her boss—a big and awkward one—and this could ensure everyone gets what they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, Everly can totally survive a few months of faux romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except there’s a problem. Shepherd is supposed to be a single-minded, unemotional robot boss. Not an actual human with a heart and morning wood. Between the awkward bed-sharing and tingly fake dates, lines are blurring. And as Everly gets to know the real Shepherd, she discovers there’s more to the man behind the bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And faking it gets all too real.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faking Ms. Right is a hot, STAND-ALONE romantic comedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I have a certain set of rules I try to live by. Rules that have always served me well. Until now…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rule one: Don’t have sex with someone you work with.&lt;br /&gt;Rule two: Don’t have sex with your friend’s ex-boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;Rule three: Don’t have sex with your best friend who also happens to be the same ex-boyfriend of your friend.&lt;br /&gt;Rule four: Don’t ever, under any circumstances, fall in love with your best friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it’s safe to say, I officially broke all four of my rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Andrew Albright. Sexy, arrogant, insanely gorgeous, and eternally off-limits. &lt;br /&gt;Not only is he still in love with my friend, his ex, but he’s my rock. My perfect best friend.&lt;br /&gt;The one person I cannot lose under any circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;Especially when my life has a habit of falling apart on a regular basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one mercy kiss later, to save me from an awkward situation, and suddenly everything changes. He flirts relentlessly. Corners me in dark hallways. Throws me panty-melting stares that render me helpless. &lt;br /&gt;I crossed the uncrossable line. Broke every damn rule. &lt;br /&gt;Now our perfect friendship is falling apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s doing everything he can to keep it that way… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE EDGE OF REASON is a funny, sexy, and emotional best friends to lovers, STANDALONE romance&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Warned as a girl to keep her kisses to herself, Greer Galloway disobeys twice--once on her sixteenth birthday as she's kneeling in a pool of broken glass, and another time after a charming stranger named Embry Moore whisks her into the dazzling Chicago night. Both times she falls in love, and both times her heart is broken beyond repair. And so as an adult, she vows never to kiss--or to love again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's until the Vice President of the United States shows up at the university where she teaches, and asks for one thing: for her to meet with the hero-turned-President Maxen Colchester. Maxen, the soldier who was her first kiss in that pool of broken glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the other complication? The Vice President is none other than charming Embry Moore himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Greer finds herself caught between past and present, pleasure and pain--and two men who long for each other as much as they long for her. And as war and betrayal press ever closer, they tumble headlong into a passionate love affair that will change the world...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Priest&lt;/i&gt; comes a contemporary reimagining of the legend of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot--elegant, carnal, and unforgettable. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When life crashes down around us, how hard are we willing to fight for the one thing we can’t live without, each other?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is full of moments. &lt;br /&gt;Big moments. &lt;br /&gt;Little moments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And none of them are inconsequential. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every single moment prepares you for that one instance that defines your life. You must overcome all your fears, confront the demons that chase you, and cleanse the poison that clings to your soul or you risk the chance of losing everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mine started the minute Rylee fell out of that damn storage closet. She made me feel. Made me whole when all I thought I could ever be was incomplete. &lt;/i&gt;Became the lifeline I never knew I needed. &lt;i&gt;Hell yes, she’s worth the fight…but how do you fight for someone you know you don’t deserve?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is full of ups and downs. &lt;br /&gt;Heart stopping highs.&lt;br /&gt;Soul shattering lows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And none of them are insignificant. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is a racecourse of unexpected twists and turns that must be negotiated. You have to break down walls, learn to trust, and heal from your past in order to win. But sometimes it’s the expected that’s the hardest to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Colton has healed and completed me, stolen my heart, and made me realize our love’s not predictable nor perfect—it’s bent. &lt;/i&gt;And bent’s okay. &lt;i&gt;But when outside factors put our relationship to the test, what lengths will I have to go to prove to him that he’s worth the fight?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever said love is patient and love is kind, never met the two of us. We know our love is worth it—have acknowledged that we were meant to be—but when our pasts crash into our future, will the repercussions make us stronger or break us apart?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=9780989450218" title="9780989450218" rel="nofollow"&gt;9780989450218&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times Bestselling&lt;/i&gt; author K. Bromberg comes the first book in an unforgettable series about lust, love, redemption, and healing . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton Donavan lives on that razor thin edge toward out of control. Whether it’s on the track or off of it, everything he wants is at his fingertips: success, willing women, media attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything that is, but &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. I’m the exception this reckless bad boy can’t seem to win over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart is healing. His soul is damaged. We both know the two of us could never work. But he crashes into my life without apology—disrupting my world, testing my boundaries, and uncovering the darkness of my past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our chemistry is undeniable. Our attraction is magnetic. Our ability to help each other heal obvious. And even though he won’t let me in, there’s something about Colton I can’t walk away from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the beginning of our story.&lt;br /&gt;Our fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our perfectly imperfect love.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book #2 of the Driven Trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when the one person you never expected suddenly happens to be the one you’ll fight the hardest to keep?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colton stole my heart. He wasn't supposed to, and I sure as hell didn't want him to, but he crashed into my life, ignited feelings within me that I thought had died forever, and fueled a passion that I never knew could exist.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rylee fell out of that damn storage closet and into my life. Now I don't think I'll ever be the same. She's seen glimpses of the darkness within me, and yet she's still here. Still fighting for me. She is without a doubt the saint, and I am most definitely the sinner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How is it the one thing neither of us wanted—neither of us anticipated that fateful night—has us fighting so hard to keep?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He steals my breath, stops my heart, and brings me back to life again all in a split second of time. But how can I love a man who won't let me in? Who continually pushes me away to prevent me from seeing the damaged secrets in his past? My heart has fallen, but patience and forgiveness can only go so far.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can I desire a woman who unnerves me, defies me, and forces me to see that in the deep, black abyss of my soul there's someone worthy of her love? A place and person I swore I'd never be again. Her selfless heart and sexy body deserve so much more than I'll ever be capable of giving her. I know I can't be what she needs, so why can't I just let her go?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We are driven by need and fueled with desire, but is that enough for us to crash into love?</description>

  <description>Secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Deceptions. &lt;br /&gt;Tragedies.&lt;br /&gt;Those were the root of all evil. One of those became the root of mine the day I lost the love of my life. My best friend. My lover.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone disregarded it, saying, “Let’s face it, Averie, you have the rest of your life ahead of you.” They were wrong. James Lawrence was my ever after . . . until Ashton. &lt;br /&gt;If only he didn’t come bearing his own brand of evil. &lt;br /&gt;A secret. &lt;br /&gt;The reason he wanted me to stay away. &lt;br /&gt;I should have listened, and he should have tried harder, but both of us failed. And if we hadn’t, if he had told me when we first met, would it have altered the moment I realized that I was falling for him?&lt;br /&gt;The slight variation in the air. The hitch in my breath. The lightness in my chest.&lt;br /&gt;Impossible to know; I’d already fallen.&lt;br /&gt;I was already ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A standalone sports romance that takes place in senior year high school. Due to explicit content, this book is suitable for 17+</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I’m a good girl—until I got drunk in Vegas and married a panties-flaming-hot Irishman. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oops.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve always lived my life by the rules. Unlike my two sisters, I’m the good one. The responsible one. Going outside my comfort zone is when I wear red lipstick before five PM. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That comfort zone of mine? It’s smashed to smithereens on a wild night in Las Vegas when I met—and &lt;i&gt;married&lt;/i&gt;—Liam Gallagher. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After one shot of tequila, then two, then too many to count, a good girl’s rules tend to disappear. And so do her panties, and her bra, and various other articles of clothing when she’s with an Irishman who knows his way around a woman’s body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now my husband wants us to stay married. For six months. He &lt;i&gt;says&lt;/i&gt; it’ll be worth my while. Considering our chemistry underneath the sheets, I can’t say that he’s wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam isn’t safe, though. Liam definitely isn’t comfortable. He’s like the male equivalent of wearing red lipstick in the daytime all wrapped up in an irresistible, dangerous package. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet this stubborn Irishman isn’t about to let me go, drunken &lt;i&gt;Princess Bride&lt;/i&gt;-themed Vegas wedding or no. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I have to decide if I’m brave enough to break the rules for love.</description>

  <description>The moment she met Callen Hayes, eleven-year-old Jessica Creswell knew he was a broken prince. &lt;i&gt;Her&lt;/i&gt; prince. They became each other's refuge, a safe and magical place far from their troubled lives. Until the day Callen kissed her&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;Jessica's first real, dreamy kiss—and then disappeared from her life without a word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, everyone knows who Callen Hayes is. Famous composer. Infamous bad boy. What no one knows is that Callen's music is now locked deep inside, trapped behind his own inner demons. It's only when he withdraws to France to drink his way through the darkness that Callen stumbles into the one person who makes the music return. Jessica. &lt;i&gt;His Jessie&lt;/i&gt;. And she still tastes of fresh, sweet innocence . . . even as she sets his blood on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they don't belong in each other's worlds anymore. There are too many mistakes. Too many secrets. Too many lies. All they have is that instinctive longing, that need—and something that looks dangerously like love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;No one lays open the heart and soul quite like &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mia Sheridan.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Thea Landry has always known her place in modern-day society. It’s somewhere just above the trash can her mother dumped her in as a newborn but below the class where much comes easy. With her tattered shoes and bargain-bin clothes, her life has never been full of glamour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a rich and charismatic man takes interest, she doesn’t fool herself into thinking their encounter is anything more than a one-night stand. Months later, she’s kicking herself for not getting his phone number. Or his last name. She’s given up hope of seeing him ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, years later, Logan Kendrick waltzes into her life once more and turns everything she’s built upside down. This time around, she won’t make the same mistake. She’s going to fight to keep him in her life—not for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for their daughter.</description>

  <description>Addison McCormick has everything. A handsome fiancé, wealth, and a lucrative career as a lawyer at her father's firm. But when she catches her soon-to-be-husband cheating, she has to start anew. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, single, unemployed, and heartbroken, she decides a vacation is just what she needs to escape the wreckage in L.A.—and serene Colorado is calling her name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t expect to find there is Chase Prescott: the sexy, brooding owner of the cabin she’s renting. She sees him as nothing more than a vacation boyfriend, a quick and dirty fling to help her get over her recent heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she soon discovers his mysterious aura is not just a front, and the fantasy world they create will crash head-on with their harsh reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when a relationship meant only to last a few days becomes something that might last a lifetime?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Jake &lt;br /&gt;I know she’s lying the moment I see her. &lt;br /&gt;That her name is as fake as her story. She’s barged into my life like a beautiful nightmare, turning everything upside down. &lt;br /&gt;It hasn’t stopped me from trying to help her. Protect her. Save her from the threats that seem to come out of nowhere. &lt;br /&gt;She’s put my entire world at risk. My reputation. My business. My livelihood. &lt;br /&gt;But Mia brought me back to life. And I will do anything to save hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mia &lt;br /&gt;I was running for my life the night I met Jake. &lt;br /&gt;Broken down on the road to nowhere. Lost. Homeless. Scared out of my mind. &lt;br /&gt;I don't care. I’m willing to risk it all to start over. Desperate to hide and never be found again. &lt;br /&gt;But it doesn't take much for Jake to break down my defenses. A soft word. A gentle touch. He becomes mine, but more importantly, I become his. &lt;br /&gt;Until the nightmare of my past shows up, pissed off as hell… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This book contains material that might be offensive for some or elicit a strong emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>I’ve always heard that you should marry someone that loves you more than you love them – that if you do this, you’ll always be happy.&lt;br /&gt;Did I follow that advice? No. Am I happy? No. And is Finn happy? No. &lt;br /&gt;I’m stuck in a marriage with an ex-Marine suffering from PTSD. I’m not sure we’re in love anymore. We have a baby who brings us both joy—but it’s not enough. I feel like my life is crumbling around me and I’m struggling to keep the pieces together. &lt;br /&gt;Someone from my past has sauntered back in quietly, unknowingly. To my surprise, the attention is what I was craving.&lt;br /&gt;I have to make a decision. Do I stay and fight, or leave, when the idea of escape is beautiful and tempting?&lt;br /&gt;I’m always the one who loves more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semi Finalist: Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Romance 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All is fair in love and auto maintenance.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beau Winston is the nicest, most accommodating guy in the world. Usually. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Handsome as the devil and twice as charismatic, Beau lives a charmed life as everyone’s favorite Winston Brother. But since his twin decided to leave town, and his other brother hired a stunning human-porcupine hybrid as a replacement mechanic for their auto shop, Beau Winston’s charmed life has gone to hell in a handbasket. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shelly Sullivan is not nice and is never accommodating. Ever. &lt;br /&gt;She mumbles to herself, but won’t respond when asked a question. She glares at everyone, especially babies. She won’t shake hands with or touch another person, but has no problems cuddling with a dog. And her damn parrot speaks only in curse words. Beau wants her gone. He wants her out of his auto shop, out of Tennessee, and out of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, learning why this porcupine wears her coat of spikes opens a Pandora’s box of complexity—exquisite, tempting, heartbreaking complexity—and Beau Winston soon discovers being nice and accommodating might mean losing what matters most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist: Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Romance 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make a deal with the devil and you might get what you want, but will it be what you need?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Sylvester wants one thing, and that one thing is NOT to be Tennessee’s reigning Banana Cake Queen. Ever the perpetual good girl and obedient daughter, Jennifer is buckling under the weight of her social media celebrity, her mother’s ambitions, and her father’s puritanical mandates. Jennifer is officially desperate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And desperate times call for Cletus Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cletus Winston is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery covered in conundrum sauce, and now he’s in a pickle. Despite being convinced of his own omniscience, extortion by the exalted Banana Cake Queen of Green Valley has taken him completely by surprise. So... what’s a maniacal mastermind to do? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely, the last thing you expect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna Diaz is everyone’s favorite “fat” funny lady. The movie studio executives can’t explain it, but her films are out-grossing all the fit and trim headliners and Hollywood’s most beautiful elite. The simple truth is, everyone loves plus-sized Sienna. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she has a problem, she can’t read maps and her sense of direction is almost as bad as her comedic timing is stellar. Therefore, when Sienna’s latest starring role takes her to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park she finds herself continually lost while trying to navigate the backroads of Green Valley, Tennessee. Much to her consternation, Sienna’s most frequent savior is a ridiculously handsome, charming, and cheeky Park Ranger by the name of Jethro Winston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna is accustomed to high levels of man-handsome, so it’s not Jethro’s chiseled features or his perfect physique that make Sienna stutter. It’s his southern charm. And gentlemanly manners. And habit of looking at her too long and too often. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna has successfully navigated the labyrinth of Hollywood heart-throbs. But can she traverse the tenuous trails of Tennessee without losing her head? Or worse, her heart?</description>

  <description>Adam Oliver hated me. Loathed my very existence. He had every right to, but that didn’t make my life any easier the afternoon I had to rescue him on the side of the road. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But worse than rescuing a guy who hated me to his core was the lie I told my parents. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because I’d just told them that my long-term boyfriend was finally back in town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My long-term boyfriend who didn’t actually exist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one named Adam Oliver—the guy I’d crushed on all through high school. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So the real Adam had no idea that he and I were engaged in a years-long, committed, serious relationship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, somehow, some way, I needed to convince him to play along with my one little lie.</description>

  <description>There’s one creed all Cavensham men subscribe to: they fall in love completely and decidedly. But what happens when the woman you fall in love with swears she'll only marry you as a last resort? &lt;i&gt;Rogue Most Wanted &lt;/i&gt;is the next book in the sparkling, romantic &lt;i&gt;Cavensham Heiress &lt;/i&gt;series by Janna MacGregor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE NEEDS TO MARRY SOMEONE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Theodora Worth needs to marry fast in order to keep her estate. It’s been her heart and home for years, and she’ll not lose it to anyone. There’s just one problem—as a woman who was raised in isolation by her grandfather, she’s completely incapable of pouring a cup of tea, never mind wooing a man. She’ll need a little matchmaking help from her sprightly next-door neighbor in order to find a convenient husband…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;IT’S JUST NOT GOING TO BE HIM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord William Cavensham’s heart was broken years ago, and since that day he vowed to never love again. But his spirited Great Aunt Stella is determined he’ll marry or not inherit a single penny from her. And she’s got just the woman in mind—her beautiful and completely hapless next-door neighbor, Thea…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thea and Will agree there’s no sense in marrying each other. Will wholeheartedly believes he’s incapable of love, and Thea refuses to marry the first man she’s practically met. But Will may be the rogue Thea wants the most after all…</description>

  <description>Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, a liar, and as fierce and true a champion as Roger or Asriel could want--but what Lyra doesn't know is that to help one of them will be to betray the other.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Meghan March comes the stunning conclusion to the Forge Trilogy. In this final volume, ruthless billionaire Jericho Forge faces his toughest challenge. To emerge victorious, he’ll have to give up the one thing he’s never offered a woman—his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started as a game. She was nothing but my pawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was quick to see the error in my ways, and now she is everything I never knew I needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of a woman like India Baptiste is beyond measure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the problem with being a man like me? I’ve already screwed this up, and there’s no guarantee India will take me on for one last bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll do whatever I have to do. Drop to my knees and offer her the only thing I have left. The one thing that’s only ever been hers—the heart of the devil.</description>

  <description>Some love affairs aren’t meant for the public eye. Some love affairs won’t survive the fallout. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Calliope das Dores is not the perfect rebound, even if her name means "muse". She is not who I should be running to. But I want her anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She keeps telling me my squeaky-clean image can’t handle the scandal, but this want between us is not black and white, and it never will be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t care that she’s my uncle’s wife—or that she shares my last name. After finding my girlfriend in bed with my uncle at the end of my worldwide tour, the truth is clear: Calliope and I are the only family we both have left now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, after flying to the Ozarks to tell her of our partners’ sins, I tell myself it’s just so she won’t hear it from someone who would lie to her. But my manager and best friend say I’ve wanted her since I was a kid, and now, finally, she is allowed to want me back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She says we can get over them with each other—even if it’s in secret, for a summer—but I have to promise her I won’t fall in love. It’s not part of the plan. The details in our past deny us of any future we could have had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What starts out as a rebound for both of us eventually consumes me. But the flames don’t reach her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My muse is consumed, too. But not with me.</description>

  <description>When uptight British bookshop owner Emily Bartlett goes to Las Vegas to get over a humiliating breakup, she’s expecting to make a few mistakes. But when she meets Ruby Knight, a pessimistic American C-list TV actress with designs on a movie career, she makes a whopper. The pair get so incredibly drunk together that they end up getting accidently married. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the cold light of day, both women are shocked to find themselves wedded to a virtual stranger. But maybe it’s not such a big mistake? Could Ruby’s marriage to Emily help boost her profile and get her the biggest role of her life, earning Emily a big payday in the process? Only if they can make it seem like they’re really in love. And only if they can navigate the treacherous LA movie scene without tripping themselves up and giving the game away. Or worse, getting carried away with their fake relationship… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what if they do let themselves feel something? Could they fall in love? Or are they Just Married? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A witty romantic comedy, ‘Just Married?’ is the latest book from Natasha West, the internationally bestselling author of ‘By Any Other Name’ and ‘The Plus One.’ &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Meghan March continues the story of ruthless, calculating billionaire Jericho Forge in Luck of the Devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My poker face has always been one of my greatest assets, along with my grit and determination. I was beholden to no one. Asked permission for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Then Jericho Forge took my life by storm.&lt;br /&gt;I traded my freedom for something infinitely more precious, but I didn’t realize he was holding an unbeatable hand.&lt;br /&gt;Now, all I have to do is survive the high-stakes game that is my life—with my heart intact.&lt;br /&gt;But not falling in love with Forge? That will take the luck of the devil. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luck of the Devil is the second book of the Forge Trilogy, and should be read following Deal with the Devil. The Forge Trilogy concludes in Heart of the Devil.</description>

  <description>"You can put that man in a suit, but he'll never be tame." &lt;br /&gt;One look at Jericho Forge and I knew the rumors were true. He was a predator, and he had set his sights on me.&lt;br /&gt;I knew better than to bet more than I could afford to lose that night. I knew better than to bet myself. But desperation leads to bad decisions, and I thought there was no way I could lose.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have no choice but to make a deal with the devil.</description>

  <description>Some girls don’t like pretty things. &lt;br /&gt;Some girls like things that are destructive, and toxic. Things that fuel our bodies with adrenaline and bring our demons to their knees. &lt;br /&gt;They say magic isn’t real, but it’s it the closest way to describe love? It doesn’t exist physically. It merely exists around us, within us, possessing our souls and making us do stupid shit. Shit like falling in love with a boy who knows how to rip my world apart and raise hell with a simple flick of his wrist. Their secrets are now mine. I’m not just in the middle of this game, I’m helping orchestrate it. Can the cries of my aching soul be enough to drown out the burning embers of my mistakes? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The mind strengthens the heart, roughing the edges to prepare it for war. This is a war I will not win. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a war of fate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;𝘚𝘩𝘦’𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘬. &lt;br /&gt;𝘚𝘩𝘦’𝘴 𝘨𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘰 𝘧𝘢𝘭𝘭. &lt;br /&gt;𝘚𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘰 𝘮𝘦, 𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘧𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴 &lt;br /&gt;𝘉𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴𝘯’𝘵 𝘢 𝘧𝘢𝘪𝘳𝘺 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘦 &lt;br /&gt;𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘯𝘰 𝘬𝘯𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵. &lt;br /&gt;𝘐’𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘢𝘬𝘦 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘰𝘧 𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘴𝘰𝘶𝘭 &lt;br /&gt;𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘱𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘮𝘺 𝘴𝘱𝘪𝘵𝘦. &lt;br /&gt;𝘕𝘰 𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵. &lt;br /&gt;𝘕𝘰 𝘭𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵. &lt;br /&gt;𝘌𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘮𝘺 𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴, 𝘴𝘶𝘳𝘷𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘥𝘢?&amp;amp;</description>

  <description>“Love is savage, love is blind, love is something they may not find…” &lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, there was a young girl who lived in a battered trailer, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. &lt;br /&gt;One day, she fell down The Elite Kings’ rabbit hole. Sucked into a dark vortex of lies, hate, and deceit, and spat out by money, glitz, and power. &lt;br /&gt;There were things this little girl didn’t know, things she was about to find out and secrets that have been kept from her. Those secrets were guarded by the boys that were about to smash her world open and tear it all apart… &lt;br /&gt;He may be a Malum, but she is a Stuprum, born into this world but neglected by the choice of her mother. Her eyes may not glisten with stars, but they roar with fire, and when she finally reaches her peak, it’s that same fire that will burn. &lt;br /&gt;Them. &lt;br /&gt;All. &lt;br /&gt;Down. &lt;br /&gt;My name is Tillie Stuprum, and my story is not like the rest. &lt;br /&gt;Everything she thought she knew is a fabricated version of the truth. I’m Nate Riverside-Malum, the one your girl whispers about to her friends and whose initials are scratched down your back. Her story is not like the rest of them, because her story is dead.</description>

  <description>Is it possible to keep a life-changing secret from your family and friends when it is burning you alive from the inside out? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn’t seem possible that a person could change in one week yet after only seven days spent with the mysterious Frenchman in Los Cabos, Mexico, Giselle was moving to New York City a changed woman. Confident, sexy and in charge, Elle is ready to take on the challenges she knows await her when she reunites with her family and begins her career as an artist in earnest. If she is a little heartbroken at the prospect of never seeing the cool and dominating Sinclair again, she’s braced for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until Sinclair shows up in her mother’s kitchen and Giselle discovers just who his ‘darling’ girlfriend really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is the second book in The Evolution Of Sin series and should be read after The Affair &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Is a week of passion enough to warrant changing their lives forever? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Italian born Giselle Moore is reinventing herself for the second time in her short twenty-four years of life, trading in her bohemian artist’s life in Paris for the grit and glamour of New York City where the family she hasn’t seen in years awaits her. But before beginning her new life, she travels to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico searching for a week of relaxation and reprieve before barreling into her turbulent future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never expected to meet the handsome and enigmatic Frenchman Sinclair on the plane and she certainly never would have imagined herself accepting his proposal for a week long, no-strings-attached affair. Giselle has never experienced anything as heady as Sinclair’s controlled seduction and cool yet devastatingly erotic commands and she finds herself powerless to stop the ferocity of their passions, even when she discovers he has a partner back home. The last thing she needs in her life is another complication, yet as the week wears on, she finds it surprisingly easy to relinquish control to Sinclair, a man she knows nearly nothing about. And to her horror, the one thing she promised never to submit, her battered heart, is just as easily captured in the business mogul’s unyielding hands.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy concludes with Sinful Empire!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s mine, I keep, and that includes Keira Kilgore.&lt;br /&gt;It’s no longer enough to have her in my debt. No longer enough to own her body.&lt;br /&gt;I want something more.&lt;br /&gt;She can try to resist, but I’ll never give her up.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will keep us apart.&lt;br /&gt;Not her. Not my enemies. No one.&lt;br /&gt;Her debt will only be paid one way—with her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt; is the third and final book in the Mount Trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mount Trilogy continues with &lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt;... &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m his entertainment. His toy. Payment on a debt. &lt;br /&gt;I tell myself I hate him, but every time he walks into the room, my body betrays me. How can I want him and fear him in the same moment? &lt;br /&gt;They told me he’d mess with my head. Make it go to war with my body. &lt;br /&gt;But I didn’t realize it would be complete anarchy. &lt;br /&gt;I should’ve known better. When Mount’s involved, there are no rules. &lt;br /&gt;I will not surrender. I will not show weakness. I’ll stand my ground and make it out of this bargain with my heart and soul intact. &lt;br /&gt;But he has other plans . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defiant Queen&lt;/i&gt; is the second book of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira's story concludes in &lt;i&gt;Sinful Empire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes looking to the past helps you find your future.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abbi Hope Goldstein is like every other teenager, with a few smallish exceptions: her famous alter ego, Baby Hope, is the subject of internet memes, she has asthma, and sometimes people spontaneously burst into tears when they recognize her. Abbi has lived almost her entire life in the shadow of the terrorist attacks of September 11. On that fateful day, she was captured in what became an iconic photograph: in the picture, Abbi (aka "Baby Hope") wears a birthday crown and grasps a red balloon; just behind her, the South Tower of the World Trade Center is collapsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fifteen years later, Abbi is desperate for anonymity and decides to spend the summer before her seventeenth birthday incognito as a counselor at Knights Day Camp two towns away. She's psyched for eight weeks in the company of four-year-olds, none of whom have ever heard of Baby Hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad Noah Stern, whose own world was irrevocably shattered on that terrible day, has a similar summer plan. Noah believes his meeting Baby Hope is fate. Abbi is sure it's a disaster. Soon, though, the two team up to ask difficult questions about the history behind the Baby Hope photo. But is either of them ready to hear the answers?</description>

  <description>It was the biggest day of my life. &lt;br /&gt;I know most people say that about something joyous; a graduation, a wedding ceremony, the birth of their first child. My situation was a little different. &lt;br /&gt;Sure, it was my eighteenth birthday, but it was also the day that I was sold. &lt;br /&gt;Sold to a man with hair like a crown of gold and eyes blacker than the darkest pits of Hell. &lt;br /&gt;He bought me to own me, to control me, and to use me as a means to an end. &lt;br /&gt;I was his tool and his weapon. &lt;br /&gt;And through it all, somehow, I also became his salvation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fake love, real sparks.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Celeste Lamontagne receives a wedding invitation from her ex, she’s furious. The only thing worse than being cheated on? Seeing your ex and the girl she cheated with get married. Less than a year later. And as part of a two-week long Mediterranean cruise. But they say the best revenge is a life well lived, right? Not for Celeste, it isn’t. It’s arranging an elaborate fake relationship with someone to make your ex jealous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lane Bishop is the perfect someone to do just that. Impulsive to the extreme, she loses her job right in front of Celeste. There goes Lane’s best shot at becoming a stylist in New York City. She can have another chance if she agrees to travel with Celeste, pretending to be her girlfriend so that Celeste’s ex sees her happy and thriving. The only catch? Celeste’s an heiress accustomed to getting everything she wants. She’s rigorous about details—some might say spoiled—which clashes with a free spirit like Lane. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two weeks travelling in close quarters challenges the faux lovebirds. They’ve got to appear harmoniously in love, even when they’d rather rib each other than whisper sweet nothings. But the sparks between Celeste and Lane become harder and harder to ignore. Can they convince the wedding guests of their passion without the flames setting them both alight?</description>

  <description>Noah Becker is nothing but trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s what Mama told me when I was a kid, kicking his pew in church and giggling at the games we’d play. It’s what the town said when his father died and the Becker brothers went wild. And it’s on repeat in my mind the day I walk into the whiskey distillery where he works to buy a wedding gift for my fiancé. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s trouble. &lt;br /&gt;Dirty, sweaty, rude trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No matter how many times I repeat it, I can’t escape Noah in our small Tennessee town. And the more I run into him, the more he infuriates me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because he sees what no one else does. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He sees me—the real me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The me I’m not sure I’m allowed to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m Ruby Grace Barnett, the mayor’s daughter. Soon to be a politician’s wife, just like Mama and Daddy always wanted. Soon to fulfill my family’s legacy, just like I always knew I would. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until the boy everyone warned me about makes me question everything, like whether the wedding I’m planning is one I even want. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone says Noah Becker is nothing but trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If only I had listened.</description>

  <description>Legend has it that there’s an intangible red string that binds two souls destined to be together.&lt;br /&gt;No matter the time, place, or circumstance, nothing can break the invisible thread between those two people who are meant to be together.&lt;br /&gt;That’s what it was like between Warner and I—an instant connection, like we’d always been together. &lt;br /&gt;He and I, both from traumatized families, found comfort in one another. The boy with the letterman jacket and charismatic smile. And me, his bohemian princess. The invisible string pulling us to one another despite the danger our love created.&lt;br /&gt;The town whispered about us.&lt;br /&gt;Our parents threatened us to stay away from one another.&lt;br /&gt;They tried to cut the string and keep us apart.&lt;br /&gt;We simply tied it in chaotic knots, with no hope for ever separating them.&lt;br /&gt;Together, we escaped and became the modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. Our getaway filled with crime and passion.&lt;br /&gt;But will our unbreakable bond uphold the chaos fate brought us, or will our love bleed into a pool of crimson?</description>

  <description>Get ready for the darker and dirtier side of New Orleans with a brand new alpha romance from USA Today bestselling author Meghan March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Orleans belongs to me. &lt;br /&gt;You don’t know my name, but I control everything you see—and all the things you don’t. &lt;br /&gt;My reach knows no bounds, and my demands are always met. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t need to loan money to a failing family distillery, but it amuses me to have them in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;To have her in my debt. &lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t know she caught my attention. &lt;br /&gt;She should’ve been more careful. &lt;br /&gt;I’m going to own her. Consume her. Maybe even keep her. &lt;br /&gt;It’s time to collect what I’m owed. &lt;br /&gt;Keira Kilgore, you’re now the property of Lachlan Mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Ruthless King is book 1 of the Mount Trilogy. Mount and Keira’s story is anticipated to be completed in Fall 2017 with Defiant Queen and Sinful Empire.*</description>

  <description>**Stand Alone** &lt;br /&gt;Her world was color. Canvas and paint. Indie O’Connell lived inside her head. Her voices the muse. And as a freshman at St. Peter's College, all she wanted, was to create a name for herself with the brush in her hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His world was over. Despite his humble upbringing, Kai Carter seemed to have it all. Captain of the swim team and a full scholarship. His golden boy status a mask he had to wear to keep his dream and his family afloat. All the pieces of his life dangled precariously from his fingertips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced to fight a battle he’d never signed up for, Kai’s loyalty turned out to be his undoing, and like a good captain, no matter what the cost, he’d gone down with the ship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They never planned for their worlds to collide. &lt;br /&gt;He was her brother's best friend. &lt;br /&gt;She was supposed to be invisible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Off limits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being together, regardless of how much they wanted it, was a line they'd never cross. But when lives get messy, lines get blurred, and in love, nothing is ever black and white. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>His world was water and rhythm. Hard work and drive kept Royal O'Connell one step ahead of his competition. His spot on the swim team, keeping his scholarship, was the only plan that mattered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His world was ebony and ivory. Natural talent and ambition set Camden Morgan apart from the other music majors. His dedication scoring him a full ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, their paths would have never crossed….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Royal meets his best friend's new roommate, his big plan and Camden’s controlled environment faces a variable that could destroy it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attraction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world they live in had no room for error. That undeniable pull between them was dangerous and neither one of them could've prepared for the choice they'd have to make. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love isn't always an easy road and, when everything they've worked for is on the line, they'll have to decide if being together is worth the risk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let There Be Light is a full-length standalone.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

They were rich and expected to attend her school, Fallen Crest Academy. They chose public school and now Samantha has to live with them. The problem is that she doesn't care at all: about them, about her friends, about her cheating boyfriend, or even about her parent's divorce. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe change is a good thing.</description>

  <description>Coming March 22, 2018&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;When romance novelist Kate Smith suddenly gets writer's block as she's beginning the final installment of her international bestselling erotic Bed 'n Breakfast series, she'll do pretty much anything to get her groove back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like sneak into a Tire Depot waiting room because her words flow there just like complimentary coffee-smooth, sweet, and scorchingly hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She manages to fly under the radar until the rugged and charming mechanic, Miles Hudson, notices the quirky redhead slinking in and out of the employees only entrance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she's way too intriguing to blow the whistle on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing a test-drive of her new book idea sounds like a much better option.</description>

  <description>The underworld of Chicago is far from forgiving. It’s a world where knowledge means power, power money, and money everything. &lt;br /&gt;While I paid the ultimate price to have it all, it wasn’t my decision to give my life.. &lt;br /&gt;That doesn’t mean I ceased to exist, only to live.&lt;br /&gt;Going where the job takes me and living in the shadows, with deadly accuracy I utilize the skills inherent to me, not knowing from where they came, not recalling what I’d lost. &lt;br /&gt;And then I saw her.&lt;br /&gt;Laurel Carlson.&lt;br /&gt;I shouldn’t want her, desire her, or need her, yet with each sighting I know she is exactly what I have to have. Laurel has the ability to do what I thought was impossible. She sees what others don’t. &lt;br /&gt;My gut tells me that it’s a deadly mistake to change my plans and open my world to her. My mind says she’ll be repulsed by my twisted existence. &lt;br /&gt;None of that matters, because my body won’t take no for an answer. &lt;br /&gt;I’ve made dangerous mistakes before.&lt;br /&gt;This time, will the price be too high?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aleatha Romig comes a brand-new dark romance bringing us back to the same dangerous underworld as SECRETS. You do not need to read the Web of Sin trilogy to get caught in this new and intriguing saga, Tangled Web. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWISTED is book one of the TANGLED WEB trilogy which will continue in OBSESSED and conclude in BOUND.&lt;br /&gt;Have you been Aleatha’d?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Beards, brothers, and bikers! Oh my! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Identical twins Beau and Duane Winston might share the same devastatingly handsome face, but where Beau is outgoing and sociable, Duane is broody and reserved. This is why Jessica James, recent college graduate and perpetual level-headed good girl, has been in naïve and unhealthy infatuation with Beau Winston for most of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His friendly smiles make her tongue-tied and weak-kneed, and she’s never been able to move beyond her childhood crush. Whereas Duane and Jessica have always been adversaries. She can’t stand him, and she’s pretty sure he can’t stand the sight of her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a case of mistaken identity, Jessica finds herself in a massive confusion kerfuffle. Jessica James has spent her whole life paralyzed by the fantasy of Beau and her assumptions of Duane’s disdain; therefore she’s unprepared for the reality that is Duane’s insatiable interest, as well as his hot hands and hot mouth and hotter looks. Not helping Jessica’s muddled mind and good girl sensibilities, Duane seems to have gotten himself in trouble with the local biker gang, the Iron Order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, Beau’s magic spell is broken. Yet when Jessica finds herself drawn to the man who was always her adversary, now more dangerous than ever, how much of her level-head heart is she willing to risk?</description>

  <description>Chemistry is my love language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always been able to separate feelings from chemosignals. A shot of dopamine, a dash of serotonin, and a sprinkle of oxytocin—and bam. You’re in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when egg meets sperm, you’re pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t even be surprised as I stared down at the little blue plus sign, because I knew exactly when and how, and with whom it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When: approximately five weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;Who: one night stand.&lt;br /&gt;How: prophylactic malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside? I don’t have to go looking for a suitable mate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genetically, he’s the cream of the crop. His musculature is a study in symmetry and strength, his height imposing and dominant. He is a man who thrives on control and command, a man who survives on intelligence and resourcefulness. A perfect male specimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the whole package is wrapped up in a flawlessly tailored suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m having this baby, and he insists we’re well-suited to have it together. And what’s worse? He wants more, in the way of love and marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But love isn’t real. It’s just a product of chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if he changes my mind about that, we’re both in trouble.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; It started as a simple search for a landscape designer...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a beautiful backyard for my new home and my neighbors suggested I look into Ward Landscaping &amp;amp; Design.&lt;br /&gt;The owner had no pictures of himself on his website, just a portfolio of nice outdoor sitting areas, pools, and vibrant gardens that I'd always dreamed of having.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I hired him.&lt;br /&gt;I expected to meet an average guy, but Mr. Marcel Ward is far from your average man. He's handsome, and well-built, and his smile--though a rare trait--is truly infectious.&lt;br /&gt;He's every woman's dream--a handsome, older man who doesn't mind getting down and dirty to create something beautiful all because of his passion for it. Unfortunately that lucky woman can't be me.&lt;br /&gt;Although Mr. Ward tests my limits, quickens my breath, and makes my heart skip a beat when he's around, I've made a promise to devote myself to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I falling for a man I know I can't have?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

They alter your entire outlook on life.&lt;br /&gt;I’m Madison Montgomery, and I want to play a game.&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what happens when I &lt;i&gt;win&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riddle me this, Mads.&lt;br /&gt;What goes bump in the night,&lt;br /&gt;but is something you can’t see with sight?&lt;br /&gt;You may run, and you may hide.&lt;br /&gt;If by happily ever after, you mean Bonnie &amp;amp; Clyde.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Riddle me this...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I am neither dead, nor alive, and I’m not something little Madison can hide.&lt;br /&gt;But you will be dead, by the time this is done...&lt;br /&gt;the timer starts now, and the games have just begun…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison Montgomery comes from money and power, but when someone close to her commits the ultimate crime, Madison must live with her tainted name for the rest of her life. When she begins Riverside Preparatory Academy, the private school her father has swept her into in The Hamptons, she hopes for a fresh start. What she wasn't hoping for was the pack of bad boys who run the school; ten, to be exact. When Madison gains the attention of their leader, Bishop Vincent Hayes, a whole new world that she didn't think existed is exposed to her. A whole world that starts and ends with The Elite Kings Club and these boys, are about to flip her world upside down. Secrets are overflowing and family lies are about to be exposed. Is there more to Madison Montgomery than even she knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About this book: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to admit something right now. The Silver Swan is &lt;i&gt;f*cked&lt;/i&gt;. It might be the most &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; story I've ever written with equally &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; characters. Who knew? You know, when I started this book, it was supposed to be YA. I wanted to write a book that my sisters could read. A book that won't have people look at my mum like &lt;i&gt;"damn... what sort of messed up shit happened to your kid?"&lt;/i&gt;. The angst, the assholeness, the games, the f**kery, the &lt;b&gt;WHAT THE F**KING F**K ARE YOU DOING???!!!...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I cannot even.... anyway, this is a &lt;b&gt;warning&lt;/b&gt; (and the only one I'll give you). It's crazy. I don't compare my work to my others, but this book is f**ked. It will most likely stomp all the f**k over people's hard limits (and not give a sh*t while it's doing it) and will make you second guess all the morals you thought you had.&lt;br /&gt;This most definitely is not looking like a love story right now... more like a..... I don't even....*shakes head* anyway, I apologise now. You asked for it..........</description>

  <description>Lennon Carter first saw my face with his hand around my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shock widened his eyes, starbursts of anger for what I'd done. &lt;br /&gt;That moment should have been the last of us; our beginning and end. &lt;br /&gt;Fate, it seems, had other plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dedicated musician, Lennon would become my mentor, my shadow, my protector and nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;We were two discordant notes that somehow blended with perfect harmony.&lt;br /&gt;Challenged to become a pianist as talented as him, I became Lennon's SIN, while he became my DISCIPLINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(A Taboo Student/Teacher Romance)&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"Girls like you aren't exactly welcomed at a place like this, so keep your head down and look the other way." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the exact words of my social worker when she dropped me in my newest hellhole, a place for "troubled teens". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't listen, and now I'm on their radar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They expect me to play along in their games of hierarchy, to fall in line in the social order they've deemed me fit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad for them, I don't follow rules. &lt;br /&gt;Too bad for me, they're determined to make sure I do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inconceivably attractive and treated like kings...these are the boys of Brayshaw High.&lt;br /&gt;And I'm the girl who got in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Releasing January 17th, 2019&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is book one in a three book series</description>

  <description>Lisa is a card-carrying, book-loving Gryffindor. Solid. And that’s why everyone knows she’s awesome. Well, except for her crush, Matt. He only ever sees her as a friend. Plus, he's got his eye on another girl. Oh well, plenty of fish and all that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing Lisa just read a book on the “wedding ring phenomenon”—you get more attention when you’re already taken. What if Lisa pretends to be Matt’s plus one? Maybe it’ll help Matt get his girl and Lisa can hook her own fish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the plan works, Matt suddenly claims he doesn’t like the view from the friend-zone and wants her instead… But she isn’t interested in being anyone’s second choice. If this guy wants to earn her attention, he’ll need more than some silly “phenomenon.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll need to go all out...</description>

  <description>Rafe Pierce just wants to keep his head down and earn his next promotion. Becoming Houston’s “Hot Cop” is his worst nightmare, and things only get worse when the sexiest reporter he’s ever met starts digging through his past. Sophie Klein has the power to expose a childhood he’d rather keep hidden, so why can’t he stay away from her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s everything Sophie Klein hates: brash, arrogant, and hot as hell. When a chance encounter with a bachelorette party makes Rafe a social-media sensation, Sophie is the lucky reporter chosen to tell his story. She can’t deny the chemistry between them, but is determined to keep her distance. Unfortunately for her, a drunken hookup in a bar supply closet ensures she will be spending at least the next nine months with him…</description>

  <description>A girl who can speak to gods must save her people without destroying herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince in danger must decide who to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boy with a monstrous secret waits in the wings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they must assassinate the king and stop the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a centuries-long war where beauty and brutality meet, their three paths entwine in a shadowy world of spilled blood and mysterious saints, where a forbidden romance threatens to tip the scales between dark and light. &lt;i&gt;Wicked Saints&lt;/i&gt; is the thrilling start to Emily A. Duncan’s devastatingly Gothic Something Dark and Holy trilogy..</description>

  <description>Lisa is a card-carrying, book-loving Gryffindor. Solid. And that’s why everyone knows she’s awesome. Well, except for her crush, Matt. He only ever sees her as a friend. Plus, he's got his eye on another girl. Oh well, plenty of fish and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing Lisa just read a book on the “wedding ring phenomenon”—you get more attention when you’re already taken. What if Lisa pretends to be Matt’s plus one? Maybe it’ll help Matt get his girl and Lisa can hook her own fish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the plan works, Matt suddenly claims he doesn’t like the view from the friend-zone and wants her instead… But she isn’t interested in being anyone’s second choice. If this guy wants to earn her attention, he’ll need more than some silly “phenomenon.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll need to go all out...</description>

  <description>Most people would probably be embarrassed to land themselves back in their hometown and working at a pizzeria after an ugly divorce. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s home, and I have one last shot to make Wren Daniels see me as more than just her brother’s best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the opportunity to show her what’s been right in front of her this whole time presents itself, I take it, holding nothing back this time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wren thinks we’re pretending, but there’s nothing fake about the way I feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After all, she’s always had…a pizza my heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I love you&lt;/i&gt;, he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forever&lt;/i&gt;, he said.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, he lied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he leaves me high and dry after a cross-country move, I push him out of my life as much as I can, which is hard to do when the guy who broke your heart also happens to be the most famous dude in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a disastrous year, he's aiming to rehab his reputation, and I just so happen to be aiming for a promotion at the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we strike a deal, and it's a win-win all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, what's the harm in a few dates to charity galas anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's arrogant, a total jerk. There's no way I'll fall for him...again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to love him. Now I hate him...I think.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It started as a simple search for a landscape designer…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a beautiful backyard for my new home and my neighbors suggested I look into Ward Landscaping &amp;amp; Design. &lt;br /&gt;The owner had no pictures of himself on his website, just a portfolio of nice outdoor sitting areas, pools, and vibrant gardens that I’d always dreamed of having.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I hired him.&lt;br /&gt;I expected to meet an average guy, but Mr. Marcel Ward is far from your average man. He’s handsome, and well-built, and his smile—though a rare trait—is truly infectious. &lt;br /&gt;He’s every woman’s dream—a handsome, older man who doesn’t mind getting down and dirty to create something beautiful all because of his passion for it. Unfortunately, that lucky woman can’t be me. &lt;br /&gt;Although Mr. Ward tests my limits, quickens my breath, and makes my heart skip a beat when he’s around, I’ve promised to devote myself to my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I falling for a man I know I can’t have?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"You don't belong." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No words whispered in anger have ever rung more true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They're the Kings of Brayshaw with the world at their feet, destined for greatness and in need of control.  &lt;br /&gt;I'm the girl from the gutter with nothing to offer and as defiant as they come.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say it doesn't matter, that I'm one of them now, and nothing could ever change that. Not even me, should I dare try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But they're wrong. &lt;br /&gt;They underestimate how far I'll go to protect them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trouble is coming...and they have no idea. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;--- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is book two in a three book series.</description>

  <description>When I put up a &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;ROOMMATE WANTED&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; poster, he was the last person on earth I thought would respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was also the last person on earth I'd agree to let live with me...on purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, here we are⁠—roommates. I'm certain we can coexist without it being awkward, and I'm determined to make it work. There will be no sexual tension building with each accidental touch, no flutters when he wears that stupid backward baseball cap, and definitely no flirting when we text back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb Mills can't be the guy for me. He's my best friend's ex-boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that would be wrong...&lt;i&gt;right?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Hi Monty.

  <description>A wrong number is supposed to be just that—a wrong number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delete. &lt;i&gt;Done.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not continue to text. Do not flirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wrong number shouldn't be the first person on your mind in the morning, or the last at night...and you're &lt;i&gt;definitely&lt;/i&gt; not supposed to talk them into buying a baby goat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because that would be weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zach Hastings and I get into a wrong-number mix-up, we don't follow the rules. We keep texting and flirting, because he's wicked funny and perfectly nerdy and a wonderful distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not looking for love, and Zach definitely had the wrong number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe he's the right guy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The man I hate might be the first one to pluck my petals…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confession: I, Dandelion “Dani” Wright, am twenty-six years old and have yet to be deflowered. No man has hosed my hyacinth. Fondled my freesia. Diddled my daffodil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My excuse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was too busy running my family’s flower shop and winning floral design competitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly that whole pesky virginity thing becomes a big deal when Jacob West walks back into my life. The boy I once loved. The same boy who humiliated me when he stood me up for prom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Jacob is no boy, though: he’s all man now—confident, charming, and so sexy my metaphorical blossoms are getting scorched. I can almost forget I’m supposed to hate him forever. &lt;i&gt;Almost.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make things worse, he’s my main competition now, since he took over his parents’ flower shop. If I give into this sizzling attraction between us, it could jeopardize everything I’ve worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I’m not careful, he might not just be the first man to pluck my petals—he might also be the only man to capture my heart.</description>

  <description>One simple question changed both our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I keep you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were only nine then, and all that mattered to us was seeing each other again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that all changed as we grew up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years of pretending like we didn’t know each other. That nothing we felt when we were younger had ever happened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that question was never asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knew that it would take so long for us to figure it all out? To stop pretending and finally realize that we had been there for each other all along.  It might have taken us 21 years, but it’s finally here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is our story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HARRY DRESDEN — WIZARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lost Items Found. Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry Dresden is the best at what he does. Well, technically, he's the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; at what he does. So when the Chicago P.D. has a case that transcends mortal creativity or capability, they come to him for answers. For the "everyday" world is actually full of strange and magical things—and most don't play well with humans. That's where Harry comes in. Takes a wizard to catch a—well, whatever. There's just one problem. Business, to put it mildly, stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the police bring him in to consult on a grisly double murder committed with black magic, Harry's seeing dollar signs. But where there's black magic, there's a black mage behind it. And now that mage knows Harry's name. And that's when things start to get interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic - it can get a guy killed.</description>

  <description>Permission is the conclusion of Grim and Emma Jean's story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He was my first. &lt;br /&gt;But since then I’ve been programmed to enjoy torture. &lt;br /&gt;Being watched. &lt;br /&gt;Being taken two at a time. &lt;br /&gt;I feel nothing now. I’m empty. Hollow. Lost. &lt;br /&gt;He knows it. He knows I need more. &lt;br /&gt;So, he gives it to me. &lt;br /&gt;My body has never felt such pleasure. &lt;br /&gt;My heart has never endured such pain &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new, &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, contemporary romance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Naked surfer. Habitual pothead. A con, a liar, a thief and a fraud. &lt;br /&gt;Last I heard, he was extorting the rich and screwing their wives for a living. &lt;br /&gt;Which is why I’m more than a little surprised to find him at my threshold, looking for my friendship, my services, and most puzzling of all—looking humbled. &lt;br /&gt;Thing is, I’m on a boycott. Literally—I cut boys from my life. Permanently. &lt;br /&gt;Problem is, Bane is not a boy, he is all man, and I’m falling, crashing, drowning in his sweet, perfect lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesse Carter&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hot as hell, cold as ice. &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t aware of her existence until a fat, juicy deal landed in my lap. &lt;br /&gt;She’s a part of it, a little plaything to kill some time. &lt;br /&gt;She is collateral, a means to an end, and a side-bonus for striking a deal with her oil tycoon stepdad. &lt;br /&gt;More than anything, Jesse Carter is a tough nut to crack. &lt;br /&gt;Little does she know, I have the teeth for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*This book contains material that might be offensive for some or elicit a strong emotional response. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>They call him The Mute for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;Hard, cold and calculated, he rarely speaks.&lt;br /&gt;When he does, it’s with disdain.&lt;br /&gt;When he does, his words aren’t meant for me.&lt;br /&gt;When he does, my stomach flips and my world tilts on its axis.&lt;br /&gt;He is thirty-three.&lt;br /&gt;I am eighteen.&lt;br /&gt;He’s a single dad and my father’s business partner.&lt;br /&gt;I’m just a kid to him and his enemy’s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;He’s emotionally unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;And I am…feeling.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Would you trade your soul mate for your soul?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Shadowhunter’s life is bound by duty. Constrained by honor. The word of a Shadowhunter is a solemn pledge, and no vow is more sacred than the vow that binds &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, warrior partners—sworn to fight together, die together, but never to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Carstairs has learned that the love she shares with her &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, Julian Blackthorn, isn’t just forbidden—it could destroy them both. She knows she should run from Julian. But how can she when the Blackthorns are threatened by enemies on all sides?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only hope is the Black Volume of the Dead, a spell book of terrible power. Everyone wants it. Only the Blackthorns can find it. Spurred on by a dark bargain with the Seelie Queen, Emma; her best friend, Cristina; and Mark and Julian Blackthorn journey into the Courts of Faerie, where glittering revels hide bloody danger and no promise can be trusted. Meanwhile, rising tension between Shadowhunters and Downworlders has produced the Cohort, an extremist group of Shadowhunters dedicated to registering Downworlders and “unsuitable” Nephilim. They’ll do anything in their power to expose Julian’s secrets and take the Los Angeles Institute for their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Downworlders turn against the Clave, a new threat rises in the form of the Lord of Shadows—the Unseelie King, who sends his greatest warriors to slaughter those with Blackthorn blood and seize the Black Volume. As dangers close in, Julian devises a risky scheme that depends on the cooperation of an unpredictable enemy. But success may come with a price he and Emma cannot even imagine, one that will bring with it a reckoning of blood that could have repercussions for everyone and everything they hold dear.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Keralie Corrington may seem harmless, but in fact, she's one of Quadara's most skilled thieves and a liar. Varin, on the other hand, is an honest, upstanding citizen of Quadara's most enlightened region, Eonia. Varin runs afoul of Keralie when she steals a package from him, putting his life in danger. When Varin attempts to retrieve the package, he and Keralie find themselves entangled in a conspiracy that leaves all four of Quadara's queens dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no other choices and on the run from Keralie's former employer, the two decide to join forces, endeavoring to discover who has killed the queens and save their own lives in the process. When their reluctant partnership blooms into a tenuous romance, they must overcome their own dark secrets in hopes of a future together that seemed impossible just days before. But first they have to stay alive and untangle the secrets behind the nation's four dead queens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An enthralling fast-paced murder mystery where competing agendas collide with deadly consequences, &lt;i&gt;Four Dead Queens&lt;/i&gt; heralds the arrival of an exciting new YA talent.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From subway to Broadway to happily ever after. Modern love in all its thrill, hilarity, and uncertainty has never been so compulsively readable as in New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren’s romantic novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriages of convenience are so...inconvenient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Holland Bakker has invented excuses to descend into the subway station near her apartment, drawn to the captivating music performed by her street musician crush. Lacking the nerve to actually talk to the gorgeous stranger, fate steps in one night in the form of a drunken attacker. Calvin Mcloughlin rescues her, but quickly disappears when the police start asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the only resource she has to pay the brilliant musician back, Holland gets Calvin an audition with her uncle, Broadway’s hottest musical director. When the tryout goes better than even Holland could have imagined, Calvin is set for a great entry into Broadway—until his reason for disappearing earlier becomes clear: he’s in the country illegally, his student visa having expired years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that her uncle needs Calvin as much as Calvin needs him, a wild idea takes hold of her. Impulsively, she marries the Irishman, her infatuation a secret only to him. As their relationship evolves and Calvin becomes the darling of Broadway—in the middle of the theatrics and the acting-not-acting—will Holland and Calvin to realize that they both stopped pretending a long time ago?</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, college student Quincy Carpenter went on vacation with five friends and came back alone, the only survivor of a horror movie–scale massacre. In an instant, she became a member of a club no one wants to belong to—a group of similar survivors known in the press as the Final Girls. Lisa, who lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout's knife; Sam, who went up against the Sack Man during her shift at the Nightlight Inn; and now Quincy, who ran bleeding through the woods to escape Pine Cottage and the man she refers to only as Him. The three girls are all attempting to put their nightmares behind them, and, with that, one another. Despite the media's attempts, they never meet.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Now, Quincy is doing well—maybe even great, thanks to her Xanax prescription. She has a caring almost-fiancé, Jeff; a popular baking blog; a beautiful apartment; and a therapeutic presence in Coop, the police officer who saved her life all those years ago. Her memory won’t even allow her to recall the events of that night; the past is in the past. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; That is, until Lisa, the first Final Girl, is found dead in her bathtub, wrists slit, and Sam, the second, appears on Quincy's doorstep. Blowing through Quincy's life like a whirlwind, Sam seems intent on making Quincy relive the past, with increasingly dire consequences, all of which makes Quincy question why Sam is really seeking her out. And when new details about Lisa's death come to light, Quincy's life becomes a race against time as she tries to unravel Sam's truths from her lies, evade the police and hungry reporters, and, most crucially, remember what really happened at Pine Cottage, before what was started ten years ago is finished.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Katie McGarry’s trademark wrong-side-of-the-tracks romance is given a new twist in the gritty YA contemporary novel, &lt;i&gt;Only a Breath Apart&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say your destiny is carved in stone. But some destinies are meant to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only curse Jesse Lachlin believes in is his grandmother’s will: in order to inherit his family farm he must win the approval of his childhood best friend, the girl he froze out his freshman year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fortuneteller tells Scarlett she's psychic, but what is real is Scarlett’s father’s controlling attitude and the dark secrets at home. She may be able to escape, but only if she can rely on the one boy who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each midnight meeting pushes Jesse and Scarlett to confront their secrets and their feelings, but as love blooms, the curse rears its ugly head…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43802613-work-in-progress" rel="nofollow"&gt;B07MYCRRND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought my first kiss would be on my wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here I stand, clutching a bouquet of pale pink roses behind the doors of a Las Vegas chapel, and at the end of the aisle is the absolute last man I imagined would be waiting for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Bane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author. Notorious bad boy. Savagely handsome, dark as sin, chiseled as stone. And somehow, my soon-to-be husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marry him, and I’ll land my dream job. Save him, and I’ll walk away with everything I’ve ever wanted. All I have to do is remember it’s all for show. None of it is real, no matter how real it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, I have to survive the kiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with lips like his, I don’t stand a chance.</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A contemporary novel about two best friends who must make tough decisions about their futures--and the TV show they host--in their senior year of high school.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Friday night, best friends Delia and Josie become Rayne Ravenscroft and Delilah Darkwood, hosts of the campy creature feature show &lt;em&gt;Midnite Matinee&lt;/em&gt; on the local cable station TV Six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the end of senior year quickly approaching, the girls face tough decisions about their futures. Josie has been dreading graduation, as she tries to decide whether to leave for a big university and chase her dream career in mainstream TV. And Lawson, one of the show's guest performers, a talented MMA fighter with weaknesses for pancakes, fantasy novels, and Josie, is making her tough decision even harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scary movies are the last connection Delia has to her dad, who abandoned the family years ago. If &lt;em&gt;Midnite Matinee&lt;/em&gt; becomes a hit, maybe he'll see it and want to be a part of her life again. And maybe Josie will stay with the show instead of leaving her behind, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tug-of-war between growing up and growing apart tests the bonds of their friendship, Josie and Delia start to realize that an uncertain future can be both monstrous...and momentous.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The chilling new psychological thriller from the #1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I Am Watching You&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was their darkest secret. Three schoolgirls made a promise—to take the horrible truth of what they did to the grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years later, Beth and Sally have tried to put the trauma behind them. Though Carol has distanced herself from her former friends, the three are adamant that the truth must never come to light, even if the memory still haunts them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when some shocking news threatens to unearth their dark secret, Beth enlists the help of private investigator Matthew Hill to help her and Sally reconnect with estranged Carol—before the terrible act they committed as teenagers is revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth wishes she could take back the vow they made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But somebody is watching and will stop at nothing to ensure the secret stays buried. Now, with her beloved family in peril, can Beth still keep the promise?</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>Sera has always felt as if she didn’t belong among her people, the Cerulean. She is curious about everything and can’t stop questioning her three mothers, her best friend, Leela, and even the High Priestess. Sera has longed for the day when the tether that connects her City Above the Sky to the earthly world below finally severs and sends the Cerulean to a new planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Sera is chosen as the sacrifice to break the tether, she doesn’t know what to feel. To save her City, Sera must throw herself from its edge and end her own life. But something goes wrong and she survives the fall, landing in a place called Kaolin. She has heard tales about the humans there, and soon learns that the dangers her mothers warned her of are real. If Sera has any hope to return to her City, she’ll have to find the magic within herself to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today and Washington Post bestselling author L.J. Shen comes an intense, high school enemies-to-lovers romance with a twist.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Penn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say revenge is a dish best served cold. &lt;br /&gt;I’d had four years to stew on what Daria Followhill did to me, and now my heart was completely iced. &lt;br /&gt;I took her first kiss. &lt;br /&gt;She took the only thing I loved. &lt;br /&gt;I was poor. &lt;br /&gt;She was rich. &lt;br /&gt;The good thing about circumstances? They can change. Fast. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m her parents’ latest shiny project. &lt;br /&gt;Her housemate. Her tormentor. The captain of the rival football team she hates so much. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, baby girl, say it—I’m your foster brother. &lt;br /&gt;There’s a price to pay for ruining the only good thing in my life, and she’s about to shell out some serious tears. &lt;br /&gt;Daria Followhill thinks she is THE queen. I’m about to prove to her that she’s nothing but a spoiled princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daria&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves a good old unapologetic punk. &lt;br /&gt;But being a bitch? Oh, you get slammed for every snarky comment, cynical eye roll, and foot you put in your adversaries’ way. &lt;br /&gt;The thing about stiletto heels is that they make a hell of a dent when you walk all over the people who try to hurt you. &lt;br /&gt;In Penn Scully’s case, I pierced his heart until he bled out, then left it in a trash can on a bright summer day. &lt;br /&gt;Four years ago, he asked me to save all my firsts for him. &lt;br /&gt;Now he lives across the hall, and I want nothing more than to be his last everything. &lt;br /&gt;His parting words when he gave me his heart were that nothing in this world is free. &lt;br /&gt;Now? Now he is making me pay. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Olive is always unlucky: in her career, in love, in…well, everything. Her identical twin sister Ami, on the other hand, is probably the luckiest person in the world. Her meet-cute with her fiancé is something out of a romantic comedy (gag) and she’s managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a series of Internet contests (double gag). Worst of all, she’s forcing Olive to spend the day with her sworn enemy, Ethan, who just happens to be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olive braces herself to get through 24 hours of wedding hell before she can return to her comfortable, unlucky life. But when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning from eating bad shellfish, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. And now there’s an all-expenses-paid honeymoon in Hawaii up for grabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting their mutual hatred aside for the sake of a free vacation, Olive and Ethan head for paradise, determined to avoid each other at all costs. But when Olive runs into her future boss, the little white lie she tells him is suddenly at risk to become a whole lot bigger. She and Ethan now have to pretend to be loving newlyweds, and her luck seems worse than ever. But the weird thing is that she doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, she feels kind of... lucky.</description>

  <description>All Stevie Bell wanted was to find the key to the Ellingham mystery, but instead she found her classmate dead. And while she solved that murder, the crimes of the past are still waiting in the dark. Just as Stevie feels she’s on the cusp of putting it together, her parents pull her out of Ellingham academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her own safety they say. She must move past this obsession with crime. Now that Stevie’s away from the school of topiaries and secret tunnels, and her strange and endearing friends, she begins to feel disconnected from the rest of the world. At least she won’t have to see David anymore. David, who she kissed. David, who lied to her about his identity—son of despised politician Edward King. Then King himself arrives at her house to offer a deal: He will bring Stevie back to Ellingham immediately. In return, she must play nice with David. King is in the midst of a campaign and can’t afford his son stirring up trouble. If Stevie’s at school, David will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tantalizing riddles behind the Ellingham murders are still waiting to be unraveled, and Stevie knows she’s so close. But the path to the truth has more twists and turns than she can imagine—and moving forward involves hurting someone she cares for. In New York Times bestselling author Maureen Johnson’s second novel of the &lt;i&gt;Truly Devious&lt;/i&gt; series, nothing is free, and someone will pay for the truth with their life.</description>

  <description>Echo Ridge is small-town America. Ellery's never been there, but she's heard all about it. Her aunt went missing there at age seventeen. And only five years ago, a homecoming queen put the town on the map when she was killed. Now Ellery has to move there to live with a grandmother she barely knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is picture-perfect, but it's hiding secrets. And before school even begins for Ellery, someone's declared open season on homecoming, promising to make it as dangerous as it was five years ago. Then, almost as if to prove it, another girl goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellery knows all about secrets. Her mother has them; her grandmother does too. And the longer she's in Echo Ridge, the clearer it becomes that everyone there is hiding something. The thing is, secrets are dangerous--and most people aren't good at keeping them. Which is why in Echo Ridge, it's safest to keep your secrets to yourself.</description>

  <description>We met on a Tuesday. &lt;br /&gt;Became best friends, then lovers, on a Tuesday. &lt;br /&gt;And everything fell apart on a Tuesday... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Taylor has three automatic strikes in my book: 1) She hates me. She also claims that I'm a "domineering jerk with a huge, overbearing ego." (I do have something huge. It's not my ego, though.) 2) She takes our mandatory tutoring sessions way too seriously. 3) She's sexy as hell... And a virgin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, those were her strikes before our study sessions started lasting longer than they were supposed to. Until one innocent kiss became a hundred dirty ones, and until she became the first woman I ever fell hard for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our future together after graduation was supposed to be set: &lt;br /&gt;Professional football for me. Law school for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she left me at the end of the semester with no explanation, and then she completely disappeared from my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until tonight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We met on a Tuesday. &lt;br /&gt;Became everything, then nothing, on a Tuesday. &lt;br /&gt;And now it's seven years later, on a Tuesday... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a full length second chance romance, inspired by Adele's "&lt;i&gt;When We Were Young&lt;/i&gt;"**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one believes in them. But soon no one will forget them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1889. The city is on the cusp of industry and power, and the Exposition Universelle has breathed new life into the streets and dredged up ancient secrets. Here, no one keeps tabs on dark truths better than treasure-hunter and wealthy hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie. When the elite, ever-powerful Order of Babel coerces him to help them on a mission, Séverin is offered a treasure that he never imagined: his true inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hunt down the ancient artifact the Order seeks, Séverin calls upon a band of unlikely experts: An engineer with a debt to pay. A historian banished from his home. A dancer with a sinister past. And a brother in arms if not blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they will join Séverin as he explores the dark, glittering heart of Paris. What they find might change the course of history--but only if they can stay alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; From NYT and USA Today bestselling author, Gina L. Maxwell, comes a brand new series with a fresh twist on an old classic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time, in Neverland, North Carolina--I fell in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was twelve when Peter first climbed up to my balcony.&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen when I sneaked out to see him at the School for Lost Boys.&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen when his touch made me fly,&lt;br /&gt;And eighteen when his words made me cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were magnetic, drawn to each other from that very first night, and what I thought would be forever. But when it came time for me to leave, he wouldn't come with, so I left town with a map for my future and a shattered heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ten years later, I've returned to Neverland, hoping to find a man in place of the boy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter was partially right, growing up is no fun. After quitting my fancy career that sucked the magic out of life, I'm now organizing the fundraiser of the year. In a move that could make or break the event and my new company, I've hired Peter, master mechanic and owner of LB Automotive, to help me pull this off--trusting him to rebuild a classic car for the auction that could help hundreds of foster kids in need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was prepared, but the boy who refused to leave is now a man hell-bent on getting me to stay, and as sparks fly between us, that undeniable fire flares back to life, deeper and hotter than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that ripped body doesn't mean Peter's matured enough to make us or this event work, and not everyone in Neverland is happy about my return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every wound heals.&lt;br /&gt;Not every heart can be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Not every boy grows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after all this time, the love we found might be lost to us again...this time, forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Pan is an adult contemporary romance retelling of Peter Pan, complete with Wendy, Hook, Tink, and all the Lost Boys as sexy mechanics. There are no fantasy elements in this world, other than the "magic" that happens between the sheets. ;) &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The final battle is here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aelin Galathynius has vowed to save her people―but at a tremendous cost. Locked within an iron coffin by the Queen of the Fae, Aelin must draw upon her fiery will as she endures months of torture. The knowledge that yielding to Maeve will doom those she loves keeps her from breaking, but her resolve is unraveling with each passing day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Aelin captured, friends and allies are scattered to different fates. Some bonds will grow even deeper, while others will be severed forever. As destinies weave together at last, all must fight if Erilea is to have any hope of salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years in the making, Sarah J. Maas's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Throne of Glass series draws to an explosive conclusion as Aelin fights to save herself―and the promise of a better world.</description>

  <description>This isn’t your high school Shakespeare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have thirty days to block my secretary’s advances. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have thirty days to prove my worth as Illyria Pharmaceuticals’ CFO. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have thirty days to help my boss fall in love with another woman. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pretending to be in charge is harder than it looks. Duke Orsino, the CEO, sets my knees quaking with every glance. Olivia, my secretary, leaves unmentionables in my desk drawers. And I have no idea where my twin brother got off to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have thirty days to keep this shipwreck of life from falling apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Twelfth Floor is a contemporary romance adaption of the Shakespeare play, Twelfth Night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a stand alone romance with an alpha hero, a not-so-alpha heroine, and lots of foul language.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Probably my favorite Lauren Oliver book</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel. At times it was super hard to put down I became so invested in the characters and really just felt for Brynn and Mia. I wasn't sure sometimes where we were going but I like the ride.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;**A standalone romance inspired by the classic film, Roman Holiday.**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never believed in fairy-tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never held out for Prince Charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up poor in small-town California as the oldest of six siblings, I knew I would never ride off into the sunset with anyone. That was even more apparent when a senseless tragedy took the lives of my parents, forcing me to become the sole guardian of our dysfunctional household at the mere age of twenty-three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a fateful encounter literally brought Prince Charming to my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought Viktor was just your average businessman passing through, albeit obscenely handsome, six-foot-five, blue-eyed, and mysteriously rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon I discovered the truth behind Viktor’s façade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beneath his quiet, enigmatic gaze and cocky charm, is a man who is running away from who he really is. A role he’d rather not fulfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is Viktor of House Nordin, His Royal Highness, The Crown Prince of Sweden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet uncovering Viktor’s secret was only the first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t expect to fall in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t expect to have my whole life turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you’re from two different worlds, can your hearts meet somewhere in the middle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or do happily-ever-afters only exist in fairy-tales?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;br /&gt;- The Swedish Prince will be available on iBooks/Nook/Kobo on March 19th and 20th ONLY&lt;br /&gt;- The Swedish Prince will have a live release on Amazon KU on March 22nd &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>My sister Bianca and I have two rules governing the dispensation of our trust funds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One. I get married first. &lt;br /&gt;Two. She gets married second. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither of us will see a penny until we are both “properly cared for.” My father had a terrible sense of humor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I turn to the only man who can help me. Even when the last time I saw him he said he hated me. Even when I love him as much as I loathe him. Even when he’s all wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liar. Thief. Killer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few words whispered about him in back alleys. To me he’s Pierce, to everyone else, he’s Pierson St. James, local mobster and second in charge of the infamous Wild Dogs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He may be disreputable, but desperation calls for extreme measures. A long time ago, he promised to marry me. Now I’m going to hold him to that promise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And we are both going to regret it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t your high school Shakespeare...and you've never read The Taming of the Shrew like this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a standalone romance with alpha heroes, alpha heroines, and a whole lot of foul language.</description>

The beginning seemed to be passed right but the ending felt rushed. I'm not sure how many pages it is because my Kindle wouldn't tell me but I totally could've read more.<br /><br />That being...</strong>]]>

  <description>Arthur is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if they can’t quite nail a first date . . . or a second first date . . . or a third?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work . . . and Ben doesn’t try hard enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if it is?</description>

  <description>They say your first kiss should be earned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine was stolen by a devil in a masquerade mask under the black Chicago sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the vows you take on your wedding day are sacred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine were broken before we left church. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say your heart only beats for one man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mine split and bled for two rivals who fought for it until the bitter end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was promised to Angelo Bandini, the heir to one of the most powerful families in the Chicago Outfit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then taken by Senator Wolfe Keaton, who held my father’s sins over his head to force me into marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that all great love stories have a happy ending. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, Francesca Rossi, found myself erasing and rewriting mine until the very last chapter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One kiss. &lt;br /&gt;Two men. &lt;br /&gt;Three lives. &lt;br /&gt;Entwined together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And somewhere between these two men, I had to find my forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Rosie&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say that life is a beautiful lie and death a painful truth. They're right. &lt;br /&gt;No one has ever made me feel more alive than the guy who serves as a constant reminder that my clock is ticking. &lt;br /&gt;He is my forbidden, shiny apple. &lt;br /&gt;The striking fallacy to my blunt, raw, truth. &lt;br /&gt;He is also my sister's ex-boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;One thing you should know before you judge me; &lt;br /&gt;I saw him first. I craved him first. I loved him first. &lt;br /&gt;Eleven years later, he waltzed into my life, demanding a second chance. &lt;br /&gt;Dean Cole wants to be my bronze horseman. My white knight has finally arrived. Hopefully, he isn’t too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dean&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say the brightest stars burn out the fastest. They’re right. &lt;br /&gt;She sets my mind on fire. &lt;br /&gt;All smart mouth, snarky attitude and a huge heart. &lt;br /&gt;In a world where everything is dull, she shines like fucking Sirius. &lt;br /&gt;Eleven years ago, fate tore us apart. &lt;br /&gt;This time, I dare it to try. &lt;br /&gt;Getting to her is a battlefield, but man, that’s why they call me Ruckus. &lt;br /&gt;Rosie LeBlanc is about to find out how hard I can fight. &lt;br /&gt;And conquering her will be the sweetest victory. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Emilia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances, and it’s true.The man who comes to me in my dreams also haunts me in my nightmares. He is a brilliant lawyer. A skilled criminal. A beautiful liar. A bully and a savior, a monster and a lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, he made me run away from the small town where we lived. Now, he came for me in New York, and he isn’t leaving until he takes me with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vicious&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a starving artist. Pretty and evasive like cherry blossom. Ten years ago, she barged into my life unannounced and turned everything upside down. She paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emilia LeBlanc is completely off-limits, my best friend’s ex-girlfriend. The woman who knows my darkest secret, and the daughter of the cheap Help we hired to take care of our estate. That should deter me from chasing her, but it doesn’t. So she hates me. Big fucking deal. She better get used to me.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From the internationally celebrated author of the Original Sinners series comes a brand-new tale of betrayal, revenge and a family scandal that bore a 150-year-old mystery&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cooper McQueen wakes up from a night with a beautiful stranger, it's to discover he's been robbed. The only item stolen—a million-dollar bottle of bourbon. The thief, a mysterious woman named Paris, claims the bottle is rightfully hers. After all, the label itself says it's property of the Maddox family who owned and operated Red Thread Bourbon distillery since the last days of the Civil War until the company went out of business for reasons no one knows… No one except Paris. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small hours of a Louisville morning, Paris unspools the lurid tale of Tamara Maddox, heiress to the distillery that became an empire. But the family tree is rooted in tainted soil and has borne rotten fruit. Theirs is a legacy of wealth and power, but also of lies, secrets and sins of omission. The Maddoxes have bourbon in their blood—and blood in their bourbon. Why Paris wants the bottle of Red Thread remains a secret until the truth of her identity is at last revealed, and the century-old vengeance Tamara vowed against her family can finally be completed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full-length STANDALONE romantic comedy AND romantic suspense (I know, it's both!) debut from the owner of the popular bookish Etsy store, Bookified!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lena Douglas may be a world-famous Instagram model, but she hates it. She’s a real InstaPrincess, reigning over her court of perfectly airbrushed selfies and avocado toast posts, but at twenty-six, she’s running out of time before the Internet moves on to a younger model. Starting her own fitness line is the perfect escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the thing about new companies? They kind of need a little cash. A mentor who can show Lena how to run a business wouldn’t hurt, either. Fortunately, she’s rented the house of a man who could be her perfect business partner. If she agrees to accompany him to events as his date, he might just fund her line. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad she doesn’t have time for distractions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad her new neighbor is stupidly attractive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad he’s the neighbor from hell.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Grant has spent his entire career building his father’s construction company into the success it is today. Now that his father has finally handed the reins over to him, Travis is more than ready to take that success to a whole new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect way to do that? Do a killer job constructing the new civic center for Travis’ small Arizona town, a desperately-needed new building to keep the town afloat. The only problem? Not everyone is sure Travis can handle such an important project, especially John Masterson, the arch nemesis of Travis’ father since their infancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis is determined to complete the project without a hitch. But that’s before a beautiful woman moves in next door. A beautiful woman who can’t seem to keep the noise down no matter how many times he calls the police.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad he doesn’t have time for distractions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad his sleep-deprived mind can’t focus on work because of the racket next door.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too bad all he can think about is tasting his new neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;More wonderful awesomeness about Miss InstaPrincess:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This standalone, happily-ever-after romance is told in alternating points of view between the hero and heroine (Travis and Lena.) It switches every couple of chapters.&lt;br /&gt;-All you need to know about Travis: Wealthy. Sarcastic. Construction Worker. Trust me, it works.&lt;br /&gt;-There is just a BIT of a bromance between Travis and his best friend. Prepare yourself.&lt;br /&gt;-This is a full-length, standalone novel of about 80,000 words BUT it also includes the first chapter of the standalone sequel coming Fall 2018 and featuring characters you'll meet in Miss InstaPrincess and come to love!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Stop the Magician. Steal the book. Save the future.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In modern-day New York, magic is all but extinct. The remaining few who have an affinity for magic—the Mageus—live in the shadows, hiding who they are. Any Mageus who enters Manhattan becomes trapped by the Brink, a dark energy barrier that confines them to the island. Crossing it means losing their power—and often their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Esta is a talented thief, and she’s been raised to steal magical artifacts from the sinister Order that created the Brink. With her innate ability to manipulate time, Esta can pilfer from the past, collecting these artifacts before the Order even realizes she’s there. And all of Esta’s training has been for one final job: traveling back to 1902 to steal an ancient book containing the secrets of the Order—and the Brink—before the Magician can destroy it and doom the Mageus to a hopeless future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Old New York is a dangerous world ruled by ruthless gangs and secret societies, a world where the very air crackles with magic. Nothing is as it seems, including the Magician himself. And for Esta to save her future, she may have to betray everyone in the past.</description>

Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>The Girls of Innovations Academy are beautiful and well-behaved—it says so on their report cards. Under the watchful gaze of their Guardians, the all-girl boarding school offers an array of studies and activities, from “Growing a Beautiful and Prosperous Garden” to “Art Appreciation” and “Interior Design.” The girls learn to be the best society has to offer. Absent is the difficult math coursework, or the unnecessary sciences or current events. They are obedient young ladies, free from arrogance or defiance. Until Mena starts to realize that their carefully controlled existence may not be quite as it appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mena and her friends begin to uncover the dark secrets of what’s actually happening there—and who they really are—the girls of Innovations will find out what they are truly capable of. Because some of the prettiest flowers have the sharpest thorns.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A lady with a noble mission. A duke looking for redemption. A forbidden love that cannot be denied…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Daphne Hallworth is ready to celebrate the holidays with her family. But when they accidentally leave her home alone, Daphne uses the time to work on her dream—opening a home for unwed mothers. But her quest isn’t problem-free: She’s in a battle to win the property for the home against her brother’s best friend-turned-enemy, Paul Barstowe, Duke of Southart. And that’s not all: someone has stolen her personal diary, which holds secrets that could devastate her family. Daphne has always harbored private feelings for the man her family scorns…though perhaps striking a bargain with the handsome Duke will solve both their problems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul, long considered good for nothing, aims to open a hospital to honor his brother and restore his reputation. So when a conflict over the land brings him straight into Daphne’s life, they make a deal: He will help her find her diary if Daphne can change her family’s opinion of him. But before he can win her family’s affection, he has to win hers first. Maybe love was the answer to their family feud all along?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this short story enhanced with beautiful illustrations, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Man Called Ove&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Beartown&lt;/i&gt; delivers an insightful and poignant tale about finding out what is truly important in life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A father and a son are seeing each other for the first time in years. The father has a story to share before it’s too late. He tells his son about a courageous little girl lying in a hospital bed a few miles away. She’s a smart kid—smart enough to know that she won’t beat cancer by drawing with crayons all day, but it seems to make the adults happy, so she keeps doing it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As he talks about this plucky little girl, the father also reveals more about himself: his triumphs in business, his failures as a parent, his past regrets, his hopes for the future.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, on a cold winter’s night, the father has been given an unexpected chance to do something remarkable that could change the destiny of a little girl he hardly knows. But before he can make the deal of a lifetime, he must find out what his own life has actually been worth, and only his son can reveal that answer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With humor and compassion, Fredrik Backman’s &lt;i&gt;The Deal of a Lifetime&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that life is a fleeting gift, and our legacy rests in how we share that gift with others.</description>

  <description>Although Scott Carey doesn’t look any different, he’s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn’t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King’s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade—but escalating—battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott’s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face–including his own—he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott’s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started at a dinner party. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors--a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all--a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately focuses on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they've kept for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family--a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist.</description>

  <description>As a slave in the Kipchak Khanate, Jinghua has lost everything: her home, her family, her freedom … until the kingdom is conquered by enemy forces and she finds herself an unlikely conspirator in the escape of Prince Khalaf and his irascible father across the vast Mongol Empire. On the run, with adversaries on all sides and an endless journey ahead, Jinghua hatches a scheme to use the Kipchaks’ exile to return home, a plan that becomes increasingly fraught as her feelings for Khalaf evolve into a hopeless love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jinghua’s already dicey prospects take a downward turn when Khalaf seeks to restore his kingdom by forging a marriage alliance with Turandokht, the daughter of the Great Khan. As beautiful as she is cunning, Turandokht requires all potential suitors to solve three impossible riddles to win her hand—and if they fail, they die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jinghua has kept her own counsel well, but with Khalaf’s kingdom—and his very life—on the line, she must reconcile the hard truth of her past with her love for a boy who has no idea what she’s capable of ... even if it means losing him to the girl who’d sooner take his life than his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bird and the Blade&lt;/i&gt; is a lush, powerful story of life and death, battles and riddles, lies and secrets from debut author Megan Bannen.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Redbreast &lt;/em&gt;is a fabulous introduction to Nesbø’s tough-as-nails series protagonist, Oslo police detective Harry Hole. A brilliant and epic novel, breathtaking in its scope and design—winner of The Glass Key for best Nordic crime novel and selected as the best Norwegian crime novel ever written by members of Norway’s book clubs—&lt;em&gt;The Redbreast&lt;/em&gt; is a chilling tale of murder and betrayal that ranges from the battlefields of World War Two to the streets of modern-day Oslo. Follow Hole as he races to stop a killer and disarm a ticking time-bomb from his nation’s shadowy past. &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt; magazine says that “nobody can delve into the dark, twisted mind of a murderer better than a Scandinavian thriller writer”…and nobody does it better than Jo Nesbø! James Patterson fans should also take note.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most demeaning. This year, there's a ninth. And instead of paper, she's made of fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this richly developed fantasy, Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. She lives in a remote village with her father, where the decade-old trauma of watching her mother snatched by royal guards for an unknown fate still haunts her. Now, the guards are back and this time it's Lei they're after -- the girl with the golden eyes whose rumored beauty has piqued the king's interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learns the skills and charm that befit a king's consort. There, she does the unthinkable -- she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world's entire way of life. Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.</description>

  <description>We all came to the powwow for different reasons. The messy, dangling threads of our lives got pulled into a braid--tied to the back of everything we'd been doing all along to get us here. There will be death and playing dead, there will be screams and unbearable silences, forever-silences, and a kind of time-travel, at the moment the gunshots start, when we look around and see ourselves as we are, in our regalia, and something in our blood will recoil then boil hot enough to burn through time and place and memory. We'll go back to where we came from, when we were people running from bullets at the end of that old world. The tragedy of it all will be unspeakable, that we've been fighting for decades to be recognized as a present-tense people, modern and relevant, only to die in the grass wearing feathers."</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadowhunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City - whatever the cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is a mortal sin and the secrets of the past prove deadly as Clary and Jace face down Valentine in the third installment of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series The Mortal Instruments.</description>

  <description>Inspector Harry Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad is dispatched to Sydney to observe a murder case. Harry is free to offer assistance, but he has firm instructions to stay out of trouble. The victim is a twenty-three year old Norwegian woman who is a minor celebrity back home. Never one to sit on the sidelines, Harry befriends one of the lead detectives, and one of the witnesses, as he is drawn deeper into the case. Together, they discover that this is only the latest in a string of unsolved murders, and the pattern points toward a psychopath working his way across the country. As they circle closer and closer to the killer, Harry begins to fear that no one is safe, least of all those investigating the case.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A love letter to the craft and romance of film and fate in front of—and behind—the camera from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Hold Still.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A wunderkind young set designer, Emi has already started to find her way in the competitive Hollywood film world.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Emi is a film buff and a true romantic, but her real-life relationships are a mess. She has desperately gone back to the same girl too many times to mention. But then a mysterious letter from a silver screen legend leads Emi to Ava. Ava is unlike anyone Emi has ever met. She has a tumultuous, not-so-glamorous past, and lives an unconventional life. She’s enigmatic…. She’s beautiful. And she is about to expand Emi’s understanding of family, acceptance, and true romance.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;International bestselling author Anna Todd returns with a gripping novel about a young woman's journey towards love, and the obstacles life throws up at every turn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karina knows the harsh realities of military life. And like anyone who has grown up around an army base, she knows the background noise that follows a soldier home from war. That's why she's forging her own quiet life in her own little house. But she hasn't turned her back on her family. She's the glue that holds them together-when her father is deployed, when her brother, Austin, has another brush with the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karina knows that she has to look after herself, that she can't always fix what's broken. But when Austin's behavior worsens and her father's reactions grow more extreme, Karina feels her own edges beginning to fray. That's when she meets him-a closed book she's desperate to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At just twenty, Kael is a handsome, brooding soldier struggling with the aftermath of two tours in Afghanistan. He's emotionally damaged and closed off. Quiet doesn't begin to describe him. But as Karina gets used to his stable presence, she finds it hard to ignore the way he makes her feel. In their time together, she finds the stillness she has always wanted and never found. She lets down her guard. And she lets herself fill in the blanks about this mysterious man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But illusions quickly made are quickly shattered. That's when Karina has to find her own courage-to untangle the truth from the lies, and decide what she's going to do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A riveting story about love and lies, &lt;i&gt;The Brightest Stars&lt;/i&gt; will stay with you long after the last page has been turned.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the Norwegian ambassador to Thailand is found dead in a Bangkok brothel, Inspector Harry Hole is dispatched from Oslo to help hush up the case.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once he arrives Harry discovers that this case is about much more than one random murder. There is something else, something more pervasive, scrabbling around behind the scenes. Or, put another way, for every cockroach you see in your hotel room, there are hundreds behind the walls. Surrounded by round-the-clock traffic noise, Harry wanders the streets of Bangkok lined with go-go bars, temples, opium dens, and tourist traps, trying to piece together the story of the ambassador’s death even though no one asked him to, and no one wants him to—not even Harry himself.</description>

  <description>An unspeakable crime. A confounding investigation. At a time when the King brand has never been stronger, he has delivered one of his most unsettling and compulsively readable stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sarai has lived and breathed nightmares since she was six years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She believed she knew every horror and was beyond surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lazlo faces an unthinkable choice—save the woman he loves, or &lt;i&gt;everyone else?&lt;/i&gt;—while Sarai feels more helpless than ever. But is she? Sometimes, only the direst need can teach us our own depths, and Sarai, the Muse of Nightmares, has not yet discovered what she's capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As humans and godspawn reel in the aftermath of the citadel's near fall, a new foe shatters their fragile hopes, and the mysteries of the Mesarthim are resurrected: Where did the gods come from, and why? What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to save them instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love and hate, revenge and redemption, destruction and salvation all clash in this astonishing and heart-stopping sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Strange the Dreamer&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

He plays women with intoxicating charm. And he’ll play me with the ease of a virtuoso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who better to teach me to play than the master himself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m his model student, front row, pencil sharp. Pick up lines? I’ve got them. Free drinks? By the dozen. Kissing? Let me grab my chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most valuable lesson I’ve learned is that there’s so much I don’t know. Like why his touch sets off a chain reaction straight to my nethers. Or how I’m certain each kiss is the best I’ll ever have, until the moment his lips take mine again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s so much I don’t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the fact that I’m only a bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we are what we are. He’s a player, through and through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m the fool who fell in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Standalone romantic comedy and part of the Red Lipstick Coalition Series*</description>

  <description>As Darby Dixon sits in a tiny Texas church bathroom on her wedding day holding a positive pregnancy test, she realizes that of all the bad decisions she's made in her life, marrying her abusive fiancé would be the worst. She's never been able to stand up for herself, but she'll sure as hell stand up for her baby. With just the cash she has on hand, she runs to get a bus ticket to the farthest place she can afford. Between her sheer grit and pageant-queen smile, she lands a job as a front desk clerk at the Colorado Springs Hotel. It's not a glamorous life, but she and her baby are all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A former Marine, Scott "Trex" Trexler has worked in the most dangerous, corrupt, war-torn places on earth. Now he finally has a chance to return to the last place he'd felt at peace--Colorado Springs, Colorado, to take a new job with the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, a top-secret military installation buried deep within the granite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment Trex walks into the inn, Darby knows he's dangerous. There's no way she wants to get involved with another man who seems to be keeping way too many secrets. As charming and devastatingly gorgeous as Trex is, he clearly isn't telling her everything. But as wildfires rage on the mountain and Darby's ex-fiancé shows he isn't so willing to let her go, both she and Trex are soon to find out that what you don't know absolutely can hurt you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kevin Kwan, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/i&gt;, is back with a wickedly funny new novel of social climbing, secret e-mails, art-world scandal, lovesick billionaires, and the outrageous story of what happens when Rachel Chu, engaged to marry Asia's most eligible bachelor, discovers her birthfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the eve of her wedding to Nicholas Young, heir to one of the greatest fortunes in Asia, Rachel should be over the moon. She has a flawless Asscher-cut diamond from JAR, a wedding dress she loves more than anything found in the salons of Paris, and a fiance willing to sacrifice his entire inheritance in order to marry her. But Rachel still mourns the fact that her birthfather, a man she never knew, won't be able to walk her down the aisle. Until: a shocking revelation draws Rachel into a world of Shanghai splendor beyond anything she has ever imagined. Here we meet Carlton, a Ferrari-crashing bad boy known for Prince Harry-like antics; Colette, a celebrity girlfriend chased by fevered paparazzi; and the man Rachel has spent her entire life waiting to meet: her father. Meanwhile, Singapore's It Girl, Astrid Leong, is shocked to discover that there is a downside to having a newly minted tech billionaire husband. A romp through Asia's most exclusive clubs, auction houses, and estates, &lt;i&gt;China Rich Girlfriend&lt;/i&gt; brings us into the elite circles of Mainland China, introducing a captivating cast of characters, and offering an inside glimpse at what it's like to be gloriously, crazily, China-rich.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44429353-piece-of-work" rel="nofollow"&gt;B07D211YBH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marble isn’t the only thing that’s hard at this museum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His body is as chiseled as Adonis. His lips are as sculpted as David. And his ego is the size of the Guggenheim. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You know the type—wolfish smile and the gravity of a black hole. The kind of man who sucks all the air from the room the second he enters it. My cocky boss thinks this internship was wasted on me, and he doesn’t hesitate to let me know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he’s wrong, and I’m going to prove it to him. If I can stay away from his devil lips, that is. Lips that cut me down and kiss me in the same breath, leaving me certain he’s on a mission to ruin my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And maybe my heart, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*A brand new STANDALONE romantic comedy full of steam, laughs, and heart by bestselling author Staci Hart*</description>

  <description>Prestigious. Powerful. Privileged. This is Fullbrook Academy, an elite prep school where history looms in the leafy branches over its brick walkways. But some traditions upheld in its hallowed halls are profoundly dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jules Devereux just wants to keep her head down, avoid distractions, and get into the right college, so she can leave Fullbrook and its old-boy social codes behind. She wants freedom, but ex-boyfriends and ex-best friends are determined to keep her in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Baxter feels like an imposter at Fullbrook, but the hockey scholarship that got him in has given him a chance to escape his past and fulfill the dreams of his parents and coaches, whose mantra rings in his ears: &lt;i&gt;Don’t disappoint us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jamie and Jules meet, they recognize in each other a similar instinct for survival, but at a school where girls in the student handbook are rated by their looks, athletes stack hockey pucks in dorm room windows like notches on a bedpost, and school-sponsored dances push first year girls out into the night with senior boys, the stakes for safe sex, real love, and true friendship couldn’t be higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jules and Jamie’s lives intertwine, and the pressures to play by the rules and remain silent about the school’s secrets intensify, they see Fullbrook for what it really is. That &lt;i&gt;tradition&lt;/i&gt;, a word Fullbrook hides behind, can be ugly, even violent. Ultimately, Jules and Jamie are faced with the difficult question: can they stand together against classmates—and an institution—who believe they can do no wrong?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A masterful tale of ambition, jealousy, desire, and superpowers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor and Eli started out as college roommates—brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find—aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge—but who will be left alive at the end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Vicious&lt;/i&gt;, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn't automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 55 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Twenty-six years ago Hannah had her eye shot out. Now she wants justice. But is she blind to the truth?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher J. Yates’s cult hit &lt;i&gt;Black Chalk&lt;/i&gt; introduced that rare writerly talent: a literary writer who could write a plot with the intricacy of a brilliant mental puzzle, and with characters so absorbing that readers are immediately gripped. Yates’s new book does not disappoint. &lt;i&gt;Grist Mill Road&lt;/i&gt; is a dark, twisted, and expertly plotted Rashomon-style tale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1982; the setting, an Edenic hamlet some ninety miles north of New York City. There, among the craggy rock cliffs and glacial ponds of timeworn mountains, three friends—Patrick, Matthew, and Hannah—are bound together by a terrible and seemingly senseless crime. Twenty-six years later, in New York City, living lives their younger selves never could have predicted, the three meet again—with even more devastating results.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>A young girl tells the story of her family's tragic demise using a deck of cards of the eponymous Mexican game in this spellbinding debut novel that marks the arrival of a powerhouse new talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her older sister Estrella in the ICU and her father in jail, eleven-year-old Luz Castillo has been taken into the custody of the state. Alone in her room, the young girl retreats behind a wall of silence, writing in her journal and shuffling through a deck of Lotería cards-a Mexican version of bingo featuring bright, colorful images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither the social worker assigned to her case nor her Aunt Tencha, who desperately pleads for her niece's release, can cajole Luz to speak. The young girl's only confidant is her journal. Within its pages, Luz addresses an invisible higher power, sharing her secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Lotería cards as her muse, Luz picks one card from the deck with each shuffle. Each of the cards' colorful images- mermaids, bottles, spiders, death, and stars-sparks a random memory. Pieced together, these snapshots bring into focus the joy and pain of the young girl's life, and the events that led to her present situation. But just as the story becomes clear, a breathtaking twist changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprising, spellbinding tale richly imaginative and atmospheric, Lotería is an exquisite debut novel from an outstanding new voice in fiction.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed by critics, beloved by readers of all ages, taught everywhere from inner-city grade schools to universities across the country, and translated all over the world, &lt;i&gt;The House on Mango Street&lt;/i&gt; is the remarkable story of Esperanza Cordero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in a series of vignettes – sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes deeply joyous–it is the story of a young Latina girl growing up in Chicago, inventing for herself who and what she will become. Few other books in our time have touched so many readers.</description>

  <description>In Bed Stuy, New York, a small misunderstanding can escalate into having a price on your head—even if you’re totally clean. This gritty, triumphant debut captures the heart and the hardship of life for an urban teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A lot of the stuff that gives my neighborhood a bad name, I don’t really mess with. The guns and drugs and all that, not really my thing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nah, not his thing. Ali’s got enough going on, between school and boxing and helping out at home. His best friend Noodles, though. Now there’s a dude looking for trouble—and, somehow, it’s always Ali around to pick up the pieces. But, hey, a guy’s gotta look out for his boys, right? Besides, it’s all small potatoes; it’s not like anyone’s getting hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Needles. Needles is Noodles’s brother. He’s got a syndrome, and gets these ticks and blurts out the wildest, craziest things. It’s cool, though: everyone on their street knows he doesn’t mean anything by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it’s cool…until Ali and Noodles and Needles find themselves somewhere they never expected to be…somewhere they never should've been—where the people aren't so friendly, and even less forgiving.</description>

  <description>Nix has spent her entire life aboard her father’s ship, sailing across the centuries, across the world, across myth and imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as her father has a map for it, he can sail to any time, any place, real or imagined: nineteenth-century China, the land from &lt;i&gt;One Thousand and One Nights&lt;/i&gt;, a mythic version of Africa. Along the way they have found crewmates and friends, and even a disarming thief who could come to mean much more to Nix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the end to it all looms closer every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father is obsessed with obtaining the one map, 1868 Honolulu, that could take him back to his lost love, Nix’s mother. Even though getting it—and going there—could erase Nix’s very existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, Nix is entering unknown waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She could find herself, find her family, find her own fantastical ability, her own epic love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or she could disappear.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I've been watched all my life. I'm used to being stared at. Observed. Followed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fame and obsession collide in this darkly twisted novel from an incredible new voice in suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOMEONE IS WATCHING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washed up teen star Liv Hendricks quit acting after her beloved younger sister inexplicably disappeared following a Hollywood party gone wrong. Liv barely escaped with her life, and her sister was never heard from again. But all this time, someone's been waiting patiently to finish what was started...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOUR MISSING GIRLS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fifteen years later, broke and desperate, Liv is forced to return to the spotlight. She crowdfunds a webseries in which she'll pose as a real-life private detective--a nod to the show she starred on as a teen. When a mysterious donor challenges her to investigate a series of disappearances outside a town made famous by the horror movies filmed there, Liv has no choice but to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOLLOW THE WHITE WOLF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liv is given a cryptic first clue: Follow the white wolf. And now a darker game is about to begin. Through social media, someone is leaving breadcrumbs to follow. As Liv makes increasingly disturbing discoveries, her show explodes in popularity. A rapt internet audience is eager to watch it all--perhaps even at the cost of Liv's own life...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with provocative twists and turns as the line between plot and reality blurs in this inventive tour-de-force from breakout writer Jennifer Wolfe.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Natasha’s sure that her friends love her. But does that mean they didn’t try to kill her?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natasha is the most popular girl in school. So why was she pulled out of a freezing river after being dead for thirteen minutes? She doesn’t remember how she ended up in the icy water that night, but she does know this—it wasn’t an accident, and she wasn’t suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Natasha’s two closest friends, who are usually her loyal sidekicks, are acting strangely. Natasha turns to Becca, the best friend she dumped years before, to help her figure out the mystery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first Becca isn’t sure that she even wants to help Natasha. But as she is drawn back into Natasha’s orbit, Becca starts putting the pieces together. As an outsider, Becca believes she may be the only one who can uncover the truth…which is far more twisted than she ever imagined.</description>

  <description>Roses are read, violets are blue, if you hurt us, we’re coming for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeply secretive Black Coats have been exacting vengeance on men who hurt girls and women for years. And Thea has just received an invitation to join them. This is the opportunity she’s been waiting for to finally get justice for her cousin Natalie, whose killer went free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea dives head first into the group, training every day with other girls whose stories rival hers. Together they carry out Balancings—acts of revenge guaranteed to teach a lesson. With every predator threatened, every blackmailer exposed, and every date rapist punished, Thea can feel herself getting closer to avenging Natalie’s death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the Balancings begin to escalate in brutality, and Thea discovers that the Black Coats are not all they seem to be. Thea must confront just how far she’s willing to go for justice—and what kind of justice Natalie, and Thea herself, deserve. Because when the line between justice and revenge is razor thin, it’s hard not to get cut.</description>

  <description>They call her Traitor Kate. It’s a title Kate Brighton inherited from her father after he tried to assassinate the high king years ago. Now Kate lives as an outcast, clinging to the fringes of society as a member of the Relay, the imperial courier service. Only those most skilled in riding and bow hunting ride for the Relay; and only the fastest survive, for when dark falls, the nightdrakes—deadly flightless dragons—come out to hunt. Fortunately, Kate has a secret edge: she is a wilder, born with magic that allows her to influence the minds of animals. But it’s this magic that she needs to keep hidden, as being a wilder is forbidden, punishable by death or exile. And it’s this magic that leads her to a caravan massacred by nightdrakes in broad daylight—the only survivor her childhood friend, her first love, the boy she swore to forget, the boy who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high king’s second son, Corwin Tormane, never asked to lead. Even as he waits for the uror—the once-in-a-generation ritual to decide which of the king’s children will succeed him—he knows it’s always been his brother who will assume the throne. And that’s fine by him. He’d rather spend his days away from the palace, away from the sight of his father, broken with sickness from the attempt on his life. But the peacekeeping tour Corwin is on has given him too much time to reflect upon the night he saved his father’s life—the night he condemned the would-be killer to death and lost the girl he loved. Which is why he takes it on himself to investigate rumors of unrest in one of the remote city-states, only for his caravan to be attacked—and for him to be saved by Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their paths once more entangled, Kate and Corwin have to put the past behind them. The threat of drakes who attack in the daylight is only the beginning of a darker menace stirring in the kingdom—one whose origins have dire implications for Kate’s father’s attack upon the king and will thrust them into the middle of a brewing civil war in the kingdom of Rime.</description>

  <description>For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn’t just a game—it’s a way of life. The obsession started ten years ago and its fan base now spans the globe, some eager to escape from reality and others hoping to make a profit. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. But the bounty hunting world is a competitive one, and survival has not been easy. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships—only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced she’s going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game’s creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. He needs a spy on the inside of this year’s tournament in order to uncover a security problem . . . and he wants Emika for the job. With no time to lose, Emika’s whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she’s only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</description>

  <description>Returning home for her father’s wedding was never going to be easy for Adele. If being sent away at eighteen hadn’t been bad enough, the mess she left behind when she made a pass at her dad’s business partner sure was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years older than her, Pete had been her crush for as long as she could remember. But she’d misread the situation—confusing friendliness for undying love. Awkward. Add her father to the misunderstanding, and Pete was left with a broken nose and a business on the edge of ruin. The man had to be just as glad as everyone else when she left town. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seven years later, things are different. Adele is no longer a kid, but a fully grown adult more than capable of getting through the wedding and being polite. But all it takes is seeing him again to bring back those old feelings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes first loves are the truest.</description>

  <description>Theo Mackey only remembers one thing for certain about the fire that destroyed his home: he lit the match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it was an accident. But the blaze killed his mom and set his dad on a path to self-destruction. Everything else about that fateful night is full of gaping holes in Theo’s mind, for good reason. Maybe it’s better that way. As captain of the Ellis Hollow Diving Team, with straight A's and solid friends, he's only one semester away from securing a scholarship, and leaving his past behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a family history project gets assigned at school, new memories come rushing to the surface, memories that make him question what he really knows about his family, the night of the fire, and if he can trust anyone—including himself.</description>

      <![CDATA[Okay so I was hooked. I had some feelings and some of them were spot on others were way off base. I was expecting to enjoy this novel after the race reviews I heard from people I trust. I just wasn't expecting to be so invested.]]>
