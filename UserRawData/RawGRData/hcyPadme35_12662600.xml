  <description>3 Hours, Unabridged Version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor Kalinski, all-star forward for the Boston Barracudas, is one of the biggest jerks in professional hockey. Before long his aggressive attitude gets him shipped off to play in the minor leagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furious, he takes to the ice with equal amounts of skill and scathing sarcasm, which doesn’t win him any friends—except for good-natured alternate captain Daniel Arou. He won’t take any of Vic’s crap, and he won’t take no for an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Vic’s troublemaking is pulling his career one way while Dan’s talent is pushing his in the other. However much they scorch the sheets, they might soon be separated by more than Vic’s fear of being hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside Scoop: This book contains scorching gay sex and a heaping helping of no-holds-barred snark between hot hockey heroes who don’t pull their punches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Romantica® gay erotic romance from Ellora’s Cave</description>

  <description>When Felix is hired to take care of a recently blinded man, he thinks his life might finally be turning around. It has to be better than where he came from, but he has no idea what he’s signed up for. Lane is depressed, rude, and difficult to be around. It doesn’t help that Felix is clearly not qualified for the job, especially since he can’t even make oatmeal right. But Felix is trying to make his life better, so he’ll put up with the man even if it requires some unconventional methods. Felix’s humor soon pulls Lane out of his depression, and Felix feels like things are finally going right in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he’s attacked by someone who wants to keep Lane quiet. It’s clear that Lane isn’t who he’s pretending to be, and Felix should probably walk away. But Felix has finally found a place where he belongs and he’s willing to go to great lengths to stay by Lane’s side. Even if it involves kidnapping, stealing, and Felix’s overwhelmingly bad ideas, Felix will do just about anything because Lane is there for him unlike anyone else has ever been. Felix might be out of his element, but one thing he is sure about is that he doesn’t want to leave Lane… even if it costs him his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hidden in Darkness is 90k words of snark, car chases, and morally questionable choices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Newly edited with an updated cover.</description>

  <description>Sequel to Lost in Time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newspaper reporter Lew Tyler and his lover, Detective Alec Carter, are working out the parameters of their new relationship. Meanwhile, time traveler Lew is trying to decide whether he wants to stay in the 1920s or find a way to get back to 2016, and Alec doesn’t know if he can bear the vulnerability of being in love with someone who uses such dangerous magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fenn is a Hunter from the Outlands, come through the Border to search for the murderous Creature and its offspring at the behest of the Ternants, who maintain the balance between Fenn’s world and ours. Fenn strikes a bond with Sergeant Will Grant, Alec’s second in command, who is keen to learn more about his own magical abilities. As time goes on, Will grows keen to learn more about Fenn, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fenn has their own painful secret, and when they appear to have betrayed the team and goes missing in London, Will is devastated. He has to choose between following his heart or following his duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving through the contrasting rich and poor areas of post-First World War London from West End hotels to the London docklands, the men need to work together to capture the Creature ... and choose who – and what -- is important enough to hold on to and what they may need to give up to make that happen.</description>

  <description>Being a new member of the undead sect has its ups and downs, something that newly embraced Akio Lee is finding out first hand. Being able to spend eternity with his beloved Vincente, the man who introduced him to life in the nightside, is a definite up. Having to sneak up and feed on strangers? That’s one of the downsides, and something that Akio is finding difficult to swallow. But what other option is there for a recently wed vampire couple who need blood to survive? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a new donor perhaps? One who comes into the lifestyle willingly, as Akio had done, and is open to the unique and sensual relationship that develops when three men have a blood bond. A man who can exist in both the nightside and the dayside worlds. A man like Dalton Briggs, the tall, dark, and handsome caretaker of the manse Akio and Vincente now call home? Dalton seems to tick every box Akio and Vincente have: he’s comfortable around vampires, he’s obviously into men, he’s drop dead gorgeous, and he’s human. But will the outgoing handyman be willing to offer two vampires his vein, his body, and his heart?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Length: 3 hours and 23 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a century ago Illusionist David Berkeley committed suicide in his mansion by the sea, thus dooming his restless spirit to wander forever. Or so the local legend goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Rhys Davies, a part-time parapsychologist, is writing a book on California hauntings and he believes the crumbling ruins of Berkeley House will make a terrific chapter -- if he can gain access to the house and grounds. The only obstacle is brooding cop and self-appointed caretaker, Sam Devlin. As obstacles go, Devlin is a big one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know what they say. The bigger they are, the harder they fall...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ghost of a Chance" first appeared in the 2007 anthology, Scared Stiff, where Josh joined best-selling authors William Maltese, Sarah Black and Laura Baumbach for a quartet of very different stories of m/m supernatural doings that had readers panting (in more ways than one) under the covers.</description>

  <description>After leaving a trail of terror and death in his wake, the notorious “Missouri” Boone Jennings finally meets his match in San Francisco when US marshal Ambrose Shaw catches up to him. The story of his capture, and the marshal’s bravery, has already become legend back east by the time Pinkerton inspector Ezra Johns gets off the train from New York City to testify in the murderer’s trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ambrose is unable to give witness to the evils he’s seen, Ezra becomes their lone hope for putting Jennings in a noose. But if Ezra thinks that’s his biggest problem, he’s got plenty to learn about life—and the afterlife—in the spirited West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Ambrose is there to assist, and more than happy to oblige Ezra—in the courtroom or the bedroom. He spent his life bringing justice to the Wild West, and if he has a say in it, that’s how he’ll be spending his death too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening Time: 3 hrs 21 min</description>

  <description>What if you could hear the words behind the words?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brad Weston’s life seems perfect. He’s GQ handsome, the chief of staff for a Republican California state senator, and enjoys the power and the promise of a bright future. And he’s in a comfortable relationship with his boyfriend of six years, Alex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam Fuller is Brad’s young blond blue-eyed intern, fresh out of college, running from a bad breakup, and questioning his choices and his new life in politics. To make things worse, Sam also has a thing for the boss, but Brad is already taken.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While looking for a gift for his boyfriend, Brad wanders into a curiosity shop and becomes fascinated by an old wooden medallion. Brad's not a superstitious man, but when he takes out the medallion in his office, he sees the world in a whole new light.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;7 hrs 50 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a series of bombs go off in a Therian youth center, injuring members of THIRDS Team Destructive Delta and causing a rift between agents Dexter J. Daley and Sloane Brodie, peace seems unattainable. Especially when a new and frightening group, the Order of Adrasteia, appears to always be a step ahead. With panic and intolerance spreading and streets becoming littered with the Order's propaganda, hostility between Humans and Therians grows daily. Dex and Sloane, along with the rest of the team, are determined to take down the Order and restore peace, not to mention settle a personal score. But the deeper the team investigates the bombings, the more they believe there's a more sinister motive than a desire to shed blood and spread chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovering the frightful truth behind the Order's intent forces Sloane to confront secrets from a past he thought he'd left behind for good, a past that could not only destroy him and his career, but also the reputation of the organization that made him all he is today. Now more than ever, Dex and Sloane need each other, and, along with trust, the strength of their bond will mean the difference between justice and all-out war.</description>

  <description>Griffin McKellan has a secret . . . actually, more than one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wants to take a class at the local university, but he's got more than studying on his mind. Griffin's enamored with the professor, Jackson Grady. He’s spent months spying on the guy, but now he has to meet him face to face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And even though Griffin wants nothing more than to teach the professor a thing or two, there’s a huge problem standing in his way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vampires don’t usually date their food source. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Snow &amp;amp; Winter: Book Four&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a full year since the mystery that brought antique shop owner and part-time amateur sleuth Sebastian Snow together with NYPD homicide detective Calvin Winter. Patience, sanity, and their very lives have been put to the test, but love has persevered. Although Sebastian is now New York City’s best-known busybody, he’s done solving crimes and wants nothing more than to plan a romantic budget wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Snow’s Antique Emporium receives a decapitated human head in the mail and the holidays are gory once again. Sebastian patently disregards the mystery of a lifetime because he is &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; with death and danger—but the killer escalates. Before Sebastian knows it, his closest friends and family are dragged into a series of horrific murders with antiquated clues hinting to the infamous Victorian American Bones Wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking to recover a long-lost artifact linked to paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope and to capture a murderer. But it’s not Sebastian who may become the next target—it’s Calvin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;10 hrs 6 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When homicide detective Dexter J. Daley’s testimony helps send his partner away for murder, the consequences - and the media frenzy - aren’t far behind. He soon finds himself sans boyfriend, sans friends, and, after an unpleasant encounter in a parking garage after the trial, he’s lucky he doesn’t find himself sans teeth. Dex fears he’ll get transferred from the Human Police Force’s Sixth Precinct, or worse, get dismissed. Instead, his adoptive father - a sergeant at the Therian-Human Intelligence Recon Defense Squadron otherwise known as the THIRDS - pulls a few strings, and Dex gets recruited as a Defense Agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dex is determined to get his life back on track and eager to get started in his new job. But his first meeting with Team Leader Sloane Brodie, who also happens to be his new jaguar Therian partner, turns disastrous. When the team is called to investigate the murders of three HumaniTherian activists, it soon becomes clear to Dex that getting his partner and the rest of the tightknit team to accept him will be a lot harder than catching the killer - and every bit as dangerous.</description>

  <description>Paranormal investigator Wolf Kincaid knows what his foot tastes like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly because he stuck it firmly in his mouth when his lover, Tristan Pryce, accidentally drugged him with a batch of psychotropic baklava. Needing to patch things up between them, Wolf drags Tristan to San Luis Obispo, hoping Tristan’s medium ability can help evict a troublesome spirit haunting an old farmhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Wolf’s sister handling Hoxne Grange’s spectral visitors, Tristan finds himself in the unique position of being able to leave home for the first time in forever, but Wolf’s roughshod treatment is the least of his worries. Tristan’s ad-hoc portal for passing spirits seems to be getting fewer and fewer guests, and despite his concern he’s broken his home, Tristan agrees to help Wolf’s cousin, Sey, kick her poltergeist to the proverbial curb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Luis Obispo brings its own bushel of troubles. Tristan’s ghost whispering skill is challenged not only by a terrorizing haunting but also by Wolf’s skeptical older cousin, Cin. Bookended by a pair of aggressive Kincaids, Tristan soon finds himself in a spectral battle that threatens not only his sanity but also his relationship with Wolf, the first man he’s ever loved.</description>

  <description>Pip Leighton is in a fix. His sister’s marriage hinges on him staving off the family’s impending financial ruin by taking the job of secretary to Lord Cross, a reclusive man with a temper befitting his name. Developing a passion for his employer was not on the cards. Neither was getting caught up in the deep mystery surrounding Foxwood Court and its resident ghost, but Pip has never been one to shirk a duty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Pip delves deeper into the past, he discovers that his only hope for a future with Cross may depend on a man long dead—a man with a curious resemblance to himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Written for lovers of gothic romance and ghost stories, The Ghost and the Secretary is the first in a series of gay romance novellas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Gothic Paranormal Romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;8 hrs 16 min&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his Uncle Mortimer died and left him Hoxne Grange, the family’s Gilded Age estate, Tristan Pryce knew he wasn’t going to have an easy time of it. He was to be the second generation of Pryces to serve as a caretaker for the estate, a way station for spirits on their final steps to the afterlife. The ghosts were the simple part. He’d been seeing boo-wigglies since he was a child. No, the difficult part was his own family. Determined to establish Tristan’s insanity, his loving relatives hire Dr. Wolf Kincaid and his paranormal researchers, Hellsinger Investigations, to prove the Grange is not haunted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptic Wolf Kincaid has made it his life’s work to debunk the supernatural. After years of cons and fakes, he can’t wait to reveal the Grange’s ghostly activity is just badly leveled floorboards and a drafty old house. The Grange has more than a few surprises for him, including its prickly, reclusive owner. Tristan Pryce is much less insane and much more attractive than Wolf wants to admit and when his Hellsinger team unwittingly release a ghostly serial killer on the Grange, Wolf is torn between his skepticism and protecting the man he’d been sent to discredit.</description>

  <description>Prince Owin &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a fierce predator—not at all adorable, despite my graceful stature—the last thing I needed was a bodyguard. Especially a wolf shifter, whose presence alone was an insult to my princely principles. As Prince of the Ocelot Shifters, I prided myself on my infallible feline instincts, uncompromisable dignity, and flawless fashion sense. If having a canine follow me around at all times wasn’t bad enough, I now faced the most important moment of my entire life. The time had come to prove I was worthy of my crown. If only I could find a way to get rid of the pesky bodyguard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grimmwolf &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the King of All Shifters asked me to guard Prince Owin, I admit I had no idea what to expect. Cat shifters tend to be a little intense, not to mention kinda cranky. Owin was no exception, though he seemed crankier than most. Being his bodyguard was proving to be one of the greatest challenges of my life—but not nearly as great as convincing him there was something special between us. When Owin is faced with a perilous quest to prove his worth, I was determined to keep him safe, even if the same couldn’t be said of my heart.</description>

  <description>Apex Racing is expanding and absorbing Pilot and his lovers. Everyone is happy with it…except Johnny. He's feeling constantly left out and more alone than ever before. It's time to seek out his own win, and find his holeshot even if its off the track and away from Pilot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gavin is determined to put together the hottest Supercross team, and he wants that to include Bryce Nickels, but that seems almost impossible since he signed with Apex. Perhaps, he needs a new angle, like the sexy business partner of the bodyguard, Johnny Killebrew. Maybe he'll sign on more than he bargained for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is chasing their own dreams, but Johnny isn't sure he even has one. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;When opposites attract, it’s not just the team that’s in for a shake-up.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a stipulation in his father’s will throws Mark back into a family that disowned him, he has only two things on his mind; buying his way out of contractual obligations and running in the opposite direction as fast as he can. When neither option pans out, he finds he is now a one third owner of the struggling Arizona Raptors hockey team, and that is just about the worst thing he could have happened to him. Not only does he hate hockey, but the Raptors are a bottom-of-the-league team, rife with jealousies and anger in a locker room that only knows self-pity. How is he supposed to help turn things around when the only way to start fixing things is to form an alliance with the estranged siblings he’d run from fifteen years earlier?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Rowen Carmichael, a stubborn, opinionated, irritating man with superiority issues and questionable taste in music. Butting heads with Rowen, who he’d never even wanted to hire in the first place, is one thing, but there is no way in hell that he will allow the growing attraction to the new coach become anything more. Until with everything on the line, he has to make decisions that will change his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of collegiate coaching, Rowen is given an offer that he simply can’t refuse, although perhaps he should. When he’s presented with the chance to take one of the worst teams in the league and mold them into a future cup contender, the challenge is just too alluring to pass up. He leaves his beloved Ontario behind and moves west to the arid city of Tucson where he is faced with a broken team, shoddy management, and players overflowing with resentment and bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never in his twenty years of hockey has he ever seen such a raging dumpster fire of an organization. Yet there’s something about this team and this city that compels him to roll up his sleeves and start dismantling. He has his eye on a new associate coach that’s bound to makes waves, and several key players who should be sent packing. Now all he has to do is convince the new owners of the team that his choices are for the best. If only Mark Westman-Reid, one of three siblings who now own the Raptors, wasn’t so damned rock-headed, so damned snooty, and so damned appealing his job might be a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>Haven Hart stands on the edge of good and evil. Having balance between the two is the only thing keeping the town from crumbling to the ground. For years, one man has been charged with maintaining that balance. Poe. &lt;br /&gt;The air of mystery surrounding Poe is one of necessity. He’s the keeper of secrets and for good reason. He’s stood alone against the most ruthless men and women, always hiding behind the curtain to help his friends defeat what seeks to destroy them. &lt;br /&gt;Now, after all this time, the city he loves, the people he has protected, and the secrets he’s kept hidden are in serious jeopardy. Poe will need the help of his friends to fight the ultimate battle; not just save Haven Hart but everything and everyone he holds dear to him. &lt;br /&gt;When the dust settles, will betrayals be forgiven? Will the city still be standing? Will Poe’s beloved be at his side or will everything crumble? One thing is for certain, everything will be tested, and questions will finally be answered. Raven’s Hart is the final installment in the Haven Hart Series. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Two stories, two couples, two eras, timeless emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Ground Which Was Secured At Great Expense&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1914 and The Great War is underway. When the call to arms comes, Nicholas Southwell won’t be found hanging back. It’s a pity he can’t be so decisive when it comes to letting his estate manager Paul Haskell know what he feels before he has to leave for the front line. In the trenches Nicholas meets a fellow officer, Phillip Taylor, who takes him into the unclaimed territory of physical love. Which one will he choose, if he’s allowed the choice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Case of the Overprotective Ass&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stars of the silver screen Alasdair Hamilton and Toby Bowe are wowing the post WWII audiences with their depictions of Holmes and Watson. When they are asked by a friend to investigate a mysterious disappearance, they jump at the chance — surely detection can’t be that hard? But a series of threatening letters — and an unwanted suitor — make real life very different from the movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Cochrane, author of the delightful &lt;b&gt;Cambridge Fellows&lt;/b&gt; series, brings her familiar romantic, roguish style to the two novellas that together are &lt;b&gt;Home Fires Burning&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>France, 1915&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Tom Donald envies everything about fellow officer Frank Foden—his confidence, his easy manner with the men in the trenches, the affectionate letters from his wife. Frank shares these letters happily, drawing Tom into a vicarious friendship with a woman he's never met. Although the bonds of friendship forged under fire are strong, Tom can't be so open with Frank—he's attracted to men and could never confess that to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Frank is killed in no-man's-land, he leaves behind a mysterious request for Tom: to deliver a sealed letter to a man named Palmer. Tom undertakes the commission while on leave—and discovers that almost everything he thought he knew about Frank is a lie…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 2 Hours, 5 Minutes</description>

  <description>Psychic medium Vincent Night and his lover, Henry Strauss, have spent months striving to uncover the dark secret harbored by Vincent's dead mentor, James Dunne. Their only clue comes from a journal: Dunne was seeking to restore the Grand Harmonium, an artifact meant to breach the walls between life and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate seems to intervene when Henry and Vincent are offered a job investigating the haunted orphanage where Dunne lived as a youth. But the ghosts of the orphanage don't rest easily, and the lovers soon find themselves in a battle to locate the Grand Harmonium before it falls into the wrong hands - and unleashes evil upon the world.</description>

  <description>After the events of Reyhome Castle, Henry Strauss expected the Psychical Society to embrace his application of science to the study of hauntings. Instead, the society humiliates and blacklists him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His confidence shaken, he can't bring himself to admit the truth to his lover, the handsome medium Vincent Night. Vincent's new life in Baltimore with Henry is disrupted when a friend from the past asks for help with a haunting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the remote town of Devil's Walk, old ties and new lies threaten to tear the lovers apart, if a fiery spirit bent on vengeance doesn't put an end to them first.</description>

  <description>After losing the family fortune to a fraudulent psychic, inventor Henry Strauss is determined to bring the otherworld under control through the application of science. All he needs is a genuine haunting to prove his Electro-Séance will work. A letter from wealthy industrialist Dominic Gladfield seems the answer to his prayers. Gladfield’s proposition: a contest pitting science against spiritualism, with a hefty prize for the winner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contest takes Henry to Reyhome Castle, the site of a series of brutal murders decades earlier. There he meets his rival for the prize, the dangerously appealing Vincent Night. Vincent is handsome, charming…and determined to get Henry into bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry can’t afford to fall for a spirit medium, let alone the competition. But nothing in the haunted mansion is quite as it seems, and soon winning the contest is the least of Henry’s concerns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the evil stalking the halls of Reyhome Castle wants to claim not just Henry and Vincent’s lives, but their very souls.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;4 hrs 48 min&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles, 1943&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reporter Nathan Doyle had his reasons to want Phil Arlen dead, but when he sees the man's body pulled from the La Brea tar pit, he knows he'll be the prime suspect. He also knows that his life won't stand up to intense police scrutiny, so he sets out to crack the case himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Matthew Spain's official inquiries soon lead him to believe that Nathan knows more than he's saying. But that's not the only reason Matt takes notice of the handsome journalist. Matt's been drawn to men before, but he must hide his true feelings—or risk his entire career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nathan digs deeper, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay one step ahead of Matt Spain—and to deny his intense attraction to him. Nathan's secrets may not include murder, but has his hunt put him right in the path of the real killer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Previously published, newly revised by author.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Former Army Ranger turned government assassin Álvaro Montero and CIA Officer Caiden Cardosa crossed paths two years ago in Vienna, where their encounter ended less than amicably—despite the explosive sexual chemistry between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Caiden is riding a desk at Langley after his cover is blown. And Álvaro—who was “killed”—has a new identity and purpose as Delta/D, an operative for the Locke and Keyes Agency, under the leadership of the mysterious Alpha Orion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When D and Caiden team up in a deadly black ops mission, the urge to kill each other will have to take a back seat to the desire for revenge against the man who betrayed them both. Surviving the mission won’t be easy. Resisting the passion between them—that might be impossible. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;3 hours 2 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas is a time for giving - what do you do when no one gives a damn? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Zachary Weston Christmas means sleeping on a churchyard bench in the freezing snow with nothing better in his future. Thrown out of his home for being gay, he is left without money or, it seems, anywhere to go. Until a stranger shows him that some people do give a lot more than a damn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Hamilton is a rookie cop in his small home town. He finds a young throwaway, fresh from the city, sleeping on a bench in the churchyard on a snowy Christmas Eve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he be the one to give Zachary his own Christmas miracle?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;3 hrs 28 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a New York cop and a teacher find love in the city at Christmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been far too long since Christian Matthews has seen Daniel Bailey. In fact, the last time they met, Chris was a senior in college and he was the TA tasked with helping Daniel who was a way too confident freshman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years down the road, Chris is licking his wounds after being asked to leave the private school where he was teaching. He has no job, no money, and has to rely on his friend, Amelia, for the job and a room to live in. He needs a freaking Christmas miracle to make this season anything other than a total loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Daniel comes back into his life, and suddenly everything seems possible. Not only is Daniel still the man Christian wants more than anything, but this time Chris may well actually tell Daniel how he feels.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the world labels a man and judges them blindly, is it possible to ever find love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firefighter Eric is on the front line, battling the threat of nature’s destruction in the California grasslands alongside his CalFire team. Focused and calm, even in the direst of situations, he has a strong affection for his fire truck, loves his career, and has best friends he can rely on. All he needs now is love, but that seems to be impossible to find. At his friend’s wedding. Eric falls in lust at first sight with the shy, slim and sexy Brady, even if Brady isn’t the type of guy he usually goes for. What Eric longs for is an equal in his bed, not a smaller guy who might want Eric to role-play big strong firefighter every time they have sex. He wants to find someone he can be vulnerable with, someone who will love him for his soft heart and quiet ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brady’s life plans grind to a halt when his niece and nephew lose their parents in a tragic accident, and he becomes a dad overnight. His Developmental Coordination Disorder rules his life, but he fights both DCD and the fears that chase him every day, to give Maddie and Lucas a home. Agreeing to go to a friend’s wedding is a decision he regrets long before he even gets there. But, he refuses to give in to his fear, even if he might do something that makes him a target for people’s comments and laughter. Meeting Eric, a huge man with a gentle voice and a flair for chivalry, he falls hard. Now, if only he can let himself get past his panic that Eric would never want someone like him, then maybe he could fall in love for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-order Kobo, B&amp;amp;N, Apple - 17 August&lt;br /&gt;Release Date - Kobo, B&amp;amp;N, Apple, Amazon, Smashwords - 24 August&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Exclusive / Kindle Unlimited - 31 August</description>

  <description>Orlando Coppersmith is called in to solve not one but two problems: a suspected murder and a mysterious violin. So why is he reluctant to take the case - is it because it came from the warden of his old college? Once more, it's up to Jonty Stewart to get his partner through the challenge and employ their own, unique, way to finding a solution.</description>

  <description>Despite having known each other for half their lives, it took years of heartache before Carter Hamilton and Riley Porter-Wright could admit they were perfect for each other.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;7 hours and 43 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Elliot Mills comes face-to-face with evil in this follow-up to &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Fair Game&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Fair Play&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; from bestselling author Josh Lanyon&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;One final game of cat and mouse… &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex–FBI agent Elliot Mills thought he was done with the most brutal case of his career. The Sculptor, the serial killer he spent years hunting, is finally in jail. But Elliot's hope dies when he learns the murderer wasn't acting alone. Now everyone is at risk once again—thanks to a madman determined to finish his partner's gruesome mission.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the lead agent on the case, Special Agent Tucker Lance, goes missing, Elliot knows it's the killer at work. After all, abducting the love of his life is the quickest way to hurt him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chances of finding Tucker are all but impossible without the help of the Sculptor—but the Sculptor is in no position to talk. Critically injured in a prison fight, he lies comatose and dying while the clock ticks down. Elliot has no choice but to play this killer's twisted game and hope he can find Tucker in time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;7 hrs 20 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifty years ago, Roland Mills belonged to a violent activist group. Now, someone is willing to kill to prevent him from publishing his memoirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ex-FBI agent Elliot Mills is called out to examine the charred ruins of his childhood home, he quickly identifies the fire for what it is--arson. A knee injury may have forced Elliot out of the Bureau, but it's not going to stop him from bringing the man who wants his father dead to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agent Tucker Lance is still working to find the serial killer who's obsessed with Elliot and can't bear the thought of his lover putting himself in additional danger. Straightlaced Tucker has never agreed with radical Roland on much--"opposing political viewpoints" is an understatement--but they're united on this: Elliot needs to leave the case alone. Now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucker would do nearly anything for the man he loves, but he won't be used to gain Elliot access to the FBI's resources. When the past comes back to play and everything both men had known to be true is questioned, their fragile relationship is left hanging in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;68,000 words</description>

  <description>Life has never been easy for Duncan Stiel. His childhood was the stuff of nightmares, and his day job as an undercover police officer forces him to hide his true self and occasionally lands him in the hospital. So when he finally meets the perfect man, it comes as no surprise that everything falls apart around him. What Duncan doesn't expect is that the hardest hurdle to get over before he can make a life with Aaron Sutter is the one inside himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Aaron has it all - looks, money, fame, and success beyond measure. Everyone, that is, except Aaron. At the end of the day, the cameras stop flashing, friends go back to their own lives, company business is handled, and Aaron is always alone. The moment he meets Duncan Stiel, Aaron knows he'll do anything to hold onto the larger-than-life detective. But when he realizes money won't buy him the ultimate happiness, Aaron needs to find the strength to give Duncan something much more important - his heart.</description>

  <description>Felix Day, author of the Constantine Sphinx mysteries, and Leonard Fuller, author of the Inspector Fez mysteries, are bitter rivals and the best of enemies. Both happen to present when a notorious author of roman à clef is shot by an invisible assailant during a signing at historic Marlborough Bookstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if they weren’t both suspects, it’s the perfect opportunity to match wits and sleuthing skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the murderer was equally amused.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Length: 4 hours and 3 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don't talk to strangers, young man - especially the dead ones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the Roaring '20s. Skirts are short, crime is rampant, and booze is in short supply. Prohibition has hit Little Egypt, where newspaperman David Flynn has come to do a follow-up story on the Herren Massacre. The massacre isn't the only news in town, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spiritualist medium Julian Devereux claims to speak to the dead - and he charges a pretty penny for it.&lt;br /&gt;Flynn knows a phoney when he sees one, and he's convinced Devereux is as fake as a cigar store Indian. But the reluctant attraction he feels for the deceptively soft, not-his-type Julian is as real as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Julian begins to have authentic, bloodstained visions of a serial killer, and the cynical Mr. Flynn finds himself willing to defend Julian with not only his life, but his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: This novella contains phony spiritualists, cynical newspapermen, labor disputes, illicit love affairs, high-calorie southern cooking, and more than 50 percent humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains scenes of mild gay erotic content.</description>

Riley is caught in some serious Cartel problems and suddenly everything Jack holds dear is threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add in Vaughn and Darren's story, revisiting Robbie, Eli, Liam and Marcus, alongside Sean and Eden and the wedding that never was, and this story promises you everything you want from a Texas series book.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;4 hrs and 18 mins.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riley and Jack Campbell-Hayes are in a good place. Jack is expanding the DD and training quarter horses, Riley is so close to his first ethical based contract that he can almost taste it and Hayley is nearly ten and happy as all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack hires Robbie, a man recovering from a great loss, to be his right hand man. Meanwhile Riley's flamboyant mischievous photographer friend, Eli, decides the DD is the perfect backdrop for a cowboy themed model shoot. Eli has secrets not even Riley knows about but despite what he is hiding he falls in lust with Robbie at first sight. Everyone except Robbie can see how perfect Eli would be for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when secrets spill and lies are discovered? And just how far will Riley and Jack go to play matchmaker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against the backdrop of twenty half naked models on DD land, and in the midst of fighting the oil establishment that just won't give Riley a chance, Texas Heat is the story of one hot summer in Texas with a Gay Rodeo, humor, angst and a love between two men that just grows stronger every day.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 7 hours and 59 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riley Hayes, the playboy of the Hayes family, is a young man who seems to have it all: money, a career he loves, and his pick of beautiful women. His father, CEO of HayesOil, passes control of the corporation to his two sons; but a stipulation is attached to Riley's portion. Concerned about Riley's lack of maturity, his father requires that Riley &lt;i&gt;'marry and stay married for one year to someone he loves'.&lt;/i&gt; Angered by the requirement, Riley seeks a means of father's stipulation. Blackmailing Jack Campbell into marrying him "for love" suits Riley's purpose. There is no mention in his father's documents that the marriage had to be with a woman and Jack Campbell is the son of Riley Senior's arch rival. Win win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riley marries Jack and abruptly his entire world is turned inside out. Riley hadn't counted on the fact that Jack Campbell, quiet and unassuming rancher, is a force of nature in his own right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story of murder, deceit, the struggle for power, lust and love, the sprawling life of a rancher and the whirlwind existence of a playboy. But under and through it all, as Riley learns over the months, this is a tale about family and everything that that word means.</description>

  <description>Jory Harcourt is finally living the dream. Being married to US Marshal Sam Kage has changed him—it’s settled the tumult of their past and changed Jory from a guy who bails at the first sign of trouble to a man who stays and weathers the storm. He and Sam have two kids, a house in the burbs, and a badass minivan. Jory’s days of being an epicenter for disaster are over. Domestic life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means it's exactly the right time for a shakeup on the home front. Sam’s ex turns up in an unexpected place. A hit man climbs up their balcony at a family reunion. And maybe both of those things have something to do with a witness who disappeared a year ago. Marital bliss just got a kick in the pants, but Jory won’t let anyone take his family away from him. Before he knew what it felt like to have a home, he would have run. Not anymore. He knows he and Sam need to handle things together, because that’s the only way they’re going to make it.</description>

  <description>Sequel to A Matter of Time I &amp;amp; II&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jory Harcourt doesn't have to go looking for trouble. Wherever he goes, it seems to find him—particularly when his partner, Sam Kage, is working undercover on a federal task force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the recession forces him to close his business, Jory goes to work as a matchmaker and event planner. From there, it's only a matter of time before his big mouth and up-front attitude make him the rope in a tug-of-war between a trust fund baby and a drug-smuggling criminal. Then, as if that situation weren't delicate enough, Jory's undercover lover shows up working for the smuggler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the men who want him and the men who just want him dead, Chicago is getting a little crowded for Jory, so on the advice of his brother, his boyfriend, and the FBI task force, he heads for Hawaii... where a serious accident threatens his quality of life. Can Sam and Jory keep the faith and prove that their relationship really is bulletproof?</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Jory Harcourt changed his name and shut the door on a past full of pain, only to emerge stronger on the other side. He has a new career, a great working partner, and a satisfying life - except for the hole in his chest left behind when police Detective Sam Kage walked out with his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Sam's back and he knows what he wants... and what he wants is Jory. Jory, who doesn't know if he can survive another breakup or losing Sam to his dangerous job, resists returning to the arms of the only man he has ever truly loved. But when a serial killer with a score to settle targets Jory, he will have to decide if love is worth the danger as he tries to solve the case and keep Sam safe.</description>

  <description>Jory Keyes leads a normal life as an architect’s assistant until he is witness to a brutal murder. Though initially saved by police Detective Sam Kage, Jory refuses protective custody - he has a life he loves that he won’t give up no matter who is after him. But Jory’s life is in real jeopardy, especially after he agrees to testify about what he saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While dealing with attempts on his life, well-meaning friends who want to see him happy, an overly protective boss, and a slowly unfolding mystery that is much more sinister than he could ever imagine, the young gay man finds himself getting involved with Sam, the conflicted and closeted detective. And though Jory may survive the danger, he may not survive a broken heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;8 hrs 10 min&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a half-century old skeleton tumbles out of the wall in the midst of the renovation of Cloak and Dagger Bookstore renovation, Adrien turns to hot and handsome ex-lover Jake Riordan -- now out-of-the closet and working as a private detective. Jake is only too happy to have reason to stay in close contact with Adrien, but there are more surprises in Adrien's past than either one of them expects -- and one of them may prove hazardous to Jake's own heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;6 hrs 14 min&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffering from writer's block and frustrated with his tentative relationship with hot but closeted LAPD Homicide Detective Jake Riordan, gay bookseller and mystery writer Adrien English travels to northern California where he finds a body in his front drive. By the time the sheriffs arrive the body has disappeared, and Adrien once again finds himself playing amateur sleuth. But when the game turns deadly, Adrien turns to Jake. Jake may be confused about some things, but keeping his lover alive is not one of them - no matter what the cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;5 hrs 24 min&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone's out to get Los Angeles bookseller Adrien English. His best friend has been viciously murdered, now he's getting weird phone calls and sinister gifts from a mysterious "admirer." The cops think he's trying to divert suspicion from himself - with the exception of sexy and homophobic homicide detective Jake Riordan. Is Riordan really such a great detective - or does he have a few secrets of his own? Is his offer to help Adrien on the level or is he out to nail his favorite suspect - to the wall?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Length: 2 hours and 57 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France, 1916. The Great War. High above the carnage in the trenches, British and German aces joust like knights of old for control of the skies. The strain and tension of living every day on the edge of death leads to dangerous choices and wild risks. When British ace Bat Bryant's past catches up with him, he strikes out in panic and kills the man threatening him with exposure. But there's a witness: the big, handsome American pilot Cowboy Cooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowboy, it seems, has his own ideas of rough justice.</description>

  <description>1895. New York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Webster’s pack is in trouble. His father’s failing health and his mother’s untimely death mean that the vultures are circling. It won’t be long before his family’s assets are stripped and his pack disbanded. When an offer of help arrives in the form of a marriage of convenience, he has little choice but to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arrangement would be the perfect solution, if not for one thing. Gabriel is to marry Nathaniel Hayward, the Alpha who was badly injured in the accident that killed his brother ten years before—and the man Gabriel has been in love with for as long as he can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a business arrangement masquerading as a marriage—in a strange, empty house with a damaged husband who barely tolerates him — isn’t what Gabriel expected from life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes the last thing we want is the beginning of something more.&lt;br /&gt;And an ending can be the start of something beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A standalone story set in the Homestead universe**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novel - 54k</description>

  <description>Luke Lafontaine survived the past year by not thinking about the father he lost, the dairy farm he couldn’t save from bankruptcy, or his way of life that vanished with the rap of an auctioneer’s hammer. Cleaning up city folks’ trash at the Minnesota State Fair is just another dead-end job. But at the Fair, surrounded by a celebration of farm life, ambitions he’d given up on and buried deep start to revive. And seeing Mason Bell in the parade—gorgeous, gay, out-of-his-league Mason—stirs other buried dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mason left his hometown for college in Minneapolis without looking back. Student life is fun, classes are great, gay guys are easy to find, but it’s all a bit superficial. He’s at the State Fair parade route with his band when he realizes a scruffy maintenance worker is Luke, his secret high school crush. Luke should be safely home working on his dad’s farm, not picking up litter. Mason wishes he hadn’t fallen out of touch. He’s an optimist, though, and it’s never too late for second chances. Now he just has to convince Luke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;States of Love: Stories of romance that span every corner of the United States.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love, served behind the stick.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle McKee lives a charmed life. He co-owns Under, an uptown speakeasy, where he is chief mixologist. Friends poke fun at Kyle’s tiny one-bed apartment in Chelsea, but they’re the best support system a man could ask for. Unfortunately, Kyle’s lackluster love life has led him to take a break from dating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harlem resident Luka Clarke is a lieutenant with Engine 47, the Pride of Morningside, where he carries on his father’s legacy with the FDNY. Luka, who is mixed race and bisexual, has his eye on Kyle, whom he met at a local burger joint and he just needs to make time to visit Kyle’s bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before work one evening, Kyle is trapped inside the luncheonette when a fire breaks out. Luka’s firehouse answers the call and he connects with Kyle again under the most unexpected of circumstances. When Kyle gratefully invites Luka and the firehouse squad to Under, the flirting between the two men leads to a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle and Luka quickly grow close, but Luka’s mother and sister distrust Kyle for being both white and gay. Luka believes his family will come around and accept Kyle in the end, but Kyle is not optimistic and hides his disquiet as attraction blossoms into love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle and Luka’s near-idyllic bubble is shattered one evening after a hate crime leaves them scarred, inside and out. Shaken, they put on a strong front but struggle inwardly against fear and personal demons. As the emotions seething beneath the surface finally come to a head, both men must decide if they have the strength to find love enough to conquer hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reader advisory: This book contains references to non-nurturing parenting; homophobia; racism and racist slurs. There are references to recreational drug use. This book also contains scenes of mmmm ménage and characters caught in fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Release Date: 20th August 2019&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the lines between pretense and reality blur, can the actor and the boyfriend-for-hire discover something real?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan Levesque is Hollywood’s newest blue-eyed boy. Moving from soap operas to the big screen has paid off for the kid from Minnesota, and he’s hot property. But, when a video from the lowest point of his past is shared on social media everything begins to unravel and old hurts resurface. His agent suggests a way out of the mess, and he jumps at the chance to make things right by pretending he’s in a committed, loving relationship with the tall, dark, sexy boyfriend for hire, Kaden. Only, he never counted on the impact Kaden would have on his life or his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kaden Moore’s next assignment lands in his lap, he’s expecting nothing more than a self-centered celebrity who’s messed up. Kaden’s new role is that of Hollywood A-lister Ryan Levesque’s boyfriend, a PR stunt concocted by his agents to restore the actor’s dented popularity. Kaden is aware of the video that surfaced from Ryan’s past, and though it raises questions about what kind of man Ryan is, it’s not any of Kaden’s business. Kaden has been pretending his entire life and knows he can show the troublesome actor a thing or two about the world beyond the Hollywood bubble. But maybe Kaden isn’t as clued up as he thinks, especially when it comes to the heart and love.</description>

A love-threatening lie.  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; Can a witch avoid a murder rap without revealing the supernatural truth?  &lt;p&gt;Cosmo Saville guiltily hides a paranormal secret from his soon-to-be husband. And if he can’t undo a powerful love spell, uncertainty threatens his nuptial magic. But when he’s arrested for allegedly killing a longtime rival, he could spend his honeymoon behind bars…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police Commissioner John Joseph Galbraith never believed in love until Cosmo came along.

But with an unseen enemy threatening to expose Cosmo’s true nature, the couple’s blissful future could shatter like a broken charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Cosmo find the lost grimoire, clear his name and keep John’s love alive, or will black magic “rune” their wedding bells?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mainly by Moonlight&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the sexy Bedknobs and Broomsticks romantic gay mystery series. If you like spell-binding suspense, steamy star-crossed fun, and a dash of paranormal, then you’ll love Josh Lanyon’s charming tale. &lt;/p&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It's all fun and games until someone loses a hand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dixon has been dying to introduce Yuri to Uncle Fonzo, the Hand of his family, and now he'll finally get that chance. All they need to do is meet him at a traveling carnival with an unused piece of Spellcraft. Easy peasy, right? Not even a little. And even worse, they might encounter a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncle Fonzo has left a trail of magical destruction in his wake, but he claims he's been helping people. Spellcrafters are a slippery bunch, and it's hard to say if he's stretching the truth or telling an outright lie. One thing's for sure, he's between a rock and a hard place now, and if he doesn't deliver an outrageous ransom to Strange Manor by midnight, all deals are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a lackluster carnival with a booby-trapped tour bus to the decrepit mausoleum behind an old mental asylum, the Spellcraft leads Dixon and Yuri on a goose chase that's not only wild…but deadly.</description>

  <description> “Mr. Addison… I’m so sorry to impose, but I was hoping you would sign my venator card?”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jack thought he had it all: a powerful family ready to offer a helping hand in times of need, success and fame, and the most amazing lover in the person of Roux Chat-Bonnes. Problem is, his family would never accept a nonhuman as Jack’s life partner, so for months he was stuck trying to keep his relationship hidden. But when Roux found out Jack had given in to his father and agreed to give a speech at an anti-creature conference, Jack’s beloved chat left him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ashamed and heartbroken, Jack needs to choose whether he should go against what he believes in and support his Father’s cause, or follow his heart and try to win Roux back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Deep down, Jack knows what’s right, but choosing to do the right thing is a whole other matter when it means standing against the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; pride, love, trust, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, deception, lies, keeping secrets, Paris, France, rejected lover, lack of acceptance, prejudice &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy &lt;br /&gt;Content: Scorching hot, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if this is the last time we lie like this?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncertainty is keeping Ellery Luker awake at night and robbing him of his appetite. It’s been five days since the love of his life and partner of twenty-five years, Jools, went to the doctor. Five days since the biopsy. Five days of going crazy with worry and what ifs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Jools suffers from the same disease that stole Ellery’s mother when he was just eleven?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if all Ellery’s worst fears come true?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What if…?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Stars of the silver screen Alasdair Hamilton and Toby Bowe wow the post WWII audiences with their performances. But when they depict Holmes and Watson life starts to imitate art. They get asked in by a friend to investigate a mysterious disappearance only to find a series of threatening letters—and an unwanted suitor—make real life very different from the movies.Then there's an unpleasant co-star who's found murdered during an opening night. Surely detection can’t be that hard?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the hottest summer on record, Iron Lake reservoir is emptying, revealing secrets that were intended to stay hidden beneath the water. The tragic story of a missing man is a media sensation, and abruptly the writer and the cop falling in love is just a postscript to horrors neither could have imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Selling Horror writer Chris Lassiter struggles for inspiration and he’s close to never writing again. His life has become an endless loop of nothing but empty pages, personal appearances, and a marketing machine that is systematically destroying his muse. In a desperate attempt to force Chris to complete unfinished manuscripts his agent buys a remote cabin. All Chris has to do is hide away and write, but he’s lost his muse, and not even he can make stories appear from thin air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sawyer Wiseman left town for Chicago, chasing the excitement and potential of being a big city cop, rising the ranks, and making his mark. A case gone horribly wrong draws him back to Lancaster Falls. Working for the tiny police department in the town he’d been running from, digging into cold cases and police corruption, he spends his day's healing, and his nights hoping the nightmares of his last case leave him alone.</description>

  <description>Reverend Brian Lucas has a secret his congregation in the Nine Mile Methodist Church knows nothing about, and he’d really like to keep it that way. But even his earth-shattering secret takes a backseat to what else is happening in his tiny hometown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murders usually do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian's “close friend,” Sam, is urging a resolution to their little problem, but Brian's brother, Boyd, the County Sheriff, is more caught up in chasing down a homicidal maniac who is slaughtering little old ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Brian's secret and Boyd's mystery run into each other head on, and Boyd's fifteen-year-old son, Jesse, gets involved, all hell breaks loose. Then a fourth death comes to terrify the town, and it is Brian who begins to see what is taking place in their little corner of the Corn Belt. But even for a Methodist minister, it will take more than prayer to set it right.</description>

  <description>When Jamie Roma and Derek Lee find their blossoming love affair interrupted by dual invitations to a house party from a mysterious unnamed host, they think, Sounds like fun. The next thing they know they are caught up in a game of cat and mouse that quickly starts racking up a lot of dead mice. Yikes, they think. Not so fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped inside a spooky old house in the middle of nowhere, with the body count rising among their fellow guests, they begin to wonder if they'll escape with their lives. As a cataclysmic storm swoops in to batter the survivors, the horror mounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, even in the midst of murder and mayhem, Jamie and Derek's love continues to thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the guest list thins, so does the list of suspects. Soon it's only them and the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the battle really begins.</description>

  <description>The world of writers, readers, and reviewers is a close-knit family of friends, fans, and fiction fanatics. That’s the world Milo Cook and Logan Hunter reside in—thriving on the give and take of creativity, the sharing of stories and ideas, and forever glorying in their boundless love of books and the words that make them breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes words can cut too deep. And when they do, there is inevitably a price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What begins for Milo and Logan as a time of new love and gentle romantic discoveries, becomes before it’s over a race for their lives and for the lives of everyone they know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would ever suspect that an entity as beautiful as the written word could become a catalyst for revenge? And ultimately—murder?</description>

  <description>Lee, Jones, and Ginger deal with dangerous situations and mounting stress daily working for the most powerful assassin organization in the world. All of those things seem like a walk in the park compared to the friction that sparks between them. When all three are assigned to the same job, ignoring the heat from the inferno of desire becomes impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee is a master at deciphering codes, skilled in hacking complicated systems, and never misses a target, even from over fifty miles away. His feelings for Jones and Ginger, however, may be the first code he’s unable to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jones deals in absolutes, but the road to his past is paved with bodies and regrets. Getting Lee to acknowledge the pull they both feel toward Ginger may be the hardest mission he’s ever had to face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger struggles to cope with the overwhelming guilt that accompanies this new job. Falling for these hired killers will be a risk—one that could wind up with him losing in the end or gaining everything he’s ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the three work together to take down a human trafficking ring—and save a desperate soul—time is of the essence. Their lives are on the line as mysteries unfold and unexpected encounters throw them off course. Will Lee, Jones, and Ginger let doubts come between them, distracting them from their mission and blocking any hope of love? Or can they face the toughest challenge of their lives and become…a triple threat</description>

  <description>Can a couple be more opposite than a thief and a cop? Or do they have more in common than they think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mattias Dumont stole to survive. He was damned good at it. But there’s no such thing as a victimless crime, and when he saw how his theft hurt people, he resolved to change. Now he works as a consultant, and while helping to investigate a rash of burglaries, he crosses paths with James.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Police Officer James Levinson doesn’t trust thieves, and that includes Mattias. James’s father stole to support himself, and James knows firsthand how that can destroy lives—it inspired him to go into law enforcement. Mattias is no different, from what he can tell… at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they work together, Mattias and James realize there’s something deeper between them than just the physical attraction neither can deny. Given time, they might even grow to trust each other—unless the case they’re working on dredges up pasts both would rather forget.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;“Catnip is nothing like tea or coffee. It’s a drug and should remain illegal.”&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finally getting together during their dangerous job in Siberia, Roux and Jack arrive in Paris. On the surface, Jack’s life has finally slotted into place, but the necessity of keeping secrets is choking him on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His father is in town to lead an anti-creature conference, and since he’s unaware of his son’s interspecies relationship and pro-creature views, he wants Jack to be the keynote speaker. Torn between his love for Roux and his family’s expectations, Jack attempts to play both sides and lie his way out of the conundrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they meet Roux’s old flame, a big, sexy chat who knows everyone in Paris, keeping a low profile might not be possible anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Themes: pride, love, trust, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, deception, lies, drugs, keeping secrets, Paris, France, the ex&lt;br /&gt;Genre: M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy&lt;br /&gt;Content: Scorching hot, explicit scenes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo.</description>

  <description>Six months after meeting Cian, the start of the rest of Mitch’s life is so close he can almost taste it. With his high school exams behind him, he can look forward to a long summer, his first Pride festival in Dublin, and, best of all, moving in with Cian when Mitch starts college in September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cian can’t wait to accompany Mitch to his first Pride, or for the moment they’ll start sharing a home and their lives. But while the festival is everything they could have hoped for, unexpected news that Cian is about to lose his room in Dublin puts their life together under threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Objections to their plans from the home front and a shocking lack of affordable housing in Dublin could shatter Mitch and Cian’s dreams, but perhaps a second miracle is exactly what they need to find their pride of place.</description>

  <description>Beto Hernandez’s objective: Break the human trafficking ring plaguing Skagit once and for all. He’s not in Skagit to make friends—his kicking ass first and taking names later. Maybe. He crosses paths with an intriguing and sexy man, the first man in years to spark Beto’s interest. It’s ultimate bad timing, though; no one in Skagit can be trusted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is Carsten Quinn, and where does he fit in Beto’s investigation? Beto tries to stay away from Carsten but their undeniable chemistry keeps him close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carsten Quinn survived years in hell to return to “normal life,” and he his own mission in Skagit. The only problem is he’s hiding, not living anything like a normal life. When his closest friend is severely injured it’s up to Carsten to finish gathering evidence to put some very bad people behind bars and he knows all too well he can’t trust anyone, especially not the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, the law appears anyway, in the form of a sexy cop he can’t stop thinking about; when Carsten’s past comes back with a vengeance, he has no one else to turn to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is happiness too much to hope for? Are Beto and Carsten too different and too broken to trust anyone, much less each other? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The holiday season can’t be over soon enough for John Hall. His ex-boyfriend emptied the bank accounts and ran off with his personal trainer months earlier leaving John unable to pay his creditors. Now he’s forced to close the independent movie theater he runs. Now he’s going to have to close the movie theater he owns, a bad end to a bad year. Gay, single and closer to fifty than forty, John doesn’t see a lot of hope in his future. In the dark of night he wonders if staying afloat is worth the effort. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chance Allsop made a promise to his dying mother he hopes he doesn’t regret. Ten months after her death he’s finally in Skagit Washington, visiting the old movie theater where his parents met and fell in love decades ago. The whole thing seems like a lark until he lays eyes on the handsome owner. With his mother’s spirit at his back Chance fully intends to win John Hall’s heart. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Rod Beton and Travis Walker have known each other a long time; since the second grade when Rod was the new kid in town and Travis befriended him with Pokémon trading cards and a fruit snack. Apparently Rod’s easy. Since that day they've had each other's back's, bread and butter, biscuit and gravy...and so on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Rod fell in love with Travis. He's been hoping for some kind of signal from Travis that he returns Rod's feelings. When Travis announces his surprise engagement over Thanksgiving dinner Rod decides he's done waiting for the impossible. He packs his belongings and heads for Skagit and a new life. Even if Travis suddenly decided Rod was the man for him would Rod be able to put aside his insecurities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis always knew he was destined to take over the family business. As the only boy he’s expected to take the helm of the Walker farming operation, and he’s good at it. An engagement to a local girl he’s pals with seems like the perfect solution gets him mom off his back and ensures the family line -- eventually. When his best friend abruptly leaves town Travis’s eyes are finally opened to the difference between what is expected of him and what he could expect for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;His Best Man&lt;/i&gt; is a standalone in the Accidental Roots series, a friends to lovers mm romance with an HEA. Bisexual/gay.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> Someone is watching. Someone is waiting.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Despite having attracted the attention of a dangerous stalker, Special Agent Jason West is doing his best to keep his mind on his job and off his own troubles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But his latest case implicates one of the original Monuments Men in the theft and perhaps destruction of part of the world's cultural heritage--a lost painting by Vermeer. Naval Reserve Lieutenant Commander Emerson Harley wasn't just a World War 2 hero, he was the grandfather Jason grew up idolizing. In fact, Grandpa Harley was a large part of what inspired Jason to join the FBI's Art Crime Team. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learning that his legendary grandfather might have turned a blind eye to American GIs "liberating" priceless art treasures at the end of the war is more than disturbing. It's devastating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jason is determined to clear his grandfather's name, even if that means breaking a few rules and regulations himself--putting him on a collision course with romantic partner BAU Chief Sam Kennedy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meanwhile, someone in the shadows is biding his time...&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Ever since he first set foot in Harrisburg, Tennant’s life has been a rollercoaster. Ups and downs too numerous to mention, hard knocks and championship rings. Through all of those monumental moments, one thing has been a constant for him, Jared Madsen. Now that their wedding day is drawing nearer, Ten is seriously considering eloping. He would, if not for his mother, his father, his brothers, the wedding planner, the guests, the cake, the press, and the team. Oh, and then there’s his best friend, who is vying for the job of ringmaster of the wedding circus. Would sneaking off during the night with Jared and skipping to the honeymoon part of the festivities really be all that bad?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Jared proposed to Ten, he imagined a quiet wedding, on a beach somewhere, with family, and maybe the team. But life gets complicated with Ten’s warring brothers, a Russian goalie with a love of sequins, and a bachelor party organized by Adler. When Trent sends them a wedding planner, every spare hour is filled with choosing invitations, cake tasting, and finding a rose in the perfect shade of green. Add in Layton organizing a press conference, and suddenly their private wedding is destined to become a media sensation. Is it wrong to think seriously about kidnapping Ten and spiriting him away to a small deserted island?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adler organizing the bachelor party, Trent supplying the wedding planner, and Stan writing a speech. What can possibly go wrong?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The day Ryan Fulton realises he’s in love with Jamie Holt is the day he knows he’s losing him. With blue-tinted white blond hair, eyeliner, and a personality to match, Ryan knows he’s a bit much. But can he change? Can he tone it down and, if he does, can he live like that? He’d never suspect Jamie of cheating, but maybe his closeted boyfriend decided flamboyant Ryan wasn’t worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ryan isn’t going to take it lying down. Determined to win Jamie back, Ryan even decides to get rid of the black and blue lace undies he just bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Jamie comes home and says they need to talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LENGTH: 4,177 words.</description>

Her girlfriend, Annie Slocum, books the first possible flight to Dublin for both of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their difficult relationship, Siobhán wants to help her father, so she and Annie move in with him during his recovery. Although Annie loves Siobhán and Ireland, and wants to be supportive, she feels out of place and disconnected from Siobhán.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick hasn’t been the same since his wife’s death fifteen years ago, and it takes time and patience for Siobhán and him to work through their issues. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things slowly begin to improve as Annie figures out a way to expand her Boston-based blog to include some Irish content, and Siobhán’s spark of creativity re-ignites after lying dormant for more than a year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s one more hurdle they must overcome, and that decision will shape their entire future.</description>

  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After one night of passion, Jack and Roux travel to Siberia to hunt down a mysterious monster that has crawled out of a deep mine shaft and keeps attacking the workers. With Roux regretful about giving in to temptation, the atmosphere between the two venators remains tense, but private matters need to stay in the background when the unknown being proves more deceptive than expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Something dangerous lurks in the blizzard, but how can they protect themselves when they don’t trust each other? When new truths about Roux are revealed, will Jack be able to man up and become who Roux needs him to be? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; pride, shapeshifter, demons, Siberia, winter setting, love, trust, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, love, deception, kitsune &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy &lt;br /&gt;Scorching hot, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; (M/M serial)</description>

  <description> Mineral spas are so calm and relaxing...unless they smell like a derrière at a bean-lover's convention, that is!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixon and Yuri have a hot tip that Uncle Fonzo is taking the waters at Spring Falls Hot Spring Spa. Not only is the spring stinky enough to make your eyes water—but the foul odor reaches peak level just as the resort is gearing up for a visit from an important critic that will make or break its reputation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, this wouldn't be Dixon’s problem...except it appears that a piece of his uncle's Spellcraft might be responsible. He can't be entirely sure, though, since that particular slip of paper managed to go through the shredder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixon and Yuri pitch in to help the spa's owner appease a jilted bride, an obnoxious businessman, and the world's most boring critic while they scramble to reconstruct the shredded Spellcraft. Can they fix the wonky spell before it does any permanent damage? Or will all their efforts at saving the spa end up swirling down the drain?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The ABCs of Spellcraft is a series filled with bad jokes and good magic, where MM Romance meets Paranormal Cozy. A perky hero, a brooding love interest, and delightfully twisty-turny stories that never end up quite where you'd expect. The books are best read in order, so be sure to start at the beginning with Quill Me Now.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>The year is 1894. Europe has been suffering from a series of Anarchist terror attacks, the latest of which was the bombing of a Parisian textile mill which killed twelve people. The perpetrators of this act - the seven Hirsch Brothers - are believed to be on the run in London. Billings, Flynt and Clarkson are called in by Special Branch to help locate them. But the investigation goes spectacularly wrong. One by one, the Hirsch Brothers are found dead and the police have no idea who is killing them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When the lines between career and love blur, will Ethan and Ben find a way to create a future that will work for both of them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior year is here, and everything is on the line. Benoit’s time to shine in the crease is now, and he’s going to do everything he can to make sure those professional scouts take notice. He’s earned a great reputation for his skills in the net, and his laid-back demeanor is his key to maintaining his cool when things get heated in the goal crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Eagles roar into a new season, Ben’s laser-sharp focus is shattered by his attraction to Ethan Girard, the team’s new defensive consultant. Trying his best to ignore the budding friendship that’s taking a hard, fast turn into something far more passionate, Ben is determined to keep his mind on the sport he loves and not let his feelings for the handsome older man creep into his performance. But love, like hockey, is wildly unpredictable, and soon Ben finds that he’s unable to distance himself from Ethan who is slowly and surely working himself into his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed Boston defenseman, Ethan Girard, isn’t stupid. Celebrating his thirty-second birthday in the emergency room after breaking his leg, and with a warning that healing will be a long process, he knows he has to think about his future. He was drafted at eighteen, and he’s never known anything but hockey, but with no contract in place yet for the new season he considers that maybe it’s time for him to hang up his skates for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volunteering to help out with the Owatonna Eagles fills his time, but from the moment he lays eyes on goalie Ben, he knows his world will never be the same again. Falling in lust is as easy as stealing his first kiss, but Ben refuses to engage. Has Ethan finally met his match?</description>

  <description>Sometimes you have to start over to get love right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Ryan’s life is too chaotic for romance, what with running his business and being the legal guardian to his ten-year-old niece, but he’s hopeful he’ll find the right man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trauma surgeon Finn Thomason recently relocated from Chicago to Boston, where his focus on medicine leaves him little space for a personal life. Making a commitment to find a better work-life balance, Finn hopes he’ll also find a relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in an evening rainstorm, Luke shelters under a sidewalk awning…and encounters a handsome stranger. The two strike up a conversation and Finn offers to walk Luke under his oversized umbrella. Charmed, Luke accepts and asks Finn out for coffee in thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke and Finn quickly grow close, but, as the summer draws to an end, Luke struggles to keep his connection with Finn while Finn tries to come to terms with caring for a man whose attention is pulled in many directions. Both men are scrambling to get it right, but only time will tell if they’ll learn there is more than enough room in their hearts to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains references to child abandonment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Release Date: 28th May 2019</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Road trip!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dixon and Yuri head for Taco Town, they’re hoping to track down Uncle Fonzo. What they find instead is a fiasco. Is it sabotage? A curse? Or is it just a bunch of badly worded Spellcraft?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small Minnesota berg is a tourist destination featuring a memorable roadside attraction: The Big Taco. It’s not actually edible, but there’s a flock of birds passing through that never got the memo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing’s for sure, Fonzo has been there. Not only do plenty of folks recognize his photo, but they paid him to solve certain problems…all of which are now exponentially worse. Dixon wants to chalk it up to a run of bad luck. Yuri knows a con man when he sees one, and while he doesn’t relish the thought of destroying Dixon’s hero, he wouldn’t mind knocking the guy down a few pegs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s definitely something screwy about the Spellcraft they uncover. And they’d better figure out how to repair it before the Big Taco is reduced to crumbs—and with it, the livelihood of all their new friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The ABCs of Spellcraft is a series filled with bad jokes and good magic, where MM Romance meets Paranormal Cozy. A perky hero, a brooding love interest, and delightfully twisty-turny stories that never end up quite where you’d expect. The books are best read in order, so be sure to start at the beginning with Quill Me Now.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s 1942 and after a sexual indiscretion, US Navy pilot Zachary MacKenzie is sent to serve in the Royal Navy’s submarine service—a shockingly harsh punishment for a man who loves to fly. The submarine is oppressive and frustrating for him, and he’s marked out from his peers, publicly by being American, and privately by his attraction to men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bright spot is the company of his steward, sonar operator Gethin Llewelyn. Despite the differences of rank and background, they’re drawn to each other. Gethin’s integrity complements Zach’s casual joie de vivre, and soon the friendship develops into something much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the threats of war increase, the submarine is plagued by potentially hostile vessels, and circumstances lead them to suspect there’s a spy amongst their own crew. Being forced even closer together as they work for the greater good reveals a new awareness, and Zach doesn’t know what is in more danger, the vessel under his charge or his heart.</description>

  <description>Can two men fake their way to marital bliss? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caleb Taylor is shocked to learn his family could lose Bliss Island Resort — their home and livelihood — unless he makes use of a clause to marry the child of investor Louis Chastain. Sofia Chastain is more like a sister than a love interest, and Caleb isn’t ready to sign over his future. But Sofia has a brother, and Caleb has a plan ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Julien Chastain was disowned at fifteen and has made a life as a go-go dancer in Miami, but he lives paycheck to paycheck. When his childhood friend proposes an outlandish marriage contract, he thinks he’s crazy. But it’s a chance at a future that’s tough to pass up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caleb and Julien must present themselves as an authentic couple for the legal loophole to work, but the lines between “fake” and “real” keep shifting as they navigate intimacy, public scrutiny, and sabotage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love isn't part of the plan, but plans change. If they can outsmart Julien's father and prove their love is worth more than a transaction, they just might find a true happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;When they spend time alone on a Montana mountainside will Tyler ever convince Martin that like sapphires, love is worth searching for?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin’s name was the very last on a kill list. The son of a murderer, he’s had no childhood; lost in a horrific holding pattern of death that turned his heart to stone. Thanks to the man who called him brave and spared his life, he no longer has to look over his shoulder, but he does have one question. Why did Justin let him live?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Colby has identified a major flaw in the seismic mapping system used to monitor earthquake activity. Sent to Crooked Tree by his employer, the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology, he is tasked with adding a new remote station to the network. The installation should be his entire focus, but the lure of sapphires and his attraction to a heartbroken young man called Martin is enough to make him want more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Heartbroken after the death of his eccentric lover, Jenks is left to care for Mutt’s beloved pets on a lovely but isolated estate. With only the animals for company and rejected years earlier by his family when he left school to be with his lover, Jenks worries he’s fading from the world—until one misty morning when he discovers a half-drowned man on the bank of the river. And not just any man, but one who may have been the victim of an attempted murder. &lt;br /&gt;James Griffin is respectable and married…and has buried his true passion his entire life. Jenks’s gentle manner and keen mind stir in him the sort of longing he wishes he had for his wife. The same frustrated wife he now wonders may have plotted his demise. His memories clouded, Griffin knows he must discover his attacker’s identity, resolve matters in his unhappy marriage…and confront the desire he feels for the shy but tenacious Jenks. &lt;br /&gt;Together, they return to London to learn the truth of Griffin’s near murder. The police believe the incident nothing more than an accident, leaving Griffin and Jenks to find their way through a tangle of conflicting desires and ambitions to hunt the truth on their own. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Charles “Chet” Greenwood has everything he’s ever wanted: a home, a stable business, and strong, loving relationships with his two boyfriends. In the year since he’s been with Cris and Jake, they’ve always agreed on one thing to keep their triad strong: communication is key. Which is why it hurts that lately Jake seems to be hiding something. Before Chet and Cris can find out what, a tragic phone call forces Chet and his nephew Dell to return to their Georgia hometown for a funeral—and to finally confront the bigoted family they left behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jake Bowden never imagined he’d go from an exotic dancer to a professional cook in the space of a year, but here he is. He’s also secretly looking at top culinary schools, but the requirements are way beyond Jake’s abilities. And going to school could take him away from his boyfriends—which might actually be for the best. Chet and Cris have so much history together, are always in sync, and when Jake can’t get time off to support Chet, he feels even more like the odd man out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cris Sable knows something is going on with Jake, and he hates leaving Jake behind for two days to attend a funeral, but Chet and Dell need his support—especially with Dell’s own boyfriend unable to make the trip. Cris checks in with Jake constantly while they’re away, and even after their trio returns home, Cris knows something is still wrong. But it gets lost in the aftermath of an unbelievable secret reveal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While in Georgia, Chet received shocking news about his own past that will change everything about his future, and it rocks their triad to its core. But Cris loves and believes in his men, and he will do everything in his power to keep their three hearts beating as one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR NOTE: This is an m/m/m romance with kinky three-way sex between consenting adults. The “Us” series is best read in numerical order.</description>

  <description>Taro Ichikawa needs his weekly routines. Working from home as a programmer allows him to work around his constant struggle with anxiety and OCD—everything from exact meal times to his weekly dinner dates with his best friend Cris Sable. Openly demisexual, he’s comfortable knowing he’s different from most, and he’s content being single—until he breaks routine to attend Cris’s birthday party and makes an unexpected new friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dell Greenwood moved in with his uncle eighteen months ago to turn his life around, and after a serious setback last fall, he’s finally healthy and heading in the right direction. His full-time job as a porn videographer keeps him busy, so he doesn’t have to think about the fact that while he seriously dated one man last year, he’s not attracted to…well, anyone. It’s easy to assume that his traumatic past is to blame for his lack of interest in dating, but when he meets and gets to know Taro Ichikawa, Dell wonders if there’s a different reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Befriending someone mired in strict routines isn’t easy, but Dell is stubborn when he wants something, and being patient with Taro is easy. From emails to tentative lunch dates, what begins as a simple friendship slowly deepens into something much stronger—and completely unexpected. But Dell knows that for him to be all-in with Taro, he not only needs to come to terms with his sexuality, but he also has to be honest with himself and his family about the absolute worst moment of his life.</description>

Surrounded by his huge Cuban family, his brothers-in-arms from Four Kings Security, and a groom with a penchant for chaos, what could possibly go wrong?</description>

  <description>Jaden King was raised in Boston to a wealthy family that taught him what love and hard work is. He has a challenging and rewarding career until everything was turned upside down. What was once a promising future has quickly become a frightening and unknown reality. After months of dealing with the fall out on his own, he decided getting away--or more realistically, running away--to White Acre and his best friend sounded like the perfect plan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Danny Keegan is a laid-back man with simple tastes and an even simpler life. He adores the little town of White Acre where he grew up, he loves his parents, and he enjoys his uncomplicated life. He’s always told himself the fact that he’s a closeted gay man in a conservative, parochial town wasn’t an issue and coming out of the closet wasn’t necessary. But with the addition of Jaden in his life he realizes as happy as he is, he could be happier and the future of a love of his own doesn't seem so out of grasp as it always had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Jaden and Danny meet, their chemistry is undeniable but playful flirting doesn't mean anything. They start spending all their free time together, and what started as a simple friendship quickly turns into something much more than either saw coming. But, Jaden carries a secret that could end it all before it even begins. And though Jaden is scared to tell the truth and risk everything that has come to mean so much to him, he knows that he can’t go on without laying himself bare, leaving Danny with an important, life changing choice to make. His content little life or what could be the love of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Jaden’s truth be too much for Danny, or will Danny decide a life out in the open, full of love, laughter, and passion is worth risking it all? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> “Are you planning to sleep with every creature you encounter?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The popular monster hunter Jack Addison is on his way to Transylvania to participate in a vampire festival and meet up with the coven elders. But no matter how thrilled he is to see the elusive creatures of the night in the flesh, he is far more excited about traveling alongside his frenemy/crush Roux. When the pretty chat invited him on the trip, Jack had hoped that perhaps the skittish creature would finally yield to his charm, but Roux is even more irritable than usual. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of vampires to go around at the festival, and Jack had never been close enough to an undead creature to consider his curiosity satisfied. But when Roux’s behavior changes from annoying to alarming, it will be up to Jack to help his friend, no matter how many pairs of glinting canines beckon him closer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; pride, experimenting, vampires, Transylvania, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, love, biological urge to mate, heat &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content:&lt;/b&gt; Scorching hot, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> “Mermaids had a bit of a reputation for accidentally drowning partners who got frisky with them in the open sea. As a gay man, Jack was immune to their charms.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It turns out that by staying with Calix, Jack had bet on the wrong centaur. A year on, he is broke and heartbroken after his boyfriend left him for someone with a thicker wallet. Salvation comes in the form of a message from Roux, Jack’s rival and crush all in one. Jack is willing to do whatever it takes to prove he’s a changed man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the only non-human in their profession, the humanoid feline Roux not only hunts down creatures but also understands their unique needs. Can Jack help him save the beautiful merman Lauro from the claws and teeth of jealous mermaids? And can he resist the seductive merman in the process? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; pride, experimenting, merman, mermaid, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, love, post-breakup issues, rebound &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy &lt;br /&gt;Contains scorching hot, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Length:&lt;/b&gt; 15,000 words (Episode 5 in the serial) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>What happens when you try to fix the past and end up threatening your future?&lt;br /&gt;Scott is struggling. Grieving the loss of his brother, carrying the weight of his father’s expectations, and getting his ass kicked in the rink, he’s in a downward spiral. He needs a solution and fast, but when his steroid use is exposed, he’s close to losing his place at Owatonna and more importantly, on the Eagles Hockey team. Thrown out of his house, with nowhere to go and no future in sight, he only has one choice; agree to mandatory counseling, random drug tests, and get his act together. Only then will he have a chance at normal. Meeting Hayne, a senior connected to the world through his art, is a shock to the system. Moving in with him is his only option, but falling for the shy artist leaves Scott in an impossible situation, and one he can’t escape.&lt;br /&gt;Hayne has always been that quiet, creative kid who sat in the back of class drawing instead of listening to the teacher. A talented artist, the shy and sensitive young man is struggling with the loss of his childhood friend. Seeing his sadness reflected in his usually colorful paintings, he decides to attend grief counseling and meets Scott, a lost soul in desperate need of light and color in his life. Taking in a homeless hockey player certainly was never part of his carefully orchestrated ten-year plan. But now that Scott is in his life, he’s discovering the joy of this man’s loving smile and tender touch is one of the most beautiful palettes on earth.</description>

  <description>The city of Haven Hart rests under the heel of Christopher Manos. He reigns over the most dangerous and deadliest citizens as the most powerful crime boss the city has seen in generations. Yet, for the last five years, the harshest edges of his nature have been tempered by the loving devotion of his husband, Snow, and the nephew Christopher adores like a son. His life is a balance of darkness and light until a birthday trip for his nephew, Simon, is interrupted by a hail of bullets and explosions, threatening to destroy it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Snow has found a home, a family, and the love of one of Haven Hart’s most powerful men. When Christopher and Simon are kidnapped, Snow risks everything to find his family. Utilizing specialized skills he learned on the streets and the finer points of running a city from his crime boss husband, Snow takes on roles he never dreamed he would--protector, leader, and avenger. No one threatens his family and lives. Experienced enough to know he can’t do this alone, Snow calls in every favor he is owed, risking his life promising favors in return, all to save his family and the man he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sins of the Manos crime family are escaping the dark recesses of the past and threatening the bright future of everything Snow and Christopher have built. Yet, even with the help of some unlikely and uniquely dangerous people, Snow finds himself wondering if their efforts will be enough to save the two most important people in his life. Will the loving family Snow has finally found be taken from him forever?</description>

  <description>Borrowed from the Secret Intelligence Service cipher department to assist Briers Allerdale - a field agent returning to 1920s London with news of a dangerous anarchist plot - Miles Siward moves into a 'couples only' boarding house, posing as Allerdale’s 'wife'. Miles relishes the opportunity to allow his alter ego, Millie, to spread her wings but if Miles wants the other agent’s respect he can never betray how much he enjoys being Millie nor how attractive he finds Allerdale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursuing a ruthless enemy who wants to throw Europe back into the horrors of the Great War, Briers and Miles are helped and hindered by nosy landladies, water board officials, suave gentlemen representing foreign powers and their own increasing attraction to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they catch their quarry? Will they find love? Could they hope for both?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clock is ticking.</description>

  <description>Love, served extra dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Murtagh loves his life as a wealthy bisexual businessman dedicated to the pursuit of pleasure. With a circle of friends he trusts implicitly, he enjoys a successful career in his family’s business and as co-owner of Under, an uptown speakeasy, with his friend with benefits, Kyle McKee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music teacher and part-time DJ Cameron Lewis lives modestly in a DUMBO loft and isn’t interested in serious relationships. However, he’s always up for some casual fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing a favor for his friend Carter Hamilton, Jesse meets Cam and is immediately charmed. When Jesse discovers Cam’s other life as a DJ, he is further intrigued. Viewing Cam as a challenge, Jesse pulls out all the stops, but his usual methods to avoid serious relationships fail. Though Cam has no intention of becoming attached, he begins to fall for Jesse, unaware that Jesse’s feelings are changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afraid of heartbreak, Cam pulls away, leaving Jesse bewildered and hurt. They remain friends until a series of misunderstandings widens the rift to breaking point. When Cam steps in to help Jesse through a family crisis, they realize they care for each other more than they’ve been willing to admit. Jesse and Cam don’t want a traditional relationship, but can they build a future that makes them both happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader advisory: This book contains scenes of mmm ménage as well as references to homophobia and recreational drug use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Release Date: 26th March 2019</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Falling for each other was easy. Staying together comes with a learning curve.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months after they met in the miraculous library, Cian is nervously preparing for Mitch’s arrival in Dublin. As much as he’s looking forward to three long days with his boyfriend—without parental supervision—he can’t help worrying about the fact that they will have to share both his small room and his even smaller bed. He doesn’t even own pajamas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their relationship is new, and Cian may be two years older, but he has little more experience than Mitch when it comes to intimacy and boyfriends. He isn’t sure what he’s doing or what’s expected of him. As a result, Cian and Mitch are in for a whirlwind weekend, filled with shocks, surprises, fun, and deepening feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against the backdrop of Ireland celebrating its national holiday, Cian and Mitch learn their first Lessons in Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;While a Miracle in the Library was a young adult story, Lessons in Love features two young men old enough to consume alcohol and be sexually active. This book is therefore meant for readers who are eighteen years or older and contains sexual acts between two consenting men.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Mitch McCann has been trying to dodge his bullies for eighteen months. He isn’t out, but that hasn’t stopped the popular gang at school from tormenting him for being gay. Three weeks before Christmas, in a desperate attempt to shake his pursuers, Mitch flees into the abandoned community hall, only to discover the building is far from empty; inside he finds a fully stocked library as well as Mr. Nichols, the very welcoming librarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The library turns into Mitch’s refuge of choice, where he can read books that answer his endless questions, without fear of encountering abuse. His peace of mind is shattered when nineteen-year-old Cian Leavy enters his sanctuary. Cian is the boy who made Mitch realize he’s gay, and he’s more attractive now than he was eighteen months ago, when Mitch literally ran into him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Cian unwittingly disrupt Mitch’s life again? Or has the scene been set for a miracle in the library?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Ward “King” Kingston the role of protector, forged by fire and tragedy, is one he takes seriously. When King is asked to safeguard the son of a four-star general and friend, he is pulled back into the world of government black ops on a mission that raises painful memories from his past. The moment King meets Leo, amid the chaos of a lockdown at a secret black site, it’s clear he’s never faced a challenge like this—one that will test his unwavering sense of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leopold de Loughrey is a misunderstood genius whose anxiety and insecurities are sent into overdrive when he is forcefully recruited to work on a top-secret project. Terrified of what his role as "invaluable asset" means, Leo’s stress leads to disappearances, arguments, and blowups that threaten the project and Leo’s future. King’s arrival is a calm in the storm for Leo and his frenetic thoughts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King and Leo couldn’t be more different, yet as they navigate the dangers of a secret multi-agency operation and face unknown threats, their differences could be what saves them. Neither man believes a happily ever after is in the cards, but their hearts might just prove them wrong… if they can survive a deadly betrayal.</description>

  <description>You never forget your first love ... especially when they cause you pain. Chase thought he was doing the right thing when he left Liam years earlier, but when he finds out he was wrong, it might be too late. The trust they once shared may be past the point of repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Forever Kind of Love&lt;/i&gt; is a story of second chances that asks the question -- is a good reason enough to wash away the years of hurt it caused? Chase comes home from the military ready to start his life with Liam. But he discovers Liam’s life has already started without him. Is there a place for him in it? Is the possibility of more pain worth the risk for Liam?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that isn’t hard enough, they only have the week Chase is on leave to come to terms with their future. Can they find forever in seven days?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> --- The real demons live within ---  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laurent.&lt;/b&gt; Time traveller. Devoted husband. Stubborn as the devil himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beast.&lt;/b&gt; Kings of Hell MC president. Will stop at nothing to protect his family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After everything Baal put them through, neither Laurent nor Beast considered ever making another pact with a demon, but in the spur of the moment, temptation becomes too great, and they decide on one more deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This time, with Mr. Magpie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the gift might prove to be more than they can handle. The danger to the human world has already strained their relationship, but Magpie’s offering brings out the worst in both Laurent and Beast. Confronted with each other’s flaws, they need to decide if, despite all they’ve been through together, perhaps they’re just not meant to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the world on the brink of collapse, and their pact binding them in new and unexpected ways, they have to put their differences aside to stand a chance at saving their family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; motorcycle club, alternative lifestyles, demons, tattoos, secrets, crime, gothic, opposites attract, biker, commitment, family, sacrifice, relationship issues, established couple &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; Dark, paranormal M/M romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content:&lt;/b&gt; Scorching hot, emotional, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Length:&lt;/b&gt; ~105,000 words (Book 5 in the series) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FINAL BOOK IN THE SERIES.

  <description>Dr. Christopher Allen knows how to deal with death. He’s a psychiatrist who works with hospice patients and their families, helping them cope with grief and letting go. But Chris’s job doesn’t prepare him for the sudden death of his devil-may-care brother Cal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At Cal’s funeral, Chris is completely thrown when he meets Elliot Rawlings, an artist Cal has been dating. Chris is hurt to discover that the brother he knew as straight was actually bisexual. Elliot is angry and resentful of having been kept hidden from Cal’s family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the funeral, a night of drinking at the bar with Cal’s friends leads to Chris and Elliot falling into bed together. The next morning, they’re overwhelmed by guilt and grief and agree to never speak of it again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Cal’s apartment needs to be packed up and Elliot reluctantly agrees to help Chris, as well as answer some questions about Cal’s life and their relationship. Despite their guilt and initial dislike for one another, they sort through the pieces of Cal’s life and begin to fall for each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite his best efforts to fix things, Chris’s family seems to be crumbling around him and he begins to question who he is and what his role with them is. As his feelings for Elliot grow, Chris must decide if they’re worth further damaging his fragile relationships with his friends and family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elliot’s rough upbringing has left him distrustful of getting close to anyone, much less another man who isn’t willing to acknowledge him in public. The odds seem stacked against Chris and Elliot, but if they can overcome them, they may be able to lay Cal’s ghost to rest, along with their own demons. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reader Advisory: This story deals with themes related to alcoholism, death (of secondary characters), and past abuse/neglect.</description>

  <description>Detective Bill Quigley fell in love with the familiar Isaac the night they met. But after more than two years, it’s time to admit to himself that Isaac doesn’t return his feelings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isaac knows he’s too broken by his experiences for anyone to fall in love with. Especially someone like Bill, who deserves a partner unplagued by Isaac’s nightmares and doubts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When children go missing from an orphanage, Bill and Isaac must work together to find them. And as years of yearning threaten to ignite into passion, they must decide once and for all whether to take a chance on love.</description>

  <description>Julian “Quinn” Quinetro, a gruff, tough Miami SWAT officer, has been injured on the job, and all he’s looking for is a little peace and quiet to recover—difficult to achieve with his large Cuban family. An adventure in picking up his prescriptions puts him in the path of his geeky, brownie-baking neighbor, Spencer Morgan. Spencer sweeps into Quinn’s life like a tropical storm of sunshine and rainbows. Not surprisingly, it’s chaos at first sight. Quinn’s in need of a little tender loving care, and Spencer decides he’s just the man for the job. Their very different lives might clash, but they might also find some common ground—and maybe more.</description>

  <description>Stan Lyamin has seen many of his dreams come true. He’s found his soulmate, loves Noah like his own, hoisted the Cup, and has his Mama living with him in his new country. But his fantasies of a loud, loving, madcap home overflowing with childish laughter linger. When a distant family member passes, Stan and Erik immediately agree to take in the two orphaned children, but that means a trip back to Russia for Stan, an idea that both exhilarates and terrifies him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erik’s world tilts on its axis when a phone call wakes him and Stan in the middle of the night. Abruptly, Stan is returning to Russia, making deals, working with people who know people, and fully intending to bring two orphaned children home. The red tape is overwhelming, and Erik is alone in Harrisburg with the nearly impossible task of finding a nanny who can speak fluent Russian. Being on his own is one thing, but add in fears about Stan’s safety and team issues, and Erik is finding everything hard to balance; not least of which is spending quality time with Noah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their family expands from three to five, the journey won’t be easy, but love can always find a way.</description>

  <description>Look but don’t touch. That’s the rule concerning dancers at Sapphire Sands, the prestigious members-only nightclub where Seth works at as a bartender. Seth has never had a problem following the rules until the day one of the dancers falls into his lap. Literally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit loves his job dancing at Sapphire Sands. Every day his job brings him closer to his dream of opening his own dance studio, so risking it all on the hot bartender is not an option. Or is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short can be read as a standalone even if you haven't read any of the books in the series.</description>

  <description>Detective Chief Inspector Robin Bright and his partner, deputy headteacher Adam Matthews, have just consigned their summer holiday to the photo album. It’s time to get back to the daily grind, and the biggest problem they’re expecting to face: their wedding plans. Then fate strikes—literally—with a bang. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone letting loose shots on the common, a murder designed to look like a suicide, and the return of a teacher who made Robin’s childhood hell all conspire to turn this into one of his trickiest cases yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Especially when somebody might be targeting their Newfoundland, Campbell. Robin is used to his and Adam’s lives being in danger, but this takes the—dog—biscuit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This title contains references to abuse and self-harm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Word count: 72,500; page count: 209&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Ben Cronin and Ty O’Malley have been inseparable ever since they got together on Valentine’s Day. Nine months into their relationship, dark clouds descend when Ben’s father falls seriously ill and dies in a matter of weeks. Having lost his only close relative, Ben is grief-stricken, and appears to be sinking ever deeper into a black hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to help Ben cope with his pain, Ty plans a getaway for them, to coincide with their first anniversary. But taking Ben back to the stunning beauty of the Swiss Alps, a place he visited with his father years ago, is a risky undertaking. Reuniting him with memories could as easily push Ben deeper into his pain as it might help him find the first traces of light. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty’s plan will either bring them closer than they’ve ever been, or spell disaster— for both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Valentine’s surprise is the sequel to Valentine’s Love. While it can be read as a stand-alone, you’ll enjoy this story more if you read Valentine’s Love first.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Ty O’Malley loves Spoilt for Choice, his gift shop. He enjoys nothing more than helping his customers find the perfect present. The only exception is Valentine’s Day. Ever since his partner left him, three years previously, Ty hasn’t been able to enjoy the love-themed holiday, and goes out of his way to avoid dealing with it. This year will be no different — until his assistant interferes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ben Cronin walks into his premises, looking for presents for a man he doesn’t know but has been admiring from afar, Ty can’t deny Ben is everything he would look for in a man — if he happened to be looking, which he isn’t. Besides, Ben has obviously set his sights on someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ty instructs Ben in the art of finding the perfect gift, the two men grow closer. But there are only four weeks until Valentine’s Day. After February fourteenth, Ty will probably never see Ben again … Or will he?</description>

  <description>Bad Valentine Book 3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accident-prone Ethan has a dating history that reads like a disaster movie script. Strong and silent Kel can’t seem to master the necessary small-talk on a proper date. When they both get signed up anonymously for a Valentines’s night event—"for those with an adventurous spirit but an open diary”—they never imagined they’d be matched. They never imagined the romantic sparks would fly. To be honest, they never imagined they’d survive the week. &lt;br /&gt;A catalogue of disasters dogs the footsteps of their blossoming romance, including a coffee date with food allergies as an added extra, an intimate dinner that strays too close for comfort to chopped chillies, and a sensual massage with hot wax candles that threatens to alert the local fire brigade. &lt;br /&gt;But if they can hold tight to their sweet, surprising, yet single-minded attraction – they might just survive this Valentine’s Day with something very special to look forward to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;******* &lt;br /&gt;This is a totally standalone romantic comedy of 17.5k words in the BAD VALENTINE series. These are lighthearted Valentine's Day shorts by four different authors, each story written with the same opening line: "Nothing good ever came of a Valentine." Check the series page for details of the other stories by Jordan Castillo Price, Dev Bentham and Jesi Lea Ryan. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Some hearts are made to be stolen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark Mannix doesn’t believe in love or romance, which is ironic given his birthday falls on Valentine’s Day. As he approaches forty, Mark is perfectly content with his life and nursing career in Boston, and—outside of his long-time friend-with-benefits, Alistair—prefers his hookups to be one-night stands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Mark’s plans for New Year’s Eve fall through, he attends his sister’s party and meets Owen Todd, a graphic designer of Caribbean descent. Owen is more than a decade younger than Mark and, at first glance the two men appear to have little in common. The chemistry between them is potent, however, and Mark breaks his no-strings pattern, seeing Owen week after week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A connection forms between the two men, leaving Mark in uncharted territory and drawn to Owen in ways he’s never known before. Even so, Mark continues his hookups with Alistair but is startled when Owen withdraws out of a desire to protect himself. His foundations shaken, Mark must decide if he can watch Owen walk away or … if the time has come to follow his heart in a new direction. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bad Valentine Book 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Compton owns a small but mighty fashion magazine. He already has enough on his plate, between work and, well, work. There’s no room for a kid in his life but when his sister drops her seven-year-old daughter for an extended stay, he has to figure it out. Just before his niece arrives, Nick meets a blazing hot firefighter. They get on like a house a fire and the sex—scorching. Too bad the he disappeared in the morning. Like smoke. Now Nick’s stuck with a kid he doesn’t know how to manage and without the man he’d love to get his hands on again. &lt;br /&gt;Dylan Gil wishes like hell he hadn’t taken his roommates advice and lied about who he was. He’s finally met someone he really likes and can’t stop thinking about. But now he’s too embarrassed to confess that he’s just a second-grade teacher, not a manly firefighter. Good thing that work gets distracting, particularly when one of his brightest students goes to stay with her uncle and all hell breaks loose. Some people shouldn’t be allowed to have kids. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If the term “dad pants” means anything it’s that taking care of children and fashion aren’t compatible. Does that mean these two doomed? Or is this the beginning of forever? &lt;br /&gt;A contemporary gay romantic comedy by Dev Bentham, Temporary Dad features mistaken identity, opposites attracting, a one night stand and some steamy mm romance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Temporary Dad is part of the Bad Valentine collection, along with Hidden Hearts by Clare London, Quill Me Now by Jordan Castillo Price and Love Magic by Jesi Lea Ryan</description>

  <description>What if the words you wrote came true? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellcraft isn’t exactly a respectable business, but it does pay the bills. At least, it &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt;. Unfortunately, Dixon Penn failed his Spellcraft initiation. Instead of working in his family’s shop, he’s stuck delivering takeout orders in his uncle’s beat-up Buick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning a Valentine’s Day contest at the largest greeting card company in the tri-state area would be just the thing to get his life back on track—but something at Precious Greetings just doesn’t add up. And despite numerous warnings to quit pestering them about his contest entry, he just can’t stop himself from coming back again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t hurt that the head of security is such a hottie. If Dixon had any common sense, he’d be scared of the big, mysterious, tattooed Russian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, no one ever accused him of being too smart….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quill Me Now originally debuted in the Bad Valentine collection, with Love Magic by Jesi Lea Ryan, Hidden Hearts by Clare London, and Temporary Dad by Dev Bentham.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"The day I met Derrick while playing my violin in the park was magical. Unfortunately, magic and love together don’t always mix." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oliver met Derrick while busking in the park, and they hit it off from the start. At first, Derrick’s “mysterious magician” vibe was intriguing, but after two botched dates, Oliver was ready to call it quits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fearing he lost his chance with Oliver, Derrick makes a last-ditch effort to win Oliver’s heart with a romantic Valentine’s date. But when love and magic collide, things tend to go awry. Will these two guys make it through the date unscathed? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Officer Finn Hallan has never run from a fight. With Niall’s life and love at stake, he’s not about to start now.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;N.B. Originally published with All Romance, this edition features the same story with new cover art&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finn Hallan is a member of the elite Norwegian Emergency Response Unit, code name Delta. When the team is sent to respond to a hostage situation on an Oil Platform, he has to face demons he thought he had buried a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scottish engineer Niall Faulkner’s skills in oil platform decommissioning takes him to the Forseti platform at the worst possible time. When he’s captured by terrorists, his only thought is that he will never get to tell his lover how he really feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Finn keep Niall alive? Or will they both die at the hands of hijackers in the frigid waters of the Norwegian sea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description> “Can I get a ride on your back?” &lt;br /&gt;“Only if you get me a drink first.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jack Addison’s career as a monster hunter is blossoming, and so is his experience in dealing with all kinds of interesting species. But one creature still remains a mystery to Jack—the feline-like Roux Chat-Bonnes. His fellow venator has been avoiding Jack since their successful werewolf hunt in Bohemia, but a man can only pine for so long, which is why Jack decides to vacation on a Greek island famous for its centaur population. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eager to get intimately acquainted with one of the hooved beauties, Jack instead uncovers a cruel plot that will change his view of human-centaur relations for good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; pride, experimenting, centaur, vacation, dreams, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content:&lt;/b&gt; Scorching hot, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Length:&lt;/b&gt; ~15,000 words (Episode 4 in the serial) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Theater critic Artemus Bancroft isn’t sure what to expect when his aunt summons him home to California with vague but urgent pleas about being unable to cope with “the situation.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation turns out to be the apparent haunting of Green Lanterns Inn—along with alarming rumors that long-suffering Auntie Halcyone may have murdered her philandering husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the rumors seem to have been started by the late Mr. Hyde himself—from beyond the grave.</description>

  <description> “Apparently, black market werewolf pheromones were readily available if one knew who to ask.”  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two years on from his first assignment, Jack Addison is a seasoned monster hunter, as hungry for fame and glory as he’d been when he first saw his rival, Roux Chat-Bonnes. They meet again when Jack is trapped by seven polyamorous gnomes, but what Roux doesn’t know is that Jack has developed a taste for unusual creatures and got himself captured on purpose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Roux himself, with his furry body and graceful tail, is just the kind of man Jack would like to get to know intimately, if he only wasn’t so uncertain about flirting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Opportunity for time together comes when the two of them are asked to hunt down a rogue werewolf pack. But with Roux being his usual uptight self, Jack turns his attention to the possibility of charming a werewolf. To increase his chances, he purchases a vial of pheromones, but once Jack and Roux are alone in the woods during the full moon, the line between hunter and hunted gets blurry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Themes:&lt;/b&gt; pride, experimenting, werewolf, shifter, menage, sacrifice, dreams, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre:&lt;/b&gt; M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erotic content:&lt;/b&gt; Scorching hot, explicit scenes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Length:&lt;/b&gt; ~15,000 words (Episode 3 in the serial) &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes that might be considered taboo. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;“I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to slay Nessie.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack Addison&lt;/b&gt; is on his way to becoming &lt;b&gt;a famous monster hunter&lt;/b&gt;, but luck had been against him at the Annual Nessie Hunt the previous year. Now, he’s back at Loch Ness to show everyone what he’s made of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s got a lot to prove to &lt;b&gt;Roux Chat-Bonnes, the snotty cat-like creature &lt;/b&gt;who saved his life last time, so Jack goes into the woods to hunt Nessie armed with a brand new detection device. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the creature he finds is nothing like he expected. Where he thought he would slay a monster, he ends up learning a valuable lesson about opening his horizons to new lifeforms. The learning curve is made delightful with the help of &lt;b&gt;tentacles, suckers, and lots of slippery slime&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Themes: pride, dreams, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, interspecies relations, tentacles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre: M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy&lt;br /&gt;Erotic content: Scorching hot, explicit scenes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: ~10,500 words (Episode 2 in the serial)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[What can I say about Jack Addison vs. Nessie's Tentacles that I didn't say in Man-Ravishing Spider? Probably nothing. Once again you need to be open to the weirdness factor, the intriguing yet oddly erotic nature, and Jack's overall bad(or good depending on your take of the scenario) luck. I will...]]>

  &lt;i&gt;“Please write down my name. Jack Addison.”&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack Addison.&lt;/b&gt; Son of a famous &lt;b&gt;monster hunter&lt;/b&gt;. Grandson of a celebrated inventor. He has a lot to live up to, but his ego is as big as the expectations of his family. At just nineteen, he’s fresh out of a prestigious academy, set to make a name for himself in a world where people need protection from strange and dangerous creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the annual hunt for the Loch Ness monster, Jack finds a rival in &lt;b&gt;Roux Chat-Bonnes, a cat-like being&lt;/b&gt; who recently joined the same profession and is set to steal the bounty—and fame—from under Jack’s nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack won’t let that happen. He sets out on the hunt alone, but the creature that he finds in the cave near Loch Ness doesn’t have tentacles. Instead, it’s got &lt;b&gt;hairy legs, eight black eyes and a taste for human flesh&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Themes: living up to expectations, pride, dreams, self-discovery, tolerance, fame, monster hunting, inter-species relations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genre: M/M romantic erotica, horror-comedy&lt;br /&gt;Erotic content: Scorching hot, explicit scenes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: ~7,500 words (Episode 1 in the serial)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING: This story contains morally ambiguous characters and scenes of sex that might be considered taboo.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Inspired by the pulp fiction novels of the 1940's and 50's, the novellas in this anthology emulate the dark, thrilling, sensational and taboo breaking stories of the post war era and gives them a gay twist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Honeytrap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1950’s London. Felix Stone is an openly gay P.I. He is approached by a mysterious woman who pays him to shadow her husband. What at first seems to be a run of the mill adultery case, soon turns out to be much more serious. When the people involved in the case suddenly start dying around him, Felix finds himself embroiled in the world of cold war espionage and his own life is put in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deluded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1949. The East End of London is still recovering from the blitz. Fitzgerald O’Sullivan is a young man with romantic notions of living like an impoverished writer. In an attempt to escape his past, he abandons his life of privilege and rents a room in the East End. There he meets Roy Parker, a chirpy Cockney with a working-class charm. Roy asks Fitz to write a story about how he saved the lives of two Jewish ladies during the war. What follows is a far-fetched tale filled with lies and exaggerations. This is is a noir thriller where nothing is what it seems. A dark tale of love, bitterness and vengeance set in the chaotic aftermath of the Second World War&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estranged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1950´s L.A. Sixteen year old Henry Blomqvist is the son of an aspiring actress and stepson of a millionaire businessman. He is an embarrasement to his parents, a useless layabout who is constantly getting arrested for cruising the parks. But his vices pale in comparison with the dark secrets in his parents´ lives. The kidnapping of Henry´s stepfather triggers a series of events which expose the skeletons in his parents´ closets and which finally give Henry the chance to step up to the mark and show what he´s really made of.</description>

  <description>Eduardo “Lucky” Morales is a fighter, from his childhood days in Cuba to his time as a Special Forces Green Beret. Scarred by the wars of his past, Lucky has learned nothing lasts forever. Guarding his heart is second nature, and getting emotionally involved is not an option. As co-owner of Four Kings Security, Lucky works hard alongside his former brothers-in-arms and fellow Kings, but he also plays hard. Flirting with sexy Texas cowboy and detective, Mason Cooper, is too much fun to resist, until Mason turns the tables on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mason Cooper may not be a soldier, but he’s fought his share of battles as an openly gay cop and now a detective for Major Crimes. Mason has no idea when things changed between him and Lucky, but the gorgeous, fiery Cuban has turned his world upside down. When a mistake leads to his suspension from the force, Mason turns to the least likely person for help: Ward Kingston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to keep Mason at arms’ length, Lucky is surprised to find the man at Four Kings Security. The Florida nights might be getting cooler, but the heat between Lucky and Mason burns hotter with every passing moment. Working private security can be dangerous and unpredictable, but so can falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;k.</description>

  <description>There are two sides to every story, even those buried in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Sam spots the hot guy moving in next door, he’s all for going round to introduce himself. That soon changes when it turns out his new neighbour is Charles Whitmore, an old school acquaintance. Sam didn’t like him back then, for good reason, and fifteen years haven’t altered that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Splitting up from his long-term boyfriend means a move across the city for Charlie. As luck would have it, his immediate neighbour is a guy he went to school with, Sam Gellar. While Sam is less than welcoming, his best mate is more than happy to invite Charlie into their social circle. Whatever problem Sam has with him, Charlie resolves to get to the bottom of it because, frosty beginnings aside, Charlie likes him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Christmas just around the corner, fate pushes them together, and they get on much better than they ever did at school. Despite his efforts not to, Sam develops feelings for Charlie, and they appear to be reciprocated. If Sam wants to take things further, he needs to either confront Charlie about their past—a past Charlie seems to have forgotten entirely—or let it go and move on. Sam knows deep down that he can’t let it go, but can’t find the right time to bring it up either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> To live and draw in L.A.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now living in Los Angeles with former navy SEAL Nick Reno, artist Perry Foster comes to the rescue of elderly and eccentric Horace Daly, the legendary film star of such horror classics as Why Won’t You Die, My Darling? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Horace owns the famous, but now run-down, Hollywood hotel Angels Rest, rumored to be haunted. But as far as Perry can tell, the scariest thing about Angels Rest is the cast of crazy tenants--one of whom seems determined to bring down the final curtain on Horace--and anyone else who gets in the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Emery Elward returned to Trinity Creek with no intention of doing anything but repairing the farmhouse he grew up in, starting a business, and tending to the graveyard linked to his family’s property. He has no interest in renewing past friendships. But one old friend is determined to get Emery out from behind the cemetery’s iron gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crafty, delicate Ezra Bell, who tailors his coal-black suits, knits gloves to warm his cold hands, and couldn’t make a plant grow if he tried, isn’t someone Emery can ignore. Ezra was Emery’s best friend all through school, his first crush, and his first kiss. Then Ezra stepped back without ever acknowledging that anything happened between them and Emery left town. But now Ezra is free to tell Emery the secret that kept them apart—the town is steeped in magic, the old families are witches, and some of them, like Ezra, are a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid gray skies, falling leaves, and the paper cutouts of skeletons that decorate the town in anticipation of Halloween, Ezra is going to woo Emery back to the land of the living. If anyone can convince Emery that he is wanted, that Ezra still loves him, and that magic is real, it’s Ezra. Emery may be stubborn, but he is about to discover that nothing is more certain than Ezra.</description>

  <description>Life hasn't been easy for Matthew O'Connor lately. He's an only child and struggling to deal with his mother's Alzheimer's, as he prepares to move back to Sydney to assist with her care. Visiting her on Christmas Day brings all his worries to the surface. What if she lashes out? What if she doesn't remember him at all? However, what starts out as an emotional day fraught with concern, turns into the day of Matthew's dreams, thanks to his boyfriend, Jerry, and a special gift from his mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a FREE short story to celebrate the holiday season.

  <description>When Jacob meets Celyn he hates him on sight. Too disrespectful and gaudy. Too different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even the grumpiest of wood carvers will find it impossible not to be won over by Mr. Sparkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe even fall in glittery love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This will be a free story as part of the Rainbow Advent Calendar 2018&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>(Previously published in the Hockey Holidays Anthology) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being the new man in the crease can be tough. Mitch Adams, former back-up for the Cougars is now the main man in goal, replacing August Miles, who was recently called up to the pros. There are lots of new things happening in Mitch’s life and not everything is because of hockey. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, he shared an explosive kiss with his childhood friend, Olympic snowboarder, Shaun Sandbeck. Since then, Mitch has been more than a little confused about a multitude of things pertaining to who he is, his sexuality, and the fact that he can’t stop thinking about that kiss and how he wants more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Mitch, going home for Christmas is a chance to find his focus and face the man who caused all this confusion. Is it possible for the two men to untangle lust from love, and find a future together that works? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Ben has Christmas, cats, and mistletoe on his side…. Jason doesn’t stand a chance &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Ben Slater, moving back to Bristol means being closer to his family, living with his best mate, and volunteering at the local animal shelter. But there’s also Jason, his best mate’s eldest brother. Ben’s had a crush on Jason for as long as he can remember, but the eleven-year age gap has always seemed insurmountable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jason Armitage works as a vet at his uncle’s practice. He owns a cute cottage on the outskirts of the city, and a loving dog. The one thing missing is someone to share it all with. His brother’s best friend seems a bad choice, but Jason can’t help taking a second look. Ben’s changed a lot since Jason last saw him; both in appearance and attitude. Gone is the shy young boy, replaced with a confident, twenty-four-year-old man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the run up to Christmas, the festive period gives Ben the ideal opportunity to show Jason what he has to offer. But concerns for his brother’s feelings hold Jason back. If they have any chance of making this work, Ben must convince Jason that he’s old enough to know what he wants, and Jason needs to believe that a relationship with his brother’s best friend won’t ruin their friendship. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Approx 48000 words</description>

  &lt;b&gt;FROM CATHERINE CURZON AND ELEANOR HARKSTEAD&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Captivating Captains story&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;For a lonely Cornish lifeboatman and an author who’s more used to crime scenes than love scenes, this Christmas is going to be very merry indeed!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jago Treherne agrees to man the Polneath lifeboats one snowy Christmas, he knows he can forget turkey and all the trimmings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when he boards a seemingly empty yacht and stumbles upon sexy Sam Coryton enjoying an energetic afternoon below decks, Jago soon realizes that he might be unwrapping a very different sort of Christmas gift this year!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The legendary ghosts of Christmas—Past, Present, and Future—failed to cure Evan Eazer of his misanthropy. He hates people, loves conflict, and has a swearing habit to boot. Phil, the Ghost of Imaginary Time couldn’t be more thrilled. Finally, it’s his turn to get off the bench and into the game. He’s sure he can cure Evan and earn back his place in the giving-people-Christmas-epiphanies rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan won’t reform easy. He’s immune to Phil’s many charms and seems content to live out the rest of his life bitter and alone. Worse, Phil’s time on the bench has left him ignorant to the ways of humanity. He struggles to navigate the new world and find his place within it let alone help someone else find his way back on the right path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing Phil does understand about the strange world in which he finds himself is Evan and his pain. He knows what it’s like to be misunderstood by pretty much everyone. But can he get Evan to understand him, too?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Logan Maxwell, a winger for the Burlington Dragons, is stuck in Dallas and missing Christmas with his family. There's no snow in this damn city, he's lonely, and he can't even remember the last time he hooked up with a guy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending his precious Christmas break with the other single players on the team could be great, he guessed, but for one thing; Archie Simard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lusting after the brother of your team captain is the worst idea in the history of bad ideas, Logan knows that. But when fate throws him and the temptation that is Archie together, it’s hard not to fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;This story was previously published in the Hockey Holiday Anthology&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Jonah Beecham is a down on his luck cowboy, stuck in Vegas with no money, no job, no friends, and Christmas rapidly approaching. Although he’d been promised a job as a bullfighter, the job falls through, and he’ll be sleeping in his truck for Christmas. In a fit of desperation, he drops a coin in an old-fashioned slot machine and wins enough to put gas in his truck… plus a little something extra. Rather than press his luck, he decides to leave the casino, but the universe isn’t done with him yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zach Evans is a television writer from Los Angeles who loves all things cowboy. He’s in Las Vegas to do some research at an end of year rodeo event. Too wary to approach any of the sexy cowboys he sees, he finally takes a chance when he bumps into Jonah. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spending the next week in Zach’s bed might seem like Jonah’s luck has changed, but when Jonah realizes he’s falling for a man who lives in a city where none of his skills are employable, he’s got a choice to make. Fear of the unknown will cost him Zach, but accepting that the universe has more luck in store for him might be more than he can handle.</description>

  <description>Matthew Blick is almost thirty years old, and he hates the thought of another holiday alone. He has become a bit of a wet blanket when Christmas rolls around every year. So much so that even his five-year-old niece, Hannah, knows something needs to change. She asks the department store Santa to bring her uncle a man to love, and when Santa sees her uncle, he formulates a plan to set that possibility in motion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Santa shows up at Matthew’s house and at first Matthew can’t place him, but then the memories of his first kiss flood his mind and he is shocked to find that Santa is the man he has carried a torch for since high school. Will this twist of fate help Matthew change his view on the holidays? Only a kiss can tell.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Story from the &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/130077.Warmest_Wishes_Dreamspinner_Press_2018_Advent_Calendar" rel="nofollow"&gt;Warmest Wishes: Dreamspinner Press 2018 Advent Calendar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonah Walsh’s fledgling acting career in Dublin comes to an abrupt end when a video of him in a compromising position goes viral on social media. The offer of a part in a Christmas play in Sydney, Australia arrives at exactly the right time, although he isn’t sure about celebrating Christmas in the scorching heat. Nick Claseman isn’t happy that the actor he and his sister have hired will be occupying his granny flat. As for Jonah’s enthusiasm for Christmas, Nick doesn’t get it. He hasn’t decorated or celebrated in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jonah turns out to be anything but a stuck-up starlet with delusions of grandeur, and Nick proves he’s not usually grumpy and borderline hostile, the two men gravitate toward each other. Their attraction morphs into something more when Jonah reacquaints Nick with the pleasures of Christmas and Nick shows Jonah the beauty of Australia. But Jonah is only Down Under for a few months. It would take a Christmas miracle for them to have a future together.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Life in a college town suits Josh Cassidy. He has good friends and neighbors, and the bookshop café he runs with his family is thriving. As the winter holidays begin, Josh finds himself enamored with police officer, Alex Curiel, an old friend who has recently moved back to town. The trouble is, Alex isn’t ready for the world to know he’s attracted to men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Alex’s request, Josh agrees to closet their relationship, but the secrecy quickly becomes a burden. When Josh realizes he is falling for Alex, he has more and more trouble denying his feelings. Soon, both men are forced to decide if hiding behind closed doors is the kind of future they’re looking for.</description>

  <description>Benny Fuller is on his way to rock bottom. He’s seventeen, fresh out of juvie, homeless, and desperate to find a job. His dad’s in jail and his drug-addicted mom is in no shape to take care of his sick sister, Angel. A run-in with his ex-boyfriend, Scott Sullivan, makes Benny feel even worse. He’s a thief with no future. Scott is smart, with plans for college and a great future ahead of him. Benny knows Scott can do so much better than him. Because no matter how hard Benny tries, he can’t seem to find a job or a way to take care of Angel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The further Benny falls, the more he needs Scott’s help. Benny will have to let go of his pride and trust Scott and the Sullivan family in order to get the Christmas miracle Benny and Angel so desperately need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader Advisory: This is an older (15+) YA story with themes of homelessness, drug use and prostitution (off-page), neglect of minors, and foster care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People hurried past Benny Fuller without seeing him. They were bundled up warmly against the snow, clutching their holiday shopping bags and packages. They were too intent on their destination to see the kid they pushed past. Now that the sun was going down, the crowds were beginning to thin. The wind picked up and the fat, fluffy snowflakes grew smaller and sharper. They stung his cheeks and made his hands ache. It had been early spring when he went into juvie. He’d had a hat stuffed in his old, beat up Army-style jacket but no gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the caseworker picked him up at the juvenile detention center and drove him to a foster home, she frowned at his bare hands. She said something about making sure he had a pair of gloves—and a warmer coat and boots—but she got a phone call a few minutes later and apparently forgot. He hadn’t said anything to the foster care lady about it either. So now the slushy snow soaked into his shoes as he walked and he still had no gloves or winter coat. He’d have to make do. But that was nothing new for him, was it? Benny had been doing that for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He kicked at a piece of torn, soggy cardboard on the sidewalk as he passed it. It did nothing to relieve the gnawing hunger in his stomach or the cold air that crept down the collar of his jacket and numbed his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was satisfying though. Something to do to let out all of the frustration and fear boiling inside of him. His job search had amounted to nothing. Everything amounted to nothing. There were no opportunities for kids like him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’d been wandering the city for a week. Ever since he left the foster home they placed him in. It hadn’t seemed bad at first. It was clean and there were only two other kids there, both younger. But one of them was a nightmare. Benny had never seen anything like it. The boy screamed and tried to hit the little girl all the time. The foster mother did nothing to stop it. The little girl had bruises on her arms and legs from the boy and it made Benny sick to watch it happen. Within the first day Benny was there, the boy bit Benny hard enough to draw blood, but Benny was the one who got yelled at by the foster mother for provoking him. Benny hadn’t done anything but sit down next to the kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny had tried to help out, thinking maybe the woman was just overwhelmed, but she yelled at him for interfering. The day after he got there, the little girl had to go to the doctor for pinkeye. Benny was left home with the boy. It was a nightmare. After the boy screamed and hit him and acted like a little monster all day, Benny couldn’t handle it anymore. As soon as the woman got home with the girl, Benny crawled out the bedroom window and left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He went straight to his childhood home, even though there was no one there waiting for him. He collected his car and a few belongings, but he knew he couldn’t stay or Child Protective Services would just drag him out of there and back to a foster home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once he left his old house, he had nowhere else to go. He had a car though, thankfully. It had sat, unused, while he was in juvie. It was still registered, thankfully, although the insurance on it had lapsed. He’d have to hope he didn’t get pulled over, or he’d be in big trouble.&lt;br /&gt;With no home and no job, what else could he do now but wander? Sit in his car and feel sorry for himself? Even if he wanted to, he didn’t have any money for gas so he couldn’t do it for long. He tried to run the engine as little as possible. Just enough to keep himself from freezing to death. At least when he was up and walking, his blood was flowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wasn’t warm, but at least he wasn’t dead. That was something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up ahead, a brightly-lit storefront spilled yellow light onto the snowy sidewalk. Its warmth beckoned Benny to come closer, but as he approached, he recognized the building and scowled. Sullivan’s Fine Gifts, the sign on the window read. Damn it. His wandering had taken him to the last place he should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stupid. Why did I come here? He wondered. It wasn’t like he could go in and see Scott Sullivan. God, he wanted to though. Scott was the only person Benny had ever trusted. The only one who really knew him. Scott was the best thing that had ever happened to Benny. Too bad Benny was the worst thing that had ever happened to Scott.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benny stood in front of the gift shop long enough for the snowflakes to settle on his too-thin jacket. His breath fogged the window and cold and hunger faded away as he stared into the store owned by his ex-boyfriend’s parents, mesmerized by the cheerful lights and decorations. It advertised home and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warmth. Security. Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the things Benny didn’t have.</description>

  <description>Seb and Jamie argue over most things, even in the season of presumed good will. When a totally unsuitable “Secret Santa” present for each of them causes even more tension, the hostility threatens to ruin the pleasant Christmas meal they had planned with friends. But there are strange forces at work tonight and both of them seem to be acting out of character. They find they’re working together in the kitchen, sharing confidences, and admitting to feelings they never dared before – and cooking up something rather more exciting than food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the author's anthology "Boys in Season" and previously published by MLR and Eternal Press.</description>

  <description>A Christmas M/M Story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Jackson always knew that class 2C’s help in preparing for the annual Christmas Fair would be a mixed blessing. Then he’s paired up on the Lucky Dip with Greg, the man who dumped him but now can’t keep away, the pupils are either lecturing him on his lovelife or losing bladder control, and no one’s fixed the broken handle on the storage room. It may all be one whoopee cushion too far for him! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Previously published in the 2011 anthology 'Winter Warmers'.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

With Christmas fast approaching, Cody is desperate to avoid reminders of his recent disastrous breakup, and a few weeks of sun and relaxation sound perfect—until a drunk (but very cute) superhero crashes the party by literally crashing onto the beach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that’s just the start of Cody’s problems—angry shark-men, mysterious lava creatures, and a malfunctioning AI all make his holiday getaway anything but relaxing. Amid the chaos of his adventures in lair-sitting, though, Cody might find just what he needs—a new chance at love. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Excited to celebrate his first Christmas with his true love, Phin Abernathy searches for the perfect gift for Teddy, the artist who saved him from solitude (The Artist). But his happy holiday dreams are soon threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of living on his own, then with his beloved partner, Phin has mostly banished his negative view of himself. He and Teddy are happily saving toward a house they can share, when a chance encounter with a stranger raises Phin’s old ghosts of doubt, anxiety, and low self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to quell such negative spirits, Phin focuses on volunteering at a children’s shelter. But when he sees his Teddy and handsome Justin Crump (The Medium) in a suspicious situation, it is difficult to control his racing thoughts. Belief in Teddy’s love for him wars with Phin’s fear his lover wants something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phin must decide how far he is willing to go to keep Teddy in his life, and truly embrace his own worth before he can ever celebrate the season.</description>

  <description>Prince Raphael, the youngest son of the Montaunoit royal family, is the custodian of his country's history. At a Sotheby's auction, he outbids Marc on an item he doesn't even want. Just because he can. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meeting the museum curator turns Raphael's world upside down, and when lust turns to love he knows he has to change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Marc be the one to show Raphael that he doesn't have to stay the lonely prince forever, and that love is always an option? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******* &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story is one of seven stories which can all be read and enjoyed in any order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1750, a master woodcarver poured all his unrequited love, passion, and longing into his masterpiece—a gorgeous Christmas angel for his beloved’s tree. When the man he loved tossed the angel away without a second thought, a miracle happened. The angel was found by another who brought the woodcarver True Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, the angel has been passed down, sold, lost and found, but its magic remains. Read the romances inspired by (and perhaps nudged along by) the Christmas Angel through the years. Whether it’s the 1880’s New York (Kim Fielding), the turn-of-the-century (Jordan L. Hawk), post World War II (L.A. Witt), Vietnam-era (N.R. Walker), the 1990’s (Anyta Sunday), 2018 Europe (RJ Scott), the Christmas Angel has a way of landing on the trees of lonely men who need it’s blessing for a very Merry Christmas and forever HEA.</description>

      <![CDATA[Christmas Prince by RJ Scott is not only a wonderful concluding entry in the amazing multi-author series The Christmas Angel, but it is an incredible tale that is better than any Hallmark holiday film I've seen in many years.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Pax Polo is the swashbuckling guitarist for Serenity Free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correction: &lt;i&gt;Was&lt;/i&gt; the swashbuckling guitarist for Serenity Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he sports a black eye and his bros have kicked him out of their band—three weeks before Christmas. It’s an unfamiliar kick to his over-inflated ego, but . . . whatever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to some stellar eavesdropping, an unexpected angel ornament, and a bribe to open for his favorite band ever, Pax will weasel his way back into his mates’ good graces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he has to do is friend Clifford, the neighborhood man-shrew, for the summer. Distract him a bit so Clifford’s younger sister can sneak around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like a piece of beginners Beethoven. Jolly good fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Easy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, Pax totally knows how to friend people. He has heaps of friends. This shrew’s no match for his shrewd ways. Or is he?</description>

  <description>The year is 1969…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gary Fairchild is proud to be a hippie college student, and he protests the Vietnam War because he believes in love and peace. To him, it isn’t just a counterculture movement—it’s a way of life. When tickets to the Aquarium Exposition—3 Days of Peace &amp;amp; Music, or Woodstock, as it was better known, go on sale, there’s no way he isn’t going.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Richard Ronsman is a sheltered farm boy who lives in the shadow of his overbearing father. He’s hidden his darkest secret to earn his father’s love, but nothing is ever good enough—not even volunteering for the Vietnam War. And with just a few days left before he’s deployed, a striking hippie invites him to join them at a music festival.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three days of music, drugs, rain, mud, and love forged a bond between these two very different men that would shape the rest of their lives. They share dreams and fears, and when Richard is shipped off to war, they share letters and love. For Richard’s first Christmas home, he is gifted a special angel ornament that just might make a soldier’s wish come true.</description>

  <description>August 1939. Roger Miller and Jack O’Brien have been close since childhood. By the time they realize there’s more between them than friendship, Jack is leaving their sleepy Iowa town for college. But they console themselves knowing he’ll be home for Christmas. Right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Christmas before they see each other again, but that Christmas comes six years and a world war later. Aged, beaten, and shaken by combat, they’re not the boys they were back then, but their feelings for each other are stronger than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither know the words to say everything they’ve carried since that peacetime summer kiss, though. Even as they stand in the same room, there’s a thousand miles between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe that’s some distance the little angel in Roger’s rucksack can cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christmas Angel series books are standalones and can be read in any order.</description>

  <description>Vaudeville stage magician Christopher Fiend lives for the spotlight. His chance at big time stardom awaits him in Chicago, the next stop on the circuit after the little town of Twelfth Junction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Smith wants nothing to do with his family's theater. Until Christopher catches his eye on opening night, then treats him to a very special performance during intermission. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a dead body turns up in the middle of Christopher’s act, suspicion immediately falls on him. If Christopher and Edward can’t work together to clear his name, Christopher won’t make it to Chicago in time. Edward knows he shouldn’t get attached to a man who will be gone in two days, but his heart—and a very special angel—have other ideas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Christmas Angel series of holiday romances follow the travels of an angel ornament through the decades as she inspires (and sometimes nudges) lonely men to find their Happily Ever After. The Magician’s Angel is the third in series, which can be read in any order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1750, a master woodcarver poured all his unrequited love, passion, and longing into his masterpiece—a gorgeous Christmas angel for his beloved’s tree. When the man he loved tossed the angel away without a second thought, a miracle happened. The angel was found by another who brought the woodcarver True Love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, the angel has been passed down, sold, lost and found, but its magic remains. Read the romances inspired by (and perhaps nudged along by) the Christmas Angel through the years. Whether it’s the 1880’s New York (Kim Fielding), 1910 Iowa (Jordan L. Hawk), post World War II (L.A. Witt), Vietnam-era (N.R. Walker), the 1990’s (Anyta Sunday), 2018 Europe (RJ Scott), the Christmas Angel has a way of landing on the trees of lonely men who need its blessing for a very Merry Christmas and forever HEA.</description>

  <description>After the hard winter of 1888 ended Alby Boyle’s work as a Nebraska ranch hand, he returned to New York City in search of his long-lost family. His mother and brothers are nowhere to be found, however, and after Alby’s years of absence, Five Corners no longer feels like home. His prospects seem as dim as the nighttime alleys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alby pauses to admire an angel ornament in a department store window’s Christmas display, he meets Xeno Varnham-Summerfield. Wealthy, handsome, and enthusiastic, Xeno brings Alby some temporary cheer. But for Alby to achieve his dreams of love and a real home, well, that may take a bit of holiday magic.</description>

  <description>When John Trent, a dedicated member of the new Bow Street Runners, finds an exquisite carved angel floating in the Thames, he can’t stop thinking about it. He tracks down its creator, a sad and quiet young sculptor. But neither the angel nor the sculptor is done with John just yet. The blasted angel refuses to leave him be, behaving not at all like an inanimate object should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alec Allston is resigned to the fact that his love will ever be a river that flows out and never flows in. All he wanted to do was create a special gift so that a small part of himself could be with his unattainable and noble beloved, always. But when the gift keeps showing back up at his shop in the hands of a windblown and rugged thief-taker, Alec will need to reconsider his conviction that love is destined to remain an aethereal ideal.</description>

  <description>Hiring a boyfriend for Christmas; what can go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek is facing yet another Christmas where his life feels out of control. He has a new career that doesn’t feel like his, and parents who would just love to see him settled down. All he needs is a temporary buffer for the parties he has to attend, and for his parents to leave him alone. Enter, Luke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke is twenty-thousand dollars short for the renovations on Halligans; his family’s bar in New York’s Financial District. A favor for a buddy has him agreeing to play the part of boyfriend to a guy with more money than sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the spirit of Christmas works its magic on the two men, and they begin to fall for each other, Derek runs scared, and Luke needs space.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t matter what obstacles you throw in the way of love, or how much you run in the other direction, because, when you’re least expecting it, whether you want it or not, love happens anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening Time: 3 hrs., 42 min.</description>

  <description>A product of his past, Black spends half his time saving lives and the other half taking them. Every day, a hard choice must be made and he’s the man to make it. Long ago, he vowed to never love again; one-night stands with a willing body was all he ever needed. But along came Quill, and Black’s life is irrevocably changed. He never expects something as simple as Quill’s persistence to alter the way he not only sees the world, but how he lives it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quill has bad taste in men and equally horrible luck. Growing up wasn’t easy, surviving is even harder. When his past and present collide, he’s convinced he’ll finally witness his own destruction. But when an unlikely antihero steps in to protect him, his life is turned on its head. He’s spent months flirting with the man of his dreams and hoping he’d take notice. But it turns out, being on Black’s radar isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and his idea of protection varies greatly from Quill’s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unknowingly sharing the same goal—burying their own pasts deeper than the fires of hell can reach—they’re both unaware that jumping into that fire will do more than ignite their feelings, it could lead to their own demise. Will Black and Quill be consumed by the flames, or from these ashes, will they find their own happily ever after? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Justin isn't a fan of Christmas (or holidays in general) at the best of times. But now his long-term boyfriend has broken up with him, and he's even more gloomy than usual. The hot and unfortunately straight Felix, his partner on the force, keeps trying to help. It's really not working until Christmas Day arrives, and brings with it an unexpected gift... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;9,300 words &lt;br /&gt;(friends to lovers, buddy cops, sweet gay romance, holiday)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought I was about as excited as I'd ever been for the most wonderful time of the year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When else would my partner and I get to chase down a robber dressed as Santa? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was awesome, one for the scrapbook. Vaughn and Santiago taking down a Santa. Felix flying after the guy on foot, me jerking ahead with the car, sirens on, to cut him off. The guy veered, but we knew this town. This was our beat, our patch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Felix followed without missing a step, and I navigated alleys with quick precision to cut him off at the pass. I could drive when I needed to. The Santa bandit couldn't get by us, not when we were working together. We were in the zone. I cut the sirens so I wouldn't give him any warnings. We'd already called it in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I jerked to a stop at the end of the alleyway just as Santa-thief zoomed out at top speed and slammed up against the passenger side window, where I normally sat. I swear he squeaked against it as he slid down a few inches, and where was Felix? He should be cuffing the guy right now. I waited a second, then flung myself out of the car, grabbing for my cuffs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Freeze!" I told him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn't see Felix.</description>

  <description>Can Connor show River a real family Christmas? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Connor finds River on the roof of the campus admin building, he doesn’t know what to do. His friend is drunk, and shouting into a snowstorm, a bottle of vodka in his hand. The easy part is getting River down; the hard part is insisting River comes home with Connor for Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River doesn’t have a family, or any place outside of college that he calls home. Not that it matters to him; he’s happy being alone for Christmas in his budget motel, watching reruns of Elf. Only, Connor keeps telling wildly improbable stories of the perfect family celebrations at his parents’ ranch in Texas, and it’s wearing River down. He didn’t ask to be kidnapped. He didn’t want to fall in love with the entire Campbell-Hayes family. But he does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one Christmas to the next. This is Connor’s year to rescue River, and himself, for them both to mess things up, make things right, fall in lust and finally, for Connor to show the man he loves what being part of a family can mean.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mall Santas aren’t supposed to be hot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter Adams is hopelessly adrift after college. He’s still a virgin, can’t find a real job, and has no clue what to do with his life. In desperation, he returns to his humiliating old job as an elf at the Santa's Village in his hometown's dying mall. The Santa on the job is an unexpectedly sexy lumberjack, twice Hunter's size and age. He makes Hunter feel very naughty—too bad he's grumpy and intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years after the tragic death of his partner, Nick Spini has his beagle and long, hard days on his Christmas tree farm. That’s plenty. But he can’t refuse a loyal friend’s plea for help and finds himself filling in as Santa at the local mall. Despite Nick's attempt to stay aloof, the beautiful, anxious young man playing elf brings out his long-dormant daddy instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a surprise blizzard traps them alone in Nick’s isolated forest home, their attraction burns even brighter. Will they surrender to the sizzling connection between them and find the release and comfort they crave? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Santa Daddy&lt;/i&gt; is a holiday gay romance from Keira Andrews featuring an age gap, steamy m/m first times, daddy role-playing and light spanking, Christmas romance feels, and of course a happy ending.</description>

  <description>Tennant Rowe has it all, a boyfriend he adores, a loving family, and a career on the rise. He’s sure of his place in the world, and the future can only get brighter. Then one night, in a flash of skates and sticks, life changes forever. Getting back on the ice is Ten’s priority, and experts tell him that it’s just a matter of time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jared watches his lover fall in more ways than one, and when tragedy strikes, even the strongest of relationships are tested. Ten is strong, but Jared has to be stronger to help the man who holds his heart. Only, he has to admit that maybe it isn’t just him who can make Ten whole again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jared and Ten’s love is forever, but the rocky path to the romantic Christmas Jared had planned may be hard to travel.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Casper Silverbell is a grumpity elf, and with good reason. As an accountant at the North Pole, he gets no respect from most of the creative elves who don't see his job as important. The only joys in his life are his pet polar bears, his love of fine tailoring, and his monthly spats with the head of Gift Development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did he say joy? He meant to say annoyance. Dmitri Hollyberry is everything Casper resents about creative elves, wrapped up in one green-haired, tattooed package. Dmitri never gets his expense reports in on time, and seems to delight in making Casper lose his temper. He's also smart, talented, and just different enough from the other elves that Casper had once wished Dmitri would be the one to ease his loneliness. But obviously, that's impossible. No matter how good Casper is, that is one Christmas wish he doesn't expect to come true.</description>

  <description>NOTE: This story was previously published as a two-volume serial under the titles of “Connection” and “Trust”. Minor updates have been made but the story is essentially unchanged. This is a re-release.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Scars run deep but run loves even deeper.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Forced out of the closet and the only home he’s ever known, twenty-year-old Evan Harris is left jobless and homeless. A desperate phone call to virtual strangers gives him a temporary place to stay in Atlanta. But he feels completely unprepared for the big city and too shy to go after what he wants: a relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physically and emotionally scarred from a devastating car accident, thirty-six-year-old Jeremy Lewis struggles to reconcile the popular, outgoing man he used to be with the recluse he’s become. Resigned to being alone, he’s unprepared for the changes Evan brings to his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loneliness draws them together, but it isn’t enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan must overcome his insecurities and become the man he’s always dreamed of being. Jeremy must battle PTSD and allow someone to get close enough to see his scars. Or else they’ll both miss out on the love of a lifetime.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Two clashing colleagues stuck together for Christmas--will opposites eventually attract?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick has been single since he broke up with his cheating ex almost a year ago. With Christmas looming, he's resigned to spending it alone with only memories of happier times for company. When a business trip with a co-worker leaves them stranded in the Lake District due to heavy snow, it seems Patrick will have company for Christmas after all. It's a shame his companion is Kyle, who's undeniably attractive, but annoying as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aware of Patrick's reluctant admiration, Kyle basks in the attention even though Patrick isn't the type of man he normally goes for. Averse to relationships after being hurt in the past, Kyle enjoys the occasional hook up, but has given up on seeking anything more meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuck together, their antagonism escalates along with a heavy dose of sexual tension until it finally ignites. What starts as a Christmas fling soon feels like something special; but will their tentative connection melt away as the snow thaws? If they're going to take a chance on finding happiness together, they'll have to put their differences aside and learn to trust one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains: enemies-to-lovers, snowball fights, bickering, spanking, a cute dog, a wise old lady, mistletoe, and a happy ending (of course).</description>

  <description>As war rages in France, battles are also being fought on the Home Front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bethan Harrhy, farmer's wife, does her best to keep her family happy as prices rise and the weather worsens. Nye, her husband, is angry and worried. Alwyn, her brother, is injured and shaken by his experiences in the trenches. Her baby is teething and there's another on the way. Surely having her brother's best friend to stay, another face, another voice, another pair of hands, can only be a good thing? But when Joe arrives, Bethan is forced to confront ideas she had never even guessed at and makes a terrible mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With conflict at home and abroad, can there be a happy ending for any of them?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; When will She open Rebecca Northcote’s box? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding lost poodles and retrieving stolen baubles is not how DI Tim Stoker envisioned his partnership with his lover, Hieronymus Bash. So when the police commissioner's son goes missing, he's determined to help, no matter what secrets he has to keep, or from whom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a family member is kidnapped, Hiero moves heaven and earth to rescue them. Even if that means infiltrating the Daughters of Eden, a cult of wealthy widows devoted to the teachings of Rebecca Northcote and the mysterious contents of her box. The Daughters' goodwill toward London's fallen women has given them a saintly reputation, but Hiero has a nose for sniffing out a fraud. He will need to draw on some divine inspiration to rattle the pious Daughters.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Like weeds gnarling the roots of Eden's fabled tree, Tim and Hiero's cases intertwine. Serpents, secrets, and echoes from Hiero's past lurk behind every branch. Giving in to temptation could bind them closer together—or sever their partnership forever. &lt;/i&gt;</description>
