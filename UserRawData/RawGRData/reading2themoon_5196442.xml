  <description>An unexpected offer threatens the bond between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi as the two Jedi navigate a dangerous new planet and an uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Jedi must be a fearless warrior, a guardian of justice, and a scholar in the ways of the Force. But perhaps a Jedi's most essential duty is to pass on what they have learned. Master Yoda trained Dooku; Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn; and now Qui-Gon has a Padawan of his own. But while Qui-Gon has faced all manner of threats and danger as a Jedi, nothing has ever scared him like the thought of failing his apprentice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi has deep respect for his Master, but struggles to understand him. Why must Qui-Gon so often disregard the laws that bind the Jedi? Why is Qui-Gon drawn to ancient Jedi prophecies instead of more practical concerns? And why wasn't Obi-Wan told that Qui-Gon is considering an invitation to join the Jedi Council—knowing it would mean the end of their partnership? The simple answer scares him: Obi-Wan has failed his Master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jedi Rael Averross, another former student of Dooku, requests their assistance with a political dispute, Jinn and Kenobi travel to the royal court of Pijal for what may be their final mission together. What should be a simple assignment quickly becomes clouded by deceit, and by visions of violent disaster that take hold in Qui-Gon's mind. As Qui-Gon's faith in prophecy grows, Obi-Wan's faith in him is tested—just as a threat surfaces that will demand that Master and apprentice come together as never before, or be divided forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's a soldier&lt;/b&gt; - Noemi Vidal is willing to risk anything to protect her planet, Genesis, including her own life. To their enemies on Earth, she's a rebel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He's a machine&lt;/b&gt; - Abandoned in space for years, utterly alone, Abel's advanced programming has begun to evolve. He wants only to protect his creator, and to be free. To the people of Genesis, he's an abomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noemi and Abel are enemies in an interstellar war, forced by chance to work together as they embark on a daring journey through the stars. Their efforts would end the fighting for good, but they're not without sacrifice. The stakes are even higher than either of them first realized, and the more time they spend together, the more they're forced to question everything they'd been taught was true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-paced, romantic, and captivating, &lt;i&gt;Defy The Stars&lt;/i&gt; is a story about what it means to be human, about deciding what you truly believe in, and about finding your place in a dangerous world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Witness the birth of the Resistance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Rebellion defeated the Empire in the skies above Endor, Leia Organa believed it was the beginning to a lasting peace. But after decades of vicious infighting and partisan gridlock in the New Republic Senate, that hope seems like a distant memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a respected senator, Leia must grapple with the dangers that threaten to cripple the fledgling democracy—from both within and without. Underworld kingpins, treacherous politicians, and Imperial loyalists are sowing chaos in the galaxy. Desperate to take action, senators are calling for the election of a First Senator. It is their hope that this influential post will bring strong leadership to a divided galaxy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the daughter of Darth Vader, Leia faces with distrust the prospect of any one person holding such a powerful position—even when supporters suggest Leia herself for the job. But a new enemy may make this path Leia’s only option. For at the edges of the galaxy, a mysterious threat is growing...</description>

  <description>Marguerite Caine's physicist parents are known for their groundbreaking achievements. Their most astonishing invention, called the Firebird, allows users to jump into multiple universes—and promises to revolutionize science forever. But then Marguerite's father is murdered, and the killer—her parent's handsome, enigmatic assistant Paul— escapes into another dimension before the law can touch him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marguerite refuses to let the man who destroyed her family go free. So she races after Paul through different universes, always leaping into another version of herself. But she also meets alternate versions of the people she knows—including Paul, whose life entangles with hers in increasingly familiar ways. Before long she begins to question Paul's guilt—as well as her own heart. And soon she discovers the truth behind her father's death is far more sinister than she expected.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The heroes of the Resistance must fight back fro the edge of the oblivion in this pivotal prequel to &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Resistance is in ruins. In the wake of their harrowing escape from Crait, what was once an army has been reduced to a handful of wounded heroes. Finn, Poe, Rey, Rose, Chewbacca, Leia Organa -- their names are famous among the oppressed worlds they fight to liberate. But names can only get you so far, and Leia's last desperate call for aid has gone unanswered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From jungles of Ryloth to the shipyards of Corellia, the shadow of the First Order looms large, and those with the bravery to face the darkness are scattered and isolated. If hope is to survive, the Resistance must journey throughout the galaxy, seeking out more leaders - including those who, in days gone by, helped a nascent rebellion tripple an empire. Battles will be fought, alliances will be forged, and the Resistance will be reborn.</description>

  <description>In this third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, now with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, they're plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their best hope lies with Cress, a girl imprisoned on a satellite since childhood who's only ever had her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, she's just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a higher price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only hope the world has.</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She’s trying to break out of prison—even though if she succeeds, she’ll be the Commonwealth’s most wanted fugitive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit’s grandmother is missing. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother’s whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her &lt;i&gt;prisoner&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;40 Years. 40 Stories. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of the 40th Anniversary of Star Wars: A New Hope, this unique anthology features Star Wars stories by bestselling authors, trendsetting artists, and treasured voices from Star Wars’ literary history. Over 40 authors have lent their unique vision to 40 “scenes,” each retelling a different moment from the original Star Wars film, but with a twist: every scene is told from the point of view of a seemingly minor character. Whether it’s the X-wing pilots who helped Luke destroy the Death Star or the stormtroopers who never did find the droids they were looking for, &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: From A Certain Point of View&lt;/i&gt; places the classic movie in a whole new perspective celebrates the influence and legacy of the unparalleled cultural phenomenon, &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contributors include: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Acker and Ben Blacker - Renee Ahdieh - Tom Angleberger - Meg Cabot - Rae Carson - Zoraida Cordova - Delilah S.

  <description>Ever since the debacle of the Chess Queen Enigma, Mina Holmes and Evaline Stoker have laid low, trying to settle back into their quiet lives as young ladies of London. But the Holmesian deductive abilities won't remain dormant for long, and when Mina receives a strange package from a winged, midnight visitor, she is catapulted into a new, dangerous adventure: the search for The Carnelian Crow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Evaline has received some very disturbing news--news that will change her life forever. Along with that unpleasant knowledge is the strange disappearance of her nemesis, the disreputable pickpocket Pix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes clear the arch-villainess the Ankh has made her next move, it will take all of Mina's Holmesian ingenuity and Evaline's courage and determination to stop the criminal from executing her boldest and most dangerous plan yet!</description>

      <![CDATA[While this book is lighter in plot than the first three in the series it sets up the 5th and final book nicely. There are some interesting twists and reveals that the previous books have been leading up to. Overall a solid 4.5]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;And then she mouthed a word at me—an unmistakable word that told me everything I needed to know. “Checkmate.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evaline Stoker &amp;amp; Mina Holmes have reluctantly agreed to act as social chaperones and undercover bodyguards for Princess Lurelia of Betrovia, who has arrived in London to deliver a letter that details the secret location of an ancient chess queen that’s been missing for centuries. But when the letter—which will heal a centuries-old rift between England and the Betrovians—is stolen out from under Evaline and Mina’s watchful eyes, the two girls are forced into a high-stakes race to ensure they find the chess queen before anyone else does…including their foe, the Ankh. For the chess queen is not only a historic symbol of a woman’s political power, but it has literal power as well—the queen will unlock the chessboard, revealing both treasures and ancient secrets the Ankh would kill to possess. It will take Mina’s smarts and Evaline’s strength to beat the thief and untangle this mystery before it is too late.</description>

  <description>After the Affair of the Clockwork Scarab, Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes are eager to help Princess Alix with a new case. Seventeen-year-old Willa Aston is obsessed with spiritual mediums, convinced she is speaking with her mother from beyond the grave. What seems like a case of spiritualist fraud quickly devolves into something far more menacing: someone is trying to make Willa "appear lunatic," using an innocent-looking spiritglass to control her. The list of clues piles up: an unexpected murder, a gang of pickpockets, and the return of vampires to London. But are these events connected? As Uncle Sherlock would say, "there are no coincidences." It will take all of Mina's wit and Evaline's muscle to keep London's sinister underground at bay.</description>

  <description>Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes never meant to get into the family business. But when you’re the sister of Bram and the niece of Sherlock, vampire hunting and mystery solving are in your blood. And when two society girls go missing, there’s no one more qualified to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fierce Evaline and logical Mina must resolve their rivalry, navigate the advances of not just one but three mysterious gentlemen, and solve murder with only one clue: a strange Egyptian scarab. The stakes are high. If Stoker and Holmes don’t unravel why the belles of London society are in such danger, they’ll become the next victims.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times Bestseller. Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA’s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America’s space program. Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as ‘Human Computers’, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these ‘coloured computers’ used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets and astronauts, into space. Moving from World War II through NASA’s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War and the women’s rights movement, ‘Hidden Figures’ interweaves a rich history of mankind’s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years after the fall of the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire now reigns over the known galaxy. Resistance to the Empire has been all but silenced. Only a few courageous leaders such as Bail Organa of Alderaan still dare to openly oppose Emperor Palpatine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of defiance, the many worlds at the edge of the Outer Rim have surrendered. With each planet’s conquest, the Empire’s might grows stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest to fall under the Emperor’s control is the isolated mountain planet Jelucan, whose citizens hope for a more prosperous future even as the Imperial Starfleet gathers overhead…</description>

Finally, her story will begin to be told. Following her experiences with the Jedi and the devastation of Order 66, Ahsoka is unsure she can be part of a larger whole ever again.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He could never lose control...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dashiel Thorpe, Earl of Brimsworth, has spent his life fighting the wolf within him. But when the full moon rises, Dash is helpless. A chance encounter with Caitrin Macleod on a moonlit night inadvertently binds the two together irrevocably, and Dash's impulsiveness plunges them both into a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She never saw him coming...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caitrin Macleod is no quiet country lass, but a witch with remarkable abilities. But when it comes to Dashiel, she's as helpless to fight his true nature as he is. Her senses overwhelmed, she runs back to the safety and security of her native Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Dashiel is determined to follow her—she's the only woman who can free him from a fate worse than death. And Caitrin will ultimately have to decide whether she's running from danger, or true love.</description>

  <description>After years of playing the rake to hide a dark family secret, the Duke of Aversley feels tainted beyond redemption and cynical beyond repair. Never does he imagine hope will come in the form of a quirky, quick-witted lady determined to win the heart of another gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a painfully awkward past, Lady Amelia De Vere long ago relinquished the notion she was a flower that had yet to blossom. But when her family faces financial ruin and the man she has always loved is on the verge of marrying another, she’ll try anything to transform herself to capture her childhood love and save her family―including agreeing to participate in a bet between her brother and the notorious, dangerously handsome Duke Of Aversley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bound by the bet, Amelia and Aversley discover unexpected understanding and passion beyond their wildest dreams, if only they can let go of their pride, put trust in each other and chance losing their hearts.</description>

  <description>On the night of the Parkhurst ball, someone had a scandalous tryst in the library.&lt;br /&gt;• Was it Lord Canby, with the maid, on the divan?&lt;br /&gt;• Or Miss Fairchild, with a rake, against the wall?&lt;br /&gt;• Perhaps the butler did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Charlotte Highwood knows is this: it wasn’t her. But rumors to the contrary are buzzing. Unless she can discover the lovers’ true identity, she’ll be forced to marry Piers Brandon, Lord Granville—the coldest, most arrogantly handsome gentleman she’s ever had the misfortune to embrace. When it comes to emotion, the man hasn’t got a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as they set about finding the mystery lovers, Piers reveals a few secrets of his own. The oh-so-proper marquess can pick locks, land punches, tease with sly wit... and melt a woman’s knees with a single kiss. The only thing he guards more fiercely than Charlotte’s safety is the truth about his dark past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their passion is intense. The danger is real. Soon Charlotte’s feeling torn. Will she risk all to prove her innocence? Or surrender it to a man who’s sworn to never love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Beloved authors Julia Quinn, Elizabeth Boyle, Laura Lee Guhrke, and Stefanie Sloane deliver the stories of four friends from Madame Rochambeaux’s Gentle School for Girls who find an old sixpence in their bedchamber and decide that it will be the lucky coin for each of their weddings… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Something Old”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Quinn’s prologue introduces her heroine Beatrice Heywood and the premise for &lt;i&gt;Four Weddings and a Sixpence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Something New”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Stefanie Sloane’s unforgettable story, an ever-vigilant guardian decrees that Anne Brabourne must marry by her twenty-first birthday. But love finds her in the most unexpected of ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Something Borrowed”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Boyle tells the tale of Cordelia Padley, who has invented a betrothed to keep her family from pestering her to wed. Now she’ll need to borrow one to convince them she’s found her true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Something Blue”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Laura Lee Guhrke’s story, unlucky Lady Elinor Daventry has her sixpence stolen from her and must convince the rake who pilfered the coin to return it in time for her own wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“... and a Sixpence in Her Shoe”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Quinn finishes with the story of Beatrice Heywood, who never believed that the sixpence was anything but a tarnished old coin—until it led all of her friends to true love. But her faith in the coin is tested when it keeps sending her to the wrong man!</description>

  <description>From the # 1 New York Times and International bestselling author, Jennifer L. Armentrout writing as J.Lynn, comes a richly moving story about heartbreak and guilt, second chances and hope. Full of familiar, fan-favorite characters and no two people more deserving of a happy ending, Fire In You will burn bright beyond the last page…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian Lima’s whole world was destroyed in a span of a few hours. The same night her childhood love, Brock ‘the Beast’ Mitchell, broke her heart, her life was irrevocably altered by the hand of a stranger with a gun. It takes six years to slowly glue together the shattered pieces of her life, but Jillian is finally ready to stop existing in a past full of pain and regret. She takes a job at her father’s martial arts Academy and she’s going out on her first date since a failed relationship that was more yuck than yum. Jillian is determined to start living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just never expected Brock to be a part of her life again. But he’s firmly back in her life before she knows it, and not only is he older, he’s impossibly more handsome, more teasing and more everything. And when he sees Jillian, he’s no longer capable of thinking of her as the little girl who was his shadow growing up or the daughter of the man who gave him a second chance at life. He sees the woman who’d always been there for him, the one person who believed in him no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brock knows she’s the one he should’ve made his, and what begins as a tentative friendship quickly turns to red-hot chemistry that sparks a flame that burns brighter than lust. Falling for Brock again risks more than her heart, because when the past sorrow-filled and guilt-ridden past resurfaces, and a web of lies threatens to rip them apart, the fallout could lay waste to everything they’ve fought to build together, and destroy the dreams of those they care most about.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;In New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout’s gripping new novel, a young woman comes home to reclaim her life—even as a murderer plots to end it. . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Sasha Keaton left her West Virginia hometown . . . since she escaped the twisted serial killer known as the Groom. Returning to help run her family inn means being whole again, except for one missing piece. The piece that falls into place when Sasha’s threatened—and FBI agent Cole Landis vows to protect her the way he couldn’t a decade ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First one woman disappears; then another, and all the while, disturbing calling cards are left for the sole survivor of the Groom’s reign of terror. Cole’s never forgiven himself for not being there when Sasha was taken, but he intends to make up for it now . . . because under the quirky sexiness Cole first fell for is a steely strength that only makes him love Sasha more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But someone is watching. Waiting. And Sasha’s first mistake could be her last.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes life leaves a mark.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most days, Andrea doesn’t know whether she wants to kiss Tanner or punch him in the gut. He is seriously hot, with legit bedroom eyes and that firefighter body of his, but he’s a major player, and they can’t get along for more than a handful of minutes. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanner knows he and Andrea have had an epic love/hate relationship for as long as he can remember, but he wants more love than hate from her. He wants &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;. Now. Tomorrow. But the more he gets to know her, the more it becomes obvious that Andrea has a problem. She’s teetering on the edge, and every time he tries to catch her, she slips through his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrea’s life is spiraling out of control, and it doesn’t matter that Tanner wants to save her, because when everything falls apart and she’s speeding toward rock bottom, only she can save herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes life makes you work for that happily ever after…</description>

  <description>Things are about to get &lt;i&gt;Wicked&lt;/i&gt; in New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-two year old Ivy Morgan isn’t your average college student. She, and others like her, know humans aren’t the only thing trolling the French Quarter for fun… and for food. Her duty to the Order is her life. After all, four years ago, she lost &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; at the hands of the creatures she’d sworn to hunt, tearing her world and her heart apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ren Owens is the last person Ivy expected to enter her rigidly controlled life. He’s six feet and three inches of temptation and swoon-inducing charm. With forest-green eyes and a smile that’s surely left a stream of broken hearts in its wake, he has an uncanny, almost unnatural ability to make her yearn for everything he has to offer. But letting him in is as dangerous as hunting the cold-blooded killers stalking the streets. Losing the boy she loved once before had nearly destroyed her, but the sparking tension that grows between them becomes impossible for Ivy to deny. Deep down, she wants… she needs more than what her duty demands of her, what her past has shaped for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Ivy grows closer to Ren, she realizes she’s not the only one carrying secrets that could shatter the frail bond between them. There’s something he’s not telling her, and one thing is for certain. She’s no longer sure what is more dangerous to her—the ancient beings threatening to take over the town or the man demanding to lay claim to her heart and her soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eccentric wallflower…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most debutantes dream of finding a husband. Lady Pandora Ravenel has different plans. The ambitious young beauty would much rather stay at home and plot out her new board game business than take part in the London Season. But one night at a glittering society ball, she’s ensnared in a scandal with a wickedly handsome stranger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A cynical rake…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of evading marital traps with ease, Gabriel, Lord St. Vincent, has finally been caught-by a rebellious girl who couldn’t be less suitable. In fact, she wants nothing to do with him. But Gabriel finds the high-spirited Pandora irresistible. He’ll do whatever it takes to possess her, even if their marriage of convenience turns out to be the devil’s own bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A perilous plot…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After succumbing to Gabriel’s skilled and sensuous persuasion, Pandora agrees to become his bride. But soon she discovers that her entrepreneurial endeavors have accidentally involved her in a dangerous conspiracy—and only her husband can keep her safe. As Gabriel protects her from their unknown adversaries, they realize their devil’s bargain may just turn out to be a match made in heaven...</description>

      <![CDATA[Devil in Winter is my favorite Lisa Kleypas book and I was really excited to read Devil in Spring. I really enjoyed book 1 in the Ravenels series so this book was coming to me twice recommended. <br />It's not too dark and I felt like there were strings that could have been better tied off at the end,...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groundbreaking biography that places an obsessive, unrequited love at the heart of the writer's life story, transforming her from the tragic figure we have previously known into a smoldering Jane Eyre.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed for her beloved novels, Charlotte Brontë has been known as well for her insular, tragic family life. The genius of this biography is that it delves behind this image to reveal a life in which loss and heartache existed alongside rebellion and fierce ambition. Claire Harman seizes on a crucial moment in the 1840s when Charlotte worked at a girls' school in Brussels and fell hopelessly in love with the husband of the school's headmistress. Her torment spawned her first attempts at writing for publication, and the object of her obsession haunts the pages of every one of her novels--he is Rochester in &lt;i&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/i&gt;, Paul Emanuel in &lt;i&gt;Villette&lt;/i&gt;. Another unrequited love--for her publisher--paved the way for Charlotte to enter a marriage that ultimately made her happier than she ever imagined. Drawing on correspondence unavailable to previous biographers, Harman establishes Brontë as the heroine of her own story, one as dramatic and triumphant as one of her own novels.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A warm, funny and acutely perceptive debut novel about four adult siblings and the fate of the shared inheritance that has shaped their choices and their lives.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every family has its problems. But even among the most troubled, the Plumb family stands out as spectacularly dysfunctional. Years of simmering tensions finally reach a breaking point on an unseasonably cold afternoon in New York City as Melody, Beatrice, and Jack Plumb gather to confront their charismatic and reckless older brother, Leo, freshly released from rehab. Months earlier, an inebriated Leo got behind the wheel of a car with a nineteen-year-old waitress as his passenger. The ensuing accident has endangered the Plumbs’ joint trust fund, “The Nest,” which they are months away from finally receiving. Meant by their deceased father to be a modest mid-life supplement, the Plumb siblings have watched The Nest’s value soar along with the stock market and have been counting on the money to solve a number of self-inflicted problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melody, a wife and mother in an upscale suburb, has an unwieldy mortgage and looming college tuition for her twin teenage daughters. Jack, an antiques dealer, has secretly borrowed against the beach cottage he shares with his husband, Walker, to keep his store open. And Bea, a once-promising short-story writer, just can’t seem to finish her overdue novel. Can Leo rescue his siblings and, by extension, the people they love? Or will everyone need to reimagine the future they’ve envisioned? Brought together as never before, Leo, Melody, Jack, and Beatrice must grapple with old resentments, present-day truths, and the significant emotional and financial toll of the accident, as well as finally acknowledge the choices they have made in their own lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story about the power of family, the possibilities of friendship, the ways we depend upon one another and the ways we let one another down. In this tender, entertaining, and deftly written debut, Sweeney brings a remarkable cast of characters to life to illuminate what money does to relationships, what happens to our ambitions over the course of time, and the fraught yet unbreakable ties we share with those we love.</description>

  <description>Have you ever gone just a little too far?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lexie Banks has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep. She just had mind-blowing sex with her stepbrother. In her defense, she was on the rebound, and it’s more of a my-dad-happened-to-marry-a-woman-with-a-super-hot-son situation. But still, he’s been her best friend and confidant for the better part of the last few years … and is so off limits. It’s a good thing she’s leaving in two days for a year abroad in Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even thousands of miles away, Lexie can’t seem to escape trouble. Raised Catholic, she goes to confession in hopes of alleviating some of her guilt … and maybe not burning in hell. Instead, she stumbles out of the confessional and right into Alessandro Moretti, a young and very easy-on-the-eyes deacon … only eight months away from becoming a priest. Lexie and Alessandro grow closer, and when Alessandro’s signals start changing despite his vow of celibacy, she doesn’t know what to think. She’s torn between falling in love with the man she shouldn’t want and the man she can’t have. And she isn’t sure how she can live with herself either way.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Opposites in every way . . . except the one that matters &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaw Landon loved Rule Archer from the moment she laid eyes on him. Rule is everything a straight-A pre-med student like Shaw shouldn’t want—and the only person she’s never tried to please. She isn’t afraid of his scary piercings and tattoos or his wild attitude. Though she knows that Rule is wrong for her, her heart just won’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a rebel like Rule Archer, Shaw Landon is a stuck-up, perfect princess-and his dead twin brother’s girl. She lives by other people’s rules; he makes his own. He doesn’t have time for a good girl like Shaw-even if she’s the only one who can see the person he truly is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a short skirt, too many birthday cocktails, and spilled secrets lead to a night neither can forget. Now, Shaw and Rule have to figure out how a girl like her and a guy like him are supposed to be together without destroying their love . . . or each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He is everything she wants to avoid...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, Catherine Marks has been a paid companion to the Hathaway sisters—a pleasant position, with one caveat. Her charges' older brother, Leo Hathaway, is thoroughly exasperating. Cat can hardly believe that their constant arguing could mask a mutual attraction. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful response—and even more so when Leo proposes a dangerous liaison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She is not at all what she seems...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo must marry and produce an heir within a year to save his family home. Catherine's respectable demeanor hides a secret that would utterly destroy her. But to Leo, Cat is intriguing and infernally tempting, even to a man resolved never to love again. The danger Cat tried to outrun is about to separate them forever—unless two wary lovers can find a way to banish the shadows and give in to their desires...</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;One Happily-Ever-After Rocking Chair... &lt;br /&gt;and no sign of any forthcoming babies to rock in ol' Georgebury, Vermont. For Callie Grey, turning thirty means coming to grips with the fact that her boss (and five-week fling) is way overdue in his marriage proposal. And way off track because Mark has suddenly announced his engagement to the company's new Miss Perfect. If that isn't bad enough, her mom decides to throw her a three-oh birthday bash in the family funeral home. &lt;br /&gt;Bad goes to worse when she stirs up a crazy relationship with the town's not so warm and fuzzy veterinarian, Ian McFarland, in order to flag Mark's attention. So Ian is more comfortable with animals.... So he's formal, orderly and just a bit tense. The ever-friendly, fun-loving and spontaneous Callie decides it's time for Ian to get a personality makeover. But dang, if he doesn't shock the heck out of her, she might actually fall for Vermont's unlikeliest eligible bachelor.... &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>If life were a fairy tale, Daisy Montgomery’s stepmother and two stepsisters would surely be cast in the wicked roles. For years, they’ve made life miserable for Daisy. But when she discovers she has a godmother, she’s determined to ask her for help. Little did Daisy expect her godmother to play matchmaker with her very own grandson—who happens to be a viscount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A freewheeling playboy, Charles Thorpe, Viscount Lumley, is bored with his wealth-seeking female admirers. Not only that, he’s been cut off from the family coffers. One day, on a bet, he rids himself of what little money he has left in his pockets and vows to solve problems using his wits alone. But when the Impossible Bachelor is confronted with Daisy’s plan to save her castle, the payoff is more than he could have bargained for. Sometimes, if you give a girl a viscount, you just might find love….</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pepper has been hopelessly in love with her best friend’s brother, Hunter, for like ever. He’s the key to everything she’s always craved: security, stability, family. But she needs Hunter to notice her as more than just a friend. Even though she’s kissed exactly one guy, she has just the plan to go from novice to rock star in the bedroom—take a few pointers from someone who knows what he’s doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her college roommates have the perfect teacher in mind. But bartender Reece is nothing like the player Pepper expects. Yes, he’s beyond gorgeous, but he’s also dangerous, deep—with a troubled past. Soon what started as lessons in attraction are turning both their worlds around, and showing just what can happen when you go past foreplay and get to what’s real…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Her first year away is turning out to be nearly perfect, but one weekend of giving in to heated passion will change everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Harper has grown up under the thumb of her career marine father. Ready to live life her own way and to experience things she's only ever heard of from the jarheads in her father's unit, she's on her way to college at San Diego State University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to her new roommate, Harper is introduced to a world of parties, gorgeous guys, family, and emotions. She finds herself being torn in two as she quickly falls in love with both her new boyfriend, Brandon, and her roommate's brother, Chase. Despite their dangerous looks and histories, both men adore Harper and would do anything for her, including taking a step back if it would mean she'd be happy.</description>

  <description>Sick of being the only virgin among her friends, Bliss Edwards decides the best way to deal with the problem is to lose it as quickly and simply as possible - a one-night stand. But her plan turns out to be anything but simple when she freaks out and leaves a gorgeous guy alone and naked in her bed with an excuse that no one with half-a-brain would ever believe. And as if that weren't embarrassing enough, when she arrives for her first class of her last college semester, she recognizes her new theatre professor. She'd left him naked in her bed about 8 hours earlier.</description>

  <description>Teresa Hamilton is having a rough year—she’s in love with her big brother’s best friend, but he hasn’t spoken to her since they shared a truly amazing, mind-blowing, change-your-life kiss. She got out of a terrible relationship. And now an injury is threatening to end her dance career for good. It’s time for Plan B – college. And maybe a chance to convince Jase that what they have together is real.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jase Winstead has a huge secret that he’s not telling anyone. Especially not his best friend’s incredibly beautiful sister. Even though he and Teresa shared the hottest kiss of his life, he knows that his responsibilities must take priority. He certainly doesn’t have time for a relationship. But it doesn’t help that all he can think about kissing the one girl who could ruin everything for him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they’re thrown together more and more, Jase and Tess can’t keep denying their feelings for each other. But a familiar danger looms and tragedy strikes. As the campus recovers, the star-crossed couple must decide what they’re willing to risk to be together, and what they’re willing to lose if they’re not…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some things are worth waiting for…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traveling thousands of miles from home to enter college is the only way nineteen-year-old Avery Morgansten can escape what happened at the Halloween party five years ago—an event that forever changed her life. All she needs to do is make it to her classes on time, make sure the bracelet on her left wrist stays in place, not draw any attention to herself, and maybe—please God—make a few friends, because surely that would be a nice change of pace. The one thing she didn’t need and never planned on was capturing the attention of the one guy who could shatter the precarious future she’s building for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some things are worth experiencing…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple that’s just so… so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous, but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible, he brings out a side of her she never knew existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some things should never be kept quiet…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Avery starts receiving threatening emails and phone calls forcing her to face a past she wants silenced, she’s has no other choice but to acknowledge that someone is refusing to allow her to let go of that night when everything changed. When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar? And can Cam be there to help her or will he be dragged down with her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And some things are worth fighting for…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They are England’s most eligible bachelors, with the most scandalous reputations. But for the right woman, even an unrepentant rogue may mend his ways…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born to the street but raised within the aristocracy, Drake Darling can’t escape his sordid beginnings. Not when Lady Ophelia Lyttleton snubs him at every turn, a constant reminder he’s not truly one of them. But after rescuing her from a mysterious drowning he realizes she doesn’t remember who she is. With plans to bring her to heel, he insists she’s his housekeeper—never expecting to fall for the charming beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Ophelia might not recall her life before Drake, she has little doubt she belongs with him. The desire she feels for her dark, brooding employer can’t be denied, regardless of consequences. So when her memory returns, she is devastated by the depth of his betrayal. Now Drake must risk everything to prove she can trust this rogue with her heart once more.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The last woman on earth he would ever touch . . .&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan, the Duke of Banbury, has no interest in ushering Rosalie Hughes, his stepsister, into society. Dumped on him with nowhere else to go, he's determined to rid himself of the headstrong debutante by bestowing on her an obscenely large dowry . . . making her the most sought-after heiress of the Season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;. . . is about to become the only one he wants.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Rosalie isn't about to go along with Declan's plans. Surrounded by fortune hunters, how is she supposed to find a man who truly wants her? Taking control of her fate, Rosalie dons a disguise and sneaks into Sodom, a private club host to all manner of illicit activity—and frequented by her infuriatingly handsome stepbrother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a shadowed alcove, Declan can't resist the masked temptress who sets his blood afire . . . any more than Rosalie can deny her longing for a man who will send her into ruin.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Laia is a slave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elias is a soldier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither is free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the Martial Empire, defiance is met with death. Those who do not vow their blood and bodies to the Emperor risk the execution of their loved ones and the destruction of all they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in this brutal world, inspired by ancient Rome, that Laia lives with her grandparents and older brother. The family ekes out an existence in the Empire’s impoverished backstreets. They do not challenge the Empire. They’ve seen what happens to those who do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Laia’s brother is arrested for treason, Laia is forced to make a decision. In exchange for help from rebels who promise to rescue her brother, she will risk her life to spy for them from within the Empire’s greatest military academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, Laia meets Elias, the school’s finest soldier—and secretly, its most unwilling. Elias wants only to be free of the tyranny he’s being trained to enforce. He and Laia will soon realize that their destinies are intertwined—and that their choices will change the fate of the Empire itself.</description>

  <description>Alexa Hollen is a fighter. Forced to disguise herself as a boy and serve in the king's army, Alex uses her quick wit and fierce sword-fighting skills to earn a spot on the elite prince's guard. But when a powerful sorcerer sneaks into the palace in the dead of night, even Alex, who is virtually unbeatable, can't prevent him from abducting her, her fellow guard and friend Rylan, and Prince Damian, taking them through the treacherous wilds of the jungle and deep into enemy territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer Alex is held captive with both Rylan and the prince, the more she realizes that she is not the only one who has been keeping dangerous secrets. And suddenly, after her own secret is revealed, Alex finds herself confronted with two men vying for her heart: the safe and steady Rylan, who has always cared for her, and the dark, intriguing Damian. With hidden foes lurking around every corner, is Alex strong enough to save herself and the kingdom she's sworn to protect?</description>

  <description>In a society steeped in tradition, Princess Lia’s life follows a preordained course. As First Daughter, she is expected to have the revered gift of sight—but she doesn’t—and she knows her parents are perpetrating a sham when they arrange her marriage to secure an alliance with a neighboring kingdom—to a prince she has never met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of her wedding, Lia flees to a distant village. She settles into a new life, hopeful when two mysterious and handsome strangers arrive—and unaware that one is the jilted prince and the other an assassin sent to kill her. Deception abounds, and Lia finds herself on the brink of unlocking perilous secrets—even as she finds herself falling in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kiss of Deception &lt;/i&gt;is the first audiobook in Mary E. Pearson's Remnant Chronicles</description>

  <description>Day 1: Julia Donnelly eggs my house my first night back in Star Lake, and that’s how I know everyone still remembers everything—how I destroyed my relationship with Patrick the night everything happened with his brother, Gabe. How I wrecked their whole family. Now I’m serving out my summer like a jail sentence: Just ninety-nine days till I can leave for college, and be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 4: A nasty note on my windshield makes it clear Julia isn’t finished. I’m expecting a fight when someone taps me on the shoulder, but it’s just Gabe, home from college and actually happy to see me. “For what it’s worth, Molly Barlow,” he says, “I’m really glad you’re back.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 12: Gabe got me to come to this party, and I’m actually having fun. I think he’s about to kiss me—and that’s when I see Patrick. My Patrick, who’s supposed to be clear across the country. My Patrick, who’s never going to forgive me.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Supernatural meets The Da Vinci Code in this action-packed paranormal thriller, the first book in a new series from New York Times bestselling author Kami Garcia. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never believed in ghosts. Until one tried to kill me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kennedy Waters finds her mother dead, her world begins to unravel. She doesn’t know that paranormal forces in a much darker world are the ones pulling the strings. Not until identical twins Jared and Lukas Lockhart break into Kennedy’s room and destroy a dangerous spirit sent to kill her. The brothers reveal that her mother was part of an ancient secret society responsible for protecting the world from a vengeful demon — a society whose five members were all murdered on the same night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Kennedy has to take her mother’s place in the Legion if she wants to uncover the truth and stay alive. Along with new Legion members Priest and Alara, the teens race to find the only weapon that might be able to destroy the demon — battling the deadly spirits he controls every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspense, romance, and the paranormal meet in this chilling urban fantasy, the first book in a new series from Kami Garcia, bestselling coauthor of the Beautiful Creatures novels.</description>

  <description>Tana lives in a world where walled cities called Coldtowns exist. In them, quarantined monsters and humans mingle in a decadently bloody mix of predator and prey. The only problem is, once you pass through Coldtown's gates, you can never leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One morning, after a perfectly ordinary party, Tana wakes up surrounded by corpses. The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Coldest Girl in Coldtown&lt;/i&gt; is a wholly original story of rage and revenge, of guilt and horror, and of love and loathing from bestselling and acclaimed author Holly Black.</description>

  <description>Children can have a cruel, absolute sense of justice. Children can kill a monster and feel quite proud of themselves. A girl can look at her brother and believe they’re destined to be a knight and a bard who battle evil. She can believe she’s found the thing she’s been made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hazel lives with her brother, Ben, in the strange town of Fairfold where humans and fae exist side by side. The faeries’ seemingly harmless magic attracts tourists, but Hazel knows how dangerous they can be, and she knows how to stop them. Or she did, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of it all, there is a glass coffin in the woods. It rests right on the ground and in it sleeps a boy with horns on his head and ears as pointed as knives. Hazel and Ben were both in love with him as children. The boy has slept there for generations, never waking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, he does…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the world turns upside down, Hazel tries to remember her years pretending to be a knight. But swept up in new love, shifting loyalties, and the fresh sting of betrayal, will it be enough?</description>

  <description>The exhilaratingly seductive new series from the author of the bestselling Starcrossed series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love burns. Worlds collide. Magic reigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This world is trying to kill Lily Proctor. Her life-threatening allergies keep her from enjoying many of the experiences that other teenagers take for granted... which is why she is determined to enjoy her first (and perhaps only) high-school party. But Lily's life never goes according to plan, and after a humiliating incident in front of half her graduating class Lily wishes she could just disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly Lily is in a different Salem - one overrun with horrifying creatures and ruled by powerful women called Crucibles. Strongest and cruellest of all the Crucibles is Lillian... Lily's identical other self in this alternate universe. This new version of her world is terrifyingly sensual, and Lily is soon overwhelmed by new experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily realizes that what makes her weak at home is exactly what makes her extraordinary in New Salem. It also puts her life in danger. Thrown into a world she doesn't understand, Lily is torn between responsibilities she can't hope to shoulder alone, and a love she never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can Lily be the saviour of this world when she is literally her own worst enemy?</description>

  <description>This is a world divided by blood - red or silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like superpowers. And to Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing will ever change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace. Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most, Mare discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that threatens to destroy the balance of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver prince. Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help the Red Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance - Reds against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart...</description>

  <description>When Rachelle was fifteen she was good—apprenticed to her aunt and in training to protect her village from dark magic. But she was also reckless— straying from the forest path in search of a way to free her world from the threat of eternal darkness. After an illicit meeting goes dreadfully wrong, Rachelle is forced to make a terrible choice that binds her to the very evil she had hoped to defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, Rachelle has given her life to serving the realm, fighting deadly creatures in an effort to atone. When the king orders her to guard his son Armand—the man she hates most—Rachelle forces Armand to help her find the legendary sword that might save their world. As the two become unexpected allies, they uncover far-reaching conspiracies, hidden magic, and a love that may be their undoing. In a palace built on unbelievable wealth and dangerous secrets, can Rachelle discover the truth and stop the fall of endless night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the classic fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood, Crimson Bound is an exhilarating tale of darkness, love, and redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is a standalone novel, not part of the Cruel Beauty Universe.)</description>

  <description>Feyre's survival rests upon her ability to hunt and kill – the forest where she lives is a cold, bleak place in the long winter months. So when she spots a deer in the forest being pursued by a wolf, she cannot resist fighting it for the flesh. But to do so, she must kill the predator and killing something so precious comes at a price ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragged to a magical kingdom for the murder of a faerie, Feyre discovers that her captor, his face obscured by a jewelled mask, is hiding far more than his piercing green eyes would suggest. Feyre's presence at the court is closely guarded, and as she begins to learn why, her feelings for him turn from hostility to passion and the faerie lands become an even more dangerous place. Feyre must fight to break an ancient curse, or she will lose him forever.</description>

She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy. And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar. Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;With This Kiss: Part One &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Grace Ryburn, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Ashbrook, has fallen wildly in love with Colin Barry, a dashing young lieutenant serving his country in the Royal Navy. When he returns home to exuberant celebrations, will he even notice the quiet wallflower he grew up with … or will he fall for Grace's sparkling, gorgeous sister?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With This Kiss: Part Two &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Grace Ryburn has accepted another man's proposal after the love of her life, Lieutenant Colin Barry, asked for her own sister's hand in marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Colin returns home from the wars, injured in body and spirit, will she be able to turn her back and marry another? Or will she throw away every rule her mother taught her and try to seduce a man who has shown no interest in her kisses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With This Kiss: Part Three &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Colin Barry returns from the wars knowing that he has no right to steal Grace from the arms of her fiancé. Yet the same warrior's spirit that won so many battles at sea is prompting him to throw propriety to the winds, imitate his pirate father, and simply take what he most desires!</description>

  <description>"Be careful, Amelia -- you know how reckless you can be!" -- Mrs. Charlotte Harris, headmistress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Amelia Plume has many admirers -- it's too bad they're all fortune hunters and fops who can't provide the exotic adventures she seeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the ballrooms of Mayfair have become much more appealing since the arrival of Major Lucas Winter, an American with a dark past and a dangerous air. Lucas is brash, arrogant -- and scandalously tempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every thrilling kiss sparks hotter desire, yet Amelia suspects that Lucas has a hidden motive in wooing her. And she intends to discover it, by any means necessary</description>

      <![CDATA[I hated the "hero" in this book. The first time he takes the heroine out he feels her up and has her feel him down. It's gross. I know there are lots of readers who can overlook scenes like that, but it really put me off the whole book. I ended up sort of skimming towards the end. It didn't work...]]>

  <description>Welcome to the big leagues. To secrets and scandals. It's all about the game. Who's playing. Who's not. Who has no idea about the game. And...wait, what game are we playing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll leave that for you to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start is the big question for Chloe Baker. How was she supposed to explain to Zack Warren that she started a fan club for him when she was a kid? It was just a game. A way to make friends and have fun. She never thought it would spiral out of control. And never. In a million, gazillion years, did she think it would follow her to college. How could she tell him her best friend Lana kept the club alive? That she had nothing to do with the craziness? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chloe didn’t understand why she cared so much about Zack's opinion of her. She hated him. He hated her. They had very mutual feelings of dislike for each other. So he'd just hate her even more when or if he found out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's totally fine...she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack Warren had a soft spot for Chloe Baker. He likes the way she walks. He likes the way she talks. If he was poetically inclined, he’d write a sonnet about her ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Zack’s junior year of college. He’s got things to worry about. Scouts from the major leagues. Baseball games. Contracts. Grades.... His father ran away to Vegas with Chloe's mother. He didn’t have time to worry about a girl. But he did. He worried about Chloe a lot, especially with that jerk Max sniffing around her. It's weird though, to like your stepsister, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Zack could argue that he saw Chloe first. Way before his dad met her mom. He was too young to stake a claim. But just didn’t care anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s done playing games.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HERE COMES THE GROOM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a notorious member of the Heirs' Club, Bray Drakestone can't resist a challenge from one of his well-heeled colleagues-especially when it involves money and horses. But the friendly wager takes an unexpected and deadly turn. Bray is forced to agree to marry one of his challenger's five sisters-sight unseen. Now gamblers all over London are placing bets on whether Bray will actually go through with it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THERE GOES THE BRIDE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Louisa Prim, the eldest sister, doesn't care a whit what the reckless rogue at the Heirs' Club promised her brother-she has no intention of marrying the future Duke of Drakestone. Bray, however, sees her rejection as another challenge. He bets that the fiery Miss Prim will not only agree to marry him, &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; will propose to &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;! With four sisters behind her, Louisa knows she can't lose. But why does her opponent have to be a divinely handsome scoundrel? And so sweetly, irresistibly seductive...</description>

  <description>An unexpected phone call heralds a new challenge for Mercy. Her mate Adam’s ex-wife is in trouble, on the run from a stalker. Adam isn’t the kind of man to turn away a person in need—and Mercy knows it. But with Christy holed up in Adam’s house, Mercy can’t shake the feeling that something about the situation isn’t right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon her suspicions are confirmed when she learns that Christy has the furthest thing from good intentions. She wants Adam back, and she’s willing to do whatever it takes to get him, including turning Adam’s pack against Mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercy isn’t about to step down without a fight, but there’s a more dangerous threat circling. Christy’s stalker is more than a bad man—in fact, he may not be human at all. As the bodies start piling up, Mercy must put her personal troubles aside to face a creature with the power to tear her whole world apart.</description>

  <description>Everybody knows about the Cooper Killings – the Bel Air home invasion that rocked the nation.&lt;br /&gt;There was only one survivor - a sixteen year-old girl.&lt;br /&gt;And though the killers were caught they walked free.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now eighteen, Nic Preston - the girl who survived - is trying hard to rebuild her life. She’s security conscious to the point of paranoia and her only friend is a French Mastiff bulldog, but she’s making progress. She’s started college in New York and has even begun dating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one night her apartment is broken into and the life Nic’s worked so hard to create is shattered in an instant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finn Carter - hacker, rule breaker, player – is the last person Nic ever wants to see again. He’s the reason her mother’s killers walked free from court. But as the people hunting her close in, Nic has to accept that her best and possibly only chance of staying alive is by keeping close to Finn and learning to trust the person she’s sworn to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing across a snowbound New England, frantically trying to uncover the motive behind the murders, Nic and Finn come to realize the conspiracy is bigger than they could ever have suspected. But the closer they get to the truth and the closer they get to each other, the greater the danger becomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To survive she has to stay close to him.&lt;br /&gt;To keep her safe he has to keep his distance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Maya Rodale's captivating new series introduces London's Least Likely—three wallflowers who are about to become the toast of the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Emma Avery has accidentally announced her engagement—to the most eligible man in England. As soon as it's discovered that Emma has never actually met the infamously attractive Duke of Ashbrooke, she'll no longer be a wallflower; she'll be a laughingstock. And then Ashbrooke does something Emma never expected. He plays along with her charade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A temporary betrothal to the irreproachable Lady Avery could be just the thing to repair Ashbrooke's tattered reputation. Seducing her is simply a bonus. And then Emma does what he never expected: she refuses his advances. It's unprecedented. Inconceivable. Quite damnably alluring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London's Least Likely to Misbehave has aroused the curiosity—among other things—of London's most notorious rogue. Now nothing will suffice but to uncover Emma's wanton side and prove there's nothing so satisfying as two perfect strangers…being perfectly scandalous together.</description>

  <description>Patricia Briggs's novel &lt;i&gt;River Marked&lt;/i&gt; was praised as "an urban fantasy where our everyday world is believably twisted into the world of fey, werewolves, vampires, and myths made real." Now Mercy Thompson faces a shapeshifter's biggest fear as the realm she has embraced is thrown into chaos...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercy Thompson's life has undergone a seismic change. Becoming the mate of Adam Hauptman - the charismatic Alpha of the local werewolf pack - has made her a stepmother to his daughter Jesse, a relationship that brings moments of blissful normalcy to Mercy's life. But on the edges of humanity, a minor mishap on an ordinary day can turn into so much more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an accident in bumper-to-bumper traffic, Mercy and Jesse can't reach Adam - or anyone else in the pack for that matter. They've all been abducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through their mating bond, all Mercy knows is that Adam is angry and in pain. But she fears Adam's disappearance may be related to the political battle the werewolves have been fighting to gain acceptance from the public - and that he and the pack are in serious danger. Outmatched and on her own, Mercy may be forced to seek assistance from any ally she can get, no matter how unlikely.</description>

  <description>Perfect for the fans of &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; who are desperately awaiting the release of &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt;, this novella-length digital original will bridge the gap between these two novels from the perspective of the villain we all love to hate, Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt;, Juliette escaped from The Reestablishment by seducing Warner—and then putting a bullet in his shoulder. But as she’ll learn in &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt;, Warner is not that easy to get rid of. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the base and recovering from his near-fatal wound, Warner must do everything in his power to keep his soldiers in check and suppress any mention of a rebellion in the sector. Still as obsessed with Juliette as ever, his first priority is to find her, bring her back, and dispose of Adam and Kenji, the two traitors who helped her escape. But when Warner’s father, The Supreme Commander of The Reestablishment, arrives to correct his son’s mistakes, it’s clear that he has much different plans for Juliette. Plans Warner simply cannot allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set after &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; and before its forthcoming sequel, &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt; is a novella told from the perspective of Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.</description>

I really hope this series lives up to the first book. <br /><br />Warner's my favorite villain since the Darkling and that only ended in disappointment. I'm hoping this goes bet...]]>

No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; "Welcome to a world of reckless sensuality and glittering sophistication...of dangerously handsome gentlemen and young ladies longing to gain a title . . . of games played for high stakes, including--on occasion--a lady's virtue." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A marquess's sheltered only daughter, Lady Roberta St. Giles falls in love with a man she glimpses across a crowded ballroom: a duke, a game player of consummate skill, a notorious rakehell who shows no interest in marriage--until he lays eyes on Roberta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the Earl of Gryffyn knows too well that the price required to gain a coronet is often too high. Damon Reeve, the earl, is determined to protect the exquisite Roberta from chasing after the wrong destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can Damon entice her into a high-stakes game of his own, even if his heart is likely to be lost in the venture?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>As a young girl, Emilia Gwendolyn Carrington told the annoying future Duke of Pindar that she would marry any man in the world before him—so years later she is horrified to realize that she has nowhere else to turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evander Septimus Brody has his own reasons for agreeing to Mia's audacious proposal, but there's one thing he won't give his inconvenient wife: himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, he offers Mia a devil's bargain... he will spend four nights a year with her. Four nights, and nothing more. And those only when she begs for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which Mia will never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Vander faces the most crucial challenge of his life: he must seduce his own wife in order to win her heart—and no matter what it takes, this is the one battle he can't afford to lose.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25210408-all-the-light-we-cannot-see" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the stunningly beautiful instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.</description>

  <description>It is 1866, and young Walter Moody has come to make his fortune upon the New Zealand goldfields. On the stormy night of his arrival, he stumbles across a tense gathering of twelve local men who have met in secret to discuss a series of unexplained events: A wealthy man has vanished, a prostitute has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. Moody is soon drawn into the mystery: a network of fates and fortunes that is as complex and exquisitely ornate as the night sky. Richly evoking a mid-nineteenth-century world of shipping, banking, and gold rush boom and bust, &lt;em&gt;The Luminaries &lt;/em&gt;is a brilliantly constructed, fiendishly clever ghost story and a gripping page-turner.</description>

  <description>Sir Richard Kenworthy has less than a month to find a bride. He knows he can't be too picky, but when he sees Iris Smythe-Smith hiding behind her cello at her family's infamous musicale, he thinks he might have struck gold. She's the type of girl you don't notice until the second—or third—look, but there's something about her, something simmering under the surface, and he knows she's the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris Smythe–Smith is used to being underestimated. With her pale hair and quiet, sly wit she tends to blend into the background, and she likes it that way. So when Richard Kenworthy demands an introduction, she is suspicious. He flirts, he charms, he gives every impression of a man falling in love, but she can't quite believe it's all true. When his proposal of marriage turns into a compromising position that forces the issue, she can't help thinking that he's hiding something . . . even as her heart tells her to say yes.</description>

She never doubted romance would be in her future, too. The storybooks offered endless possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as she grew older, Izzy crossed them off. One by one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;del&gt;Ugly duckling turned swan?&lt;br /&gt; Abducted by handsome highwayman?&lt;br /&gt; Rescued from drudgery by charming prince?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, no, and… Heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Izzy’s given up yearning for romance. She’ll settle for a roof over her head. What fairy tales are left over for an impoverished twenty-six year-old woman who’s never even been kissed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one.</description>

But to marry a lady, Thorn must acquire a gleaming, civilized façade, the specialty of Lady Xenobia India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exquisite, head-strong, and independent, India vows to make Thorn marriageable in just three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither Thorn nor India anticipate the forbidden passion that explodes between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thorn will stop at nothing to make India his. Failure is not an option. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is only one thing that will make India his—the one thing Thorn can't afford to lose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His fierce and lawless heart.</description>

  <description>A DUKE MUST CHOOSE WISELY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leopold Dautry, the notorious Duke of Villiers, must wed quickly and nobly—and his choices, alas, are few. The Duke of Montague's daughter, Eleanor, is exquisitely beautiful and fiercely intelligent. Villiers betroths himself to her without further ado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, no other woman really qualifies. Lisette, the outspoken daughter of the Duke of Gilner, cares nothing for clothing or decorum. She's engaged to another man, and doesn't give a fig for status or title. Half the ton believes Lisette mad—and Villiers is inclined to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between logic and passion, between intelligence and imagination, Villiers finds himself drawn to the very edge of impropriety. But it is not until he's in a duel to the death, fighting for the reputation of the woman he loves, that Villiers finally realizes that the greatest risk may not be in the dueling field...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the bedroom. And the heart.</description>

  <description>As the 800,000+ U.S. fans of Elaine Lui’s site know, her mother, aka The Squawking Chicken, is a huge factor in Elaine’s life. She pulls no punches, especially with her only child. “Where’s my money?” she asks every time she sees Elaine. “You’ll never be Miss Hong Kong,” she informed her daughter when she was a girl. Listen to the Squawking Chicken lays bare the playbook of unusual advice, warnings, and unwavering love that has guided Elaine throughout her life. Using the nine principles that her mother used to raise her, Elaine tells us the story of the Squawking Chicken’s life—in which she walked an unusual path to parent with tough love, humor, and, through it all, a mother’s unyielding devotion to her daughter. This is a love letter to mothers everywhere.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The bridesmaid is pregnant...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stuffy air in the church and her queasy stomach are a bad combination, especially since Krystal Graham is trying to hide her condition - particularly from Garret Donovan, the groomsman assigned to escort her down the aisle. The groomsman who just happens to be the father of her baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once the "I do's" are over and the newlyweds are on their way, Krystal knows she's in trouble, and she tries to make her exit before she embarrasses herself. But that's the least of her worries. Garret's a smart man and a doctor. What's she going to do once her secret is out?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Kate has always been the good girl. Too good, according to some people at school—although they have no idea the guilty secret she carries. But this summer, everything is different...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This summer she’s a counselor at Cumberland Creek summer camp, and she wants to put the past behind her. This summer Matt is back as a counselor too. He’s the first guy she ever kissed, and he’s gone from a geeky songwriter who loved The Hardy Boys to a buff lifeguard who loves to flirt - with her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate used to think the world was black and white, right and wrong. Turns out, life isn’t that easy...</description>

  <description>Red-hot author Miranda Kenneally hits one out of the park in this return to Catching Jordan's Hundred Oaks High.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a scandal rocks their conservative small town, 17-year-old Parker Shelton goes overboard trying to prove that she won't turn out like her mother: a lesbian. The all-star third-baseman quits the softball team, drops 20 pounds and starts making out with guys--a lot. But hitting on the hot new assistant baseball coach might be taking it a step too far...especially when he starts flirting back.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;ONE OF THE BOYS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What girl doesn't want to be surrounded by gorgeous jocks day in and day out? Jordan Woods isn't just surrounded by hot guys, though-she leads them as the captain and quarterback of her high school football team. They all see her as one of the guys and that's just fine. As long as she gets her athletic scholarship to a powerhouse university.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything she's ever worked for is threatened when Ty Green moves to her school. Not only is he an amazing QB, but he's also amazingly hot. And for the first time, Jordan's feeling vulnerable. Can she keep her head in the game while her heart's on the line?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the third novel in Maya Rodale's charming Wallflower series, London's Least Likely to Be Caught in a Compromising Position finds temptation in a devilishly handsome stranger . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Miss Prudence Merryweather Payton has a secret.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that she's the only graduate from her finishing school to remain unwed on her fourth season—but no one knows why. With her romantic illusions shattered after being compromised against her will, Prudence accepts a proposal even though her betrothed is not exactly a knight in shining armor. When he cowardly pushes her out of their stagecoach to divert a highwayman, she vows never to trust another man again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Roark, Viscount Castleton, is nobody's hero.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a blue-eyed charmer with a mysterious past and ambitious plans for his future—that do not include a wife. When he finds himself stranded at a country inn with a captivating young woman, a delicate dance of seduction ensues. He knows he should keep his distance. And he definitely shouldn't start falling in love with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Prudence's dark past comes back to haunt her, John must protect her—even though he risks revealing his own secrets that could destroy his future.</description>

  <description>Oct. 11th, 1943 - A British spy plane crashes in Nazi-occupied France. Its pilot and passenger are best friends. One of the girls has a chance at survival. The other has lost the game before it's barely begun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When "Verity" is arrested by the Gestapo, she's sure she doesn't stand a chance. As a secret agent captured in enemy territory, she's living a spy's worst nightmare. Her Nazi interrogators give her a simple choice: reveal her mission or face a grisly execution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she intricately weaves her confession, Verity uncovers her past, how she became friends with the pilot Maddie, and why she left Maddie in the wrecked fuselage of their plane. On each new scrap of paper, Verity battles for her life, confronting her views on courage and failure and her desperate hope to make it home. But will trading her secrets be enough to save her from the enemy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowing and beautifully written, Elizabeth Wein creates a visceral read of danger, resolve, and survival that shows just how far true friends will go to save each other. Code Name Verity is an outstanding novel that will stick with you long after the last page.</description>

  <description>It was Sloane who yanked Emily out of her shell and made life 100% interesting. But right before what should have been the most epic summer, Sloane just…disappears. All she leaves behind is a to-do list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it, thirteen Sloane-inspired tasks that Emily would normally never try. But what if they could bring her best friend back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apple picking at night?&lt;/i&gt; Okay, easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dance until dawn?&lt;/i&gt; Sure. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiss a stranger?&lt;/i&gt; Um... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily now has this unexpected summer, and the help of Frank Porter (&lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; unexpected), to check things off Sloane's list. Who knows what she’ll find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Go skinny-dipping?&lt;/i&gt; Wait...what?</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is odd. Emily's obsession with Sloane is off-putting and weird at first, but slowly begins to make more sense and by the end, it isn't strange at all. <br />My biggest and only complaint with Since You've Been Gone (but it's a big one) is that I felt like there was more to Emily's summer than...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Flying Start author of &lt;i&gt;Amy &amp;amp; Roger’s Epic Detour&lt;/i&gt;, a powerful novel about hope in the face of &lt;i&gt;heartbreak.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Edwards’ family might not be the closest-knit—everyone is a little too busy and overscheduled—but for the most part, they get along just fine. Then Taylor’s dad gets devastating news, and her parents decide that the family will spend one last summer all together at their old lake house in the Pocono Mountains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crammed into a place much smaller and more rustic than they are used to, they begin to get to know each other again. And Taylor discovers that the people she thought she had left behind haven’t actually gone anywhere. Her former best friend is still around, as is her first boyfriend…and he’s much cuter at seventeen than he was at twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the summer progresses and the Edwards become more of a family, they’re more aware than ever that they’re battling a ticking clock. Sometimes, though, there is just enough time to get a second chance—with family, with friends, and with love.</description>

      <![CDATA[I cried so hard reading this book. It's an "if you need a good cry" sort of read and nobody does parental death like Morgan Matson. Plus, if you've ever had a parent with cancer or a terminal illness, so much of this book rings true (at least it did for me)<br />]]>

  <description>The year is 2059. Nineteen-year-old Paige Mahoney is working in the criminal underworld of Scion London, based at Seven Dials, employed by a man named Jaxon Hall. Her job: to scout for information by breaking into people’s minds. For Paige is a dreamwalker, a clairvoyant and, in the world of Scion, she commits treason simply by breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is raining the day her life changes for ever. Attacked, drugged and kidnapped, Paige is transported to Oxford – a city kept secret for two hundred years, controlled by a powerful, otherworldly race. Paige is assigned to Warden, a Rephaite with mysterious motives. He is her master. Her trainer. Her natural enemy. But if Paige wants to regain her freedom she must allow herself to be nurtured in this prison where she is meant to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bone Season introduces a compelling heroine and also introduces an extraordinary young writer, with huge ambition and a teeming imagination. Samantha Shannon has created a bold new reality in this riveting debut.</description>

  <description>Dez wasn't just Jasmine's crush. A gargoyle Warden like Jas, he helped her come to terms with her destiny—fending off demons and maintaining the balance between good and evil. He was her everything…right until the moment he disappeared without a trace. It didn't help that Jas's father had just announced that she and Dez would one day be mated. Hard not to take that personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now he's back, three years older, ten times hotter, ready to pick up exactly where they left off. But Jas isn't taking that risk again. Dez has seven days to meet all her conditions and earn back her trust. Seven days filled with terrifying danger and sweet temptation. Seven days to win her heart—or shatter it all over again...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He was lost and alone. Then he found her.&lt;br /&gt;And the future seemed more fragile than ever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/characters/72211-landon-maxfield" rel="nofollow"&gt;Landon Lucas Maxfield&lt;/a&gt; believed his life was perfect and looked forward to a future filled with promise — until tragedy tore his family apart and made him doubt everything he ever believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he wanted was to leave the past behind. When he met &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/characters/72209-jacqueline-wallace" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jacqueline Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, his desire to be everything she needed came so easy…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As easy as it could be for a man who learned that the soul is breakable and that everything you hoped for could be ripped away in a heartbeat.</description>

  <description>You reap what you sow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying Nate Grimm has a dark past is an understatement. Fortunately, no one's bothered to look too closely at the Fairytale Management Authority's lead detective and part-time Reaper. And that's the way Nate wants to keep it. For after centuries of torment and loneliness, he's finally found happiness with the hot and hard-charging love of his life, Tess "Red" Little. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, his love for Tess is the reason there's a posse of Reaper judges after him, led by a sadistic bastard acquainted with Nate from once upon a time. Now, Tess will pay the price for Nate's transgressions unless Nate severs his ties to the transplanted Tales--and Tess--forever. His enemy has the advantage in speed, malice and brutality. But the Reapers have underestimated the depth of Nate's love and devotion. And the fury of his wrath. . .</description>

      <![CDATA[A nice follow-up with Red and Nate. If I have any complaint it's that I feel like this could have been a full length book. Sometimes the action felt rushed, and I would have enjoyed more time learning about the reapers and Benedict aka H.D.]]>

  <description>“My name is Tess Little. But everyone calls me Red.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, a spell went awry, stranding Make Believe characters in the ordinary world. Since then, Tess “Red” Little—a/k/a Little Red Riding Hood—has worked as an Enforcer for the Chicago branch of the Fairytale Management Authority. But, consider yourself warned—she’s not just some waif with a basket of goodies. All grown up and with nothing to lose, a gun and combat boots is more her style. And Red’s new assignment threatens to be short on happily ever afters…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is murdering transplanted Tales in gruesome fashion. The list of fictional characters capable of such grisly acts is short and includes more than one of Red’s old flames. And if that wasn’t bad enough, there’s another complication, in the form of sexy, enigmatic Nate Grimm, the FMA’s lead detective and part-time Reaper. Used to following her own rules and living life on the edge, Red has managed to avoid taking on a partner until now. But Nate’s dark side makes him perfect for a case like this. That is, if she can trust him. Because if there’s one thing Red knows for sure, it’s that believing in the wrong person can have big, bad consequences…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jill Shalvis continues with the ninth installment in her beloved Lucky Harbor series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOMETIMES WRONG IS OH-SO-RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a wrenching loss, Ben McDaniel tried to escape his grief by working in dangerous, war-torn places like Africa and the Middle East. Now he's back in his hometown and face-to-face with Aubrey Wellington, the hot-as-hell woman who is trouble with a capital T.

But by far, the toughest challenge to her plan is sexy, brooding Ben - even though he has absolutely no idea what she's done . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can this unlikely couple defy the odds and win over the little town of Lucky Harbor?</description>

  <description>Her name is Pete Caldecott. She was just sixteen when she met Jack Winter, a gorgeous, larger-than-life  mage who thrilled her with his witchcraft. Then a spirit Jack summoned killed him before Pete’s eyes—or so she thought. Now a detective , Pete is investigating the case of a young girl kidnapped from the streets of London. A tipster’s chilling prediction has led police directly to the child…but when Pete meets the informant, she’s shocked to learn he is none other than Jack. Strung out on heroin, Jack a shadow of his former self.  But he’s able to tell Pete exactly where Bridget’s kidnappers are hiding: in the supernatural shadow-world of the fey.  Even though she’s spent years disavowing the supernatural, Pete follows Jack into the invisible fey underworld, where she hopes to discover the truth about what happened to Bridget—and what happened to Jack on that dark day so long ago…</description>

  <description>Emmaline Neal needs a date. Just a date—someone to help her get through her ex-fiancé's wedding without losing her mind. But pickings are slim in Manningsport, New York, population 715. In fact, there's really only one option: local heartthrob Jack Holland. Everyone loves Jack, and he won't get the wrong idea…. After all, Jack Holland would never actually be interested in a woman like Em. Especially not with his beautiful ex-wife creeping around, angling to reunite ever since he rescued a group of teens and became a local hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the wedding festivities take an unexpectedly passionate turn, Em figures it was just one crazy night. Jack is too gorgeous, too popular, to ever end up with her. So why is she the one he can talk to about his deep, dark feelings? If Em is going to get her dream man, she'll have to start by believing in him…</description>

      <![CDATA[I received this book to review from Netgalley. <br /><br />I really like the Blue Heron series and this book continues my liking. you don't need to read these books in order but it does help explain the secondary characters and since they've all been good, you might as well get reading from the beginning.]]>

  <description>Since birth, Nyx has been betrothed to the evil ruler of her kingdom-all because of a foolish bargain struck by her father. And since birth, she has been in training to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no choice but to fulfill her duty, Nyx resents her family for never trying to save her and hates herself for wanting to escape her fate. Still, on her seventeenth birthday, Nyx abandons everything she's ever known to marry the all-powerful, immortal Ignifex. Her plan? Seduce him, destroy his enchanted castle, and break the nine-hundred-year-old curse he put on her people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ignifex is not at all what Nyx expected. The strangely charming lord beguiles her, and his castle—a shifting maze of magical rooms—enthralls her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nyx searches for a way to free her homeland by uncovering Ignifex's secrets, she finds herself unwillingly drawn to him. Even if she could bring herself to love her sworn enemy, how can she refuse her duty to kill him? With time running out, Nyx must decide what is more important: the future of her kingdom, or the man she was never supposed to love.</description>

  <description>Author of the beloved Half Moon Hollow series of vampire romances (Nice Girls Don’t Have Fangs), Molly Harper has created a standalone paranormal romance in which a dilapidated haunted house could bring star-crossed lovers together—if it doesn’t kill them first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nina Linden is hired to landscape a private island off the New England coast, she sees it as her chance to rebuild her failing business after being cheated by her unscrupulous ex. She never expects that her new client, software mogul Deacon Whitney, would see more in her than just a talented gardener. Deacon has paid top dollar to the crews he’s hired to renovate the desolate Whitney estate—he had to, because the bumps, thumps, and unexplained sightings of ghostly figures in nineteenth-century dress are driving workers away faster than he can say “Boo.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nina shows no signs of being scared away, even as she experiences some unnerving apparitions herself. And as the two of them work closely together to restore the mansion’s faded glory, Deacon realizes that he’s found someone who doesn’t seem to like his fortune more than himself—while Nina may have finally found the one man she can trust with her bruised and battered heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But something on the island doesn’t believe in true love…and if Nina and Deacon can’t figure out how to put these angry spirits to rest, their own love doesn’t stand a ghost of a chance.</description>

  <description>My name is Evie Claremont and this was to be the making of me–my freshman year of college. I’d been hoping that once I’d arrived on Crestwood’s campus, the nightmare that I’ve been having would go away. It hasn’t.&lt;br /&gt;I may be an inexperienced seventeen-year-old, but I’m grounded…sane. I look for rational explanations to even the strangest circumstances. Since meeting sophomore Reed Wellington, however, nothing makes any sense. Whenever he’s near, I feel an attraction to him–a magnetic kind of force pulling me towards him. I know what you’re thinking…that sounds fairly awesome. Yeah, it would be…if he liked me, but Reed acts as if I’m the worst thing that has ever happened to Crestwood…or him. But get this, for some reason every time I turn around he’s there, barging into my life.&lt;br /&gt;What is the secret that he’s keeping from me? I’m hoping that it’s anything but what I suspect: that he’s not exactly normal…and neither am I. So, maybe Crestwood won’t be the making of me, but it could be the breaking of me. I’ve been left to wonder if the dark future my dream is foretelling is…inescapable.</description>

  <description>Florist Claire Holbrook has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; played by the rules her entire life, but breaks them to spend one night with sexy lone wolf Jake Manning, a man she's adored since she was a teenager. Six weeks later things get complicated when she discovers they created a bond that will last a lifetime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake has &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; played by the rules. Getting Minister Holbrook's daughter pregnant wasn't part of any life plan, but he won't run from his responsibilities. He'll step up and be the best man he can, even if he doesn't have a clue where to begin. The more time he spends with Claire, though, the more he wants her, and the harder it is to get close because that would mean sharing the one thing he hasn't with anyone—the truth and his heart. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

Now she has to put her plans to move to L.A. on hold for a whole year while she fulfills the obligation of her vet school scholarship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Wyatt, her gorgeous one-night stand from a Reno vet conference, introduces himself as her new boss. And Emily is just as drawn to his seductive looks and quiet strength as she was on that very steamy night. She soon learns that Wyatt isn’t just a laid-back doctor, but a delicious alpha male tempting her away from her carefully laid-out plans...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's got nothing left to lose…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her fiancé suddenly engaged to another and her reputation in tatters, Merribeth Wakefield needs a bold plan to reclaim her life. She must be brave. Confident. She must … kiss a rake? The suggestion is ludicrous! Yet when Merribeth finds herself alone with the dark and brooding Lord Knightswold, suddenly the plan doesn't seem so farfetched. So she does something she never thought she'd do—she kisses him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But he has everything to gain…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Marquess of Knightswold—Bane to most—has no use for the affections of women. Well, none lasting longer than a single night. A plot for revenge weighs heavy on his mind, leaving no room for romance. But then a shy, witty miss borrows a kiss from him in a darkened room, and everything he thought he knew about innocent debutantes vanishes along with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a twist of fate brings Merribeth within Bane's grasp, he'll have to resist her charms—or risk losing everything—for the sake of his heart.</description>

Yet her new-found freedom is short lived. A string of unexplained murders has brought danger to Daisy's door, forcing her to turn to the most unlikely of saviors . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Their growing passion knows no bounds . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ian Ranulf, the Marquis of Northrup, has spent lifetimes hiding his primal nature from London society.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if the perfect match is a perfect surprise? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honor Holland has just been unceremoniously rejected by her lifelong crush. And now—a mere three weeks later—Mr. Perfect is engaged to her best friend. But resilient, reliable Honor is going to pick herself up, dust herself off and get back out there… or she would if dating in Manningsport, New York, population 715, wasn't easier said than done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming, handsome British professor Tom Barlow just wants to do right by his unofficial stepson, Charlie, but his visa is about to expire. Now Tom must either get a green card or leave the States—and leave Charlie behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a moment of impulsiveness, Honor agrees to help Tom with a marriage of convenience—and make her ex jealous in the process. But juggling a fiancé, hiding out from her former best friend and managing her job at the family vineyard isn't easy. And as sparks start to fly between Honor and Tom, they might discover that their pretend relationship is far too perfect to be anything but true love….</description>

  <description>When Grace Emerson's ex-fiancé starts dating her younger sister, extreme measures are called for. To keep everyone from obsessing about her love life, Grace announces that she's seeing someone. Someone wonderful. Someone handsome. Someone completely made up. Who is this Mr. Right? Someone...exactly unlike her renegade neighbor, Callahan O'Shea. Well, someone with his looks, maybe. His hot body. His knife-sharp sense of humor. His smarts and big heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoa. No. Callahan O'Shea is not her perfect man! Not with his unsavory past. So why does Mr. Wrong feel so...right?</description>

  <description>Kit Colbana - half breed, assassin, thief, jack of all trades - has a new job: track down the missing ward of one of the local alpha shapeshifters. It should be a piece of cake.&lt;p&gt;So why is she so nervous? It probably has something to do with the insanity that happens when you deal with shifters - especially sexy ones who come bearing promises of easy jobs and easier money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it’s all the other missing kids that Kit discovers while working the case, or the way her gut keeps screaming she’s gotten in over her head. Or maybe it’s because if she fails - she’s dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she can stay just one step ahead, she should be okay. Maybe she’ll even live long enough to collect her fee...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Miss Jane Fairfield can’t do anything right. When she’s in company, she always says the wrong thing—and rather too much of it. No matter how costly they are, her gowns fall on the unfortunate side of fashion. Even her immense dowry can’t save her from being an object of derision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s precisely what she wants. She’ll do anything, even risk humiliation, if it means she can stay unmarried and keep her sister safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Oliver Marshall has to do everything right. He’s the bastard son of a duke, raised in humble circumstances—and he intends to give voice and power to the common people. If he makes one false step, he’ll never get the chance to accomplish anything. He doesn’t need to come to the rescue of the wrong woman. He certainly doesn’t need to fall in love with her. But there’s something about the lovely, courageous Jane that he can’t resist... even though it could mean the ruin of them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one is like Daemon Black.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he set out to prove his feelings for me, he wasn’t fooling around. Doubting him isn’t something I’ll do again, and now that we’ve made it through the rough patches, well… There’s a lot of spontaneous combustion going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But even he can’t protect his family from the danger of trying to free those they love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After everything, I’m no longer the same Katy. I’m different… And I’m not sure what that will mean in the end. When each step we take in discovering the truth puts us in the path of the secret organization responsible for torturing and testing hybrids, the more I realize there is no end to what I’m capable. The death of someone close still lingers, help comes from the most unlikely source, and friends will become the deadliest of enemies, but we won’t turn back. Even if the outcome will shatter our worlds forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Together we’re stronger… and they know it.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The last thing Dawson Black expected was Bethany Williams. As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are…well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bethany can’t deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren’t a complication she wants, she can’t stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she’s drawn in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Captivated. Lured. Loved.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can’t stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;BEING CONNECTED TO DAEMON BLACK SUCKS… &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection. So I’ve sworn him off, even though he’s running more hot than cold these days. But we’ve got bigger problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;SOMETHING WORSE THAN ARUM HAS COME TO TOWN &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Department of Defense is here. If they ever find out what Daemon can do and that we’re linked, I’m a goner. So is he. And there’s this new boy in school who’s got a secret of his own. He knows what’s happened to me and he can help, but to do so, I have to lie to Daemon and stay away from him. Like that’s possible. Against all common sense, I’m falling for Daemon. Hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;BUT THEN, EVERYTHING CHANGES &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen someone who shouldn’t be alive. And I have to tell Daemon, even though I know he’s never going to stop searching until he gets the truth. What happened to his brother? Who betrayed him? And what does the DOD want from them—from me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;NO ONE IS WHO THEY SEEM. AND NOT EVERYONE WILL SURVIVE THE LIES.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I’d pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring… until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something… unexpected happens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon’s touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I’m getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don’t kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>An international sensation, this hilarious, feel-good novel is narrated by an oddly charming and socially challenged genetics professor on an unusual quest: to find out if he is capable of true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Tillman, professor of genetics, has never been on a second date. He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/i&gt; is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges.</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>Paige Kelly is used to weird--in fact, she probably corners the market on weird, considering that her best friend, Dottie, has been dead since the 1950s. But when a fire demon attacks Paige in detention, she has to admit that things have gotten out of her league. Luckily, the cute new boy in school, Logan Bradley, is a practiced demon slayer-and he isn't fazed by Paige's propensity to chat with the dead. Suddenly, Paige is smack in the middle of a centuries-old battle between warlocks and demons, learning to fight with a magic sword so that she can defend herself. And if she makes one wrong move, she'll be pulled into the Dark World, an alternate version of our world that's overrun by demons-and she might never make it home.</description>

  <description>Meet Amber - Thrift Store employee, mood manipulator and human lie-detector - she's forsaken boys (because all of them have one-track minds) until the day she meets Ryder, who has an uncanny ability to make her forget all her previous notions about the male of the species. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ryder's mixed up in some seriously dangerous business and not even Amber's ability to deflect raging psychopaths and defuse any situation is going to keep them from being drawn into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This prequel short story, published exclusively for World Book Day will delight and thrill fans of Hunting Lila, reuniting them with some of their favourite characters.</description>

  <description>Coralie Sardie is the daughter of the sinister impresario behind The Museum of Extraordinary Things, a Coney Island boardwalk freak show that thrills the masses. An exceptional swimmer, Coralie appears as the Mermaid in her father’s “museum,” alongside performers like the Wolfman, the Butterfly Girl, and a one-hundred-year-old turtle. One night Coralie stumbles upon a striking young man taking pictures of moonlit trees in the woods off the Hudson River. The dashing photographer is Eddie Cohen, a Russian immigrant who has run away from his father’s Lower East Side Orthodox community and his job as a tailor’s apprentice. When Eddie photographs the devastation on the streets of New York following the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, he becomes embroiled in the suspicious mystery behind a young woman’s disappearance and ignites the heart of Coralie.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes The Best Man Is The One You Least Expect...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faith Holland left her hometown after being jilted at the altar. Now a little older and wiser, she’s ready to return to the Blue Heron Winery, her family’s vineyard, to confront the ghosts of her past, and maybe enjoy a glass of red. After all, there’s some great scenery there....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Levi Cooper, the local police chief - and best friend of her former fiancé. There’s a lot about Levi that Faith never noticed, and it’s not just those deep green eyes. The only catch is she’s having a hard time forgetting that he helped ruin her wedding all those years ago. If she can find a minute amidst all her family drama to stop and smell the rosé, she just might find a reason to stay at Blue Heron, and finish that walk down the aisle.</description>

  <description>Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic, created to be the wife of a man who dies at sea on the voyage from Poland. Chava is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York harbor in 1899. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire born in the ancient Syrian desert, trapped in an old copper flask, and released in New York City, though still not entirely free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahmad and Chava become unlikely friends and soul mates with a mystical connection. Marvelous and compulsively readable, Helene Wecker's debut novel The Golem and the Jinni weaves strands of Yiddish and Middle Eastern literature, historical fiction and magical fable, into a wondrously inventive and unforgettable tale.</description>

      <![CDATA[I liked everything in this book except how the jinni and the golem turned out to be connected. It's terrible to say that something felt too far-fetched in a story about a golem and a jinni who meet in New York, but that part did. <br />In the end, the strength of this book is the characters.

  <description>ONCE UPON A TIME, A HISTORICAL ROMANCE AUTHOR CREATED A FAMILY…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not just any family. Eight brothers and sisters, assorted in-laws, sons and daughters, nieces and nephews, (not to mention an overweight corgi), plus an irrepressible matriarch who’s a match for any of them… These are the Bridgertons: less a family than a force of nature. Through eight bestselling novels, readers laughed, cried, and fell in love. But they wanted more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so the readers asked the author…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened next? Does Simon ever read his father’s letters? Do Francesca and Michael become parents? Who would win in a Pall Mall grudge match?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does “The End” really have to be the end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with The Bridgertons: Happily Ever After, Julia Quinn delivers eight sexy, funny, and heartwarming “2nd epilogues,” plus a bonus story about none other than the wise and witty Violet Bridgerton herself. So get to know the Bridgertons all over again—because Happily Ever After is a whole lot of fun.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He thinks she's an annoying know-it-all...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugh Prentice has never had patience for dramatic females, and if Lady Sarah Pleinsworth has ever been acquainted with the words shy or retiring, she's long since tossed them out the window. Besides, a reckless duel has left this brilliant mathematician with a ruined leg, and now he could never court a woman like Sarah, much less dream of marrying her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She thinks he's just plain mad...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah has never forgiven Hugh for the duel he fought that nearly destroyed her family. But even if she could find a way to forgive him, it wouldn't matter. She doesn't care that his leg is less than perfect, it's his personality she can't abide. But forced to spend a week in close company they discover that first impressions are not always reliable. And when one kiss leads to two, three, and four, the mathematician may lose count, and the lady may, for the first time, find herself speechless ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Julia Quinn's enchanting third novel in the Smythe-Smith quartet is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud and tug at your heartstrings in equal measures.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'It is very pleasant dining with a bachelor...I only hope it is not improper; so many pleasant things are!'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A portrait of the residents of an English country town in the mid nineteenth century, &lt;i&gt;Cranford&lt;/i&gt; relates the adventures of Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two middle-aged spinster sisters striving to live with dignity in reduced circumstances. Through a series of vignettes, Elizabeth Gaskell portrays a community governed by old-fashioned habits and dominated by friendships between women. Her wry account of rural life is undercut, however, by tragedy in its depiction of such troubling events as Matty's bankruptcy, the violent death of Captain Brown or the unwitting cruelty of Peter Jenkyns. Written with acute observation, &lt;i&gt;Cranford&lt;/i&gt; is by turns affectionate, moving and darkly satirical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her introduction, Patricia Ingham discusses &lt;i&gt;Cranford&lt;/i&gt; in relation to Gaskell's own past and as a work of irony in the manner of Jane Austen. She also considers the implications of the novel in terms of class and empire. This edition also includes further reading, notes, and an appendix on the significance of 'Fashion at Cranford'.</description>

  <description>Jack Audley has been a highwayman. A soldier. And he has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; been a rogue. What he is not, and never wanted to be, is a peer of the realm, responsible for an ancient heritage and the livelihood of hundreds. But when he is recognized as the long-lost son of the House of Wyndham, his carefree life is over. And if his birth proves to be legitimate, then he will find himself with the one title he never wanted: Duke of Wyndham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Eversleigh has spent the last five years toiling as the companion to the dowager Duchess of Wyndham. It is a thankless job, with very little break from the routine... until Jack Audley lands in her life, all rakish smiles and debonair charm. He is not a man who takes no for an answer, and when she is in his arms, she's not a woman who wants to say no. But if he is the true duke, then he is the one man she can never have...</description>

  <description>Twenty-four-year-old Olivia Taylor Jones has the perfect life. The only daughter of a wealthy, prominent Chicago family, she has an Ivy League education, pursues volunteerism and philanthropy, and is engaged to a handsome young tech firm CEO with political ambitions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Olivia’s world is shattered when she learns that she’s adopted. Her real parents? Todd and Pamela Larsen, notorious serial killers serving a life sentence. When the news brings a maelstrom of unwanted publicity to her adopted family and fiancé, Olivia decides to find out the truth about the Larsens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia ends up in the small town of Cainsville, Illinois, an old and cloistered community that takes a particular interest in both Olivia and her efforts to uncover her birth parents’ past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aided by her mother’s former lawyer, Gabriel Walsh, Olivia focuses on the Larsens’ last crime, the one her birth mother swears will prove their innocence. But as she and Gabriel start investigating the case, Olivia finds herself drawing on abilities that have remained hidden since her childhood, gifts that make her both a valuable addition to Cainsville and deeply vulnerable to unknown enemies. Because there are darker secrets behind her new home and powers lurking in the shadows that have their own plans for her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Julie Garwood returns with a novel of family drama, suspense, and—of course—romance. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Peyton Lockhart and her sisters have inherited Bishop’s Cove, a small, luxurious oceanfront resort, but it comes with a condition: The girls must run the resort for one year and show a profit—only then will they own it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A graduate of a prestigious French culinary school, Peyton has just lost her job as a food critic. Out of work and in a bad place personally, a year doing something completely different sounds wonderful.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There are countless challenges and too many people who want to stop the sisters from succeeding. Among them are Peyton’s contentious cousins, who are outraged that they didn’t inherit the resort, as well as a powerful group of land developers who have been eyeing the coveted beachfront property.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It’s soon apparent to Peyton that their efforts are being sabotaged, but she refuses to let the threats scare her—until she’s nearly killed. She calls on her childhood friend and protector, Finn MacBain, now with the FBI, and asks for his help. He saved her life once; he can do it again.</description>

But whether they’re writing about vampires, faeries, angels, or other magical beings, each author explores the strength and resilience of the human heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspenseful, funny, or romantic, the stories in Enthralled will leave you moved.&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Enthralled" is a collection of 14 original teen paranormal short stories from some of today's bestselling YA talent, united with the common theme of road trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Contents:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction by Melissa Marr &amp;amp; Kelley Armstrong&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni’s Farewell by Claudia Gray&lt;br /&gt;Scenic Route [The Forest of Hands and Teeth] by Carrie Ryan&lt;br /&gt;Red Run by Kami Garcia&lt;br /&gt;Things About Love [As You Wish] by Jackson Pearce&lt;br /&gt;Niederwald [Soul Screamers] by Rachel Vincent&lt;br /&gt;Merely Mortal [Wicked Lovely] by Melissa Marr&lt;br /&gt;Facing Facts [Darkest Powers] by Kelley Armstrong&lt;br /&gt;Let’s Get this Undead Show on the Road by Sarah Rees Brennan&lt;br /&gt;Bridge by Jeri Smith-Ready&lt;br /&gt;Skin Contact by Kimberly Derting&lt;br /&gt;Leaving by Ally Condie&lt;br /&gt;At The Late Night, Double Feature, Picture Show by Jessica Verday&lt;br /&gt;IV League by Margaret Stohl&lt;br /&gt;Gargouille by Mary E.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;To win her love...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extremely wealthy laird, Gowan Stoughton, Duke of Kinross, can have any of the maidens at the ball he attends. The only problem is they are all English and Gowan is not so certain they are suitable. He is accustomed to the hard-working lasses from his Highlands, not these dainty noblewomen who spend their days drinking tea or some other such nonsense. But then he makes the acquaintance of Lady Edith Gilchrist. Utterly bewitched by the emerald-eyed beauty with lush golden locks, he knows he must have her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;He must free her from her tower...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Edie" had the misfortune of being dreadfully ill at her debut ball and barely remembers what Gowan looks like. Even worse, she accepted his proposal the following day. Edie's only true passion is playing music—until Gowan writes a scandalous letter and stirs the most irresistible desire. Yet when they marry, Edie realizes her husband needs a lesson and locks herself in a tower. Somehow Gowan must find a way to enter the tower and convince his new bride that she belongs in his arms.</description>

  <description>A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who hold sway over an age of enforced peace are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes &lt;i&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Storm of Swords&lt;/i&gt;. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R.R. Martin stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.</description>

  <description>'R' is a zombie. He has no name, no memories and no pulse, but he has dreams. He is a little different from his fellow Dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amongst the ruins of an abandoned city, R meets a girl. Her name is Julie and she is the opposite of everything he knows - warm and bright and very much alive, she is a blast of colour in a dreary grey landscape. For reasons he can't understand, R chooses to save Julie instead of eating her, and a tense yet strangely tender relationship begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has never happened before. It breaks the rules and defies logic, but R is no longer content with life in the grave. He wants to breathe again, he wants to live, and Julie wants to help him. But their grim, rotting world won't be changed without a fight...</description>

  <description>In Allison Sekemoto's world, there is one rule left: Blood calls to blood &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has done the unthinkable: died so that she might continue to live. Cast out of Eden and separated from the boy she dared to love, Allie will follow the call of blood to save her creator, Kanin, from the psychotic vampire Sarren. But when the trail leads to Allie's birthplace in New Covington, what Allie finds there will change the world forever—and possibly end human and vampire existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a new plague on the rise, a strain of the Red Lung virus that wiped out most of humanity generations ago—and this strain is deadly to humans and vampires alike. The only hope for a cure lies in the secrets Kanin carries, if Allie can get to him in time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allison thought that immortality was forever. But now, with eternity itself hanging in the balance, the lines between human and monster will blur even further, and Allie must face another choice she could never have imagined having to make.</description>

  <description>Nola Leary would have been content to stay in Kilcairy, Ireland, healing villagers at her family’s clinic with a mix of magic and modern medicine. But a series of ill-timed omens and a deathbed promise to her grandmother have sent her on a quest to Half-Moon Hollow, Kentucky, to secure her family’s magical potency for the next generation. Her supernatural task? To unearth four artifacts hidden by her grandfather before a rival magical family beats her to it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Complication One: Her grandfather was Mr. Wainwright and the artifacts are lost somewhere in what is now Jane Jameson's book shop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complication Two: her new neighbor, Jed Trudeau, who keeps turning up half naked at the strangest times, a distraction Nola doesn't need. And teaming up with a real-life Adonis is as dangerous as it sounds, especially when he’s got the face of an angel and the abs of a washboard—can Nola complete her mission before falling completely under his spell?</description>

      <![CDATA[For the story I'd probably give it a three but Harper is so good at elevating her characters to another level with outstanding dialogue that I have to bump it up to a four just for that. <br />It's Half Moon Hollow. It's Molly Harper. There's some fun Dick Cheaney action. What more do you need to know?...]]>

  <description>Here is the first volume in George R. R. Martin’s magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GAME OF THRONES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;source: georgerrmartin.com</description>

  <description>Every year, the average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar. They ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, almost none of which comes from salt shakers. It comes from processed food, an industry that hauls in $1 trillion in annual sales. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Salt Sugar Fat&lt;/i&gt;, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how this happened. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century--including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more--Moss’s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He goes inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the "bliss point" of sugary beverages or enhance the "mouth feel" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing techniques taken straight from tobacco company playbooks to redirect concerns about the health risks of products. He talks to concerned executives who explain that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: the industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat.</description>

  <description>Violet Ambrose is grappling with two major issues: Jay Heaton and her morbid secret ability. While the sixteen-year-old is confused by her new feelings for her best friend since childhood, she is more disturbed by her "power" to sense dead bodies—or at least those that have been murdered. Since she was a little girl, she has felt the echoes that the dead leave behind in the world... &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the imprints that attach to their killers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet has never considered her strange talent to be a gift; it mostly just led her to find the dead birds her cat left for her. But now that a serial killer is terrorizing her small town, and the echoes of the local girls he's claimed haunt her daily, she realizes she might be the only person who can stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his fierce protectiveness over her, Jay reluctantly agrees to help Violet on her quest to find the murderer—and Violet is unnerved by her hope that Jay's intentions are &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more than friendly. But even as she's falling intensely in love, Violet is getting closer and closer to discovering a killer... and becoming his prey herself.</description>

  <description>To want what you’re not supposed to have…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is only nineteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is his new stepfather’s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits. His famous father’s guilt money, his mother’s desperation to win his love, and his charm are the three reasons he has never been told no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaire Wynn left her small farmhouse in Alabama, after her mother passed away, to move in with her father and his new wife in their sprawling beach house along the Florida gulf coast. She isn’t prepared for the lifestyle change and she knows she’ll never fit into this world. Then there is her sexy stepbrother who her father leaves her with for the summer while he runs off to Paris with his wife. Rush is as spoiled as he is gorgeous. He is also getting under her skin. She knows he is anything but good for her and that he’ll never be faithful to anyone. He is jaded and has secrets Blaire knows she may never uncover but even knowing all of that…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaire just may have fallen too far.</description>

That's usually a good sign that I probably like the author so I think I'll read the rest of the series. It's very Gothic a...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once the flames are ignited . . .&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miranda Ellis is a woman tormented. Plagued since birth by a strange and powerful gift, she has spent her entire life struggling to control her exceptional abilities. Yet one innocent but irreversible mistake has left her family's fortune decimated and forced her to wed London's most nefarious nobleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They will burn for eternity . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord Benjamin Archer is no ordinary man. Doomed to hide his disfigured face behind masks, Archer knows it's selfish to take Miranda as his bride. Yet he can't help being drawn to the flame-haired beauty whose touch sparks a passion he hasn't felt in a lifetime. When Archer is accused of a series of gruesome murders, he gives in to the beastly nature he has fought so hard to hide from the world. But the curse that haunts him cannot be denied. Now, to save his soul, Miranda will enter a world of dark magic and darker intrigue. For only she can see the man hiding behind the mask.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm SO glad I read this book. While I didn't love Archer I did really like Miranda. As I love Paranormal and Historical Romance, I'm also glad when I find a combination of the too that works. Firelight is a reworking of Beauty and the Beast with CRAZY sexual tension. There are many lusty glances...]]>

  <description>The first young adult book by a #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whidbey Island may be only a ferry ride from Seattle, but it's a world apart. When Becca King arrives there, she doesn't suspect the island will become her home for the next four years. Put at risk by her ability to hear "whispers"--the thoughts of others--Becca is on the run from her stepfather, whose criminal activities she has discovered. Stranded and alone, Becca is soon befriended by Derric, a Ugandon orphan adopted by a local family; Seth, a kindhearted musician and high school dropout; Debbie, a recovering alcoholic who takes her in; and Diana, with whom Becca shares a mysterious psychic connection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This compelling coming-of-age story, the first of an ongoing sequence of books set on Whidbey Island, has elements of mystery, the paranormal, and romance. Elizabeth George, bestselling author of the Inspector Lynley crime novels, brings her elegant style, intricate plotting, incisive characterization, and top-notch storytelling to her first book for teens.</description>

      <![CDATA[While The Edge of Nowhere has some paranormal elements, it is, first and foremost a mystery and it reads like one. I found the pacing and the set-ups fit perfectly into a standard mystery form and enjoyed discovering the "who-dunnit". The actual "who" was a bit anticlimactic to me, but the end of...]]>

  <description>Step into the glittering world of Regency and prepare to have your hearts warmed by Julia Quinn, Eloisa James and Connie Brockway . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During their annual Christmas pilgrimage to Scotland to visit their aged uncle in his decrepit castle, the Comte de Rocheforte and his cousin, Earl of Oakley, are presented with unique gifts: their uncle has raided an English lord's Christmas party and kidnapped four lovely would-be brides for his heirs to choose from . . . as well as one very angry duke, Lord Bretton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As snow isolates the castle, and as hours grow into days, the most honourable intentions give away to temptations as surprising as they are irresistible.</description>

  <description>Rich and handsome, darling of the ton, the hope of ambitious mothers and despair of his sisters, the Marquis of Alverstoke at seven-and-thirty sees no reason to put himself out for anyone. Until a distant connection, ignorant of his selfishness, applies to him for help. When Frederica Merriville brings her three younger siblings to London determined to secure a brilliant marriage for her beautiful sister, Charis, she seeks out their distant cousin the Marquis of Alverstoke. Lovely, competent, and refreshingly straightforward, Frederica makes such a strong impression that to his own amazement, the Marquis agrees to help launch them all into society. Lord Alverstoke can't resist wanting to help her Normally wary of his family, which includes two overbearing sisters and innumerable favor-seekers, Lord Alverstoke does his best to keep his distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merrivales, a family of solid social standing, have fallen into unhappy financial straits, and the marriage might deliver them from this situation. They have come to London for the glittering social season, in order to give young and beautiful Charis a chance to make a good marriage, she may be as hen-witted as she is beautiful. Frederica herself, a gay and witty charmer, believes herself happily beyond marriageable age -- she is twenty-four, after all. They boys are also very differents, Jessamy is an interesting boy, and Felix an engaging scamp. Frederica is saddened when her prime prospect, their distant cousin Lord Alverstroke, seems totally uninterested. But when they are introduced to London society by the Marquis of Alverstoke, they find themselves both besieged by more suitors than they can possibly handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his enterprising - and altogether entertaining - country cousins getting into one scrape after another right on his doorstep, before he knows it the cold Marquis finds himself dangerously embroiled and plunged into one drama after another by the large and irrepressible Merriville family, Alverstoke is surprised to find himself far from bored. He is amazed to find herself, unknowingly, finds himself thoroughly beguiled by his distand cousins and, most intriguing of all, their strongminded sister Frederica, who seems more concerned with her family's welfare than his own distinguished attentions. And when his younger cousin ends up in a terrible accident, the dutiful Marquis becomes as chivalrous as ever to the those in his charge. And Frederica begins to imagine the Marquis as match... for herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This whole grim reaper thing should have come with a manual.&lt;br /&gt;Or a diagram of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;A flow chart would have been nice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is a part-time private investigator and full-time grim reaper. Meaning, she sees dead people. Really. And it's her job to convince them to "go into the light." But when these very dead people have died under less than ideal circumstances (like murder), sometimes they want Charley to bring the bad guys to justice. Complicating matters are the intensely hot dreams she's been having about an entity who has been following her all her life...and it turns out he might not be dead after all. In fact, he might be something else entirely. But what does he want with Charley? And why can't she seem to resist him? And what does she have to lose by giving in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With scorching-hot tension and high-octane humor, &lt;i&gt;First Grave on the Right&lt;/i&gt; is your signpost to paranormal suspense of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Eliza is in a full-blown panic. Her notebook has been stolen—the one that lists everything she wants but is afraid to go after. And the absolute worst person in the world has it: her ex-boyfriend, Cooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like it’s not enough Cooper was lying to Eliza for their entire relationship, now he and his friends are blackmailing her. They’re giving her just one night to complete the most humiliating tasks on her list or they’ll post her secrets online—including the ones that aren’t just about her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eliza’s sure of only one thing: she isn’t going down without a fight. Cooper may have what’s left of her dignity, but she’s not the only one with something to hide …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hilarious and sweet teen novel by Lauren Barnholdt, the author of &lt;i&gt;Two-Way Street&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Emily and Ashton couldn't be more different. She's quiet and sweet, he's popular and outspoken. And when he flirts with her one night at the party she's throwing, Emily knows she should stay away. It's never a good idea to get involved with the hottest guy in school; you're only setting yourself up for heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even though Ashton might come across as cool and confident, he can't stop thinking about Emily. And by the end of the night, these two just might be falling hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from both Emily and Ashton's point of view, this is the second novella in the romantic At the Party series by Lauren Barnholdt, author of Two-Way Street and One Night That Changes Everything</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lady Caroline Linford is horrified to discover...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;her fiancé, the Marquis of Winchilsea, in the arms of another woman. Unfortunately, Victorian society considers such masculine peccadilloes a trifle; canceling their imminent wedding would be unthinkable. But Caroline's wish is for the man she is to marry to desire only her... and she seeks lessons in the art of romance from the best teacher: London's most notorious rake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Braden Granville may be a famous lover...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but he has no intention of taking part in Caroline's scheme — until he learns she has something he wants: the name of his own unfaithful fiancée's lover. As their passionate tutelage begins, sparks fly — and the lines between teacher and student fall away. Now there is just one last lesson to learn: on the subject of true love, the heart chooses its own unpredictable ways.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love ignites in the City That Never Sleeps, but can it last?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopeless romantic Isla has had a crush on introspective cartoonist Josh since their first year at the School of America in Paris. And after a chance encounter in Manhattan over the summer, romance might be closer than Isla imagined. But as they begin their senior year back in France, Isla and Josh are forced to confront the challenges every young couple must face, including family drama, uncertainty about their college futures, and the very real possibility of being apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring cameos from fan-favorites Anna, Étienne, Lola, and Cricket, this sweet and sexy story of true love—set against the stunning backdrops of New York City, Paris, and Barcelona—is a swoonworthy conclusion to Stephanie Perkins’s beloved series.</description>

      <![CDATA[Really good. If Lola suffers, it's in comparison to Anna and the French Kiss. It's not as good but still awesome. Stephanie Perkins writes interesting characters plus THANK YOU for writing boys that are not tall, dark brooding and mysterious. I love the normal-ness of her boy characters. ]]>

  <description>Anna is looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. Which is why she is less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris--until she meets Étienne St. Clair. Smart, charming, &lt;i&gt;beautiful&lt;/i&gt;, Étienne has it all...including a serious girlfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the City of Light, wishes have a way of coming true. Will a year of romantic near-misses end with their long-awaited French kiss?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Maddie Moore's whole life needs a makeover.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one fell swoop, Maddie loses her boyfriend (her decision) and her job (so &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; her decision). But rather than drowning her sorrows in bags of potato chips, Maddie leaves L.A. to claim the inheritance left by her free-spirited mother—a ramshackle inn nestled in the little coastal town of Lucky Harbor, Washington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over won't be easy. Yet Maddie sees the potential for a new home and a new career—if only she can convince her two half-sisters to join her in the adventure. But convincing Tara and Chloe will be difficult because the inn needs a big makeover too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contractor Maddie hires is a tall, dark-haired hottie whose eyes—and mouth—are making it hard for her to remember that she's sworn off men. Even harder will be Maddie's struggles to overcome the past, though she's about to discover that there's no better place to call home than Lucky Harbor.</description>

      <![CDATA[A perfect light, easy-going romance. Nothing to dislike here. Great characters and some very funny lines. My favourite advice was:<br /><br />"Don't take life too seriously. After all none of us are getting out alive anyway.” <br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more Jill Shalvis after this.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time, I was a little girl who disappeared. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Once upon a time, my name was not Alice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Once upon a time, I didn't know how lucky I was.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Alice was ten, Ray took her away from her family, her friends -- her life. She learned to give up all power, to endure all pain. She waited for the nightmare to be over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now Alice is fifteen and Ray still has her, but he speaks more and more of her death. He does not know it is what she longs for. She does not know he has something more terrifying than death in mind for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This is Alice's story. It is one you have never heard, and one you will never, ever forget.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a very disturbing book and impossible to really rate fairly. I read it right after reading Stolen by Lucy Christopher and it was a good contrast to the "nice" kidnapper in that book. The writing is good and you sink right into "Alice"s story, but because it's only horrible (rape and abuse...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It happened like this. I was stolen from an airport. Taken from everything I knew, everything I was used to. Taken to sand and heat, dirt and danger. And he expected me to love him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A letter from nowhere. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Gemma is kidnapped from Bangkok airport and taken to the Australian Outback. This wild and desolate landscape becomes almost a character in the book, so vividly is it described. Ty, her captor, is no stereotype. He is young, fit and completely gorgeous. This new life in the wilderness has been years in the planning. He loves only her, wants only her. Under the hot glare of the Australian sun, cut off from the world outside, can the force of his love make Gemma love him back? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story takes the form of a letter, written by Gemma to Ty, reflecting on those strange and disturbing months in the outback. Months when the lines between love and obsession, and love and dependency, blur until they don't exist--almost.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had trouble remembering this was supposed to be a regency romance. I think I ended up picturing the characters in modern day clothes. Also, I thought the ending was really weak, but Jessica Benson does a good job writing likable and engaging characters who save the story.]]>

  <description>The Unit are closing in and Demos needs one of his team to go deep cover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Suki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fashion obsessed, boy-crazy and more than a little kooky, Suki is a mind reader with a special talent for buying shoes and for listening in on private conversations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tasked with infiltrating the enemy (namely Jack and Alex) Suki rises to the challenge, leaving a trail of chaos, destruction (and a large room service bill) in her wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prequel to the events of Hunting Lila and including many of the characters from the book, this short story told through Suki’s eyes, will have you laughing out loud and gripping the edge of your seat.</description>

  <description>Sean Kowalski no sooner leaves the army than he's recruited by Emma Shaw to be her fake fiance. Emma needs to produce a husband-to-be for her grandmother's upcoming visit, and, though Sean doesn't like the deception, he could use the landscaping job Emma's offering while he decides what to do with his civilian life. And, despite his attraction to Emma, there's no chance he'll fall for a woman with deep roots in a town he's not planning to call home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma's not interested in a real relationship either; not with a man whose idea of home is wherever he drops his duffel bag. No matter how amazing his "pretend" kisses are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;70,000 words</description>

  <description>From&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Maggie Shayne comes the first novel in her thrilling new trilogy, THE PORTAL She was born to save what he is sworn to destroy... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lapsed Wiccan, Indira Simon doesn't believe in magic anymore. But when strange dreams of being sacrificed to an ancient Babylonian god have her waking up with real rope burns on her wrists, she's forced to acknowledge that she may have been too hasty in her rejection of the unknown. Then she meets mysterious and handsome Father Tomas. Emerging from the secrecy of an obscure Gnostic sect, he arrives with stories of a demon, a trio of warrior witches-and Indira's sacred calling. Yet there's something even Tomas doesn't know, an inescapable truth that will force him to choose between saving the life of the woman he's come to love-and saving the world.</description>

  <description>Dr. Melanie Lipton is no stranger to the supernatural. She knows immortals better than they know themselves, right down to their stubborn little genes. So although a handsome rogue immortal seems suspicious to her colleagues, Sebastien Newcombe intrigues Melanie. His history is checkered, his scars are impressive, and his ideas are daring. But it's not his ideas that have Melanie fighting off surges of desire . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bastien is used to being the bad guy. In fact, he can't remember the last time he had an ally he could trust. But Melanie is different — and under her calm, professional exterior he senses a passion beyond anything in his centuries of experience. Giving in to temptation is out of the question — he can't put her in danger. But she isn't asking him . . .</description>

  <description>Ami isn't much for trusting strangers. She has a hard time trusting anyone. But she's no coward, and she's no pushover in the protection department either. So when she comes across a mysterious warrior taking on eight deranged vampires on his own, she doesn't hesitate to save his bacon. Of course, that was before she realized what one little rescue would get her into . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus Grayden has been an immortal protector of humanity for eight hundred years, and at the moment he's not interested in backup. From the moment Ami arrives in his life, he can't deny that she's strong, smart, and extremely skilled at watching his back. But she's also destroying his protective solitude and stirring desires he can't bear to awaken. After all, whatever her secrets — how can she defeat death itself?</description>

  <description>In this dazzling, sensual novel, Dianne Duvall beckons readers into a world of vampires, immortals, and humans with extraordinary gifts…where passion can last forever, if you’re willing to pay the price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, Sarah Bingham’s biggest challenge was making her students pay attention in class. Now, after rescuing a wounded stranger, she’s landed in the middle of a battle between corrupt vampires and powerful immortals who also need blood to survive. Roland Warbrook is the most compelling man Sarah has ever laid hands on. But his desire for her is mingled with a hunger he can barely control…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his nine centuries of immortal existence, no woman has tempted Roland as much as Sarah. But asking her to love him is impossible—when it means forfeiting the world she’s always known, and the life he would do anything to protect...</description>

  <description>Luca Minaldi is powerful, rich and mesmerizing. But he is also a reclusive enigma. He lives in Malta, a fairytale-like place filled with sunshine and sea, beauty and secrets. And Luca’s darkest of secrets is the best kept of them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva Talbot is spending the summer in Malta to finish up her doctoral dissertation. When she meets Luca, a mysterious and handsome shipping magnate, there is an instant attraction. He has a disturbing and beautiful energy that she has never felt before. But she senses the darkness that lives within him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva is hired to care for his mother, a woman who suffers from dementia, but it is Luca who Eva will eventually risk everything to save. She desperately wants to reach inside of him and fix what is broken, while at the same time, she knows that she is falling for him. Her life becomes a swirling chaos of darkness and romance, of secrets and mystery. And the question that emerges will become the most important answer of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she save Luca from the darkness that plagues him without losing herself? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is a matter of life or death.</description>

  <description>Allie lost everything the night her boyfriend, Trip, died in a horrible car accident—including her memory of the event. As their small town mourns his death, Allie is afraid to remember because doing so means delving into what she’s kept hidden for so long: the horrible reality of their abusive relationship.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the police reopen the investigation, it casts suspicion on Allie and her best friend, Blake, especially as their budding romance raises eyebrows around town. Allie knows she must tell the truth. Can she reach deep enough to remember that night so she can finally break free? Debut writer Jennifer Shaw Wolf takes readers on an emotional ride through the murky waters of love, shame, and, ultimately, forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She won't rest until she's sent every walking corpse back to its grave. Forever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone had told Alice Bell that her entire life would change course between one heartbeat and the next, she would have laughed. From blissful to tragic, innocent to ruined? Please. But that's all it took. One heartbeat. A blink, a breath, a second, and everything she knew and loved was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father was right. The monsters are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avenge her family, Ali must learn to fight the undead. To survive, she must learn to trust the baddest of the bad boys, Cole Holland. But Cole has secrets of his own, and if Ali isn't careful, those secrets might just prove to be more dangerous than the zombies.</description>

At Parford Manor, he intends to take his place as the rightful heir to the dukedom, and settle an old score with the current duke once and for all. But when he arrives, he finds himself drawn to a tempting beauty who has the power to undo all his dreams of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And her dearest love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Margaret knows she should despise the man who’s stolen her fortune and her father’s legacy—the man she’s been ordered to spy on in the guise of a nurse.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She will not give up…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months ago, governess Serena Barton was let go from her position. Unable to find new work, she’s demanding compensation from the man who got her sacked: a petty, selfish, swinish duke. But it’s not the duke she fears. It’s his merciless man of business—the man known as the Wolf of Clermont. The formidable former pugilist has a black reputation for handling all the duke’s dirty business, and when the duke turns her case over to him, she doesn’t stand a chance. But she can’t stop trying—not with her entire future at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He cannot give in…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Marshall is a man of ruthless ambition—a characteristic that has served him well, elevating the coal miner’s son to the right hand man of a duke. When his employer orders him to get rid of the pestering governess by fair means or foul, it’s just another day at the office. Unfortunately, fair means don’t work on Serena, and as he comes to know her, he discovers that he can’t bear to use foul ones. But everything he has worked for depends upon seeing her gone.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes love is an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, it’s a strategy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Minerva Lane is a quiet, bespectacled wallflower, and she wants to keep it that way. After all, the last time she was the center of attention, it ended badly—so badly that she changed her name to escape her scandalous past. Wallflowers may not be the prettiest of blooms, but at least they don't get trampled. So when a handsome duke comes to town, the last thing she wants is his attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But that is precisely what she gets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clermont, is not fooled. When Minnie figures out what he’s up to, he realizes there is more to her than her spectacles and her quiet ways. And he’s determined to lay her every secret bare before she can discover his. But this time, one shy miss may prove to be more than his match...</description>

  <description>At the age of eighteen, in that first golden Oxford summer, Milly was up for anything. Rupert and his American lover Allan were all part of her new, exciting life, and when Rupert suggested to her that she and Allan should get married, just so that Allan could stay in the country, Milly didn't hesitate, and to make it seem real she dressed up in cheap wedding finery and posed on the steps of the registry office for photographs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Milly is a very different person. Engaged to Simon - who is wealthy, serious, and believes her to be perfect - she is facing the biggest and most elaborate wedding imaginable. Her mother has it planned to the finest detail, from the massive marquee to the sculpted ice swans filled with oysters. Her dreadful secret is locked away so securely she has almost persuaded herself that it doesn't exist - until, with only four days to go, her past catches up with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, her carefully constructed world is about to crash in ruins around her. How can she tell Simon she's already married? How can she tell her mother? But as the crisis develops, more secrets are revealed than Milly could possibly have realised...</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>An all-day scavenger hunt in the name of eternal small-town glory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only a week until graduation, there's one last thing Mary and her friends must do together: participate in the Oyster Point High Official Unofficial Senior Week Scavenger Hunt. And Mary is determined to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary lost her spot at Georgetown to self-professed "it" bully Jake Barbone, and she's not about to lose again. But everyone is racing for the finish line with complicated motives, and the team's all-night adventure becomes all-night drama as shifting alliances, flared tempers, and crushing crushes take over. As the items and points pile up, Mary and her team must reinvent their strategy--and themselves--in order to win.</description>

  <description>Everyone thinks their parents are embarrassing, but Hannah knows she's got them all beat. Her dad made a fortune showcasing photos of pretty girls and his party lifestyle all over the Internet, and her mom was once one of her dad's girlfriends and is now the star of her own website. After getting the wrong kind of attention for way too long, Hannah has mastered the art of staying under the radar...and that's just how she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, that doesn't help her get noticed by her crush. Hannah's sure that gorgeous, sensitive Josh is her soul mate. But trying to get him to notice her; wondering why she suddenly can't stop thinking about another guy, Finn; and dealing with her parents make Hannah feel like she's going crazy. Yet she's determined to make things work out the way she wants—only what she wants may not be what she needs...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, Elizabeth Scott has created a world so painfully funny and a cast of characters so heartbreakingly real that you'll love being a part of it from unexpected start to triumphant finish.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kate Brown's life has gone downhill fast.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her father has quit his job to sell vitamins at the mall, and Kate is forced to work with him. Her best friend has become popular, and now she acts like Kate's invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there's Will. Gorgeous, unattainable Will, whom Kate acts like she can't stand even though she can't stop thinking about him. When Will starts acting interested, Kate hates herself for wanting him when she's sure she's just his latest conquest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate figures that the only way things will ever stop hurting so much is if she keeps to herself and stops caring about anyone or anything.

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Bianca Piper is cynical and loyal, and she doesn’t think she’s the prettiest of her friends by a long shot. She’s also way too smart to fall for the charms of man-slut and slimy school hottie Wesley Rush. In fact, Bianca hates him. And when he nicknames her “the Duff,” she throws her Coke in his face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things aren’t so great at home right now, and Bianca is desperate for a distraction. She ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it. Eager for escape, Bianca throws herself into a closeted enemies-with-benefits relationship with him. &lt;p&gt;Until it all goes horribly awry. It turns out Wesley isn’t such a bad listener, and his life is pretty screwed up, too. Suddenly Bianca realizes with absolute horror that she’s falling for the guy she thought she hated more than anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Kiss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Leah did—only she really shouldn’t have—one hot night at a country club party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crush&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Leah has—only she really shouldn’t have—on the guy with the green eyes, the guy who is not her perfect boyfriend, the guy who does not fit in her picture-perfect life, the guy her sisters will only mock and her mother will never approve of. Not in a million years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Collide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when everything you always thought you wanted—having cool friends, being class valedictorian and homecoming queen—runs smack into everything it turns out you really do want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiss. Crush. Collide.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Leah and Porter, summer is only the beginning.</description>

  <description>Amy (a.k.a. Bird) seems to have the perfect life: loving parents, a hot boyfriend, the best friend ever. She even writes an online advice column, full of Top Tips, to help other teens take control of their lives. But after a new guy shows up at school, Bird can’t seem to follow her own wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pete is the consummate bad boy. He’s everything Bird is not: wild, unambitious and more than a little dangerous. Although she knows he’s trouble, Bird can’t stay away. And the more drawn she is to Pete, the more cracks are revealed in her relationship with Griffin, her doting boyfriend. Meanwhile, her parents’ marriage is also fracturing, possibly for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bird is way out of her comfort zone. All it takes is one mistake, one momentary loss of control, for her entire future to be blown away . . .</description>

  <description>This novel opens on the first day of Hannah's senior year, but the story really starts on the last day of her junior year. That's when Hannah not only gets dumped by her boyfriend, Ryan, but she also finds out her best friend, Ava, is going to be gone for the entire summer. But Ava's boyfriend, Noah, is definitely around--and such a good guy that he snags Hannah a job at the diner where he works. Hannah and Noah move from coworkers, to friends....and one night, to something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's back to school, where Hannah will see Ryan, Ava, and Noah all in one place. Over the course of the day secrets and betrayals are revealed, and alliances are broken and reformed. In the end, Hannah will learn a lot about love, friendship...and herself.</description>

  <description>There are two sides to every breakup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Jordan and Courtney, totally in love. Sure, they were an unlikely high school couple. But they clicked; it worked. They're even going to the same college, and driving cross-country together for orientation. &lt;p&gt; Then Jordan dumps Courtney -- for a girl he met on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's too late to change plans, so the road trip is on. Courtney's heartbroken, but figures she can tough it out for a few days. &lt;i&gt;La la la&lt;/i&gt; -- this is Courtney pretending not to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a strange twist, Jordan cares. A lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turns out, he's got a secret or two that he's not telling Courtney. And it has everything to do with why they broke up, why they can't get back together, and how, in spite of it all, this couple is destined for each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this humorous love story from the author of "Two-Way Street", an unlikely romance is the best sort of surprise—but the wrong secret can ruin everything. Kelsey’s not going to let one mistake ruin her life. Sure, she got kicked out of prep school and all her old friends are shutting her out. But Kelsey’s focused on her future, and she’s determined to get back on track at Concordia High.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isaac’s been kicked out of more schools than he can count. Since his father’s a state senator, Isaac’s life is under constant scrutiny—but Concordia High’s his last stop before boarding school, so Isaac’s hoping to fly under the radar and try to stay put for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kelsey and Isaac meet, it’s anything but love at first sight. She thinks he’s an entitled brat, and he thinks she’s a stuck-up snob. So it surprises them both when they start to fall for each other. Kelsey’s happy for the first time in months, and Isaac’s never felt this way about anyone before. But nothing’s ever completely perfect. Everyone has secrets, and Isaac and Kelsey are no exceptions. These two may have fallen hard, but there’s one thing that can ruin it all: the truth.</description>

  <description>When Jacqueline follows her longtime boyfriend to the college of his choice, the last thing she expects is a breakup two months into sophomore year. After two weeks in shock, she wakes up to her new reality: she's single, attending a state university instead of a music conservatory, ignored by her former circle of friends, and failing a class for the first time in her life. Leaving a party alone, Jacqueline is assaulted by her ex's frat brother. Rescued by a stranger who seems to be in the right place at the right time, she wants nothing more than to forget the attack and that night - but her savior, Lucas, sits on the back row of her econ class, sketching in a notebook and staring at her. Her friends nominate him to be the perfect rebound. When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own. Suddenly appearances are everything, and knowing who to trust is anything but easy.</description>

  <description>While the other girls in the walled city-state of Baalboden learn to sew and dance, Rachel Adams learns to track and hunt. While they bend like reeds to the will of their male Protectors, she uses hers for sparring practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rachel's father fails to return from a courier mission and is declared dead, the city's brutal Commander assigns Rachel a new Protector: her father's apprentice, Logan—the boy she declared her love to and who turned her down two years before. Left with nothing but fierce belief in her father's survival, Rachel decides to escape and find him herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rachel and Logan battle their way through the Wasteland, stalked by a monster that can't be killed and an army of assassins out for blood, they discover romance, heartbreak, and a truth that will incite a war decades in the making.</description>

  <description>Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong. Even after months of painful physical therapy, Maggie walks with a limp. Her social life is nil and a scholarship to study abroad—her chance to escape everyone and their pitying stares—has been canceled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year in juvenile jail, Caleb’s free . . . if freedom means endless nagging from a transition coach and the prying eyes of the entire town. Coming home should feel good, but his family and ex-girlfriend seem like strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb and Maggie are outsiders, pigeon-holed as "criminal" and "freak." Then the truth emerges about what really happened the night of the accident and, once again, everything changes. It’s a bleak and tortuous journey for Caleb and Maggie, yet they end up finding comfort and strength from a surprising source: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"One thing my mother never knew, and would disapprove of most of all, was that I watched the Garretts. All the time."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Garretts are everything the Reeds are not. Loud, messy, affectionate. And every day from her rooftop perch, Samantha Reed wishes she was one of them . . . until one summer evening, Jase Garrett climbs up next to her and changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two fall fiercely for each other, stumbling through the awkwardness and awesomeness of first love, Jase's family embraces Samantha - even as she keeps him a secret from her own. Then something unthinkable happens, and the bottom drops out of Samantha's world. She's suddenly faced with an impossible decision. Which perfect family will save her? Or is it time she saved herself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A transporting debut about family, friendship, first romance, and how to be true to one person you love without betraying another.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I won't tell anyone, Echo. I promise." Noah tucked a curl behind my ear. It had been so long since someone touched me like he did. Why did it have to be Noah Hutchins? His dark brown eyes shifted to my covered arms. "You didn't do that-did you? It was done to you?" No one ever asked that question. They stared. They whispered. They laughed. But they never asked.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So wrong for each other...and yet so right.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows what happened the night Echo Emerson went from popular girl with jock boyfriend to gossiped-about outsider with "freaky" scars on her arms. Even Echo can't remember the whole truth of that horrible night. All she knows is that she wants everything to go back to normal. But when Noah Hutchins, the smoking-hot, girl-using loner in the black leather jacket, explodes into her life with his tough attitude and surprising understanding, Echo's world shifts in ways she could never have imagined. They should have nothing in common. And with the secrets they both keep, being together is pretty much&lt;i&gt; impossible&lt;/i&gt;. Yet the crazy attraction between them refuses to go away. And Echo has to ask herself just how far they can push the limits and what she'll risk for the one guy who might teach her how to love again...</description>

  <description>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. The young King Nash clings to his throne while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. The mountains and forests are filled with spies and thieves and lawless men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where Fire lives. With a wild, irresistible appearance and hair the color of flame, Fire is the last remaining human monster. Equally hated and adored, she had the unique ability to control minds, but she guards her power, unwilling to steal the secrets of innocent people. Especially when she has so many of her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Prince Brigan comes to bring her to King City, The royal family needs her help to uncover the plot against the king. Far away from home, Fire begins to realize there's more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only she weren't afraid of becoming the monster her father was.</description>

  <description>Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight—she’s a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king’s thug. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never expects to fall in love with beautiful Prince Po. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She never expects to learn the truth behind her Grace—or the terrible secret that lies hidden far away . . . a secret that could destroy all seven kingdoms with words alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With elegant, evocative prose and a cast of unforgettable characters, debut author Kristin Cashore creates a mesmerizing world, a death-defying adventure, and a heart-racing romance that will consume you, hold you captive, and leave you wanting more.</description>

  <description>A page-turning psychological mystery that is equal parts horror, humor, and romance, &lt;i&gt;Nevermore&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Varen—a Poe fan and Goth—and Isobel—a cheerleader and unlikely heroine. When an English Lit. project pairs the two, Isobel finds herself swept into Varen’s world, one that he has created in his notebook and in his mind, one where the terrifying stories of Edgar Allan Poe come to life. Isobel slowly learns that dreams and words can be much more powerful than she’d ever imagined. As labels of “Goth” and “cheerleader” fade away, Isobel and Varen slip into a consuming romance, braced against the ever-clearer horror that the most chilling realities are those within our own minds. When Isobel has a single chance to rescue Varen from the shadows of his nightmares, will she be able to save him—and herself?&lt;br /&gt;     Included in this eBook edition of &lt;i&gt;Nevermore&lt;/i&gt;, enjoy a free collection of Edgar Allan Poe’s poems and short stories!</description>

      <![CDATA[I didn't know what to expect but Nevermore was really interesting. I found myself drawn into what was happening. If you enjoy books about the fae/fairies you'll enjoy this. While it's based around the writing of Poe the story is very unique. Plus bonus points for an nontraditional hero. ]]>

  <description>Escape from the realm of the dead is impossible when someone there wants you back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Pierce Oliviera isn’t dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she is being held against her will in the dim, twilit world between heaven and hell, where the spirits of the deceased wait before embarking upon their final journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her captor, John Hayden, claims it’s for her own safety. Because not all the departed are dear. Some are so unhappy with where they ended up after leaving the Underworld, they’ve come back as Furies, intent on vengeance…on the one who sent them there and on the one whom he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Pierce might be safe from the Furies in the Underworld, far worse dangers could be lurking for her there…and they might have more to do with its ruler than with his enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And unless Pierce is careful, this time there’ll be no escape.</description>

      <![CDATA["I liked it" might be more accurate than "I really liked it" but I do like this series more than I would normally rate 3 star. I didn't seem like anything actually happened in Underworld. Mostly that characters wandered around looking for other people without any real action. I was e-reading so I...]]>

  <description>Though she tries returning to the life she knew before the accident, Pierce can't help but feel at once a part of this world, and apart from it. Yet she's never alone . . . because someone is always watching her. Escape from the realm of the dead is impossible when someone there wants you back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now she's moved to a new town. Maybe at her new school, she can start fresh. Maybe she can stop feeling so afraid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only she can't. Because even here, he finds her. That's how desperately he wants her back. She knows he's no guardian angel, and his dark world isn't exactly heaven, yet she can't stay away . . . especially since he always appears when she least expects it, but exactly when she needs him most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if she lets herself fall any further, she may just find herself back in the one place she most fears: the Underworld.</description>

  <description>HELL ON WHEELS&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After failing as a magician's assistant, a photographer, and most recently, a bride, Miranda Puckett takes a position as a driver for Beeline, Half-Moon Hollow's premiere vampire concierge service. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miranda's assignment? Driving Collin Sutherland, the world's most fastidious vampire from Washington to Kentucky, so he can deliver a mysterious black case to Council official Ophelia Lambert.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Collin, a paranoid, aristocratic vampire with a debilitating fear of flying, refuses to let the case out of his sight. Miranda needs this time on the road to decide whether to permanently cut her ties with the fiance that had an "emotional affair" with a childhood pal, but Collin’s neatnik tendencies are driving her around the bend. The man acts as if leaving a fast food wrapped on the passenger seat is reason for a full-on CDC de-contamination scrub-down of the car. All she can do is promise to stop intentionally doing the things that make his stiff upper lip twitch with irritation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more and more mishaps occur on the road trip from hell, Miranda and Collin work together to meet his delivery deadline. Hotel rooms are destroyed. Beloved cars are defiled. And somewhere along the line, client-driver hostilities become snarky flirtation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Collin and Miranda make it to the Hollow in one piece? And if they do, will Miranda leave old, safe relationships behind for something new and well, just plain weird?</description>
