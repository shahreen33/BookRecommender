  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the vein of Stephen King, Dean Koontz, or H.P. Lovecraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A subterranean horror thriller full of monsters, suspense and mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shadows creep beneath the sleepy, small town of Stone Hill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael came to visit his grandparents, but the home he once knew has changed beyond recognition. A demigod church leader is in control and performs bizarre miracles to a congregation all dressed in white. His followers patrol the streets by day. Phantoms roam the woods by night. People vanish without a trace. Michael wants to go home, but now his grandfather has disappeared too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a race to rescue him, Michael stumbles into an ancient labyrinth of tunnels below the church and discovers an evil that has terrorized the town for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep underground he will face his most disturbing fears within unimaginable darkness, but will he live to reveal its secrets?</description>

Trapped in a marriage to an abusive alcoholic, her only pleasure was in tossing a ball to a skinny dog she’d adopted from the local shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah &amp;amp; Zoey is the tale of these two women and the one remarkable dog who saved them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a story of the power of unconditional love.</description>

  <description>When a costly mistake ends Malorie Montgomery’s career, she returns to Cape Cod in search of a fresh start. But her plans for a new—and quiet—life are quickly derailed when she makes a grisly discovery in the woods, and her screams bring the one person from her past she’d hoped to avoid. Dean Slater, the ex-boyfriend who broke her heart in high school, now lives in the beachfront community that was supposed to be her haven…and he’s just as hot as he was six years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his rough background, Dean always knew he wasn’t good enough for the kind, intelligent beauty who claimed his heart, but somehow he’d believed their love was strong enough to survive anything—until the tragic night she turned her back on him when he needed her trust the most. Despite their painful history, Dean can’t resist the instinct to protect her, especially when it becomes apparent there’s a killer in their town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their former chemistry soon reignites, but Malorie has long accepted that her dark family secret has destined her to a life alone. And when she uncovers evidence that makes her the killer’s target, a deadly confrontation threatens to destroy any possibility of a second chance.</description>

But what happens when one of these beings - for they are not human - goes rogue? Dr. Kate Pomeroy will soon find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the events of the summer before, Kate Pomeroy finally believes she has her life back on track. But an old man, who arrives on Storm Island, and another man, from her not too distant past, will turn her ordinary world upside down. Will Kate have the courage to identify and neutralize these threats?

  <description>As a child, Abby had the same recurring nightmare night after night, in which she wandered through a field ridden with human skulls and bones. Now an adult, Abby thinks she's outgrown her demons, until, the evening before her wedding, the terrible dream returns and forces her to confront the dark secrets from her past she has kept from her new husband, Willem. The following day--less than 24 hours after exchanging vows--Abby steps out into traffic. As his wife lies in her hospital bed, sleeping in fits and starts, Willem tries to determine whether this was an absentminded accident or a premeditated plunge, and he quickly discovers a mysterious set of clues about what his wife might be hiding. Why, for example is there a rash-like red mark circling her wrist? What does she dream about that causes her to wake from the sound of her own screams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly, Abby begins to open up to her husband, revealing to him what she has never shared with anyone before--the story of a terrified mother; a jealous, drug addled father; and a daughter's terrifying captivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a suspenseful, alternating narrative that travels between the present and Abby's tortured childhood, &lt;i&gt;The Pursuit&lt;/i&gt; is a meticulously crafted, deeply disquieting tale that showcases Oates's masterful storytelling.</description>

  <description>Something’s happening to the girls on Denton Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the summer of 1980 in Cleveland, Ohio, and Phoebe Shaw and her best friend Jacqueline have just graduated high school, only to confront an ugly, uncertain future. Across the city, abandoned factories populate the skyline; meanwhile at the shore, one strong spark, and the Cuyahoga River might catch fire. But none of that compares to what’s happening in their own west side neighborhood. The girls Phoebe and Jacqueline have grown up with are changing. It starts with footprints of dark water on the sidewalk. Then, one by one, the girls’ bodies wither away, their fingernails turning to broken glass, and their bones exposed like corroded metal beneath their flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As rumors spread about the grotesque transformations, soon everyone from nosy tourists to clinic doctors and government men start arriving on Denton Street, eager to catch sight of “the Rust Maidens” in metamorphosis. But even with all the onlookers, nobody can explain what’s happening or why—except perhaps the Rust Maidens themselves. Whispering in secret, they know more than they’re telling, and Phoebe realizes her former friends are quietly preparing for something that will tear their neighborhood apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating between past and present, Phoebe struggles to unravel the mystery of the Rust Maidens—and her own unwitting role in the transformations—before she loses everything she’s held dear: her home, her best friend, and even perhaps her own body.</description>

A deadly hurricane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ellie Whitaker leaves her dead-end job behind to spread her grandmother's ashes in tropical paradise, the last thing she expected was to face more ghosts. But darkness lurks inside her nana's ancestral home. Ellie's presence stirs up its energies. And as a hurricane creeps closer to the island, she must hurry to discover long-buried truths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About her treasure-hunting grandfather's death in 1951. About the curse her grandmother left behind. About the innkeeper next door with an evil secret. And the spectral visions she keeps having. Some there to help her. Some to make sure Ellie becomes a ghostly resident of haunted Key West forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A boy in a basement, a man in a booth and a darkness that threatens to swallow them both...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; New York audiobook narrator Peter Larson and his wife Hannah head to his hometown of Maple City to help Peter's ailing father and to put a recent tragedy behind them. Though the small, Midwestern town seems the idyllic place to start afresh, Peter and Hannah will soon learn that evil currents flow beneath its surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They move into an old farmhouse on the outskirts of town—a house purchased by Peter's father at auction and kept secret until now—and start to settle into their new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But as Peter sets up his recording studio in a small basement room, disturbing things begin to occur—mysterious voices haunt audio tracks, malevolent shadows creep about the house. And when an insidious presence emerges from the woodwork, Peter must face old demons in order to save his family and himself.</description>

  <description>From award-winning, bestselling author, Linda Watkins, comes a new contemporary gothic series to chill your bones and warm your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A body found hanging from the ceiling fan in the tower room of the old manor house on Storm Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nineteen years, Kate Pomeroy has suppressed that memory. A second-year-resident in surgery, she thinks she has her life under control. But a curious conversation overheard while taking a catnap launches her on a descent into a world filled with nightmarish visions that cause her to doubt her own sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent to Storm Island to rest and recuperate from an apparent breakdown, Kate is forced to come to grips with memories of the summer her mother died as well as new terrors that plague her mind. Even the blossoming of an unexpected romance with islander, Jeremy Bradshaw, cannot keep her fears at bay for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discovery of a strange little silo, hidden deep in the woods, spurs Kate to action as she tries to unravel its mysteries. But is the silo real or just another illusion created by her tortured mind? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storm Island, A Kate Pomeroy Mystery, is the first book in a series of mysteries taking place on Storm, a remote island off the coast of Maine.</description>

  <description>One of PopSugar's Most Chilling Horror Books of 2018.&lt;br /&gt;One of Inquisitr's Best Horror Books of 2018.&lt;br /&gt;One of Ranker's 2018's Scariest Horror Books.&lt;br /&gt;One of BoredPanda's 7 Books That Scared Me Half to Death.&lt;br /&gt;#1 Amazon Best-Seller in U.S. Horror New Releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Cabin Green, where the setting is familiar, but the story is completely unexpected. A terrifying slow-burn that combines the literary Gothic prose of Shirley Jackson, Ambrose Bierce, &amp;amp; Thomas Tryon with the "what's really real?" aspects of The Shining. Cabin Green has also been compared to the devastation of Hereditary and the socially progressive, ambiguous approach of Paul Tremblay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to Cabin Green alone after the death of his fiancée was Ben's first mistake. His second mistake was tempting fate by saying, "There's no such thing as an evil building." Now he's caught in a nightmare of his own making deep in the woods of Northern Michigan. Even worse, a family history of mental illness makes it impossible for him to know if the ghosts haunting the cabin are real or all in his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This modern Gothic horror story takes the reader directly into Ben's hellish experience. Is he crazy? Is a ghost haunting him? The only way to find out is to make it to the end of this deep, dark thrill ride that's filled with more twists than a roller coaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWARDS:&lt;br /&gt;TOP VOTE GETTER: Best Horror/Suspense - The Kindle Book Review (TKBR) Reader's Choice Awards 2018. &lt;br /&gt;RUNNER-UP: Best Overall Book of 2018 - TKBR Reader's Choice Awards &lt;br /&gt;SEMIFINALIST: TKBR's 2018 Jury Award for Best Horror/Suspense &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: Contains gore, sex, profanity, &amp;amp; deeply disturbing psychological themes. This isn't a fluffy horror story; it's true, descriptive Gothic horror that's emblematic of the destructive nature of grief &amp;amp; also contains societal/political/religious critiques. For mature readers only. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a real-life, spooky green cabin in Northern Michigan that's so well-hidden it can't be found by GPS! This book also contains a disturbing section that was inspired by real-life events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A spectacular read...absolutely gripping. I couldn't force myself to put it down." - The Horror Report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Takes [the] standard genre template &amp;amp; turns it upside-down...with a literary approach that combines modern &amp;amp; mid-twentieth century techniques." - The Inquisitr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A haunting tale." - PopSugar.</description>

  <description>Liza McCarthy has never known the love she so desperately craves. The illegitimate child of a broken marriage, the identity of her father and her heritage are a well-kept secret. When she receives a call from a mysterious woman claiming her life is in danger, she manages to flee just before two men break into her home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon finds herself in the tiny midwestern town of Halden’s Mill. There she is taken in by the Finns, a mysterious family who claim to guard the entrance to the fabled land of the faerie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liza is slowly drawn into a world of monsters, dark magic and a host of peculiar townsfolk. Now she must rethink everything she’s ever known and seek her destiny before two worlds collide with a force that could mean the end of the human race.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Something is wrong with the town of Bailey. Something dark, something dangerous. Something evil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh's brother has just drowned. He meets Kate and Gabe, who also have lost family to the river. When they seek the help of a local historian, Naylor, he tells them that there is a sinister longstanding pattern to such tragedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some unknown force is trying to help Josh rid the town of its curse. Why is he dreaming of a ship's captain, a hooded monk, a dark familiar with a knife? What is being demanded of him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon greater horrors than ever before are set loose. They are fighting against time, as evil has turned its baleful eye upon them.</description>

  <description>From the Multi-Award-Winning Author comes, The German Half-Bloods.&lt;br /&gt;“A historical novel steeped in horror, danger and suspense; a true page-turner.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany, September 1939. At the outbreak of War, Dieter Vogel and his family face catastrophic events and separation as each member embarks on their deadly paths towards survival, love, and freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dieter Vogel, a German industrialist, believes in protecting his family at all costs, but in a bid to keep his English wife and children safe, he is plunged into a well of deceit that tears the family apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Paul Vogel is coerced into working in the Nazi eugenics programme and soon discovers that sterilising handicapped and mentally-ill Germans is just a prelude to a more lethal plan against those the Reich deem unworthy of life. Paul, trapped by the SS, seeks help from the unlikeliest of people and is plunged into a world of espionage and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;British Army Major, Max Vogel, is attached to The British Intelligence Services and Winston Churchill’s Special Operations Executive. His missions in occupied Europe are fraught with danger, and his adulterous affair with a woman he cannot give up leads him deeper into the quagmire of treachery and lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilmot Vogel dreams of winning the Iron Cross, but when he confronts a mass killing of Jews in Poland, his idolatry of Hitler is shaken to its roots, and he finds himself imprisoned in the infamous Dachau concentration camp with no release date in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Vogel has no ambition other than to marry her English fiancé, Frank, before the lines of war are drawn. Against her father’s wishes, she leaves Berlin on the eve of the German invasion of Poland, but when she arrives in England, she learns that Frank is not the civilian engineer he claims to be.</description>

  <description>Under the guise of mentor and muse, a frustrated writer and her ambitious teenage protégé take an illicit summer road trip fraught with racial and sexual tension. This is a compelling psychological novel about social norms, artistic ambition, and obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Barnett works in the media center of a school in Flint, Michigan where she meets Taezha Riverton, an aspiring teenage writer. After discovering that Maggie is also a writer, Taezha turns to her as both mentor and friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alone and childless, it's not enough for Maggie to take Tae to upscale restaurants and poetry readings; she has a more far-reaching vision. Although Tae’s mother has nothing against Maggie, she is less than thrilled when Maggie proposes to take her daughter on a summer road trip. Permission is never explicitly granted, but shortly after school is out for the summer, Maggie and Tae head for the Southeast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tae’s mother insists that Maggie return Tae to Flint, but Maggie instead takes Tae to a remote cabin outside Asheville, North Carolina. Growing evermore emotionally unsound, Maggie clings to the belief that living close to nature is the perfect therapy for her doubts and insecurities. Yet her role as mentor has now been supplanted to that of a drill sergeant, causing Tae to have serious misgivings...</description>

  <description>"Does first love, true love, ever really die?"&lt;br /&gt;Andi Martin asks herself that question as she sits on the porch of the Sloane Cottage, her mind flooded with memories of the summer of '65 and a boy, once loved, but never forgotten. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Chambers is also on a collision course with the past as he returns to Cutter Island for the first time in more than a decade. And, as the ferry approaches the wharf, he finds his mind filled with thoughts of a summer long forgotten and a girl destined to haunt him forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From award-winning author, Linda Watkins, comes a story of love, loss, survival, and, most of all, hope...SUMMER GIRL, A Novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Such wonderful children. Such a beautiful mother. Such a lovely house. Such endless terror!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't that she didn't love her children. She did. But there was a fortune at stake—a fortune that would assure their later happiness if she could keep the children a secret from her dying father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So she and her mother hid her darlings away in an unused attic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the brutal days swelled into agonizing years. Now Cathy, Chris, and the twins wait in their cramped and helpless world, stirred by adult dreams, adult desires, served a meager sustenance by an angry, superstitious grandmother who knows that the Devil works in dark and devious ways. Sometimes he sends children to do his work—children who—one by one—must be destroyed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Way upstairs there are four secrets hidden. Blond, beautiful, innocent struggling to stay alive....</description>

  <description>Scott makes enemies everywhere. Powerful people want him dead. He’s coming back to Ireland to finish what he started. But first, he must make it out of Marrakech alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jen knows Scott will come back. Every day, she waits. He almost killed her last time and, fuelled by hate and arrogance, he’s not a man to ever just move on. He will kill her and he will kill her young son. But her husband and friends believe she has spiralled into paranoia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So she knows, when he returns, she’ll face the psychopath alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this powerful thriller, Hogan plunges us into the world and mind of her psychopathic killer from the first line and relentlessly tightens the tension until the very last page.</description>

  <description>On the verge of losing her laboratory, her savings, and all respect for herself, Pandora (Penny) Yee lands her first contract as scientific consult to the police department. And with seventeen murder cases on the go, the surly inspector is happy to leave her to it. Only she's going to need to get around, and that means her slightly unhinged adopted brother, Matiu, will be doing the driving. But something about the case spooks Matiu, something other than the lack of a body in the congealing pool of blood in the locked room or that odd little bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matiu doesn't like anything about this case, from the voices that screamed at him when he touched that bowl, to the way his hateful imaginary friend Makere has come back to torment him, to the fact that the victim seems to be tied up with a man from Matiu's past, a man who takes pleasure in watching dogs tear each other to pieces for profit and entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hounds of the Underworld&lt;/em&gt; blends mystery, near-future noir and horror. Set in New Zealand it's the product of a collaboration by two Kiwi authors, one with Chinese heritage and the other Māori. This debut book in The Path of Ra series offers compelling new voices and an exotic perspective on the detective drama.</description>

  <description>What would you do if someone demanded you write the best story of your life, to be judged online? That your life depended on it. &lt;br /&gt; Four well-known authors receive an email telling them they are responsible for a suicide.

Will anyone survive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy tense, fast-paced horror, then you will love Kevin J. Kennedy and J.C. Michael’s You Only Get One Shot! Your shot is now. Read You Only Get One Shot today. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Synopsis What would you do if someone demanded you write the best story of your life, to be judged online? That your life depended on it. Four well-known authors receive an email telling them they are responsible for a suicide. Their antagonist makes it clear she is out for revenge and they have no option but to comply. Their task is to post the best story they can imagine online and await judgement. Filled with guilt, anxiety, and even a few murderous tendencies, each writer weaves their tale and hopes for the best. It'll be the competition of their lives. Who's story will win? Will anyone survive? If you enjoy tense, fast-paced horror, then you will love Kevin J. Kennedy and J.C. Michael's You Only Get One Shot! Your shot is now. Read You Only Get One Shot today. Praise for the book: "Kennedy &amp;amp; Michael's _You Only Get One Shot_ is quite a clever noir narrative, blending several gritty tales together into one unforgettable "escape by your wits" premise that will keep you turning the pages in terror till the twisty end is brilliantly unveiled. Gleefully disturbing and darkly terrifying to writers like me, this is such a clever and diffuse story, with the same puzzling torment of the SAW movies, but all the grit of a pulp crime novel. If you have this book in your hands or on the screen right now, you better buy it right away, because you only get one shot..." Michael A. Arnzen, Bram Stoker Award winning author of Play Dead "You Only Get One Shot gives all new meaning to a publishing deadline! Quite entertaining!" Weston Kincade, author of the 'A Life of Death' series.</description>

That's what Bill Andersen thought when he moved his family to Mateguas. But Mateguas is more than just pristine beaches nestled between rocky shores. No, Mateguas is something quite different as the Andersens will soon find out.&lt;br /&gt;An arcane locked box, a strange and foreboding trail leading deep into the woods, a seductive young woman, and tales of malevolent Native American spirits are just some of the perils Karen Andersen must face if she is to find a way to save her family.&lt;br /&gt;"Linda Watkins is a gifted author who creates believable characters and paints a story with every scene. This book is a must read for fans of American Gothic and suspense novels! ~Chanticleer Book Review and Media's review of MATEGUAS ISLAND.&lt;br /&gt;"RETURN TO MATEGUAS ISLAND picks right up with the same intrigue, suspense, drama and mystery that Mateguas Island contained. A page turner from the beginning, this is a tale you will not want to walk away from...High suspense and flashes of horror beckon American Gothic readers to Return to Mateguas Island, the second book in Linda Watkins trilogy –a stunning success leaving readers posed in anticipation for the next installment." ~Chanticleer Book Review and Media's review of RETURN TO MATEGUAS ISLAND&lt;br /&gt;"Ghosts of Mateguas is a haunting novel packed with realistic characters and unpredictable twists placed on the backdrop of a spooky, magical island... This gripping saga is highly recommended for horror and Gothic fiction enthusiasts and those who enjoy romantic thrillers." ~Chanticleer Book Review and Media's review of GHOSTS OF MATEGUAS</description>

  <description>Intenze is the newest designer drug. Take it, and nightmares come alive. “Edging” is a better rush than the Tower of Terror. It’s a fraction of the price of a Six Flags admission. And it’s the most addictive high that the tiny suburb of New London has ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Rick Carlson, the junkies roaming the streets don’t even scratch the surface of what worries him. He’s trying to win back his cheating wife. He’s trying to protect his residents at Belmont Assistant Living from their own drug-addled grandchildren. And he’s trying to save his twin boy and girl from their mother’s murderous paranoia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he can’t save them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fears of all those who edge summon the Thirst—a living miasma that thrives on terror. It is bringing a storm. And time is running out.</description>

  <description>Aiden LeDoux is a typical sixteen-year-old boy when the O’Connell brothers nail his father to a tree. He doesn’t believe things can get any worse...until three months later, when a mysterious light bursts forth from his face and heals everyone in his father’s bar, from minor scrape to terminal illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once word of this miracle event spreads, crazed townspeople attempt to force Aiden to use his newfound gift to heal those they love. But Aiden doesn’t know how he did it. Or why. Or if he can ever make it happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the heart of a blizzard, in the throes of fanatical entitlement, the townspeople begin to tear the town—and each other—apart, with Aiden and his family trapped in the middle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shine Your Light on Me is a gripping tale that illuminates the ugly underbelly of humanity. From its tense opening to its explosive finale, the monsters herein are all too real, too familiar, and Lee Thompson's relentless prose will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>The little town of Castle Rock, Maine has witnessed some strange events and unusual visitors over the years, but there is one story that has never been told... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three ways up to Castle View from the town of Castle Rock: Route 117, Pleasant Road, and the Suicide Stairs. Every day in the summer of 1974 twelve-year-old Gwendy Peterson has taken the stairs, which are held by strong (if time-rusted) iron bolts and zig-zag up the cliffside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the top of the stairs, Gwendy catches her breath and listens to the shouts of the kids on the playground. From a bit farther away comes the chink of an aluminum bat hitting a baseball as the Senior League kids practice for the Labor Day charity game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, a stranger calls to Gwendy: "Hey, girl. Come on over here for a bit. We ought to palaver, you and me."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a bench in the shade sits a man in black jeans, a black coat like for a suit, and a white shirt unbuttoned at the top. On his head is a small neat black hat. The time will come when Gwendy has nightmares about that hat...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journey back to Castle Rock again in this chilling new novella by Stephen King, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Bazaar of Bad Dreams&lt;/i&gt;, and Richard Chizmar, award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;A Long December&lt;/i&gt;.

  <description>In 1961, the small town of Haven thought they'd gotten rid of their monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a series of child killings, Paul Greymore was caught carrying a wounded girl. His face, disfigured from a childhood accident, seemed to confirm he was the monster the community hoped to banish. With Paul in prison, the killings stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seventeen years, Haven was peaceful again. But Paul served his time and has now returned to Haven--the town where he grew up, and the scene of his alleged crimes. Paul insists he didn't commit those crimes, and several townspeople believe him including the local priest, a young boy named Denny, and his best friend Billy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is, now that Paul is back home, the bizarre killings have started again--and the patterns match the deaths from Haven's past. If Paul isn't the killer, who is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or WHAT is? An unlikely band of adventurers attempts to uncover the truth, delving into long-hidden tunnels that might actually be inhabited by a strange, predatory creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven is a compelling horror epic in the spirit of It or Summer of Night, and a stunning debut novel from a gifted author who knows that the darkest horrors lurk inside human beings, even when there is a monster on the loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Haven;&lt;br /&gt;"Haven is a big, generous, Stephen King-like small town boys vs. monster epic."&lt;br /&gt;— Stewart O'Nan, author of The Night Country and A Prayer for the Dying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A wonderfully entertaining ride, reminiscent of the Creature Features of yesteryear."&lt;br /&gt;— Sloane Kady, author of Irreparable Deeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Full of well-drawn characters and slow burn suspense, Tom Deady's Haven is a terrific dose of New England horror that harkens back to some of my favorite classic monster fiction from writers like Rick Hautala and Charles L. Grant. If you’re a fan of this sort of thing, you’ll know that’s damn high praise. Give it a read."&lt;br /&gt;— Christopher Golden, New York Times bestselling author of Snowblind and Dead Ringers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Haven is about scars, both literal and figurative; it's about second chances and broken memories. This is a great small-town horror novel—a bullet-read with deep characters and perfect pacing. Best of all, it's creepy as hell."&lt;br /&gt;— Rio Youers, author of Westlake Soul and Point Hollow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If coming-of-age novels with a bad-ass monster sound good to you… if mounting suspense with a true to life cast of characters peaks your interest…then Tom Deady’s HAVEN is right up your alley. Reminiscent of Charles L. Grant, HAVEN is a fun and nostalgic romp that brought me back to my own youth in small-town New England. And who doesn’t love a good monster tale?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; – John McIlveen, author of HANNAHWHERE, winner of the 2015 Drunken Druid Award and Stoker Award nominee.</description>

      <![CDATA[Tom Deady's "Haven" is one great big page-turner of a novel!

  <description>Valencia, Spain, 1491 &lt;br /&gt;The ambitions of four men merge and collide in a deadly game of intrigue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Sanz, a young militiaman, is forced to carry out a heinous crime, and he becomes an unwitting pawn in a tense battle for power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luis Peráto, the duke of Sagrat, sacrifices his own people to cover up dark secrets that could see him burnt at the stake for treason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sergio Garcia, Sagrat’s lord treasurer, is a cruel and unscrupulous man, willing to eliminate anyone who opposes his rise to power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inquisitor, Gaspar de Amo, zealously punishes heretics for their sins against Rome and her Holy Office. But bringing the Inquisition to the town of Sagrat proves more challenging than he or the church could ever have envisaged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of chaos, the people of Sagrat, terrorized by a series of murders, face an even greater danger with the arrival of the Inquisition and the unimaginable horrors it brings.</description>

  <description>The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her parents' despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie's descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.</description>

  <description>Swearing Allegiance: Part 1 of The Carmody Saga, about love, war, and betrayal, set during the First World War. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 1916 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Irish Easter uprising lays waste to Dublin and fractures a British Empire struggling to supply men and arms to defeat Germany. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Dublin’s ruins, the affluent and celebrated Carmody family are not only forced to confront the rebellion’s devastating effects on their personal lives but also the terrible secrets and lies uncovered in the midst of grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to abandon their home in the Irish capital for London, each family member must strive to survive poverty, the horrors of war, and personal bouts with excessive pride and passion – but loyalty to family proves to be the most difficult cross to bear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danny, the youngest, is a republican rebel who risks everything to fight for an independent Ireland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick, a surgeon, swears allegiance to Britain and joins His Majesty’s Royal Navy, which is engaged in tense battles to control the seas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny, self-entitled and strong willed, sees her wedding plans and grand ambitions disintegrate. With a fiancé incarcerated in a rebel prison camp and no prospects of her own, she faces the unimaginable challenge of working in one of London’s munitions factories. &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;The Lightkeepers&lt;/i&gt;, we follow Miranda, a nature photographer who travels to the Farallon Islands, an exotic and dangerous archipelago off the coast of California, for a one-year residency capturing the landscape. Her only companions are the scientists studying there, odd and quirky refugees from the mainland living in rustic conditions. They document the whales and seals around the island, the bold trio of sharks called the Sisters that hunt the surrounding waters, and the overwhelming, violent bird population.&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after her arrival, Miranda is assaulted by one of the island’s inhabitants. A few days later, her assailant is found dead, perhaps the result of an accident. As the novel unfolds, Miranda gives witness to the natural wonders of this astonishing place. She grapples with what has happened to her, deepens her connection to (and her misgivings about) her companions, and succumbs to the spell of the place nicknamed “the Islands of the Dead.” And when more violence occurs, each member of this strange community falls under suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;The Lightkeepers upends the traditional structure of a mystery novel—an isolated environment, a limited group of characters who might not be trustworthy, a death that might not have been accidental, a balance of discovery and action—while also exploring wider themes of the natural world, the power of loss, and the essence of recovery. It is a luminous debut novel from a talented and provocative writer.</description>

  <description>Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, &lt;i&gt;Bird Box&lt;/i&gt; is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

  <description>Most blogs don't chronicle a horrifying, high-stakes struggle against otherworldly evil. Mark Huntley's does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fall of 2004, as the brutal campaign of Bush vs. Kerry draws to a close in Washington, D.C., even more sinister forces are gathering power in secret. For young Mark, who's seeing things he shouldn't see-- as a forgotten, destructive nature awakens inside him-- politics are the least of his worries. Every choice he makes could cost the lives of those he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 of 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner of a 2014 Wattys Award. (Wattpad version: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/22193346-the-pseudo-chronicles-of-mark-huntley" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.wattpad.com/story/2219334...&lt;/a&gt;)</description>

  <description>The body of a young girl, found floating in the icy waters of Scarborough Marsh...&lt;br /&gt;Six men, over a span of thirty-five years, disappear without a trace...&lt;br /&gt;A harbinger of evil, so ancient it defies memory, surfaces on the rocky shores of Mateguas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journey, with Karen and her family, back to the mythos, passion, and magic, and join her as she seeks to finally lay to rest the ... GHOSTS OF MATEGUAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GHOSTS OF MATEGUAS is the third full-length novel in highly acclaimed, award-winning, MATEGUAS ISLAND SERIES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ghosts of Mateguas: A Mateguas Island Novel, is dark, fast-paced and intense ... It’s most highly recommended." ~ Jack Magnus for READERS FAVORITE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Those who love stories with some touch of mystery will not be disappointed with this one. The story, for sure, will grip readers at different levels. First off, Watkins writes with moving simplicity, a kind of prose that tantalizes and is difficult to put down, because it rings with an eloquence that is akin to the spell of the ghosts sauntering along the rocky shores of Mateguas. It can be difficult to believe a story told about humans and ghosts, but when that story is told by Watkins, it becomes as convincing as it is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting is perfect for a tale that involves the herald of evil: the rocky shores, the eternity of the sea, the marshes… The story is fast paced; the suspense is so skillfully built into the story to have the reader turning the pages, and the characters are solid enough that any reader will care about what happens to them. One would say that Ghosts of Mateguas comes with a spell that makes the book impossible to put down. Beautifully written by a writer of a rare caliber." ~ Romuald Dzemo for READERS FAVORITE</description>

  <description>Book # 3 in the Eleven-Time International Winning Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Princess Petra has already attained her knighthood in the Kingdom of Pen Pieyu and her non-princess-like talent certificate from Talent School, neither of which pleases her father and mother, the king and queen. The king writes up more silly rules in the royal rule book to deter Sir Princess Petra from her knightly ways and useless talent, and turn her into a real princess once and for all. Will the king finally succeed with this newly written, ridiculous mission for Petra?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Updated and Relaunched 2018. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A finely spun, suspenseful, psychological thriller full of deceit, drama and wry humour, this story centres around Margot Rowlands, a restless, married woman whose obsessive affair with a younger man turns out to be more than she bargained for when her lover dies under mysterious circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A secretive woman by nature and a talented amateur actress, Margot successfully avoids becoming a suspect in a murder scenario which the police are developing. But the more intricate the web of lies and cover-ups she weaves to prove her innocence and the more she draws on her acting skills, the more she unsuspectingly directs attention to her secret life, alienating husband and daughter as their suspicions grow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case against her is not conclusive, but her distant past – purposely hidden from friends and family – comes to light in the investigation and weighs heavily against her. In court, she fights with the weapons of a desperate woman and edges her trial to a surprising conclusion.</description>

  <description>NOS4A2 is a spine-tingling novel of supernatural suspense from master of horror Joe Hill, the New York Times bestselling author of Heart-Shaped Box and Horns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria McQueen has a secret gift for finding things: a misplaced bracelet, a missing photograph, answers to unanswerable questions. On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether it’s across Massachusetts or across the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing – and terrifying – playground of amusements he calls “Christmasland.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, one day, Vic goes looking for trouble—and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manx’s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. He’s on the road again and he’s picked up a new passenger: Vic’s own son.</description>

  <description>Sara Mustow has lived in the house on Pullman Street for sixty-five years. But, she does not live there alone. Sara shares her home with an infinite evil. For Alex Delaney, returning to Maine means returning to childhood memories he struggled for years to overcome. His younger brother Noah hopes the trip will bring both siblings closer to whatever shred of family remains to them. But, an old gypsy's secret will force the Delaneys to confront terrible truths. Detective Ian Letellier, a member of the Maine State Police's Major Crimes Unit leads an investigation into one of the most gruesome murders in the state's history. The evidence in the case suggests a link to a company of local Gypsies. Law enforcement holds a jaded view of the Romani, believing them to be nothing more than thieves and scam artists. What Detective Letellier learns will shatter everything he knew about the Romani, and everything he knew about himself.</description>

  <description>"The Keepers are coming..." The last words of a man who died in the middle of a highway through Cedar Hill, Ohio, still echo in Gil Stewart's ears when he discovers a dying dog in his front yard. At the same moment a package arrives on his doorstep. A package holding hope that a past young love might not be lost after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Keepers are coming, and they're bringing with them memories Gil has spent most of a lifetime forgetting, memories leaking through fractures in his psyche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Keepers are coming, and the animals — the harbingers — are acting strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Keepers are coming. But from where? And why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the day is over, Gil will have the answers, and the world he thought he knew will be irrevocably altered.</description>

  <description>What happens when thrown away dogs in need of loving homes and humans yearning for unconditional love and canine companionship come together? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rescue Me shares twelve original inspirational accounts, complete with photos, of ten dog lovers who rescued the dogs who ultimately rescued them. Read (and listen to) true tales of extraordinary commitment, physical and emotional healing, overcoming challenges, faith, twists of fate, new lives, and the magical joy that comes from the bond of unconditional love and acceptance between humans and their dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet: &lt;br /&gt;•	Julia, a woman on a mission to rescue as many dogs as she can, and how she found herself in the process. &lt;br /&gt;•	Biscuit, the injured, fear aggressive death row dog now working as a fully trained service dog. &lt;br /&gt;•	Duke, the stray flea-bitten puppy who taught his people about compassion toward the undeserving. &lt;br /&gt;•	Senior Sammy saved from a slow and certain death by his human angel, Letha, and how he put the smile back on her face.. &lt;br /&gt;•	Yoda, the little French bulldog who filled Faith’s empty nest with his big personality and lots of love. &lt;br /&gt;•	Lolli, the beagle who lost her jawbone, but found a loving home and a joyful life. &lt;br /&gt;•	And more… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dog adoption stories in Rescue Me are written for the love of dogs in rescue and shelters, and the people who devote their lives to saving them in little and big ways. It is written to raise awareness of their plight and their need, as well as to celebrate all they have to offer when given a chance - the lessons, healing, victories, and sometimes even the sorrows that loving and being loved by dogs bring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a way of giving back to these dogs and the people that care for them, shelters and rescue organizations will receive donations from the proceeds of this book to help with expenses and to fund projects designed to make life better for the animals in their care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the accompanying webpage you will find a list of sponsored organizations, home videos, photographs, bonus audio interviews with three of our authors, and more.</description>

  <description>What makes a woman kill? An upbringing marred by rejection and hurt when you are let down by the ones you love and a society that is supposed to protect you? As a teenager that rejection lures Helen King into the world of drugs and prostitution. &lt;br /&gt;Now, as an adult, Helen is spiraling out of control. Old wounds are surfacing; can she face her demons without the drugs? Will revenge help release her from her past? Beating her addiction is her only chance at a new life. But, an encounter with a former school teacher opens up old wounds that had been festering deep within her. While quitting drugs, another craving takes its place. A desire for revenge: payback for those who'd betrayed her. &lt;br /&gt;Plagued with bitterness, Helen heads to Edinburgh to begin her killing spree.&lt;br /&gt;Police are mystified when her first victim is found. A second death convinces them it’s the same killer. Can they connect Helen to the crimes? How many more will die before she is stopped?</description>

  <description>Murder and mayhem takes Jessica Huntington to new heights when Libby Van Der Woert wants to meet at the top of the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway. The disturbed daughter of Jessica’s wealthy clients, Libby says she has information about her friend, Shannon Donnelly. Another mixed-up daughter of the rich and famous, Shannon Donnelly has not been heard from in over a week and her pricey car was abandoned in a Cathedral City parking lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble begins the moment Jessica greets Libby in the Mt. San Jacinto Wilderness. Wild, manic, and sure she’s being followed, Libby’s got a gun. All hell breaks loose when Libby’s Beverly Hills shrink shows up with a gun of his own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s up with the missing and misguided daughters of wealth and privilege in Dr. Carr’s care? Jessica and her Cat Pack friends go toe-to-toe with more well-heeled heels in A DEAD DAUGHTER. Getting to the bottom of things Jessica-Huntington-style, sets off a whirlwind tour of fashionable enclaves, upscale rehab clinics, shops, restaurants and other haute hangouts. Can she and her friends outwit and outlive ‘la crème de la crud’ wreaking havoc in paradise?</description>

  <description>Smokey Hollow is a quiet town, but all that changes when Brian Keays moves in and discovers a locked steamer trunk in the attic of his home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A suspicious fire destroys a mental asylum, but there is no sign of any of its inhabitants. Victims are found dead with a pillowcase over their heads, the same method used in an unsolved series of murders, committed over fifty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian tries to piece together the connection to the trunk and its grisly contents, his investigation aided by anonymous notes. He follows the trail from a ventriloquist firefighter whose dummy knows more than its puppeteer, to a Somnambulist whose pockets contain clues, and to a Knackerman who disposes of animal carcasses but keeps a container with its own mysterious contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death is everywhere, but answers are hard to come by.</description>

  <description>Cosega Storm continues from the frightening final seconds of Cosega Search, the series’ first book. Gaines and Asher, caught in a storm of deceit, corruption and power, desperately struggle to escape. But running isn’t enough. They must piece together the mystery of Clastier’s life, understand the incredible artifacts, and somehow discover what links them all together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really happened in the past, and how will it change the future? As each extraordinary secret of the Eysen is revealed, the danger escalates. The more Gaines learns, the less he knows who he can trust. But his most difficult challenge is the paradox of the Cosega Sequence. Failing to decode it in time will cost him his life, yet succeeding means he must die. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover enough of the past . . . you may just destroy the future.</description>

  <description>A mouthy small town girl takes on big city life assisted by her "Spiritual guide through sin city" who pulls a Professor Higgins on Cherie while offering advice on single parenting and multiple affairs the heart... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Back in the Sixties while Motown hits filled the airwaves, naïve Jill Novak acknowledged her knack for choosing losers when boring Husband Number One vanished, leaving her to support their two-year-old. The perpetual daydreamer soon morphs from small town Jill to sophisticated big city Cherie, but a new name does not a better future bring. In 1969 Houston, Cherie encounters a rogue’s gallery of characters unlike those from her small Texas hometown; a drop-dead gorgeous transsexual, a snarling wannabe Mafia hit-man, a hairy cop who incorporates fondling girls into his job, and a ditzo neighbor whose desire for friendship borders on stalking. But it is two distinctly different men—a middle-age gregarious gambler and a twenty-something gruff intellectual—who jump on board her turbulent thirty-year roller coaster ride and journey with her into the 21st Century and womanhood. A tough and tender Texas-sized romance with a mild metaphysical slant, The Jewel Box highlights moments from the mystical, laid-back Age of Aquarius through the materialistic, high-speed Internet era. Music and references to the times/political climate convey the nations rocky terrain (and subsequent growth) parallel with that of the main character. This is a story of an engaging and open-hearted woman with no plan, making her way through life by fits and starts, and ultimately succeeding by turning out to be stronger than she thought.</description>

  <description>He had been looking for it his whole life. &lt;br /&gt;When he finally found it, it made no sense. &lt;br /&gt;Now everyone wants it. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever be the same again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripley Gaines, a brilliant archeologist, has spent his life searching for an elusive artifact to prove his controversial theory. What he finds shocks even him. The discovery rewrites human history and promises to change the planet’s future. It has to be suppressed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most powerful forces in the world align against him, and a deadly competition for the artifact ensues. Capturing Gaines is not enough; he, and everyone who has seen the artifact, must be killed. His only hope, is to stay alive long enough to decode the Cosega Sequence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dig far enough into the past . . . you may just discover the future.</description>

  <description>A DETECTIVE/MURDER MYSTERY LIKE NO OTHER… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the murder of a sexy, blonde bombshell (and, soon after, the bloody, gruesome, shocking murder of yet another sexy broad), ex-Inspector Cullot is called in to team up with his old side-kick, Detective Sergeant Watkins, to investigate the baffling crime. Together they set about solving the mysterious deaths at Bounderdales, the opulent mansion of the oil magnate, Henry Barble. A small group of the rich, decadent, sophisticated and ultra-sexy are staying at the mansion. What secrets are each of them harbouring? Who are the guilty parties? And what is the dark secret from his own past which causes Cullot’s frequent moments of dark despair? Why did he leave the Police Force? Did he jump, or was he pushed? Why does he now work in a department store, in Ladies Underwear? The police constable first on the scene of the initial murder, PC Blunt, is ready to record every detail of the case, and assist his colleagues in their work. But what is his own past..? Is he as half-witted as he seems? What about gorgeous, sexy blonde bombshells, Stephanie and Gloria? And louche, limp-wristed Anthony Newhome? And Barble’s son, Oswald? And Barble’s demure, bespectacled secretary, Abigail? And ex-movie star, Janice Butler? Are they all who they say they are, or are some of them involved in a deadly game of murder and revenge? How are these murders linked to the unsolved Night-Club Hostess Murders which took place two years earlier? And, most puzzling of all, what is the meaning of the tattoos on the gorgeous buttocks of the assembled ladies? Thrill to the suspense, the heart-ache, the twists and turns, the laugh-a-minute of this hilarious, baffling mystery. Get ready to follow the roller-coaster plot, with one surprise after surprise, and scintillating word-play and sparkling dialogue between the marvellous host of characters. Will you be able to work out who did it? A detective/murder mystery like no other…</description>

  <description>Harmony Duprie enjoyed her well-ordered life in the quiet little town of Oak Grove—until her arrest for drug trafficking. Cleared of all charges, she wants nothing more than to return to the uneventful lifestyle of a historical researcher she once savored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her beloved old car “George” is stolen and explodes into a ball of flames, it sets off a series of events that throws her plans into turmoil. Toss in a police detective that may or may not be interested in her, an attractive but mysterious stranger on her trail, and an ex-boyfriend doing time, and Harmony’s life freefalls into a downward spiral of chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she has to use her research skills to figure out who is behind the sinister incidents plaguing her, and why. And she better take it seriously, like her life depends upon finding the right answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it might.</description>

  <description>Shannon McLean had come a long way since she lost her mother. A while ago she'd thought she was alone in the world, a plain Jane with no place to go. Now she knew better. Suddenly she was surrounded by relatives: a crazy talented twin brother, Ian, who literally held the keys to magic in his hands; a demonic father, Connor, who had paid a high price for a one-way ticket to hell; and a wannabe big brother, Simon, who was not only half demon but also a hit man of some sort; and herself ... so not a plain Jane but a witch with ancient spells tingling on her fingertips. Oh, and if that were not enough of a burden for a thirteen-year-old girl, her father had sent her to London on an impossible quest. No matter what she did, or who tried to help her, she kept failing time and time again, and time was not something she had. If she ever intended to save her father from becoming the next king of hell, she had to act fast and do the impossible. After all, every witch knows the hard truth: demons cannot be saved.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book one of the Standing Room Only Stables series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lynn Welling grew up with a love of horses. As a child, her days consisted of sitting on her bedroom floor with shoelaces tied around her toes acting as reins. For hours she would pretend she was riding a Park horse at U.S. Nationals, trotting the victory lap with a blanket of roses draped on his neck. Now, as a young adult, that dream is one step closer to becoming a reality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Lynn lands a job as a stable hand at an Arabian horse farm, she starts to wonder if she got in over her head. The only riding she has ever done was on the neighbor’s retired Quarter horse as a kid, and it was just the basics. Now, she is in charge of caring for over 20 horses, and she’s beginning to second guess her decision. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as she’s learning the ropes, Lynn catches the eye of Doug, the head trainer, and he starts to wonder if she is the junior rider he’s been looking for. He introduces her to a tiny bay gelding, named Rumble, and Lynn has to decide if she wants to take on the daunting challenge of learning to ride him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While sorting things out, and forming a relationship with Rumble, things aren’t exactly falling into place. The resident star rider, Zoey, is quick to crush any plans that Lynn may have; shoving her, and her dreams, out the door before she gets too comfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Lynn find the strength and determination to ride Rumble in the ring this season? Or, will she leave her dreams behind, crushed into the arena dirt by pounding hooves? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take time to check out C. L. Heckman's other books on her amazon author page. &lt;br /&gt;Also, watch for future books in the series and follow Lynn, and all the other characters, on their journeys at SROS stables.</description>

  <description>Growing up a homeless juvenile delinquent left its mark on Gabriel Logan. He lived a throwaway existence until a former FBI agent recruited him for a fringe organization for boys like him, ones who could operate outside the law for the sake of justice. As an adult, he sets an example for the others and is slated to take over their group, until his work results in the murder of his pregnant wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going through the motions of everyday life, Logan does only what’s required of him with one goal in mind: kill Hugh Langston, the man responsible for his wife’s death. When he’s handed the opportunity to bring Langston down, he jumps at the chance, but the job will challenge him more than anything in the past. Not only does he have to save Langston’s daughter from her father’s hit list, but the job seems to have come to them a little too easily. Logan must find a way to not only rescue the one woman who can take down his biggest enemy, but also look into the men he trusts most to discover which one of them is betraying The Boys Club.</description>

  <description>Gran-sdur: The Games is the second book in the Pha-yul trilogy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part alien and part human, Sam, Cassie, Seb, Maya and Ryan are still discovering their potential in the second book of the Pha-yul trilogy. In Pha-yul, they are guided by new mentors - experts in the particular power that each of them possess. Training with kids more skilled than them, they realize how little they know and how much more they must learn. Between all their training and classes, they try to explore Pha-yul, the beautiful and isolated location that their ancestors had chosen as their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the pressure, they discover that they are to participate in the Gran-sdur, a competition that is held annually in Pha-yul. Here they would face the best and most skilled teams from communities around the world. With Mr. Harris’ guidance, the youngsters train hard, but will they be good enough to hold their own against equally or more talented contestants? Mr. Harris thinks they will, but the five are not so sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Games begin, the kids realise that they are not just trying to win, but are actually fighting for their lives. Will they win, or will they go down fighting? Will all five make it to the end? Or will the circle shatter?&lt;br /&gt;Circle of Five, the first book of the Pha-yul trilogy is available on Amazon.</description>

  <description>From award-winning author, Linda Watkins, comes the eagerly-awaited sequel to her highly acclaimed novel, MATEGUAS ISLAND! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a remote island comes a young woman seeking to find the truth of what happened to her family ten years before. But will the questions she asks only serve to draw her deeper into the labyrinth of mystery and magic that lies sleeping beneath this island's pristine surface? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And will her mother be once again caught in a vicious web of love, jealousy, betrayal and revenge that will make it impossible for her to shield her daughter from the dark forces that may ultimately seek to consume and destroy them both? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journey with Karen Andersen and her family back to MATEGUAS ISLAND - a return to the legends, mythos, passion and terror that lie dormant just beneath the surface - waiting and longing for this chance to be yet again reawakened! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATEGUAS ISLAND was the winner of the Readers' Favorite 2014 Gold Medal in Supernatural Fiction and recipient of an "Honorable Mention" in Fiction from the 2014 Halloween Book Festival. RETURN TO MATEGUAS is the second full-length novel in the Mateguas Trilogy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to what people are already saying about RETURN TO MATEGUAS: &lt;br /&gt;"This is a quick-paced story portraying a wide range of human emotions, deadly supernatural forces and ancient Native American beliefs that may help the characters survive the ordeal in store. It explores the depths of love and loss, dedication and defiance, innocence and desire - all in spite of the threat of losing everything. This is supernatural fiction at its best with a hint of coming-of-age enlightenment to appeal to younger readers as well as readers of all ages." ~ Melinda Hills for Readers' Favorite &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Excellent storyline, excellent characters in all-round thrilling read. Linda’s attention to detail is second to none and the book is very professionally written. Loved it!" ~ Anne-Marie Reynolds for Readers' Favorite</description>

  <description>A magician’s ghost warns Lanith about fire and kisses. Fire for endings. Kisses for magical power like she’s never tasted before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanith and her husband Tredan, magical curio merchants in the seaside town of Isor, have a quiet life—until the day Lanith meets the ghost. She rushes home to find their store on fire and Tredan gone. Keeping a promise to Tredan to seek help if he ever went missing, Lanith teams up with Enchanter Nyle. The reclusive Enchanters are so attractive, the Church declares them a danger to a person’s soul. The warnings are valid—before Nyle will help her, she must taste his magical essence with a kiss. It is a revelation shattering everything she knows about magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They discover Tredan is not what he seems. For years a Church spell compelled him to write a secret journal with magic that will ruin the Enchanters. Enchanter essence powers everything in their world. Without it, many will die from lack of magic to nourish their bodies, fuel their machines, and even make the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a Church magician has come to Isor and he will stop at nothing to acquire Tredan’s journal. Lanith has to keep him from getting the journal and enslaving the Enchanters. In addition, she must conquer her desire for Nyle and his delectable magic before it sullies her marriage vows and damns her soul.</description>

  <description>A charm hidden in a shipping box brings Tredan’s disgraceful past to his door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired Enchanter Tredan and his wife Lanith, magical curio merchants in the seaside town of Isor, have been model citizens for years. But Tredan has harbored a terrible secret. As the victim of a Church-induced spell, he created a journal with spells to enslave the Enchanters’ magical essence to the Church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enchanters generate the essence powering everything in Tredan’s world. The Church has long resented the Enchanters’ exclusive control over essence. The head Church magician, His Divine, is determined to acquire Tredan’s journal and take the Enchanters’ power for his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Lanith out on an errand for the morning, Tredan opens the box containing an Enforcer’s compulsion charm. This Church magician will stop at nothing to collect Tredan’s journal for His Divine. The ensnared Tredan must battle the Enforcer’s superior magic and keep the journal safe. Tredan must also find a way, even if he must enlist the help of the dead, to warn an unsuspecting Lanith before she returns home and falls prey to His Divine’s wrath.</description>

  <description>This is a love story...and it's nothing like the other Navy SEAL books you have read. &lt;br /&gt;It's a look inside the head of the man who wore the uniform. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Ben Keegan leaves the Navy after a decade of service. He's been shot, captured, tortured, blown up, taken shrapnel, and he suffers from six tours of combat. This is a touching love story about overcoming pain and learning to trust and love... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former Navy SEAL Lieutenant, Ben Keegan, starts teaching history at the university Lara attends. Ben starts his own contracting firm, Dark Horse Guardians. He frequently takes on black-op missions for the CIA and other foreign intelligence entities. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Ben Keegan is a mystery man and Lara is immediately intrigued with him. But, more importantly Ben is strongly drawn to her. Incredibly handsome and attentive to Lara, there is one big problem: he is legally married and has a child. And, Ben is wrestling with problems from his many years in combat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lara is 24 years old, brilliant, beautiful and finishing her master's degree in a small New England town, but there's one thing missing from her life – a love relationship. Lara Reagan O'Connell is constantly pursued because of her striking good looks, but Lara refuses to get involved physically with any man before marriage. And, getting involved with a married guy would be out of the question. In today's world, she is considered a dinosaur, holding out for the right guy. She also harbors a dark secret that causes her to be introverted and cautious in all dealings with men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lara O'Connell is about to have a man enter her world who will alter the course of her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Their love story takes the reader on a romantic, psychological, sometimes gritty, journey. Both characters remain steadfast to their values, and discover that even though they have lived completely different lives – they have more in common then they originally thought. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Matt is worried! Their relationship is in trouble. Cassie has been begging him to add role-play to their lovemaking, but the kind of role Cassie wants him to play leaves him cold. When he discovers her stash of erotic romance novels, he comes to suspect that what she really wants is dominance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt takes Cassie away for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. She is disappointed that the ‘highlight’ of the weekend is to be a costume party. A costume party is not the kind of role-play she’s fantasized about. She is surprised when she realizes it will be a party for two and that Matt has actually taken her to a BDSM club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassie agrees to be his ‘love slave’ for the weekend and promises to obey all her ‘Master’s’ commands. Matt is surprised at her enthusiasm and is turned on by her ready acceptance of his domination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, he understands her desire to role-play and Matt indulges her fantasies, along with a few of his own. However, the weekend away has changed their relationship and has taken them in a direction he hadn’t foreseen. Now he’s wondering if they can survive the changes.</description>

  <description>Long Stories Short is a collection of short stories, written in a variety of genres, which includes previously published readers' favorites. Expect the unexpected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dreams and reality collide in "The Hunted." How long is "Forever?" Man's best friend proves that he truly is, in "Indisputable Evidence." Does Bigfoot exist? Eli believes so, in "One Step at a Time." Mark and Erin discover the power of the Ouija Board, in "You Summoned Me." Is there life after death? "A Candle in the Darkness" asks that question. "Magic or Miracles" takes the reader on a journey; is it magic or a miracle? "Mountain Justice," is a story of domestic violence, friendship and a horse's devotion. How far you would go to save a friend's life? Hasty decisions have devastating results in "Unintended Consequences." Tragedy is the "Aftermath" of a house fire.</description>

  <description>Two years have passed since Frederica joined Gaston aboard the Ocean’s Knave, and with every passing hour they have fallen more deeply in love. By day she is the ship’s physician, but at night she serves her captain in his bed, offering her body for him to punish and pleasure until she begs for more. But after a successful run of raiding other pirate ships, the couple have a target on their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only hope is to form an alliance with a trio of like-minded captains, but in order to guarantee the cooperation of these unyielding, battle-hardened men, Gaston is forced to offer them a night with Frederica. Reluctantly, she agrees to be shared with the men, but afterwards Gaston finds it difficult to forgive himself for bartering Frederica’s charms. As jealousy and desperation threaten to consume him, will Gaston lose his beloved Frederica or can he weather the storm and find a way to bind her to him forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publisher’s Note: Bound by the Buccaneer is the second book of the Pirates of the Jolie Rouge trilogy, which began with Rescued by the Buccaneer. It is an adventure and erotic romance novel that includes spankings, sexual scenes including a foursome, anal play, elements of BDSM, and more.</description>

  <description>Sunshine Everly’s way of life may not be ideal to some people, but it works for her. When her ex-husband confessed he’d had an affair, she swallowed her pride, and found a way to remain friends. Together they raise their children, while he continues to court her and she continues to shoot him down. It’s a friendly game of cat and mouse until suddenly, it’s not. Sunshine has to admit that her feelings for Matt are more than friendly, but is she ready to put her heart in his hands again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln is a small, quiet town where everyone knows everyone and gossip spreads like wild fire. When a local girl is found dead outside of town, the murder ignites a fear of the unknown to most in Lincoln. When a second girl is found, suddenly fingers start pointing and long standing relationships are tested. A monster lurks in the shadows while citizens of Lincoln live in fear of one of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunshine is fiercely independent, and proudly stands on her own but with two dead girls and one missing she must admit that she needs her ex-husband more than she cares to. Matt Everly is part of the police force and wants nothing more than to catch a killer and win back the love of his live. Amidst chaos, Matt and Sunshine try to rebuild their family while lives in Lincoln begin to crumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets are exposed and hearts are broken when the bleach killer is exposed. Can the residents of Lincoln recover from the fear and betrayal instilled by the Bleach Killer? Can Sunshine and Matt bring their family together regardless of the secrets that are exposed? Welcome to Lincoln, a sleepy little town where things are not as they seem, and a murderer is lurking in the dark.</description>

  <description>After losing his sight in a terrible accident, only to learn that the woman he was planning to marry did not love him enough to accept him, Damien Falconer was devastated. Struggling to cope with his disability, he isolated himself from society, allowing no one to get close to him, but his personal assistant, Jake. Upon learning Jake was soon to leave his employ and return to Scotland, Damien was forced to advertise for his replacement. Among the applicants who answered his ad was Lisa Andrews, a registered nurse from Connecticut. But Damien was adamant that he would not be replacing Jake with a woman. His argument was, he did not feel comfortable with a woman doing the things that Jake did for him, but one whiff of Lisa's unique scent and Damien found himself fighting a blistering physical attraction the likes of which he'd never known before. Should he hire her or should he ignore what his "other" senses were screaming at him, about this woman. Damien rustled with the question for several days, but in the end, he caved. And so began a hunger for a woman he couldn't see...could only recognize by her unique scent...yet wanted like he'd never wanted anything before.</description>

  <description>When unimaginable calamities strike, Mercy Carver, a poor London woman, wonders what she has done to deserve such immeasurable suffering. It is only when she faces imminent death in the snow and ice-encrusted Virginia wilderness that she finally understands the power of destiny.&lt;br /&gt;After escaping from sadistic criminals, she crosses an ocean and falls in love with Jacob Stone, a plantation owner determined to fight Abraham Lincoln and his government.&lt;br /&gt;Mercy is passionate. She loves and hates in equal measure. Can love and hatred give her the strength she needs now to reach a Northern state and free a runaway slave, wanted for murders she committed, in order to save him?&lt;br /&gt;America and her people are strangled in an uncompromising political stalemate. Southern states have seceded from the Union, and a civil war is imminent.&lt;br /&gt;Will Jacob find Mercy before he is embroiled in a war which could see them separated forever? Can Mercy’s determination to exact revenge on the criminal who imprisoned her be realised before she is forced to make a choice between her love for a slave owner and her ambition to assist fugitive slaves?&lt;br /&gt;Mercy Carver: her journey is just beginning.</description>

  <description>Sophie Waters’ life was turned upside down when her mother passed away from cancer but the news her father and aunt delivered to her after the passing was far more devastating and unbelievable. ‘You’re a witch doctor, a healer, and you’re needed here to help protect the supernatural inhabitants of Mystery Springs.’ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Like hell,’ was her response but the moment the witches unlocked her powers there was no way she could deny the truth. And the moment she met her vampire prince there was no way she could leave Mystery Springs even if she wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment the powerful and terrifying Giovanni Mancuso spotted the spunky girl in ripped jeans, green cotton hoodie with her jet black hair in a ponytail and her green eyes covered by black cat glasses he was lost. She was not like the other girls that frequented his nightclub. She was different on so many levels. The moment his eyes connected with hers his soul knew she was important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was his soul mate, his first love, a love lost centuries ago. Only she was different; stronger, powerful. Sophie and Giovanni explore their feelings while they attempt to uncover the secret behind acts of war on the supernatural people of Mystery Springs. Together they will face off against dream assassins, death, ghosts, gods, and their own families to save the small Colorado town and find a path back into the safety of each other’s arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past lives collide in this paranormal romance with mythological consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note this is a new adult paranormal novel and contains adult subject matter of sexual nature and profanity.</description>

  <description>The story revolves around the rags to riches rise of Maria Brooks who marries a deranged genius working in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug addiction, anti-aging, art theft, murder, and the reader's favorite - Slade Kelly, a flawed, noirish undercover detective makes this an engaging and entertaining read. The action spans the globe – from the barren deserts of California to the snow-capped Himalayas, with stopovers in breathtaking Provence, ritzy New York and windy Chicago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet, orphaned Afghan girls, dreaded gangsters in the mafia, dirty politicians and unscrupulous businesses make their presence felt as the series weaves along at a sprightly pace. Will Maria go to prison forever? Will Slade die in a gun battle with the FBI? Will the motel guests be able to break the inadvertent drug habit they picked up at the Blue Coyote? Who are those little Afghan girls in the barn in Provence? Will Jordan and Maria ever find happiness?</description>

  <description>The dreaded B&amp;amp;B turned out to be far superior than expected! Mrs. Jeeves was hot, hot, hot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not your typical widow, Mrs. Jeeves had an enterprising B&amp;amp;B which was a little hub of happiness. Life is meant to live. She made sure she lived it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter’s life was centered around work. It had been a long time since he had been home to see the family. The timing for his visit was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire couldn’t wait for Peter to visit. She had to twist his arm to stay at the B&amp;amp;B. She could sense he wasn’t really keen on the trip. Her father was suddenly a changed man soon after his arrival at the B&amp;amp;B. Claire was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance was a very big factor for Peter and Mrs. Jeeves. Following his first visit they became friends. They grew closer as they communicated. Peter had to make a decision though. He had fallen head over heels in love. Visits were no longer enough. He had to make things permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he stepped out of the car on his last visit the decision was made!</description>

  <description>Silke left Grant under a gloomy and heavy cloud. Her best friend had become her enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silke and Kai made their way home. It had been a few years and her family wasn’t aware that Kai existed. She had to right her wrongs. Kai needed to meet her relatives. But Silke wasn’t prepared in any way as to what was waiting for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant doted on his daughter Claire. There were many questions that he couldn’t answer. She looked nothing like her biological mother but had the markings of the woman he had always been in love with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Grant realized Silke was home he had to clear the air. He had to explain what had happened. She needed to know the truth. What she thought was the truth was far from it. Emma didn’t feature in his life. She never had. He did have feelings for Emma though – pure hatred. He would get through to Silke even if he had to bide his time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kai and Claire’s lives were entwined. Did their parents have the same?</description>

  <description>It's Mardi Gras in post-Katrina New Orleans. With only one week until the big day, thousands of tourists have flocked to the city, paralyzing traffic and jamming the French Quarter with drunken crowds and garbage. City officials are hoping for record crowds to generate the biggest boost to the Crescent City since the "big storm." Alexander Lee Destephano, legal counsel for Crescent City Medical Center, a prestigious, world-class hospital, is excitedly anticipating her third Mardi Gras Season and most of all, her date with dashing art historian Mitch Landry. The couple has tickets to the Edition Extravaganza, the biggest Mardi Gras Ball in New Orleans at the Super Dome on Saturday evening. After several years, life is good again and Alex is determined to experience everything it has to offer. She can hardly wait until Saturday evening. But, things change. Alex is stat-paged to the Medical Center at 6:00 am on Monday morning only to learn from her boss, Don Montgomery and her former husband, Dr. Robert Bonnet that Grace Raccine, a cancer patient at CCMC and the first lady of Louisiana has been found unconscious in her room covered with blood. To make matters worse, patients are leaving CCMC against medical advice and staff are refusing to work creating crisis and chaos in the Obamacare hospital environment. By the end of the day, the much anticipated night with Mitch Landry dancing under the lights at the Endymion Ball is the last things on Alex's mind!</description>

  <description>Alex the Mutt was the love of my life, but she could have been euthanized before having had a chance to live. Please join me on my journey to find love, and the emotional conflict I endured when forced to leave a dog behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These strays deserve more. All it takes is compassion and understanding. Too many animals are killed before their time, and this has got to end now. &lt;br /&gt;If only more people would stop and think first before going to a pet store or breeder. Instead, visit a local rescue, pound, or shelter. It’s time to be their voice; please help spread the word. Will you join the cause?</description>

  <description>[Siren Ménage Everlasting: Erotic Futuristic Sci-Fi Cowboy Ménage a Trois Romance, M/F/M]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the year of catastrophes, Ronnie jumped at the offer of protection from a lifelong friend. When the safety he provided turned into abuse, she ran, vowing to take care of herself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ronnie doesn’t need a man, much less two, but Brice and Garrett think she’s pushing her luck by living in the Border Lands without a man to keep her safe. They are hell-bent on helping her, despite her claim that she doesn’t need them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brice and Garrett are more than able to take care of all Ronnie’s needs, including those she doesn’t realize she has. When danger shows up at their door, it’s up to them to keep her safe, but she has to make a decision. Will they become more than her lovers, or is she too scared to let them into her heart?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Siren Erotic Romance</description>

  <description>After an impoverished and indigent childhood, Callie Dahl is interested in one thing: money enough to buy her own home. Love and marriage are impractical pursuits, and hold zero attraction for her—though she alleviates her loneliness through the guilty pleasure of an at-far fantasy of her temporary boss, Lucius Ransome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Lucius gives her the task of disproving a long-standing Ransome Family legend, it’s a tossup for her whether the main attraction is the financial bonus he’s promised or the chance to spend time in his company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her investigation unravels more than family secrets. As she plunges into a steamy affair with Lucius, everything she holds true comes apart as he introduces her to a world where love actually might mean more than money.</description>

You will also never forget how it felt when it was torn apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year old Grace Hathaway does not give much thought to falling in love, until the day that Ian Taylor, rebel and misfit walks into her math class.

  <description>Jayden Farrell accepted long ago that he would not have a passionate relationship with all the bells and whistles that were toted around. When his partner of eight years told him she had found someone who could not only give her all the bells and whistles, but wanted to marry her, Jay, as his close friends called him, was shattered.&lt;br /&gt;Genevieve Shelton, Genna to her friends, lived a quiet uneventful life with her Grams in a small town in Connecticut. She’d lost her parents at a young age and had been brought up by her Grams with old fashioned values and ideas. Genna didn’t socialize much with the younger crowd, and had been reluctant to get involved with the young men who usually approached her. When her last relationship ended after only three months, she was in no hurry to get involved with anyone, that was, until Jayden Farrell walked into the bar where she worked. Genna found herself burning for him with a fire that threatened to consume her.&lt;br /&gt;Can this ill-matched pair find love? Can they too experience the bells and whistles? Read Jay and Genna’s story and see how easy it is with the right partner … against all odds.</description>

  <description>It is December, 1799, and Captain of Marines Simon Gamble has been sent behind enemy lines to capture an impregnable fortress called Dominance on the Maltese island of Gozo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gamble must lead his lightly-armed men against the prime veteran soldiers of France, in a daring and brutal fight where there can only be one winner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Success means freedom for the Gozitans from their French oppressors; failure means the marines face an unmarked grave on foreign soil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hero and a soldier to some, but certainly no gentleman, Gamble; battle-scarred and haunted by the horrific bloodshed at the Siege of Acre prior to this mission, must fight a new guileful enemy, even if the price means death or dishonour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Gamble's toughest fight yet, and one he knows he cannot afford to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the ultimate battle will be for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heart of Oak, is an authentic historical story set during the liberation of the Maltese Islands, the second novella in The Soldier Chronicles series.</description>

  <description>Recovering from a tragic accident I found recalling my past was my answer. When I was ten it was a magical time when I was given a chance by my grannie to have one wish come true... for a little while. I found Evernow, a realm between time and no time where only those who die with a pure heart can go. I was invited. There I discovered my true heritage, the power in a silver necklace, why there is no magic in our world and how evil can come to even the perfect places, but still be defeated with the help of a child. But we have to grow up, even if the perfect life we experienced has to be left behind. Let me tell you of my adventure during the summer when I was ten and you, too, might become a believer in magic once again. Madison's memory reveals a fantastic world she entered to rescue her Grampy and return a power-filled necklace to its rightful owner. But ill intent found this sanctuary created for all magical creatures. Its good light can burn evil, so protection is conjured from the lost essence of the purest of creatures - unicorns. And an elf prince is held captive as ransom for the object of real power the realm was illegally entered to recover. Only the child can enter the lair to free the prince, but she has a lot of help and protection, and it is they who are in most danger. Quote from book: I kept going back for a long time, every chance I could during our stays with Grannie. I was sure it was a special place for something special to visit for me to see. And, finally something did. Quote from book: For his part Foresti went into a deep meditation envisioning every inch of his carefully created land. He searched for XoLar Althusa in every niche and crevice, hollow tree and underwater cave he remembered. Unsuccessful he turned to seeking out new secret places. No creature could tell him and no vision opened to him a new place for such a vial man to hide. Frustration was only the tip of his growing fear. He knew this demonic wizard liked to play with his victims much as a cat plays with a mouse before it kills. He walked in the walled gardens, and haunted the empty halls of the large castle. Reaching the highest spire he circled its interior while gazing out over the land with his enhanced wizard vision. Unwinding his memory he tried to put pieces of all he knew and remembered together. He sought the illusive bit of his formula to complete his equation. He came to only one conclusion and he didn't like it at all. He didn't like it because it meant Gwenya Lett had more power than any of them knew, even if she had stolen it from the dead. He had one last source to confirm his suspicions -- Melvedic.</description>

  <description>Have Fun and Enjoy These Greek Recipes &lt;br /&gt;“LET’S GET GREEK COOKING NOW” &lt;br /&gt;Natural Traditional Healthy Cooking with flavors from natural herbs. &lt;br /&gt;Nutritional home cooked Greek food has been proved by researchers to lessen health problems. The answer is to cook and eat a wide variety of minimal processed foods to cover all the nutritional bases. The beauty of genuine Greek cooking and eating is using a good amount of extra virgin olive oil rich in oleic acid. Legumes are rich in vitamins, vegetables high in vitamins and fibres, the probiotics in yogurt, cheeses, antioxidants in red wine, whole wheat breads, cold-pressed vegetable oils along with good exercise such as walking all increase “good” cholesterol and a healthy heart. Eat moderate portions and now and again spoil yourself with a Greek desert, baked with nuts and semolina.</description>

  <description>While trying to complete a difficult assassination, Yrlissa decides her days of killing must come to an end if she hopes to protect her new family. But the winds of apocalyptic prophecy are tearing through the kingdoms of Talohna. Rumors of a strange being influencing kings and emperors as well as sightings of a vile, ancient, witch coven believed destroyed long ago are all omens of the darkness growing within Talohna. With her personal history woven firmly to these events, can Yrlissa keep her family safely hidden long enough to finish her final contract and then disappear with them or will the phantoms of her past rise up to take everything from her first?</description>

  <description>Deep in the heart of the rainforest, the peaceful Wakani people are protected by the nagual -- fierce jaguar warriors able to change from man to feline. Felipe is one of them, but a chance encounter with a mysterious woman becomes more than he could’ve ever bargained for. Upon revealing his true form, the desirable young man immediately captures Dahlia’s interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dynamite, guns, and the spread of an invading civilization are only some of the perils threatening Felipe's tribe. Another hungry danger lurks just beyond the village boundaries, and it eagerly awaits the chance to make the whole tribe its prey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felipe becomes torn between duty and desire, but Dahlia’s past makes them natural enemies. Can they overcome their differences in time to face the greater danger… or will a sinister presence consume them all?</description>

  <description>It was the summer of 1985, and she was young and inexperienced, but longing to love and to be loved in return, when he entered her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, while she was desperately seeking the love and approval of a mother who never wanted her in the first place, events totally beyond her control claimed her as their victim, leaving those she left behind unable to cope with the enormity of her absence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"WHY SHE LEFT US” is written as a series of diary entries, the events seen through the eyes of several different people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at its center is a love story chronicling a romance that transforms the lives of two people who, for too brief a period of time, experienced the greatest happiness they had ever known.</description>

  <description>Sebastian is the story of a young man who has his leg amputated before World War I. When his father is drafted to the war it falls on to him to run the family grocery store in Vienna, to grow into his responsibilities, bear loss and uncertainty and hopefully find love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Schreiber, his extended family, their friends and the store employees experience the ‘golden days’ of pre-war Vienna and the timed of the war and the end of the Monarchy while trying to make a living and to preserve what they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fischer convincingly describes life in Vienna during the war, how it affected the people in an otherwise safe and prosperous location, the beginning of the end for the Monarchy, the arrival of modern thoughts and trends, the Viennese class system and the end of an era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in the first part of the trilogy, “The Luck of The Weissensteiners” we are confronted again with themes of identity, Nationality and borders. The step back in time made from Book 1 and the change of location from Slovakia to Austria enables the reader to see the parallels and the differences deliberately out of the sequential order. This helps to see one not as the consequence of the other, but to experience them as the momentary reality as it must have felt for the people at the time.</description>

  <description>Sparks fly when up-and-coming artist Carmen Harris meets football star Natron Dakers at her first gallery opening. Carmen soon discovers that Natron is the type of man who sees what he wants and goes after it… and apparently what he wants is her. Almost before she knows it Carmen finds herself taking everything Natron gives her and begging for more, and when he reveals that he wants to be her dominant daddy and her to be his submissive little girl, she doesn’t hesitate to agree. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the top of his profession, Natron has money, fame, and all the perks that go with them, and now at last in Carmen he has found a woman he wants to share it with. His life feels complete… until in a split second everything comes crashing down when a devastating injury threatens to end his season—and maybe his career. Natron fears he will lose it all, but will he self-destruct or can he dig deep and fight hard for himself, his teammates, and his little girl? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Publisher’s Note: Daddy’s Game is the second book in the Daddy’s Girl series. It incorporates characters from the first book in the series, Daddy Morebucks, but it is a stand-alone novel. The content of Daddy’s Game includes spankings, graphic sexual scenes, elements of age play and BDSM, and more. If such material offends you, please don’t buy this book.</description>

  <description>High in his attic bedroom, twelve-year-old David mourns the death of his mother, with only the books on his shelf for company. But those books have begun to whisper to him in the darkness. Angry and alone, he takes refuge in his imagination and soon finds that reality and fantasy have begun to meld. While his family falls apart around him, David is violently propelled into a world that is a strange reflection of his own -- populated by heroes and monsters and ruled by a faded king who keeps his secrets in a mysterious book, The Book of Lost Things.</description>

  <description>As dusk approaches a small Dublin suburb in the summer of 1984, mothers begin to call their children home. But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox—his partner and closest friend—find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richly atmospheric and stunning in its complexity, &lt;i&gt;In the Woods&lt;/i&gt; is utterly convincing and surprising to the end.</description>

Still, in that instant, I felt &lt;/i&gt;well&lt;i&gt;. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen.

  <description>To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt;, then scattered and torn in &lt;i&gt;New Moon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt; - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

  <description>When a vampire asks cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse to use her telepathic skills to find another missing vampire, she agrees under one condition: the vampires must promise to behave and let the humans that are involved to go unharmed. Easier said than done. All it takes is one delicious blond and one small mistake for things to turn deadly.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Margaret Lea opened the door to the past, what she confronted was her destiny.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All children mythologize their birth...&lt;/i&gt; So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter’s collection of stories, which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself—all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter’s story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida’s storytelling but remains suspicious of the author’s sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Thirteenth Tale&lt;/i&gt; is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes &lt;i&gt;The Pillars of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.</description>

  <description>          They were young, brilliant, and ambitious. They set out to conquer the world. Instead, the world conquered them. &lt;br /&gt;          Bestselling author Susan Jane Gilman's riveting new memoir is a hilarious and haunting true adventure. It's filled with the memorable characters, psychological insights, and dazzling humor she's known for. Yet it also displays an accomplished literary eloquence and grandeur of scale that will entertain and enthrall old and new fans alike.&lt;br /&gt;          In 1986, fresh out of college, Susan Jane Gilman and her friend Chloe dreamed of hitting the road as modern-day female Kerouacs. Inspired by a placemat at the International House of Pancakes, they mapped out a trip circling the globe, then headed west--to China. &lt;br /&gt;          At that point in time, the People's Republic had been open to backpackers for barely ten minutes. But Susan and Chloe relished the challenge. Having been told throughout their Ivy League schooling that they were "the future leaders of America", they were eager to boldly take on the world. Unfortunately, the world had other ideas. &lt;br /&gt;          Armed only with the collected works of Nietzsche, an astrology book, and more chutzpah than sense, the two quickly found themselves on an epic misadventure. &lt;br /&gt;          As they trekked off the map into the dusty, alien streets of Communist China, they were quickly stripped of everything familiar. At turns funny, erotic, and harrowing, their journey became a string of poignant encounters with Chinese and Westerners alike. But it soon grew sinister. &lt;br /&gt;          The two young women found themselves trapped in their own peculiar Heart of Darkness in the middle of rural China, and what began as a giddy expedition became a real-life international thriller that transformed their lives for forever. &lt;br /&gt;          &lt;i&gt;Undress me in the Temple of Heaven&lt;/i&gt; is an astonishing, real-life story of hubris --and redemption-- told with tremendous heart.</description>

  <description>The inspiring account of one man's campaign to build schools in the most dangerous, remote, and anti-American reaches of Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 2011, the CBS documentary "60 Minutes" called into question Greg Mortenson's work. The program alleged several inaccuracies in &lt;i&gt;Three Cups of Tea&lt;/i&gt;, and its sequel, &lt;i&gt;Stones into Schools&lt;/i&gt;, as well as financial improprieties in the operation of Mortenson's Central Asia Institute. Questions were also raised about Mortenson's claim that he got lost near K2 and ended up in Korphe; that he was captured by the Taliban in 1996; the number of schools the CAI claimed to have built; and whether CAI funds had been used appropriately for Mortenson's book tours. Jon Krakauer, who had supported the CAI to the tune of $75,000, also questioned Mortenson's accounts, and released his allegations in a lengthy article titled &lt;i&gt;Three Cups of Deceit&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Tatiana de Rosnay offers us a brilliantly subtle, compelling portrait of France under occupation and reveals the taboos and silence that surround this painful episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, July 1942: Sarah, a ten year-old girl, is brutally arrested with her family by the French police in the Vel’ d’Hiv’ roundup, but not before she locks her younger brother in a cupboard in the family's apartment, thinking that she will be back within a few hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, May 2002: On Vel’ d’Hiv’s 60th anniversary, journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write an article about this black day in France's past. Through her contemporary investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connect her to Sarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl's ordeal, from that terrible term in the Vel d'Hiv', to the camps, and beyond. As she probes into Sarah's past, she begins to question her own place in France, and to reevaluate her marriage and her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tatiana de Rosnay offers us a brilliantly subtle, compelling portrait of France under occupation and reveals the taboos and silence that surround this painful episode.</description>

  <description>A spellbinding, beautifully written novel that moves between contemporary times and one of the most fascinating and disturbing periods in American history--the Salem witch trials. Harvard graduate student Connie Goodwin needs to spend her summer doing research for her doctoral dissertation. But when her mother asks her to handle the sale of Connie's grandmother's abandoned home near Salem, she can't refuse. As she is drawn deeper into the mysteries of the family house, Connie discovers an ancient key within a seventeenth-century Bible. The key contains a yellowing fragment of parchment with a name written upon it: Deliverance Dane. This discovery launches Connie on a quest--to find out who this woman was and to unearth a rare artifact of singular power: a physick book, its pages a secret repository for lost knowledge. As the pieces of Deliverance's harrowing story begin to fall into place, Connie is haunted by visions of the long-ago witch trials, and she begins to fear that she is more tied to Salem's dark past then she could have ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with astonishing conviction and grace, &lt;i&gt;The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane&lt;/i&gt; travels seamlessly between the witch trials of the 1690s and a modern woman's story of mystery, intrigue, and revelation.</description>

  <description>Bestselling author and columnist Carl Hiaasen returns with another hysterical mystery for kids set in Florida's Everglades.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a "family emergency," Nick and Marta just don't buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And he does! But not in the way they think. There's a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. And Nick and Marta will have to reckon with an eccentric eco-avenger, a stuffed rat named Chelsea, a wannabe Texas oilman, a singing substitute teacher, and a ticked-off Florida panther before they really begin to see the big picture.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's life in the swamp, kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author T. R. Reid guides a whirlwind tour ofsuccessful health care systems worldwide, revealing possible pathstoward U.S. reform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Healing of America, New York Times&lt;/i&gt;bestselling author T. R. Reid shows how all the otherindustrialized democracies have achieved something the UnitedStates can-t seem to do: provide health care for everybody at areasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his global quest to find a possible prescription,Reid visits wealthy, free market, industrialized democracieslike our own-including France, Germany, Japan, the U.K.,and Canada-where he finds inspiration in example. Reidshares evidence from doctors, government officials, health careexperts, and patients the world over, finding that foreign healthcare systems give everybody quality care at an affordable cost.And that dreaded monster -socialized medicine-turns out to be a myth. Many developed countries provideuniversal coverage with private doctors, private hospitals, andprivate insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to long-established systems, Reid alsostudies countries that have carried out major health carereform. The first question facing these countries-and theUnited States, for that matter-is an ethical issue: Is healthcare a human right? Most countries have already answered witha resolute yes, leaving the United States in the murky moralbackwater with nations we typically think of as far less just thanour own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Healing of America&lt;/i&gt; lays bare the moral questionat the heart of our troubled system, dissecting the misleadingrhetoric surrounding the health care debate. Reid sees problemselsewhere, too: He finds poorly paid doctors in Japan, endlesslines in Canada, mistreated patients in Britain, spartan facilitiesin France. Still, all the other rich countries operate at a lowercost, produce better health statistics, and cover everybody.In the end, &lt;i&gt;The Healing of America&lt;/i&gt; is a good news book: Itfinds models around the world that Americans can borrow toguarantee health care for everybody who needs it.</description>

  <description>The year is 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, have come to Shutter Island, home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. Multiple murderess Rachel Solando is loose somewhere on this remote and barren island, despite having been kept in a locked cell under constant surveillance. As a killer hurricane relentlessly bears down on them, a strange case takes on even darker, more sinister shades—with hints of radical experimentation, horrifying surgeries, and lethal countermoves made in the cause of a covert shadow war. No one is going to escape Shutter Island unscathed, because nothing at Ashecliffe Hospital is what it seems. But then neither is Teddy Daniels.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A modern gothic novel of suspense that reveals, through their diaries, the story of sisters who fall in love with a beguiling stranger, and of the town that turns a blind eye to his murderous ways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two sisters and their aunt are found dead in their suburban Dublin home, it seems that the secret behind their untimely demise will never be known. But then Niall, a young mailman, finds a mysterious diary in the post office’s dead-letter bin. From beyond the grave, Fiona Walsh shares the most tragic love story he’s ever heard—and her tale has only just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niall soon becomes enveloped by the mystery surrounding itinerant storyteller Jim, who traveled through Ireland enrapturing audiences and wooing women with his macabre mythic narratives. Captivated by Jim, townspeople across Ireland thought it must be a sad coincidence that horrific murders trailed him wherever he went—and they failed to connect that the young female victims, who were smitten by the newest bad boy in town, bore an all too frightening similarity to the victims in Jim’s own fictional plots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Walsh sisters, fiercely loyal to one another, were not immune to “darling” Jim’s powers of seduction, but found themselves in harm’s way when they began to uncover his treacherous past. Niall must now continue his dangerous hunt for the truth—and for the vanished third sister—while there’s still time. And in the woods, the wolves from Jim’s stories begin to gather.</description>

  <description>A newspaper photographer, Jean, researches the lurid and sensational ax murder of two women in 1873 as an editorial tie-in with a brutal modern double murder. (Can you guess which one?) She discovers a cache of papers that appear to give an account of the murders by an eyewitness. The plot weaves between the narrative of the eyewitness and Jean's private struggle with jealousies and suspicions as her marriage teeters. A rich, textured novel.</description>

  <description>Meet twenty-two-year-old Cherry Pye (née Cheryl Bunterman), a pop star since she was fourteen—and about to attempt a comeback from her latest drug-and-alcohol disaster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now meet Cherry again: in the person of her “undercover stunt double,” Ann DeLusia. Ann portrays Cherry whenever the singer is too “indisposed”—meaning wasted—to go out in public. And it is Ann-mistaken-for-Cherry who is kidnapped from a South Beach hotel by obsessed paparazzo Bang Abbott. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the challenge for Cherry’s handlers (über–stage mother; horndog record producer; nipped, tucked, and Botoxed twin publicists; weed whacker–wielding bodyguard) is to rescue Ann while keeping her existence a secret from Cherry’s public—and from Cherry herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation is more complicated than they know. Ann has had a bewitching encounter with Skink—the unhinged former governor of Florida living wild in a mangrove swamp—and now he’s heading for Miami to find her . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Bang Abbott achieve his fantasy of a lucrative private photo session with Cherry Pye? Will Cherry sober up in time to lip-synch her way through her concert tour? Will Skink track down Ann DeLusia before Cherry’s motley posse does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All will be revealed in this hilarious spin on life in the celebrity fast lane.</description>

  <description>Humans have been displaced at the top of the food chain, and now understand – to their outright horror – what it is to be not the consumer, but the consumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ephraim Goodweather, director of the New York office of the Centers for Disease control, is one of the few humans who understands what is really happening. Vampires have arrived in New York City, and their condition is contagious. If they cannot be contained, the entire world is at risk of infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Eph becomes consumed with the battle against the total corruption of humanity, his ex-wife, Kelly, now a vampire herself, is ever-more determined to claim their son, Zack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Biblical origins of the Ancient ones are gradually revealed, Eph learns that there is a greater, more terrible plan in store for the human race – worse even than annihilation…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An inspiring story of survival and our powerful bond with man's best friend, in the aftermath of the nation's most notorious case of animal cruelty. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Animal lovers and sports fans were shocked when the story broke about NFL player Michael Vick's brutal dog fighting operation. But what became of the dozens of dogs who survived? As acclaimed writer Jim Gorant discovered, their story is the truly newsworthy aspect of this case. Expanding on Gorant's &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt; cover story, &lt;i&gt;The Lost Dogs&lt;/i&gt; traces the effort to bring Vick to justice and turns the spotlight on these infamous pit bulls, which were saved from euthanasia by an outpouring of public appeals coupled with a court order that Vick pay nearly a million dollars in "restitution" to the dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As an ASPCA-led team evaluated each one, they found a few hardened fighters, but many more lovable, friendly creatures desperate for compassion. In &lt;i&gt;The Lost Dogs&lt;/i&gt;, we meet these amazing animals, a number of which are now living in loving homes, while some even work in therapy programs: Johnny Justice participates in Paws for Tales, which lets kids get comfortable with reading aloud by reading to dogs; Leo spends three hours a week with cancer patients and troubled teens. At the heart of the stories are the rescue workers who transformed the pups from victims of animal cruelty into healing caregivers themselves, unleashing priceless hope.</description>

  <description>Part blistering espionage thriller, part riveting police procedural, and part piercing exposé on social injustice, &lt;i&gt;The Girl Who Played with Fire&lt;/i&gt; is a masterful, endlessly satisfying novel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mikael Blomkvist, crusading publisher of the magazine &lt;i&gt;Millennium&lt;/i&gt;, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend, the troubled genius hacker Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of Salander’s innocence, plunges into an investigation. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The stunning third and final novel in Stieg Larsson’s internationally best-selling trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisbeth Salander—the heart of Larsson’s two previous novels—lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She’s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she’ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revenge—against the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now Salander is fighting back.</description>

  <description>The magnificent, if monstrously warped brainchild of cinematic horror master Guillermo del Toro (&lt;em&gt;Pan’s Labyrinth, Hellboy&lt;/em&gt;) and Chuck Hogan (&lt;em&gt;Prince of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;) begins where &lt;em&gt;The Strain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Fall&lt;/em&gt; left off: with the last remnants of humankind enslaved by the vampire masters in a world forever shrouded by nuclear winter.  Still, a small band of the living fights on in the shadows.</description>

  <description>The time is the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place, the rugged coast of northern California. A bluff high above the Pacific. A grand mansion full of beauty and tantalizing history set against a towering redwood forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young reporter on assignment from the San Francisco Observer. . . an older woman, welcoming him into her magnificent, historic family home that he has been sent to write about and that she must sell with some urgency . . . A chance encounter between two unlikely people . . . an idyllic night—shattered by horrific unimaginable violence. . .The young man inexplicably attacked—bitten—by a beast he cannot see in the rural darkness . . . A violent episode that sets in motion a terrifying yet seductive transformation as the young man, caught between ecstasy and horror, between embracing who he is evolving into and fearing who—what—he will become, soon experiences the thrill of the wolf gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he resists the paradoxical pleasure and enthrallment of his wolfen savagery and delights in the power and (surprising) capacity for good, he is caught up in a strange and dangerous rescue and is desperately hunted as “the Man Wolf,” by authorities, the media and scientists (evidence of DNA threaten to reveal his dual existence). . . As a new and profound love enfolds him, questions emerge that propel him deeper into his mysterious new world: questions of why and how he has been given this gift; of its true nature and the curious but satisfying pull towards goodness; of the profound realization that there are others like him who may be watching—guardian creatures who have existed throughout time and may possess ancient secrets and alchemical knowledge and throughout it all, the search for salvation for a soul tormented by a new realm of temptations, and the fraught, exhilarating journey, still to come, of being and becoming, fully, both wolf and man.</description>

  <description>Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A groundbreaking work from a master, &lt;i&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/i&gt; is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special twelve-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless—mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the “steam” that children with the “shining” produce when they are slowly tortured to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father’s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant “shining” power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes “Doctor Sleep.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan’s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra’s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of The Shining and satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.</description>

As he submits his final manuscript to his sceptical editor, he tells the story of Professor George Tate, and Celus - his seemingly ageless assistant - as they are expelled from the British Museum and embark on a journey that leaves a wake of irrevocably changed lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because Freeman has realised the Professor's truth - that the walls are thinning and the shadows are lengthening as our world awaits Her arrival.</description>

  <description>The Master's Plan is a realistic but warm and inspirational story of a woman’s struggle to find her purpose in life. The story is written with a touch of humor and a solid backdrop of both public service and church 'politics'! Snappy dialogue, interesting yet realistic plot twists, and strong likable characters who have an opinion about everything make this a fun to read and thought-provoking novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selena Beatrice Jones, aka ‘SB’ to her friends, is married to Pastor Woodruff T. Jones, pastor of Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church, Smoothville, Georgia and still sometimes struggles with her status as the good Pastor’s second wife and the daily challenges it brings…with his family and his church of 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after recently celebrating her 50th birthday, Selena thinks she's got it 'going on' and is excited about God's plans to use her to move Mt. Sinai into the 21st century via The Master's Plan. In her excitement to fulfill her purpose, Selena doesn't realize that when Commissioner Reginald Thompson II, aspiring political candidate, agrees to buy into her Master’s Plan, he does so because he has his own 'master plan'. One designed to get him into the State Legislature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selena is on a mission to fulfill her God given purpose on earth, confident that her steps are ordered by the Lord! Reginald is just as confident that his master plan will get him into office and that Selena B. Jones is the lady who can help get him there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Commissioner’s staff struggle to convince him of the importance of adhering to the often painful and seemingly unnecessary bureaucratic details associated with federal funding of faith based programs, Selena attempts to garner the critically needed backing of church family, community and friends for the Plan. Suddenly her husband disappears! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plan takes on a life of its own and without the good Pastor’s approval. Selena's hands are full as she struggles to understand Woody's sudden and highly suspect disappearance while defending both his reputation and position as Pastor of Mt. Sinai to a disgruntled and sometimes hostile committee of church elders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Commissioner’s flagrant reliance on his charm, good looks and ‘massage the truth’ tactics to accomplish his mission causes his chief strategist, Shawn Mallory, to challenge the integrity of the plan. Deciding that his boss has finally crossed the line, Mallory jumps ship just as the master plan project is launched. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unusual and atypical relationships form between government and church officials; old and new friends; and past and present family making this a ‘must read’ for everyone struggling to find purpose!</description>

  <description>On a remote island off the coast of Maine, a troubled family is trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives and start over. But unbeknownst to them, the property they have inherited is steeped in ancient magic – magic that could seek to destroy and devour them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An arcane locked box, a strange and foreboding trail into the woods, a seductive young woman, and tales of a malevolent Indian spirit, are just some of the perils Karen Andersen must face in order to find a way to save her family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A spine-tingling tale filled with passion, lies, and betrayal, Ms. Watkins debut novel, will have you sleeping with the lights on! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PRAISE FOR MATEGUAS ISLAND: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Native American folklore blends with a tale of suspense and horror in the multifaceted Mateguas Island….Mateguas Island employs a device other authors (most notably Stephen King in his classic novel The Shining) have successfully used in placing danger both outside and within the family structure.... Surprising twists and turns and a powerful old box filled with magic: these are the elements of a fine horror story that slowly builds its plot with believable protagonists and engrossing color...Any who like horror stories and gothic fiction will find Mateguas Island an exceptional read." &lt;br /&gt;~D. Donovan, Senior Ebook Reviewer, MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"...a fast-paced and unpredictable story that is both spooky and entertaining. Mateguas Island is an absorbing horror tale and is highly recommended." &lt;br /&gt;~READERS' FAVORITE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"...a creeping slow-burn that deliberately ensnares you. A truly exceptional book." &lt;br /&gt;~Jim Goforth, author of "Plebs" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"This has been one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. It would take pride of place on my bookshelf, and would be one of those books that I would read more than once." &lt;br /&gt;~Jan Raymond, author of "Circle of Five" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"For anyone who enjoys, true horror tinged with the occult, this story will be right up your alley." &lt;br /&gt;~Hunter Jones, author of "September Again" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Mateguas Island" by Linda Watkins is well-written, full of terror and suspense... The dramatic tension builds throughout, interspersed with horrific moments that keep your skin tingling and your heart racing." &lt;br /&gt;~Thomas Baker, author of "Pecha Kucha and English Language Teaching" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"I was immediately transported to this rocky sea-side setting and the sense of isolation was conveyed easily. There is just enough suspense to keep the reader hooked…I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good page-turner to curl up with!" &lt;br /&gt;~Melissa Miles, Melissa's Reviews &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Mateguas Island is a well written book!!...I truly love endings that make me drop my mouth because I didn't see it coming! I can not wait to read more from this author!! Great book!!" &lt;br /&gt;~Barb's Review - Goodreads &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Coming on like a classic and blending the finest elements of Amytiville, The Wicker Man, and James Herbert's "Magic Cottage", this slick psychological horror transcends its genre to speak directly to the reader with a highly polished subtext." &lt;br /&gt;~M.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It happened like this. I was stolen from an airport. Taken from everything I knew, everything I was used to. Taken to sand and heat, dirt and danger. And he expected me to love him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A letter from nowhere. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Gemma is kidnapped from Bangkok airport and taken to the Australian Outback. This wild and desolate landscape becomes almost a character in the book, so vividly is it described. Ty, her captor, is no stereotype. He is young, fit and completely gorgeous. This new life in the wilderness has been years in the planning. He loves only her, wants only her. Under the hot glare of the Australian sun, cut off from the world outside, can the force of his love make Gemma love him back? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story takes the form of a letter, written by Gemma to Ty, reflecting on those strange and disturbing months in the outback. Months when the lines between love and obsession, and love and dependency, blur until they don't exist--almost.</description>

  <description>I was raised within the community of the New Zealand, Seacliff Mental Hospital village during the 1950s, with each of our family members working in the psychiatric hospital at some time or another. We sometimes shared our primary school with young patients who came down from the hospital. On turning fifteen we often worked up the hill, helping in the canteen, laundry, wards or occupational therapy. From a young age we absorbed the stories, and it was difficult to know where fiction ended and the greater truth took over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To separate the truths from the almost-truths at this stage would be an impossible task as many of those concerned have died. Therefore I have blended together various stories in this narrative as representative of our family and friends' combined belief of what most probably did happen during the period covered by this narrative. Wherever possible, I have used correct dates, names and places. When there is a modicum of doubt in my mind I have changed names and details for the protection of those still living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child I knew Malcolm, who was then a young man, since Dad often invited him home for meals. He was one of the lost children, those forgotten or abandoned by their families. We followed Malcolm's story from childhood to adulthood as best we could even after he was eventually discharged back into the community. When considering the tragedy and abuse of Malcolm's wasted earlier years, it is a story of immeasurable sadness. Yet he ultimately rose above it all, and with admirable strength, courage and innate resilience, was finally able to 'free the regular boy within' as he had always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Malcolm's story as I believe it unfolded.</description>

      <![CDATA[I would not have chosen this book but for the recommendation of a friend. I am glad I did. It is a wonderful book that brings into the open the hidden fears and stereotype around historic mental asylums. That most of the hidden fears are valid made this read the more interesting. It’s truth based...]]>

  <description>***Bronze Medal Winner in the Non-Fiction - Travel category at the 2014 Readers' Favorite Book Award Contest***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is a wonderful debut memoir, made much more appealing because it is true. A well written, fast-paced book enhanced by sprinkles of French..." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1979 and twenty-one-year-old Linda Kovic needs to learn a language fast in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Broke yet determined, she chooses French immersion and contracts to become an au pair for a wealthy family in the Loire Valley. Yielding to poor judgment, she lies on her application and claims to speak basic French, confident she'll be forgiven once she arrives at the Château de Montclair. As she struggles to adapt to her challenging new environment with the hard-to-please Madame Dubois and her two incomprehensible children, Linda signs up and attends language classes at the local university. When she encounters, Adam, a handsome young student, her life becomes more complicated—much more complicated—adding fuel to her internal battle for independence. French Illusions: My Story as an American Au Pair in the Loire Valley is the first of two books based on the author's diaries.</description>

  <description>The country is in the grip of a cruel, Dracula-like King, his ugly, fat Queen and half-witted, degenerate sons. The ordinary people find solace in binge-drinking, vandalising the streets, and salivating over scantily-dressed bimbo celebrities. The country is going to the dogs. Who can save it from collapse into anarchy? Is it the drug-fuelled, sex-mad, perpetually half-naked Mandy? Is it the cross-dressing, messed-up Jason, with his strange little black moustache, and hatred for everybody? Or is it the people’s whore, Beth..? Will she be able to bewitch a whole country with her beautiful, mesmeric, blue eyes..? Be warned: Revolution requires blood, murder, mania, lust, depravity, perversion, and even more blood…before the nation can be cleansed…and then will demand even more…and more and more…until...</description>

  <description>When Ashley’s Master requests she cook for him, he finds out the lengths a truly naughty girl will go to for love in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Roger asks his live-in sub Ashley to learn to cook she eagerly agrees, assuming it’s going to be a breeze. After all, she’s a bright, accomplished woman with a successful career—how hard can it be to prepare some food?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she’s up to her ears in cocoa and flour, Ashley realises cooking is more complicated than it looks. Finding ways to shortcut the process, Ashley dupes Roger into believing she’s a diva in the kitchen. But when he finds out she’s not the chef of his dreams, will he serve up a punishment fit for a saucy sub or will their relationship go up in flames?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains anal sex, rimming and food play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Publisher's Note: This story has been previously released as part of the&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18365643-whip-it-up-anthology" rel="nofollow"&gt;Whip It Up Anthology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;by Totally Bound Publishing.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Under the guidance of Netty, Abby concocts her plans to abduct the wildlife at the Big Cat Sanctuary in Sarasota. She enlists the help of the handsome Italian yacht captain, Cobby and his son Kane, forcing her to expose the changes to her body, including her hidden wings. Hiding her plans from Jose, he departs on his own mission to find his adopted mother and sisters, leaving Abby to draw closer to the charming and capable Captain Cobby.&lt;br /&gt;Young Scotty embarks on a romance with a young rich local girl named Chloe who suffers from the mysterious death of her mother and the constant absences of her father.&lt;br /&gt;Life moves expeditiously toward the climax at Chloe’s father’s mansion on Bird Key as strange connections and revealed identities collide with political intrigue and murder, leaving Chloe and Jose traumatized. Joining them in the frantic dash to a yacht moored on the key enabling them to make their escape, wildlife and all, to Tampa Bay, is Kenya, a sassy and striking young pregnant black girl; and Peter, their trusted attorney that falls victim to Armoni and Ginger Mae’s plot, leaving him dangerously scarred and emotionally ruined. During their escape to Tampa Bay ahead of the cops and devastation from the sky, it becomes clear that Scotty might be the mysterious One, as foretold by Caesar, the iconic Siberian tiger that attaches himself to Echo and Scotty.</description>

  <description>Time to Let Go is a contemporary family drama set in Britain.&lt;br /&gt;Following a traumatic incident at work Stewardess Hanna Korhonen decides to take time off work and leaves her home in London to spend quality time with her elderly parents in rural England. There she finds that neither can she run away from her problems, nor does her family provide the easy getaway place that she has hoped for. Her mother suffers from Alzheimer’s disease and, while being confronted with the consequences of her issues at work, she and her entire family are forced to reassess their lives.&lt;br /&gt;The book takes a close look at family dynamics and at human nature in a time of a crisis. Their challenges, individual and shared, take the Korhonens on a journey of self-discovery and redemption.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Majesty Alistair wants police to look further into her father’s fatal car wreck, hopes the baseball team she manages can reclaim the state crown, aches for Derek…or, no…maybe Alec…maybe. And she mostly wishes to retract the hateful words she said to her dad right before slamming the door in his face, only to never see him again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All her desires get sidelined, though, when she overhears two fellow students planning a church massacre. She doubts cops will follow up on her tip since they’re sick of her coming around with notions of possible crimes-in-the-works. And it’s not like she cries wolf. Not really. They’d be freaked too, but they’re not the ones suffering from bloody dreams that hint at disaster like some crazy, street guy forecasting the Apocalypse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, she does what any habitual winner with zero cred would do…try to I.D. the nutjobs before they act. But, when their agenda turns out to be far bigger than she ever assumed, and even friends start looking suspect, the truth and her actions threaten to haunt her forever, especially since she’s left with blood on her hands, the blood of someone she loves.</description>

  <description>In the rush to the Tampa Airport, Abby meets a small group of elephants from the famous Elizabeth Siggins Wildlife Foundation fleeing the political horrors of Africa. Putting them under her protection and that of the Hive, she meets Tobi, the elderly matriarch of the small herd who will sacrifice herself to save a human and in return is rewarded with the ultimate gift the Womb can bestow. As the bedraggled group race to the Hive for protection, saving a few desperate souls as they go, the first bomb arrives. As the survivors and the wildlife struggle to adjust to the new pecking order in the Hive and the revelations of their own origins, a woman and her two grandchildren live through the hellish horror and complete breakdown of civilization aboveground as they struggle to reach the Hive where her husband awaits. Horror visits the struggling survivors as they learn the Earth will not support habitation for at least another one hundred years. But the biggest shock comes from the Womb as it extracts a huge penalty from the hapless people, tolling the demise of the human race. Short synopsis - The bedraggled group race to the Hive for protection, struggling with the wildlife underground, as a woman and her two grandchildren live through the hellish horror and breakdown of civilization aboveground, after the bombs.</description>

  <description>Hailey Hollinger has it all—a great husband, a fantastic career in journalism, good friends...and one hot brother—in—law that won’t stay out of her fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Hailey Hollinger was eighteen she thought her boyfriend, Brent, was the best-looking guy around. That was until he introduced her to his older brother, Mike. From that moment on she had the biggest crush on him and he became the star of all her teenage fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hailey’s all grown up now and has been married to Brent for three years. They have great careers, a nice house—they enjoy life and each other. Everything is supposed to be perfect. Except for that pesky little infatuation with her husband’s brother has never completely gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crush, by nature and definition, is supposed to be short-lived and should diminish over time. But, unfortunately for Hailey, it hasn’t, and it is beginning to mess with what she thinks should be perfection. And if her life is so great, why does she then find herself groping her brother—in—law in the cab of his truck like some sex—starved teenager? And the biggest question yet—why is he groping her right back?</description>

  <description>Corrupt and malign, the corporation Quasicore has dominated Del's life for ten years, using his father's debt and his brother's safety as leverage to make him do their bidding. Forced into acts that become progressively more shady and criminal, Del finally rebels when they demand the unthinkable. To kill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for a way out, he flees the Core, only to find himself entangled with the dazzling and dangerous Shays. Sin Shay's offer of protection seems too good to be true and her motives are suspect. Is Shay Enterprises simply a rival of the Core or a partner in crime?

  <description>Bullet wounds, torture, and oppression aren’t the only things that keep a man—or a woman— from being whole. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debt. Honor. Pain. Solitude. These are things wounded war veteran Adam Wegener knows all about. Love—now, that he is not good at. Not when love equals a closed fist, burns, and suicide attempts. But Adam is one who keeps his word. He owes the man who saved his life in Iraq. And he doesn’t question the measure of the debt, even when it is in the form of an emotionally distant, beautiful woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yasmeen agreed to become the wife of an American veteran so she could flee persecution in war-torn Syria. She counted on being in the United States for a short stay until she could return home. There was one thing she did not count on: wanting more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it too late for Adam and Yasmeen?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian note: alternate-cover edition of B00D09DJQU.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas loves Keziah. He'll do anything for her...at least he believes that. But all it takes is one shattering moment to change a belief; a few nights is more than enough to kill the belief. The world Thomas knows changes one night when he gets a phone call. It's Keziah. She's hurt. She's scared. She needs him. He gets Keziah home, but the horror has just begun. From that moment a darkling world embraces him. Keziah believes she has been bitten by a vampire. Thomas doesn't believe it. At first. But when one belief dies, it's because a new one is forming. As he fights to discount her story, Thomas tries to nurse her back to health, but it isn't working. He can no longer ignore the truth. She isn't solely Keziah anymore. Heartbroken, maddened, and hollow, Thomas has to make a difficult choice. Accept what his girlfriend has become or turn against her. Both choices demand a high price, but which is Thomas willing to pay?</description>

  <description>Netty’s influence transcends a full century as the United States evolves to a point of politically driven economic collapse. The year is 2033 as a young mother, abused by her shiftless husband, heroically decides to remove her two sickly children, Scotty and Abby, from the mean streets of their government subsidized tenement town of Short Hills, New Jersey to the hills and old farmland of Sussex County. There they unite with a Latino family that adopted Jose, a young boy from Costa Rica, traumatized at the age of seven by the brutal murder of his parents and the kidnapping of his infant sister. &lt;br /&gt;The two families unite to pool finances, creating the love and bonds that will enable them to survive the psychotic attention of Armoni, a soul damaged beyond redemption, discovery of Baby’s miraculous offspring, Echo; and their subsequent body changes. Through the efforts of Echo who develops an unexplained passion for the curly haired dog, Barney, they flee the clutches of Armoni after the murder of Armoni’s sidekicks by Echo, to Sarasota, Florida, one of the last remaining enclaves of wealth in the U.S. &lt;br /&gt;Scotty learns to utilize Echo as a co-conspirator in his intrigue to thwart the efforts of heinous people that prey on the lives of creatures in their environmentally rich new home, where the insidious miscreant, Armoni, tracks them; dragging along Ginger Mae, a New York City prostitute looking for opportunity with her mute child, Daisy; bringing brutality and violence to all. &lt;br /&gt;Having fallen in love, the young Abby and Jose draw close, only to be separated by the transcendental Netty, who tries to use Abby as a conduit in her plan to rescue as much wildlife as they can before despicable political events bring on the specter of Armageddon.</description>

He is a tall, muscular, God-like force in the young, impressionable and lonely girl’s life. He is her friend, her confident, her conscience, and the older man she adores beyond reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy Phillips is fully aware of his young charge’s adolescent crush on him. Although he is flattered by the adulation, he maintains a safe distance and professional demeanour until Holly is wounded in a rival family blood feud, and the course of both their lives is changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advisory : This is a six book series. The first five installments end with To Be Continued...&lt;br /&gt;But the good thing about this series is you won’t have to wait years between installments. &lt;br /&gt;eXtasy Books will release a new book, the first of every month until the conclusion in September.</description>

  <description>Abandoned by her brother and out of her depth in one of the foulest prisons in the galaxy, Priya finds an ally in a half-mad newcomer with a deadly beauty and a mysterious past. Together they hatch a plan to break out of the prison, but before they attempt it, Priya’s brother Tier arrives as a new inmate. Determined to rescue his wayward sister, he is dismayed to find the child he knew has become a bitter, wild young woman, with a companion as magnetic as she is murderous. Between one woman’s fury at his desertion and the other woman’s seductive menace, Tier discovers escaping with his skin intact might just take a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They call me the Black Widow, the spider who kills and eats her mates. If I have another name, I don’t know it. My past is lost in blood and shadow. It never mattered until I met Priya, the quicksilver girl with a laugh like sunshine, and her brother, the first man to touch me without dying. For them, I would leave my darkness behind...but can I?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A gripping psychological thriller on the inherent greed and evil of man, dooming the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two hundred years of tender love between man and alien, political downfalls, wanton violence of unspeakable order tempered with laughter, family loyalty and hope is the thrilling vehicle by which Ms Accinni conveys her cautionary tale of the merciless disrespect man gives his planet and the vulnerable creatures entrusted to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Baby" introduces Netty, a naive teenage farm girl given in marriage to an older brutal opportunist disguised as a successful citizen during the years of Prohibition in Sussex County, New Jersey. After years of enslavement, Netty flees into the night from her rapist and bootlegger husband, traveling back to the farm worked by her parents, where she rescues an unfamiliar damaged creature she finds in a cave in the woods of her childhood, falling in love with the enigmatic alien she names Baby. Together they find happiness and fulfillment despite the changes to Netty's body wrought by the proximity of the unusual creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damaged by entry into our atmosphere while pregnant, the confused creature forgets the purpose of his mission, appearing unconcerned with the disappearance of his offspring and savoring the unexpected joy of the love he shares with young Netty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a handsome Italian stranger comes into Netty's life, complications ensue as she falls in love while trying to hide the bizarre and wondrous changes to her farm and her body. Netty, Baby and Wil strive to conquer obstacles thrown in their path by life, succeeding wildly until the heart-rending and astonishingly brutal climax to their story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This charming, yet brutal story is the prologue to a series that will chill and surprise you as it foretells the selfishly destructive path man has followed since his species evolved. It pulls no punches while allowing Netty and Baby's influence to transcend mortal life as the world dances toward depraved indifference, introducing other characters along the ride that readers will laugh,shed tears with and learn to despise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lengths will Baby and his offspring go to complete their mission? Will it spell Armageddon for the beleaguered planet with its vulnerable and exploited creatures or will man tip the scales himself, leaving those that love the creatures to salvage the pitiful ruins?</description>

  <description>When sorority pledge, Addison Montgomery, gets caught chucking eggs at a mansion at the demand of her sisters on Halloween, she's punished by the rich man's son, Logan Thorndike, a hot junior at her college, and they get swept up in the delicious power exchange and a tumultuous squall of passion. Addison is certain Logan is the perfect full-time Dom for her, but he's doing all he can to keep the darker corners of his soul in check. With her chasing him down and not letting up, he tentatively claims her as his because he can't resist her sexy flirtation and naughty behavior that demands a strong dose of correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they engage in loads of hot "funishment" and experience the thrill of D/s and kink, Logan quickly settles into his position over her. But jumping into a BDSM lifestyle, while trying to balance college life and their animalistic lusts, may be way too hot for them to handle. The dark turns and bumps in the road take them both by surprise and threaten to derail everything beautiful they're striving to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * This &lt;b&gt;107,700-word collection is the first five books in the 10-part Sorority Pledge Saga&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;a serialization&lt;/b&gt; that follows a rocky romance centered around the edgy bliss of Domination and submission. Please be 18+ and naughty enough for a spanking of your own. * * * (Based on industry standards, this book is about 475 pages.)</description>

  <description>NOTE FROM THE DOM, LOGAN THORNDIKE: Poor sorority pledge, Addison Montgomery, lands in a world of trouble and heat when she’s caught chucking eggs at my father’s mansion on Halloween at the demand of her sisters. When she accepts a trip over my knee as her punishment, we get swept up in a delicious power exchange and a squall of tumultuous passion. But given our limited experience, diving into untested lusts may be way too hot for us to handle ... especially where more than hearts can be broken. Besides, I’m doing all I can to keep my dark side and hellish childhood from rising up to strangle me, and a girl like Addison Montgomery, so compliant, so wet, so eager to please is...God, she is the very last thing I need! She’s both my dream come true and my absolute, worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novella contains me doing debased things to her mind and body, I’m wicked like that, and other yummy treats I’m not gonna spell out in a blurb. What kind of Dom would I be if I went around spoiling surprises? If you’re at least 18 and pink gets you flowing, go slip into your loosest pajamas. That’s not an order, those only go to my sub, but it’s a recommendation I strongly suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * This 20,200-word novella is Book 1 in the 10-part Sorority Pledge Saga, a serialization that follows a rocky romance centered around the edgy bliss of Domination and submission. Contains explicit situations and language. 18+ please. * * *</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'Honey and Decadence' by Wendi Zwaduk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All work and no play makes life boring…unless there's a dollop of whipped cream and a studded paddle involved. Then it's all fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roxy loves her job at the Delight Tonight restaurant, but she longs for more. She’d rather find employment using her accounting skills. Her boss, Sean, has mentioned he’s interested in bringing her on as an accountant. Can she keep her wits about her or will she cave in to the blossoming feelings she has for him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean doesn’t date his staff…ever. Except, Roxy makes him rethink his rules. She’s curvy, sexy and one of the few people he trusts. When he’s given the birthday surprise of his life, he knows he wants Roxy in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will getting her into his bed translate into a love to last forever, or a lust and chocolate-filled disaster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'More Than Vanilla' by Elizabeth Coldwell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a chocolate shop gets an adult makeover with the help of a Belgian master chocolatier, a kinky couple find their relationship becomes sweeter than ever…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver Honeyman owns a chocolate shop in York, a business that has been in his family for over two hundred years, and that he runs with his girlfriend and long-time submissive, Nina Lee. But times are tough, sales are down, and Oliver and Nina know they have to do something to bring Honeyman’s into the twenty-first century and attract new customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution they devise is to introduce a new range of chocolates into the shop, with more unusual and exotic flavours chosen with the help of a very kinky taste test. To help create the new line, Oliver recruits master Belgian chocolatier Daniel Martens. Not only is Daniel incredibly talented, but he’s also just as dominant as Oliver, and Nina is soon learning that the taste of submission is even sweeter when it’s offered to her by two men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will the move of renaming the shop More Than Vanilla and pitching their products at more adult tastes bring them the change in fortunes they need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Satisfying Desires' by Victoria Blisse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas is the only man who can satisfy all her desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally has a broken wrist and is struggling to cope with being off work and home alone. She’s eaten nothing but soup in days and is sick to death of daytime TV. She goes for a walk but is distracted by the delicious smells coming from the local café.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tall and tanned Greek chef, Lucas, wants to look after Sally…and not just by feeding her with his delicious fried foods. He invites her back to enjoy a meal with him alone that night once the café is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His special brand of optimism and dominance has Sally bending to his will and begging him for more. Their less than innocent evening meal is finished off by a trip to the bedroom with a pot of chocolate spread because, as Lucas says, the only thing better than a hot naked woman is a hot naked woman covered in chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains creative use of fruit and vegetables.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Five Courses' by Ayla Ruse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paying the price for breaking the rules has never been so delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trent and Mike rule their kitchen like they do their subs—with firm command and guiding strokes. Only they haven’t enjoyed a sub in months, not since Melissa moved in with them. She’s getting over a broken heart and seems so fragile that they don’t want to scare her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the men come home from their club early one night, they catch her breaking just about every rule they have in their kitchen. Now the gloves are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa, trembling under their gaze, is given ten seconds to decide her fate—she can walk away and lose any hope of growing her relationship with these men, or she can stay and submit to their creative punishment for her misdeeds…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains minor food play, spankings, an erotic version of red-light/green-light, and interesting consequences involving cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18802470.Subterfudge" rel="nofollow"&gt;'Subterfudge'&lt;/a&gt; by Normandie Alleman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ashley’s Master requests she cook for him, he finds out the lengths a truly naughty girl will go to for love in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Roger asks his live-in sub Ashley to learn to cook she eagerly agrees, assuming it’s going to be a breeze. After all, she’s a bright, accomplished woman with a successful career—how hard can it be to prepare some food?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she’s up to her ears in cocoa and flour, Ashley realises cooking is more complicated than it looks. Finding ways to shortcut the process, Ashley dupes Roger into believing she’s a diva in the kitchen. But when he finds out she’s not the chef of his dreams, will he serve up a punishment fit for a saucy sub or will their relationship go up in flames?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains anal sex, rimming, food play.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'The Interview' by Caitlin Ricci&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob might be just what Chef Anne needs, not only in her restaurant but in her bed as well. Here’s hoping he likes being tied…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chef Anne is ready to move on from her first restaurant but she’s not going to leave her baby with just anyone. Plenty have applied for the position of executive chef and all have failed miserably. She expects perfection and knows with the right candidate she’ll get just that. A colleague’s request to give his son a chance may be exactly what she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob has grown up well from the last time she saw him, now a broad-shouldered hunk that makes her think about far more than simply food. But inviting this young chef into her bed might be more complicated than she bargained for. He’s her colleague’s son, after all. Then again, satisfying appetites is what being a chef is all about, and she does aim to please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Jacob is as good in bed as he is in the kitchen she might just get a great afternoon and a new executive chef out of it…</description>

  <description>In the not too distant future, most of the solar system has been colonized in a tremendous expansion known as the Great Solar Diaspora. Massive space habitats house anywhere from hundreds of thousands to billions of people. The colonies vary greatly in size and design, in politics, in technology, and in religion and faith. You might think that people who live in space and depend on technology all day, every day, would be above superstition, but you would be wrong. Even on Harkon Colony - one of the largest, most advanced space habitats in the solar system - there are plenty of people who believe in all kinds of strange mystical things.Things like what Will Ozwald sells at his shop, “Master Wu’s Spells and Spare-Ribs.” There, you can buy anything you want: from a necklace for hiding skin blemishes, to a ring that suppresses teenage libido. Except, don’t ask for a love potion. “Master Wu say can not do.” There is even a sign. You see, Will can illegally exploit the tech every Harkonite has in his head to create many illusions. But love is no illusion! Will believes that all he could manage would be a kind of lust-slave spell, and even a con-artist has to draw the line somewhere. Yet, despite the sign, citizens keep on asking. Why can’t his customers accept his one rule? Why do they keep asking for love? And, what happens when one particular customer won’t take “no” for an answer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Cyborg Spell Shop” is a short story (6,000 words) set in a shared fictional universe with author James Chalk’s “Jonathan Harkon Adventure” series. At the author's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management).</description>

  <description>Twenty-one year old Colette Ellis has done plenty of daydreaming about Professor John McGill, but after a spur-of-the-moment decision to seduce him in his office turns her fantasies into reality, she is left longing for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns that this handsome academic can be as firm as he is passionate, and when her bratty behavior earns her a sound spanking she sees a side of him she never expected. Before she knows it, the beautiful young woman finds herself tied up at his mercy, naked, exposed, and more aroused than she could have ever imagined. As she grows closer to him, she cannot help but wonder how long this can last. Could John come to see her as more than just a naughty coed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John has never fallen for a student… until now. There is something different about Colette, something that brings him alive in a way he has never felt before. Can he dare to hope that she is after more than just a fling?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A story from the Dreamspinner Press 2013 Advent Calendar collection &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18869285.Heartwarming" title="Heartwarming" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heartwarming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to be a good Jew &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a gay man? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for Jonah Stern. He can't reconcile his faith with his attraction to boys, so he turns his back on Judaism. A college scholarship is Jonah's ticket to freedom from his disapproving parents. Next step: losing his virginity to Christian, the blue-eyed blond man of his dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Jonah has a fateful meeting with Aaron Blumberg and ends up celebrating Hanukkah. Aaron tells him they're bashert—meant to be. But Jonah has doubts. He believes his lack of faith will create a wedge between them. It's up to Aaron to bridge the gap and convince Jonah to take a leap of faith.</description>

One-nineteen, a bat hybrid, longs for his freedom, but when he finally gets a chance to try his wings, he's afraid of getting caught and hides in an underground cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brad Walsh is an experienced caver, but an accident leaves him trapped underground. Rescue comes in the form of a shy stranger, who calls himself Mace. Brad invites Mace into his home—and his bed. But he has no idea that his virgin lover is a shape-shifter who's on the government's most wanted list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in his life, Mace knows what it feels like to have someone care about him, but staying with Brad is out of the question.</description>

  <description>Adam is a wolf hybrid, the result of a secret military research project splicing animal DNA with human DNA to create the perfect soldier. He was never meant to see the outside world, but a freak gas explosion gives him a chance to escape. Now a hunted man, Adam trusts no one, and he expects to spend the rest of his life alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalist Chaunce "Chance" Philip Hollis III is unlucky in love and stuck in a job he hates. Then he meets Adam. It's lust at first sight, and Chance is sure he's found the perfect man. Adam is determined not to involve Chance in his life, but it's already too late. The bad guys are hot on his trail and just as determined to use Chance for bait. To save Chance, Adam will have to show his true colors and use the only weapons he has—fangs and fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This book was previously published at Silver Publishing in January 2012 under the title "A Chance Encounter (Hybrids 1)" and has been extensively revised and expanded.</description>

  <description>Gritting her teeth Jenny grimaced and gave him what he wanted; the lewd sight of her backside jiggling this way and that as he continued to spank it. His hand now felt like sandpaper on the sensitised flesh. How much longer would she have to endure this? The clamps continued to bite into her tender nipples, and as she swayed to and fro she could feel them moving with her, the ache increasing with each passing second... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Jenny thought life was hard under the expert tutelage of Mark, being faced with a stable full of sex-starved pony girls poses several more challenges. For instance, how do you bring eleven young women to orgasm in a timely fashion? But to her surprise, tackling the problem with experimentation and enthusiasm, she finds herself enjoying the experience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When training begins it is anything but enjoyable, however. Harnessed in pony girl tack, her body is encircled with leather, rubber and steel. It nips, chafes and rubs cruelly, especially when she's faced with a morning of naughty games in the exercise yard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Book Four of Pony Tales Jenny earns herself several punishments, and is subjected to some very thorough sex indoctrination she has to submit to the whims of her groom, trainers and even the stable-hands. Will rescue arrive or will she have to beg to be released, with nothing more than her body as currency?</description>

  <description>"Everything about you is a lie." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Freeman Sullivan is a man running out of time. As he submits his final manuscript to his sceptical editor, he tells the story of Professor George Tate, and Celus - his seemingly ageless assistant - as they are expelled from the British Museum and embark on a journey that leaves a wake of irrevocably changed lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because Freeman has realised the Professor's truth - that the walls are thinning and the shadows are lengthening as our world awaits Her arrival.</description>

  <description>Life…secrecy, deceit, danger…No, no! Run, escape! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Run!” Her inner voice is shouting. She has to run faster! She’s about to get caught! No, no! She has to get away. Please, she must escape! “Run faster!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as Tess Sanoby can remember, she has always had the same nightmares, where the girl in her dreams is running for her life with an unknown force chasing her. Each time, right before the girl is caught, Tess awakens, shaken with fear and confusion. Who is the girl? What do these dreams mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting through the growing pains of high school with her best friends Jack and Kylie, and then being accepted into her dream college, Tess is excited to start her life of independence. There, she meets the mysterious trainer and mentor, Chris, and she instantly feels a strong connection with him. Unfortunately, Chris wants nothing to do with her. Although Chris continues to give her the cold shoulder, his overprotectiveness and the occasional slips of sensitivity confuse Tess. Not understanding Chris or their relationship, she is on a constant emotional roller coaster with him. Could her best friends be the stable force that she desperately needs? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Tess, the more she tries to connect the missing pieces of her life, the more obscure her past and future appear to her. To make matters worse, she realizes she has fallen hard for a man who may be her worst enemy. As passion ignites between the two, she can’t help but surrender her heart and soul to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess is unexpectedly exposed to a world of secrecy, deceit, and danger, causing her to be running for her life, chased by the unknown. Can Tess escape and save not only herself, but also her loved ones? Or, will she be caught, leaving her no choice but to face her worst nightmare?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaysing Dreams is the ultimate love story, full of suspense, friendship, betrayal, tragedy, and sacrifice. In this epic tale, you will laugh and cry with Tess--a story full of twists and turns, keeping you guessing until the end.</description>

  <description>Overweight and dull. That’s how I felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandfather and brother died. I hid inside a black cave deep in my soul, numbed for a decade on meds, booze, and bad love, married to my glorious career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Liz Snow, from Atlanta, Georgia, and this is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hot summer I fell hopelessly in love with successful attorney, Peter William Hendrix III, from Chattanooga, Tennessee. We bonded because of Shelley and Keats. Pete introduced me to the works of modern English poet, Jack O. Savage, It was like The Poet was drawing us together through his blogs and poems, like he had a message for my life and my love with Pete Hendrix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lived it in my heart and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all went tragically wrong once I learned Pete’s secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As September ends I jet to London, England with an unstable mind and a broken heart. Pete Hendrix betrayed me big time. There was no time for revenge. My life was a kaleidoscope of stabbing shards of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London ignored me. Maybe I didn't exist. I was lost and lonely in a flat in Kensington. I hear that Jack O. Savage will make a rare public appearance. I wrangle an invitation to the art gallery where he is reading. I was curious. Somehow, he was the cause of my trouble. The rock-star-with-words was even more damaged than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack O.Savage, The Poet became my friend. Then, an unexpected kiss at a county fair on a perfect English summer's day changed everything forever. Jack the man became my lover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My elusive dream of a lifelong love began. If Pete was what I'd always wanted, Jack was what I always needed. The mystery unraveled as the kaleidoscope of my broken life evolved and I found myself living a rainbow of perfect bliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes when you believe it’s the end, it’s only the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September Ends is contemporary fiction, blending romance, erotic and supernatural elements, bound together by poetry. It reveals the intricate web of passion and desire which entangles Liz Snow, Pete Hendrix and Jack O. Savage. The story is told through Liz Snow’s diary, Jack O. Savage’s poetry, and from letters sent across the Atlantic. Traveling throughout the lushness of a summertime in Tennessee and Georgia, September Ends journeys into the elegance of London’s West End and is finally settled in the countryside of Cornwall, England, a decade later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September Ends is a story of sin, redemption and salvation through love because love happens when we least expect it.</description>

  <description>New York City is famous for New Year’s Eve—but most people don’t celebrate it with a fight to the death… with a wizard who’s already dead! Of course, that is only the beginning for Addison Rhydderch, who wakes up to learn that he’s the newest Regent—protector of the balance between the mundane and the supernatural across the Eastern United States. Easier said than done, even with the guidance of a dragon and the aid of a sultry dryad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brave, clever, and politically clueless, Addison seems like the perfect tool of the mysterious Regency Board… but even those Magi could never have foreseen the results of this appointment. With the Faeries threatening war and rumors of a mystical murderer stalking the streets, it is soon up to Addison to try and put out the fires flaring up from centuries old conflicts—Before both worlds are torn apart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for young readers, written with adult fans of fantasy and the paranormal in mind with sexual situations.</description>

Confused and scared, they turn to Mr. Harris, a teacher in their school, who offers to help them control their powers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But is there more to Mr. Harris than meets the eye? His cryptic explanations about their powers, how and why they manifested, leaves the five kids with more questions than answers. Can they trust Mr. Harris?

The children try to figure out the answers as they work towards gaining control over their powers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unknown to them, danger lingers near. They have to face the threat and put their lives at risk. They must learn to trust one another and combine their powers to survive…will they make it? Are their powers strong enough? And will they finally find the answers they seek? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Corey Somerset, Tim Hayworth and Lee Hunter have had one hell of a good night. &lt;br /&gt;And it isn't over yet. &lt;br /&gt;Celebrating their friend's birthday with drunken debauchery and intoxicated antics they've just stumbled through a mini-wave of mindless vandalism and though they've wandered far out of the realms of civilization they are keen to keep the party vibe going. &lt;br /&gt;When they encounter a band of mysterious fugitive women who call a bizarre encampment deep in the woods their residence it appears a strong likelihood that continuing the party is on the cards. &lt;br /&gt;But it won't come without a price. &lt;br /&gt;The collective of unnerving lawless women are open to the suggestion but not without the threesome completing a request first, a seemingly straight forward barter proposition that will bring the boys face to face with something else that dwells in an unorthodox co-existence with the girls in the wilderness. &lt;br /&gt;These are the Plebs and the shocking violent encounter the trio are unwittingly pitched into with these freakish feral fiends may be their first but it won't be the last. &lt;br /&gt;As the shiftless young men become inextricably entwined and involved with the agenda driven dangerous women so too do their fates, with them unravelling killer secrets, duplicity, bloodshed and brutality along the way that encompasses not just them but more of their friends, new enemies and old enemies. &lt;br /&gt;A simple night of bad decisions escalates and snowballs into an expedition of terror spanning all the way home and beyond with Corey and his friends engulfed in a nightmare where the lines between man and monster blur. &lt;br /&gt;Depravity, death and destruction reign supreme and it isn't just the Plebs that want them all torn limb from limb.</description>

  <description>~~Sasha’s Story: How to Find a Mate the Hard Way (Alien Erotica)~~ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sasha visits an alien bar looking for exotic excitement and wakes in a strange white room with no memory of how she got there. There's no exit—is this a jail cell? Or a cage? The intriguing reptilian male in the next cell tells her she was abducted and is now the subject of experimentation. But what kind of experiments? When a female alien enters his cell, Sasha witnesses in scorching detail the erotic behavior their captors expect to observe. And she’s his next test partner... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: “Sasha’s Story” is a 10,000+ word erotic short story intended for mature audiences only, with explicit sexual content, graphic language, and sizzling human/alien scenarios that may be shocking to some readers. Enter at your own risk! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Fortune twists in the strongest hands. This is no repeat; this is what happens next. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A man, once a legend who bound his soul to his sword as he lay dying, is now all but a boy nearing the end of his acolyte training. Stifled by life in the undersea city of Avalon, Arthur wants to fight side by side with the air-breathing Terrans, not spend his life as servant to the incorporeal sentient known as the Archive. Despite the restrictions put on him by Sanctuary, he is determined to help the surface-dwellers defeat predators whose sole purpose is to ensure their own survival, no matter the cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ashira, War Maid and princess of the surface-world, is ready to sacrifice her life to defend her kin, but when she is betrayed and cast out of the life chosen for her, she must choose whether to die with honor or become one of the creatures her kinsmen fear and loathe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Following two threads of time, C.N. Lesley’s new incarnation of the Arthurian tales of old delivers the perfect blend of science fiction and fantasy.</description>
