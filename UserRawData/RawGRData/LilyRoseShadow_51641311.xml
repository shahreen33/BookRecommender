  <description>&lt;b&gt;This entry in the popular Little Bit Of series helps you understand, and develop, your powers of intuition.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Intuition is something we're all born with and use every day. But generally, it's not consciously explored and strengthened like a muscle. But with the right work, we all can increase our intuitive ability. This fascinating introduction guides you, with the help of real-life examples from over two decades as a spiritual life coach, how to listen to your intuition, act upon it, and discover the resulting flow and magic that comes from living life intuitively.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Float: A Guide to Letting Go&lt;/em&gt; seeks to encourage children to process their emotions gently and in a way that allows them purposeful ownership of what they think and how they feel. It will aid them in identifying the root of their feelings, help them to examine their reactions to emotions and decide for themselves what they may be ready to release. The thoughtful use of color and symbols, and the guided practice of breathwork, encourages readers to maintain a broad focus as they become more grounded and aware. The playful rhyme dances with readers as they grow on their journey to the present, where they are beautifully set free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers will enjoy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning how to identify and examine emotions Understanding how to release unwanted thoughts and feelings Permission to acknowledge, accept, feel and heal in a unique way "Aimee Ruland's book, &lt;em&gt;Float&lt;/em&gt;, is a masterpiece of creativity where the intangible becomes relatable, fun and beautifully depicted. Teaching children mindfulness, kindness and intention regarding their feelings might just be the most important lesson we can teach them. This book belongs on the shelf of every child--or anyone who has ever been a child."&lt;br /&gt; --Stephanie Wharton, M.Ed., INHC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What a beautiful message for children of all ages! A brilliant example of emotions and feelings that may be difficult for children to define with words. &lt;em&gt;Float&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect story to help a child's mind and body unwind at the end of the day. I found myself thinking about the message long after reading the story."&lt;br /&gt; --Tanya Swanson, kindergarten teacher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Beautiful, soothing words to comfort children and guide them in using imagery to help deal with the weight of daily emotions."&lt;br /&gt; --Susan E. Slater, children's librarian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Float&lt;/em&gt; does a great job blending imagery to relate to feelings of young children. The colors of the balloons are neatly tied into each feeling discussed in the book. The strategies are appropriate, simple and thought provoking. A great read!"&lt;br /&gt; --Matthew Menard, M.S., M.Ed., LPC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Aimee Ruland is the Dr. Seuss of children's therapy books. My seven-year-old loves the book, and so do I.&lt;br /&gt; --Jeffrey Barkstrom, LAC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Loving Heaing Press &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.LHPress.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.LHPress.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Jody has been a conduit for ghosts her entire life. Not only do they come to her for help, but at times she experiences what they feel when they die. This gift or curse comes at a high personal cost—especially when a child is involved. There’s not a man alive who is willing to compete with troubled spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jared, a wealthy and determined high-powered P.I., has lived without love his entire life. In business if he wants something, he goes after it with a vengeance and is usually not denied. His life experiences have taught him that believing and trusting in others is a dead end street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on one magical night Jared meets Jody, and they soon find themselves on the brink of falling in love. But will the spirits surrounding Jody relinquish their hold on her in order for Jared to stake his claim or will their love disappear in an ethereal puff of smoke?</description>

      <![CDATA[This book started out really powerfully, and well-paced. A few chapters in, (around the time of the art show) the pace suddenly deadens. The story loses a lot of the energy that was built up, and I immediately disliked Jared. It's hard to connect with a guy who starts off as so toxic. I loved Jod...]]>

I always go into YA books with a grain of salt, since I'm a bit older than the target audience. This definitely swept me back to my teenage years when the world felt full...]]>

  <description>Parker Mills has it all. She’s the two-time winner of the Miss Divine Pecan Pageant, head of the eighth grade dance committee, and a secret psychic empath. Since she absorbs any strong emotion around her, Parker has committed herself to finding shortcuts to happiness. Whether acting as a tutor, a coach, or a matchmaker, Parker knows that when others are happy, she’s happy. Granted, all that fixing other people’s drama means her own crush has no idea how she feels, but it’s still a win-win as long as her psychic methods remain a secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that was how it always worked before Mia came to town. With her mysterious past and dark cloud of depression, Mia’s moods threaten to rain on Parker’s happiness parade. After Parker’s usual shortcuts fail—even after bringing gorgeous Josh on the scene—she is forced to kick things up a notch, or two. But when Parker’s psychic powers go haywire, dangerous secrets begin to unravel …starting with her own.</description>

  <description>WARNING:&lt;br /&gt;There is a GRAPHIC suicide in this story and there is VIOLENCE. The heroine is going to kill things since she is a demon slayer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bullied through high school, seventeen-year-old Justice St. Michaels is grateful for the help of her best friend Moira O’Fhey. Their only wish is to graduate high school, leave the sleepy town of Fallingbrook and all that happened behind them. The Heavens have other plans. Between growths on her back and being involved in explosive school fights, nothing seems to make sense. When an unexpected encounter with Darien Raventhorn causes worlds to collide it exposes the truth about Justice's real identity. To avenge a family death, Justice must embrace her birthright, and slay a demon before all Hell breaks loose.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was almost impossible to read. The grammar is absolutely atrocious, switching tenses randomly without any apparent reason, even in flashback scenes. There wasn't much character development or plot line, just a lot of information dumping inbetween action scenes. REALLY disappointed.]]>

  <description>Willow’s Chaos &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chaos is one of the most beautiful and horrific pieces of art ever displayed. Built firm, solid, and ripped, his body is his canvas. His unmarked face displays what every woman longs to dream of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A successful businessman leading an investigative service, he is always searching for those needing help. But deep inside, Chaos has a secret, and he suffers from the pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willow knows how Chaos releases the pressure of life, but he refuses to let her in. With problems of her own, will she let him go, or will she heal herself through helping him? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Chrissy digs up clues to help Autumn solve a historical disappearance and a modern-day murder mystery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Autumn Clarke is getting her life back to normal with the help of her extraordinary shih tzu, Chrissy, when the death of a local philanthropist reveals the man's dark family secrets, as well as unexpected ties to Autumn. When Chrissy discovers a dog-eared diary in the dead man's family home, Autumn discovers that things in the Clarke family are not quite as they seem. Can Autumn interpret the hidden clues in the dog-eared diary to crack the most puzzling disappearance in Knollwood history? Are the recent murders connected to the past? Is Chrissy more insightful than Autumn realized?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "I have fallen in love with Chrissy and Autumn and their continuing journey to health while finding themselves in the middle of a murder mystery adventure. My pre-teen daughter and I enjoyed reading The Dog-Eared Diary and then discussing the clues, plot twists, and characters."&lt;br /&gt; --Antoinette Brickhaus, Maryland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Through the relationship between Autumn and Chrissy, Wing also shows the importance of therapy animals and how much they can help those who need them. Add a sweet romance to the intrigue of the mystery and you've got a book that you won't want to put down."&lt;br /&gt; -- Melissa Alvarez, Intuitive, animal communicator and author of &lt;em&gt;Animal Frequency&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Llewellyn's Little Book of Spirit Animals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Diane Wing has created a wonderfully endearing little character in Chrissy the Shih Tzu. It really shines through that the author is a lover of animals and dogs. I can see these books quickly becoming a cherished addition to the cozy mystery genre."&lt;br /&gt; --J. New, author of The Yellow Cottage Vintage Mysteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book #2 in the &lt;em&gt;Chrissy the Shih Tzu Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Learn more at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.DianeWingAuthor.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.DianeWingAuthor.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From Modern History Press &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.ModernHistoryPress.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.ModernHistoryPress.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Hang on to your chaps, because this is a Wild West like you never knew.&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth O’Grady and her mother run the O’Grady Inn in Alana Creek- a town known for shootouts, fights, and outlandish parties. When Elizabeth’s step-father died, she wanted to celebrate but instead found a heap of debt, and the wealthiest family in town, the Randalls, own the inn.&lt;br /&gt;When the Randalls offer her an unusual bargain, she jumps at the chance. It doesn’t matter that they want her to steal a valuable object from an angry dragon who isn’t up to negotiating. But dragons aren’t the only secret Alana Creek hides. Elizabeth discovers her town is home to shifters, witches, and mythical hunters, and her past connects all of them. &lt;br /&gt;Now she must risk death to save her hotel. But she discovers a hidden talent, and the Randalls and Alana Creek are about to get a lesson they won’t soon forget.</description>

      <![CDATA[Fun read, but some of the scenes felt entirely unnecessary to the story. I loved the premise of the story, although the flow was a bit choppy at times. Overall, great steampunk story perfect for a cozy afternoon with a cup of cocoa.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Buckle up for a wild ride as Dixie Whiskey finds forever love in TAMING MY WHISKEY, a funny, sexy, and emotionally riveting standalone romance by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;The perfect love story for those who enjoy fiercely loyal and insanely sexy alpha heroes, smart, sassy heroines, strong family bonds, bikers, babies, and more! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In USA Today Bestseller TAMING MY WHISKEY...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the princess of the Dark Knights motorcycle club doesn’t come with a white knight or a fairy-tale castle, and that’s okay, because Dixie Whiskey has never needed a man to slay her dragons or make her whole. Even so, after watching each of her brothers fall in love, she’d sure like a shot at her own happily ever after. But with the Dark Knights watching over her and the only man she’s ever wanted out of reach, she’s not holding her breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the launch of Silver-Stone Cycles’ biggest line approaches, Jace Stone is left needing a favor from the one woman who holds the power to take him to his knees. He knows when it comes to sinfully gorgeous and sharp-tongued Dixie Whiskey, he must stay on his toes and keep his walls firmly in place. But Jace needs her for his business—and Jace Stone always gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tall, gruff, and darkly handsome biker presents an opportunity that any other woman might see as the chance of a lifetime, Dixie turns him down flat. But Jace is determined, and he pulls out all the stops—sending Dixie’s overprotective brothers up in arms. Rebellious Dixie takes a stand—going after the freedom, and the man, she’s always wanted. One scorching kiss leads to an undeniable connection, but Jace isn't looking to be tied down, and Dixie refuses to play second fiddle. Can two untamable hearts find forever love in each other’s arms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more hot Whiskey love, check out Melissa’s other Whiskey novels.&lt;br /&gt;TRU BLUE&lt;br /&gt;TRULY MADLY WHISKEY&lt;br /&gt;DRIVING WHISKEY WILD&lt;br /&gt;WICKED WHISKEY LOVE&lt;br /&gt;MAD ABOUT MOON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't miss RIVER OF LOVE, the first story in which the Whiskeys were introduced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whiskeys are perfect beach reads with depth of story, strong family ties, and a wealth of emotions. Small town love stories with happily ever afters guaranteed.</description>

  <description>Rose McFarland is a trained killer--a Memphis S.W.A.T. sniper with a secret. Her team knows about the burn scars that lurk under her clothes, a legacy of the house fire that killed her father and brother sixteen years before. Her supervisors know that she spent two years in a rehabilitative facility, healing and learning to cope with the emotional trauma of the fire. But no one knows about the visions that drove her there, angry spirits that consumed her childhood, alienated her from her family and made her doubt her own sanity--the Whispers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Charlie Akers, a half-brother she never knew, ends up on the wrong side of Rose's rifle, she unwittingly sets off a chain of events that puts her family in the middle of increasingly dangerous paranormal visitations. Charlie won't stay dead, and soon ghosts from Rose's past are creeping back into her life. People she's killed in the line of duty, family she thought long buried, every one of them under the influence of Rose's greatest fear, the Whispers themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the walls between our world and the world of the dead grow thin, Rose will have to face her old nightmares to stop the Whispers from breaking free. If she can't, it won't just be Memphis that falls to the dead--there will be no safe place left on earth for the living.</description>

  <description>'We haven't elected a Prime Minister, we've elected a lifestyle'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the fourth decade of the 21st century looms, new PM Guy Morrissey and his fitness guru wife Mona (hashtag MoMo) are hailed as the motivational couple to get the UK #FitForWork, with Mona promising to 'change the BMI of the nation'. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lita Stone is an influential blogger and social media addict, who watches as Guy and Mona's policies become increasingly ruthless. Unemployment and homelessness are out of control. The solution? Vast new compounds all over the country, to house those who can no longer afford to keep a roof over their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the Hope Villages, financed by US corporation Nutricorp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lita and her flatmates Nick and Kendall feel safe in their cosy cyberspace world. Unaware of how swiftly bad luck can snowball, they suspect little of the danger that awaits the unfortunate, behind the carefully constructed mirage of Hope.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Terry Tyler's nineteenth published work is a psychological thriller that weaves through the darker side of online life, as the gap between the haves and the have-nots grows ever wider. Whether or not it will mirror a dystopian future that awaits us, we will have to wait and see.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover the magic of the Bradens, and fall in love with Addison Cole's rich and romantic storytelling. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In AND THEN THERE WAS US… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brianna Heart has a six-year old daughter and a twelve-year plan to keep her life as simple as possible until Layla turns eighteen. That means swearing off relationships and the drama that goes along with them, working two jobs, and being the best mother she can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Capital Series Grand Prix racer Hugh Braden wants after dating media-hungry leggy models and money-hungry fan girls is a blind date. But how could he turn down a favor to one of his best friends? Hugh expected the date to go poorly, but he didn’t expect to be intensely attracted to the beautiful brown-eyed bartender who completely blows him off—and steals his every thought thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Brianna’s perfectly orchestrated life turns upside down, Hugh is there to help, softening the turmoil, and maybe even rescuing her heart from the lonely place where it has been hiding. Can a man who doesn’t believe in fate and a woman who doesn’t believe in true love find happiness in each other’s arms forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Addison Cole is the sweet-romance pen name of New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;Addison Cole novels are the sweet editions of Melissa's steamy romance Love in Bloom series, and are written to stand alone, or to be enjoyed as part of the larger Sweet with Heat series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet with Heat novels convey all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language.&lt;/b&gt; If you are looking for a more explicit romance, pick up the steamy edition of this title, Heart at Play, by Melissa Foster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: WESTON BRADENS&lt;br /&gt;A Love So Sweet&lt;br /&gt;Our Sweet Destiny&lt;br /&gt;Unraveling the Truth About Love&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Loving Lacy&lt;br /&gt;Promise of a New Beginning&lt;br /&gt;And Then There Was Us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO AVAILABLE for your binge-reading pleasure, more fun, heartwarming, flirty, and romantic love stories. The Seaside and Bayside series are set in the quaint small towns of Cape Cod, making them perfect beach reads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: SEASIDE SUMMERS&lt;br /&gt;Read, Write, Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Dreaming at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Hearts at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Sunsets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Secrets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Nights at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Seized by Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Embraced at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Lovers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Whispers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: BAYSIDE SUMMERS&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Love at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Passions at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Heat at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Escape at Bayside</description>

  <description>"Edris wants to be a poet. His father wants him to kill the king's son."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edris’s lay-about life of privilege ends abruptly when his father, Lord Elros, announces that his adolescent son will enter the military in the spring. Edris has only six months to ready himself to serve a king who despises his family and will undoubtedly make his life beyond miserable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To prepare him, Lord Elros puts Edris through a brutal training regime. Not only does he demand Edris beat every man with whom he spars, but he also insists his son knock them unconscious—even if that means fighting dirty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About to crack under the relentless pressure, the sensitive Edris seeks a way to get out from under his father’s heavy thumb. A solution presents itself when an announcement for the latest Kings’ Quest arrives. According to the royal proclamation, the adventurer who finds the fabled Sword of Betrayal will win one thousand gold pieces, money Edris could use to start his own life with the woman he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Edris proposes to undertake the quest in order to get in better shape; however, Lord Elros has another idea—Edris will undertake the quest so he can get close to, and kill, the king’s son.</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;Falling in love was out of the question ... until it was the answer. &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing Aeris St. Cloud wants more than to win her father's love and the acceptance of her family unit by joining the Military Academy at New Hope. But after she is captured by the fearsome space pirate, Captain Chainsword, Aerie is certain falling in love with her nation's arch enemy is the last possible way to earn their coveted esteem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven by vengeance, Exton Shepherd never set out to save anyone. As he circles the war-torn world in his pirated starship, the Perdition, he only sees his father's ghost lurking around every corner and the looming darkness on the horizon. When Aerie unexpectedly tumbles into his life, he finds he cannot trust her, anymore than he can ignore her. But just like the raging war down on Earth, it's tempting to think he can ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the war ascends to the heights of the Perdition, Aerie's loyalty, and Exton's heart, are put to the test. But will love be enough to save them -- and others -- from certain destruction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FROM THE AUTHOR: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heights of Perdition&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in the Divine Space Pirates trilogy, a futuristic romance series where family, faith, and freedom all take center stage. With religious and political themes, this is one book sure to entertain your mind as much as it stimulates your heart. Look for Book 2, &lt;em&gt;The Breadth of Creation&lt;/em&gt;, as the story - and the war - continues on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;FROM THE BOOK: &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“Tell me your name. It’s a good place to start, don’t you think?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“I’ll never give you any information. How could I, knowing what I know about you?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“Perhaps there’s more to me than you realize.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“You’re a hateful monster! What else do I possibly need to know?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Aerie regretted her outburst less than a second later. The captain immediately left his chair and came close to her. Instinctively, she pulled back, but the pad behind her did not allow her to go far.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;As he drew near, she got a good look at his face; though no longer adorned with the pirate’s wig and beard, she could see he was still masked. The apathy, the cynicism, the playful whimsy—all of it hid a deep crevice of pain inside of him.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The sudden urge to reach out and touch him shot through her. It was quickly followed by alarm and self-disgust.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“From your comments, I would assume you have yet to learn a great many things,” he told her, his voice sharp.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“What do you mean by that?” she asked, boldly meeting his gaze.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“First, your name is no small matter," he said. "Destinies can be made and shaped by your name, though whether good or bad, it is up to you."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;He turned away from her abruptly and began pacing by her bed. Aerie listened to his steps resonate with certainty and distinctness, like a military cadence, as she tried to breathe properly.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“Second,” he continued, glancing at her from over his shoulder, “Despite what you might think, I am not a monster; merely a man.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“I hardly see the difference,” she retorted, still rattled by his presence.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“I would expect that, given your education with the URS. Over the past decade, your beloved Daddy Dictator has managed to ensure your education, rigorous as it is, consists of really only following instructions, repeating the lies they prefer to the truth, and ignoring any logic that would unravel them or undermine their authority.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;WHAT REVIEWERS ARE SAYING: &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 STARS!&lt;strong&gt; ~ Reader's Favorite Review &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Questions raised about government, religion, and human nature were peppered throughout the narrative, elevating The Heights of Perdition from a mere space fantasy to something much more thought-provoking. &lt;strong&gt;~ Author Jess Jesinghaus &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;4th Place in Best RF Christian Sci-Fi &amp;amp; Fantasy for 2018&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. &lt;/b&gt;Bayside Summers is a series of standalone steamy romance novels featuring alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, deeply emotional, always passionate, and easy to relate to. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Gavin is about to find out that Harper really does exist⁠—and she's going to knock his socks off! Find out for yourself in USA Today bestseller Bayside Romance! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When screenwriter Harper Garner got a shot at the big-time in LA, she celebrated her brave cross-country move with her first and only one-night stand—connecting so deeply with the sexy, brilliant man, she broke the number-one rule of one-night stands and left her phone number. Not hearing from him was only the first in a long line of hope-shattering, confidence-busting blows. Ten months later, Harper is done with men and done with LA. She pulls up her big-girl panties and heads home to Cape Cod to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, interior designer Gavin Wheeler has it all: a successful business, a loving family, and a close-knit group of friends. But Gavin once endured a heartbreak so painful, he was sure he’d never feel anything for a woman again. A chance encounter at a music festival with a gorgeous, down-to-earth blonde proved him wrong, but when morning came, the woman who made him crave more was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serendipitous evening reunites Harper with her devastatingly delicious one-night stand, and the connection is just as intense as she remembered. Harper’s life is too unsettled for a relationship, but Gavin is determined to help her find her way, especially if it leads straight to his heart. Moonlight conversations lead to steamy kisses, and as romance blooms, it stirs a love too real to deny. But when Gavin’s past collides with the life they’re building, it has the power to ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BAYSIDE SUMMERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Desires&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Passions&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Heat&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Escape&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Romance&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Fantasies&lt;br /&gt;More Bayside books coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"With her wonderful characters and resonating emotions, Melissa Foster is a must-read author!" -NYT Bestseller Julie Kenner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Melissa Foster is synonymous with sexy, swoony, heartfelt romance!" -NYT Bestseller Lauren Blakely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;While each book may be read as a standalone, you might enjoy reading the entire Love in Bloom series.

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;Observation is just the first step. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then comes the action. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And these actions will speak louder than any words.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;Someone is watching. Scrutinizing every flip of the hair, change of expression, and spoken word. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How long until they come for you?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Cooper Chain and Willow Ball, it was a normal weekday morning. Until the moment Cooper opens the back door and... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Was it just an accident? Or is an invisible force trying to eliminate Ball &amp;amp; Chain off the face of the Earth? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unable to let go of the memory of her father, Willow takes the lure of learning more information. But a meeting goes horribly wrong, and death is knocking on her door. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sucked into a vortex of bizarre, deathly events, Willow and Cooper struggle to fight off a never-ending series of attacks. They take one step, but someone else is always a step ahead. How can they defeat what they cannot see? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when the gauntlet is thrown down, survival takes on a whole new meaning. And that's when Willow and Cooper come face-to-face with a force that could bury them for good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How many shapes can evil take? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Get &lt;i&gt;PREY&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You will devour this book if you're a fan of Michael Connelly's &lt;b&gt;Ballard and Bosch&lt;/b&gt;, David Baldacci's &lt;b&gt;King and Maxwell&lt;/b&gt;, Tess Gerritsen's &lt;b&gt;Rizzoli and Isles&lt;/b&gt;, Janet Evanovich's &lt;b&gt;Fox and O'Hare&lt;/b&gt;, Stuart Woods, or the TV show &lt;b&gt;"Castle."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Warning: The Ball &amp;amp; Chain Thrillers are an addictive thrill ride full of white-knuckle suspense and sarcastic sass. A mystery-thriller with a slice of humor. Go figure. Proceed with caution.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ball &amp;amp; Chain Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MERCY (Book 1) &lt;br /&gt;FEAR (Book 2) &lt;br /&gt;BURY (Book 3) &lt;br /&gt;LURE (Book 4) &lt;br /&gt;PREY (Book 5) &lt;br /&gt;VANISH (Book 6)</description>

  <description>In 1865 a shadow hovers over the nation: the shadow lingers still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born into slavery, Henry’s young life is spent working in tobacco drying sheds on Missouri plantations. Freed at the onset of the Civil War, he's alone, starving, and on the run from Confederate militiamen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years later, Clara Hanfield, the daughter of a powerful New York shipping magnate, escapes her tyrannical father and travels west in pursuit of John Elliot, the man she loves. John, a U.S. Army lieutenant, was sent to the Dakota Territory where he discovers a government conspiracy to incite an all-out war with the Indians; a war meant to finally eliminate them as an obstacle to the westward expansion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry finds himself caught in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aided by Clara, John, and his native ally, Standing Elk, Henry must battle hatred, greed, and the ghosts of his past during this turbulent and troubling time in American history.</description>

  <description>Gregory and his little sister Imogen love spending Halloween with their parents. But this year is different. If he proves he can take care of Imogen all by himself, he’ll finally have the allowance he’s dreamed of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was before the basement door opened on its own. Before the strange door appeared in the basement and Imogen was taken from him by the monster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now everyone in town is blaming him for her disappearance, but no one is listening to his story. Where did the door come from? What was that creature? And most of all, can he find his sister before it’s too late, or will he bury his memories of her along with his parents?</description>

  <description>It's the summer of 2012 and Elizabeth Megalos is a disillusioned art-school grad getting by as a bank teller in St. Louis. One evening, she’s attacked by a possessed coworker and saved by a mysterious, wise-cracking sorcerer named Eddy. He drags Elizabeth and Hugh—a skeptical scholar of the occult—to Europe, where he introduces them to his three magical celebrity friends. Once there, Eddy explains the group's mission: preventing a Demiurge—a creature out of Gnostic Christian mythology—from fulfilling the visions of doom in the Book of Revelation. The Demiurge has been drawing power from the misguided beliefs in the Mayan apocalypse and is set to start the destruction on Dec. 21st, 2012. Through ritual magic and a series of psychedelic experiences, the group learns that Elizabeth is the key to taking down the Demiurge, though she can't imagine how she will be the one to stop Armageddon.</description>

  <description>Philip is a good boy, a really good boy, who accidentally gets sent to Hell to become the Devil’s heir. The Devil, Lucifer, is dying and desperately in need of a successor, but there’s been a mistake and Philip is the wrong boy. Philip is terrible at being bad, but Lucifer has no other choice than to begin the difficult task of training him in the ways of evil. Philip gets both friends and enemies in this odd, gloomy underworld—but who can he trust, when he discovers an evil-minded plot against the dark throne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Devil's Apprentice is volume 1 in The Great Devil War-series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover the magic of the Bradens, and fall in love with Addison Cole's rich and romantic storytelling.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In PROMISE OF A NEW BEGINNING... &lt;br /&gt;After having her heart broken by a country music star, Savannah Braden has sworn off men. She takes a break from her fast-paced Manhattan lifestyle for a weekend at a survivor camp to rebuild her confidence and readjust her priorities. But when she meets the handsome guide, Jack Remington, she's drawn to everything about him—from his powerful physique to his brooding stare—despite the big chip on his shoulder. Powerless to ignore the heated glances and mounting attraction, Savannah begins to reassess her hasty decision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing his wife in a tragic accident, Jack Remington found solace in the Colorado Mountains. This solitary existence allows him to wallow in his guilt and punish himself for having made a decision that he believes cost his wife her life. He never expected to want to return to the life he once knew—but then again, he never expected to meet gorgeous, stubborn, and competitive Savannah Braden. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One passionate kiss is all it takes to crack the walls the two have built to protect themselves, and allow love to slip in. While Jack fights his way through his guilt, and struggles to get back into the lives of those he left behind, Savannah is there to help him heal, and together they nurture hope that they've finally found their forever loves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addison Cole is the sweet-romance pen name of New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole novels are the sweet editions of Melissa's steamy romance Love in Bloom series, and are written to stand alone, or to be enjoyed as part of the larger Sweet with Heat series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet with Heat novels convey all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language.

  <description>Heroines of Avalon Other Tales is a gripping narrative, a collection of powerful mythical women. Ayn Cates Sullivan combines her storytelling craft with research to provide readers with great entertainment. Each story includes symbolism, a spirituality developed around the deity, and poems evoking a spiritual atmosphere linked to the character. The stories transport readers into the time of legend and revisits deities and legendary female characters linked to Welsh and British mythology. In this book, the author's research into the myth of the Holy Grail creates beautiful mythical encounters, bringing to life “untold” stories of characters like the Goddess Arianrhod, Blodeuweddi, Iouga, Elen, also known as “Elen of the Ways,” and the Goddess of Sovereignty, Elaine and Dindraine in the Arthurian female Grail Knights.The stories begin with an informative commentary that shares the author’s personal journey and offers elements of myth and the culture around which these characters evolved. The reader will understand the feminine visage of God and the role of some of the heroic women in the lives and history of legendary heroes like Arthur. The literary allusions are manifold in this narrative, and they feature the Lady of the Lake, Morte D’Arthur, and the Arthurian Round Table. One understands the role of women in British mythology and that brave kings were nothing without them: “A king must connect to the spirit of the land through a woman." The author reminds us that any nation or tribe that remembers and re-tells the stories of their people carry a torch of light and insight that continues to pass hope from one generation to the next. This is a book that invites wholeness and peace.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two besties and a baby make for an instafamily and a surprising romance in a delightful series by Melissa Foster, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Sugar Lake novels.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Dalton has always been honest, except where his heart is concerned. He’s been in love with his best friend—saucy, smart-mouthed Aurelia Stark—forever. But Ben’s a planner, and timing has never been on his side. When he finally decides to make his move, Aurelia beats him to the punch with a move of her own—to a different town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurelia loves her new life in the charming town of Harmony Pointe. She has a great apartment and her very own bookstore, and best of all, the sinfully hot, commitment-phobic friend she’s crushed on for years is no longer just around the corner. Maybe she’ll finally be able to leave her unrequited love behind and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a baby is left on Ben’s front porch—a baby that is presumably his—Aurelia is there for him. Neither one knows the first thing about babies, but how hard can it be? Ben and Aurelia are catapulted into a world of love, laughter, and tracking down the baby mama, and it might even add up to a very happily ever after… just not one either of them expects.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Earth scientists and their families stationed on the remote planet of Fosaan were promised a tropical vacation-like experience. But Fosaan, devastated from an apocalyptic event nearly three-hundred years ago, is full of lethal predators and dangerous terrain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthers are forbidden to go beyond the safety zone of their settlement and must not engage the small population of reclusive Fosaanians, descendants of the survivors. Sixteen-year-old Quinn Neen plans to do both of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Quinn discovers a beautiful Fosaanian girl named Mira stealing food from his family’s living unit, he soon learns Earth’s government may not be telling the whole truth about Fosaan and the cause of the past disaster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some who to restore the planet to its former glory by any means necessary. Quinn finds himself caught between his loyalty to his own people and what is right for Mira and her people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he can decide what to do, the scientists are taken captive, stranding the young Earthers on Fosaan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn must go from renegade to leader and convince Mira to become an ally in a fight against an enemy whose very existence threatens their lives and the future of those both on Fosaan and at home.</description>

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not talking about erotica, per say, but what is the difference between a book you eagerly devour and a book you slum your way through? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are individual exceptions, the most objective difference between a good story and a downright terrible one is simple—it all comes down to the writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s either good writing, and we can forgive the technical flaws a little more easily, or it’s bad writing, and bad writing is just bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good writing is more than just good writing. &lt;br /&gt;Good writing is sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re a fiction writer looking to improve your writing skills, this is the perfect, provocative read to encourage you to get down to business and write your story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside &lt;em&gt;Good Writing is Like Good Sex&lt;/em&gt;, you will find:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•A titillating perspective on the writing process &lt;br /&gt;•The secret to why your story is special, and how you can make it sexier&lt;br /&gt;•Tips on romancing your readers&lt;br /&gt;•How to write irresistible characters &lt;br /&gt;•Basic writing and story concepts with advanced insights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… and all in a non-gratuitous fashion with a lot of innuendos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. S. JOHNSON is the award-winning, genre-hopping author of several novels, including young adult sci-fi and fantasy adventures such as the Starlight Chronicles series, the Once Upon a Princess saga, and the Divine Space Pirates trilogy. She has written articles for The Rebelution, MTL Magazine, Hollywood in Toto, StudioJake, and more. With a gift for sarcasm and an apologetic heart, she currently lives in Atlanta with her family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;FROM THE BOOK: &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“So, what’s so special about your book?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;It’s still a terrifying question, but the more you see it, the better you can prepare to answer it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;It might be hard for you to realize that your book is special at all, especially if you are a new writer, or you’re one of those people who struggle with self-confidence (I can assure you from personal experience you are in good company). I know exactly how that feels.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;But your book will be special, because it’s yours.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;It is your words written down on paper, your story written for the world to see, and the book you were born to write.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;It’s yours.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This is something that people tend to say about kids, and I like using this analogy here because kids can be the result of good sex, just as my “book babies” are the result of my writing. No one will love my real children the way I do. My kids are unlike everyone else’s children because they are mine. And no one will ever love my husband the way I do, because he is the one I chose and the one who chose me back. Your own love story will be special because it’s yours.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Your book will be special too.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;But, let’s face it, “special” has its limits, especially when it comes to the competitive writing market.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Your unique outlook should be what tips the balance in your favor, and you do yourself a lot of favors if your tipping point doesn’t have a lot of unattractive baggage dragging it down. This means you need to take care to make your book be its best.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;WHAT READERS ARE SAYING: &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;"An absolutely brilliant, cheeky, and fun guide to writing better. Great for anyone tired of bland writing guides." ~ Liliyana, Book Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chock-full of useful writing advice, written by a woman who clearly knows what she’s talking about." ~ Jessica, Author and Book Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I'm a therapist, and I work with the most dangerous patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've seen it all... A boy who planned to be the next school shooter. A patient with OCD whose loved ones really did suffer every time he missed a ritual. A choir boy who claimed he was being molested -- not by a priest -- but by God Himself. A patient with PTSD who gave &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; nightmares. A husband and wife who accused each other of abuse, and only one of them was telling the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how could I ever forget, Patient #220.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, my patients have a habit of dying. Sometimes I wonder if I'm the common denominator. Or maybe that's just the cost of taking on exceptionally broken clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I'll never stop trying to help.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;A painting. A memory. A death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can safe refuge ever be found?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;Mindi Mendrano had it all -- she was a golden goddess with a tennis prowess few had ever seen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then she vanished. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who had the greatest motive to kill her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before Cooper Chain can finally get the green light to pen his first book -- a biography on a once-famous tennis phenom -- he must find her. If she's still alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can secrets kill? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A man disappears into the bowels underneath the city of Dallas, and Willow can't make sense of it or the odd people she befriends. Does at least one man have an ulterior motive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two die the hard way, leaving Willow and Cooper scrambling to see through a haze of clues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can secrets kill? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Retracing every aspect of Mindi's former life, team Ball &amp;amp; Chain uncover a key to her past. But will it unlock memories that create the ultimate time bomb? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The very existence of a hidden society is on the line -- and one man will either force their loyalty or recreate one of the deadliest events in modern history. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can secrets kill? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cooper and Willow have one chance to stop the killing and save a life. But will they be too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Get &lt;i&gt;LURE&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You'll love this Ball &amp;amp; Chain thriller if you're a fan of the &lt;b&gt;Fox &amp;amp; O'Hare novels&lt;/b&gt; by Janet Evanovich and Lee Goldberg, Michael Connelly's &lt;b&gt;Ballard and Bosch&lt;/b&gt;, David Baldacci's &lt;b&gt;King and Maxwell&lt;/b&gt;, Tess Gerritsen's &lt;b&gt;Rizzoli and Isles&lt;/b&gt;, or the TV show &lt;b&gt;"Castle."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't miss out on all the Ball &amp;amp; Chain Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;MERCY - Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;FEAR - Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;BURY - Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;LURE - Book 4 &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A tiresome task. &lt;br /&gt;A deceptive dragon. &lt;br /&gt;A prince that changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ophiuchus is a celebrated warrior of the Celestial Kingdom and a warrior among the Stars. He has been always been a dutiful servant of the Prince of Stars. So when the prince asks him to watch over the crafty serpent, Naga, Ophiuchus agrees. But as time passes and discouragement—both from Naga and others—Ophiuchus wonders if the Prince of Stars was right in asking him to take on the burdens of his task. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ophiuchus honor his duty, or give into his heart's weariness?</description>

It feels like you're completely dropped into the middle of an ongoing story, but there's no reference to it being part of a series in the synopsis or book. At times it's a little disjointed and doesn't flow...]]>

  <description>And You Can Love Me is a story for everyone who loves someone with ASD (autism spectrum disorder). It is the fictional story of Ethan, a nonverbal autistic child, based on the author's observations and experiences with her grandson. The bounce of a ball is not only a metaphor, but also how the author imagines that the child is releasing his innermost physical and emotional challenges. It is a love story that can be recognized by parents, caregivers and teachers; a story that embraces Ethan, a nonverbal child, who may never/or not yet be able to write his own story, yet he lives it every day and tells it by his actions and by bouncing a ball- any ball, any size, any color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And You Can Love Me is also a picture book that a child with ASD may, in some way, recognize within himself/herself. It doesn't try to explain, define or even educate; it is merely Ethan's story - the story of one particular nonverbal autistic child; one of the many stories that will add to the diversity of ASD stories.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved this book. The font chosen is reminiscent of a child's writing, and the illustrations match up perfectly with the story. From the start, it makes clear that everyone with ASD is different, and this is only one child's story. The story focuses on the positives, and what Ethan likes. A grea...]]>

Her smile is as ubiquitous as air, selling everything from vital medicine to vanity drugs with risky side effects. Lifelike android clones reside in over a dozen homes, shielding her from the violent resentment of a population straining under her mother's boot heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ascendant's power comes from Xenodril, a drug capable of reversing the effects of Fade, a disease some claim came from aliens or from the governments that predate the war. Only Ascendant sells it, and at a price only Citizens can afford. The rest are left to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maya's earliest memories are of living alone in a penthouse apartment, desperate for the attention of a mother who never visits. Forbidden to go out except to record advertising video, her only friend has been the 'net. When she is taken for ransom by a group of mercenaries with nothing left to lose, she discovers her life may not be what she thought it was--or wants.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kill or Cure&lt;/i&gt; is a YA romance-infused sci-fi novel. &lt;br /&gt;It focuses on human relationships in an undead, apocalyptic world. &lt;br /&gt;A girl who will stop at nothing to protect her brother.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a dystopian world ravaged by infection, society as we know it has fallen to the mouths of the dead. The remaining fragments of civilisation survive in walled compounds, scattered in the depths of the countryside. When her little brother becomes sick with a suspected flu virus, Alyx Silverthorne will do anything to keep Tommy alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With limited medical supplies and only herbal alternatives, his prospects of surviving this mystery illness are bleak. But saving Tommy is just the beginning. The infected are not the only monsters that exist in this new world, and human nature can be more destructive than the dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a race against time, Alyx and her best friend Will stop at nothing to protect him, even from the same people that swore to protect them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kill or Cure&lt;/i&gt; is a dynamic, multifaceted story of teenage love and gut wrenching loss in a dystopian world.</description>

  <description>Why does a stranger hold the key to unlocking Katie’s family secrets?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1903 Jane is the talented principal costumier at Auckland’s Opera House in its Edwardian heyday. She thrives in this place where she can hide from her pain and keep her skeletons to herself – until the past comes back to haunt her. Brigid, her beloved foster mother, and her best friend Gwenna are anchors in her solitary yet rewarding life. As the decades go by, the burden of carrying secrets becomes too great, and Jane must pass on the hidden truths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today Katie seeks refuge from her crumbling personal life with her grandmother, who lives in past with the people in her cherished photographs. All too soon, Katie learns she must identify the people behind the gentle smiles – including the Edwardian woman to whom she bears a remarkable resemblance – and reveal generations of secrets before she can claim her inheritance. She meets the intriguing Jared, who stirs her interest, but she’s not ready for any sort of romance, so is shocked when she learns that he holds the key to discovering her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awarded a BGS Gold Quality Mark</description>

  <description>It's cliché to fall for the cute barista at the coffee shop, but Paul can't help it. Eran's shy smile and heated gaze are driving him wild. Convincing Eran to go out with him, however, is a lot harder than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eran's been burned before—by family and more, enough to make him jump at shadows and avoid intimacy. But Paul is determined, and with the help of counselors, classes, and an unexpected modeling gig, Eran might just find that taking a risk on what scares him the most, has a worthy payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♦ 44,000 words.</description>

Physical abuse isn't something that should ever be tossed around lightly or used as window dressing like it is here. I...]]>

  <description>His name is Howler for a reason. A self-confident man of forty-three, he controls everything and everyone around him. Women trip over themselves to get the first smile from his lips. &lt;br /&gt;A founder/owner of an investigative service that helps people in trouble, he finds himself in the heart of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The owner of the very successful Painted Horse Ranch is being vandalized with fires, broken fences, graffiti covered signs, and attempted horse theft. &lt;br /&gt;When Howler’s boots hit the gravel road in front of the owner’s house, he knows he’ll lose his heart. Sadie is slightly older, a curvy, beautiful Choctaw who is as big a control freak as him. &lt;br /&gt;Will she play, or will she fight until she runs him off? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>This summer solstice will put the “Hot” in “Hotlanta”.&lt;br /&gt;Remington Montgomery had no interest in settling down. But now he’s engaged to be married, in line for the throne, and trying to keep his bride to be from being killed.&lt;br /&gt;Dai Ito understands her new role but isn’t ready to give up her old life. Her dreams don’t involve a crown, a husband, or being killed.&lt;br /&gt;Fate had other plans for these two dragons, but before they exchange vows, they have to hunt down a deranged serial killer, find a secret tribe of female warriors thought to be eliminated, and plan the perfect wedding that will make both their mothers happy. To make life more complicated, a mystery man from Dai’s past comes back into her life, and he has more than a friendly reunion in mind.&lt;br /&gt;Planning a wedding is never easy, but it’s twice as hard when these two shifters have to not only strengthen their relationship but race the clock before another dragon dies.</description>

  <description>Remington Montgomery is a modern dragon straddling the worlds of tradition and the past. His drive for advancement made him one of Atlanta’s finest detectives and one the most sought-after bachelors. But none of the women he’s met move him the way his first love, Dai Ito, once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dai Ito’s family pushes her to win in every area of life. They raised her to sit on the throne as the reigning Dragon Queen but never bothered to ask what she wanted. Only one person has ever challenged her, Remington Montgomery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a Beltane proclamation, Fate intervenes, and these two are chosen to reign as king and queen, a sacred duty chosen from every third generation. Only one problem- they have a serious love-hate relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Dai’s sister goes missing and they must work together to find her. Can this king and queen set aside their hatred, and learn to work together as only a royal couple can?</description>

  <description>Can you change destiny? What if you can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashish, a passionate clockmaker is frustrated with his life - financial insecurity, his ongoing nightmares and his family, wife Lata and son Vicky, are driving him crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lata is having a tough time in life with her arch-rival, Rashmi. Vicky wants to be a biker than rather join the family legacy of the clockmaker. He also has a crush on Kavya who is more interested in supporting her family than romancing around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, Ashish starts hallucinating things. The black hooded man, who traumatizes him in the nightmares, warns him of dire consequences if he doesn’t return the timepiece that was given to Ashish by his father at his deathbed. Burdened with despair, Ashish wishes he could change his destiny and end all his miseries. By sheer chance, he discovers the power of the timepiece. Ashish was still figuring out what to do with it when an incident shatters his life completely. Without second thoughts he uses the power of the timepiece to change his destiny. But, can he really change it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the chaos of the busy by-lanes of the East Delhi unfolds a paranormal, supernatural, Indian drama that will leave you thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;The Jungle Series – Get ready to be assaulted!</description>

  <description>To what lengths will one go to exorcise a specter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One rainy morning in 1892, people gather to mourn the death of San Francisco socialite Penelope Alderdice. Among them is a strange little woman named Bertha Ross, who claims to have known “Grace” in the 1850’s in the small town of Waxwood. But Penelope’s granddaughter, Vivian, has never heard of Grace or Waxwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bertha reveals surprising details about Grace’s life in Waxwood, including a love affair with Evan, an artist and member of Brandywine, Waxwood’s art colony.Vivian’s mother, Larissa, insists Bertha is an imposter who has come not to mourn a woman she knew in her youth but to stir up trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian, however, suspects the key to her grandmother’s life and her own lies in Waxwood. She journeys to Brandywine where she meets Verina Jones, Evan’s niece, and discovers a packet of letters her grandmother wrote forty years ago about her time in Waxwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Vivian confronts the specter that holds the truth to secrets buried in the family consciousness, she examines her grandmother’s life as a mid-19th century debutante and her own as a Gilded Age belle. Will she find her way out into the world as an autonomous being, or will she be haunted by the specter of her grandmother’s unhappiness all her life?</description>

  <description>A Cynn Cruor warrior who pays the ultimate price bumps into the woman he knows is destined for him. But how can he give her the love he has when both the Cynn Cruors and the Scatha Cruors want him dead? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mackenzie Butler, a former Scatha Cruor, has been incarcerated in The Hamilton’s dungeon for the last four years while he is being treated by Firebinders Faith Hannah and Marek Bannach. When an opportunity to escape The Hamilton’s Faesten arises, he takes it to fulfil one mission: the eradication of the Scatha Cruors in Leeds. But there is a sexy spanner in the works: Jasmine Angelico. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman who immediately owns his heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jasmine prepares for her holiday, she and her dog, Mutt are abducted... though abduction might not be the right word. Her unusual abductor whisks her away from the very people she believes are guilty of her family’s murder. Trapped in her kidnapper’s house, she gets to know Mack Butler more than she should. It’s just too bad that her heart is compromised when she falls for her handsome and enigmatic kidnapper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deadly secret is revealed that leads to a fight for the right to claim Jasmine. Sacrifices must be made to keep the peace within the ranks of the Cynn Cruors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine and Mack may not have a chance to find their happily ever after...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 9th book in the Isobelle Cate’s Bestselling Cynn Cruors Bloodline Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***CONTENT WARNING: This story contains adult language and sexual situations and intended for audiences 18+ ONLY***</description>

  <description>When the Ericksons move home to care for their ailing grandmother, they’re told a stranger has taken up residence in the attic of the sprawling mansion. Upon investigation, the family isn't sure the tenant is anything more than a figment of old Mrs. Erickson’s imagination—until a mysterious young woman begins to show herself to the family in fleeting, uncanny visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When unexplained things start happening under the mansion’s roof, suspicions arise as to just who—or what—she is. In the chaos that ensues, the family is forced to make a decision: trust the stranger or band together as a family against her—and their grandmother who’s protecting her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on Earth...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Maria Rossini appears to be the luckiest girl in the world. She's the daughter of a beautiful and loving mother, and her father is one of the most famous film actors of his generation. She's also the granddaughter of a rather eccentric and obscure Italian astrophysicist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as her seemingly charmed life begins to unravel, and Emma experiences love and tragedy, she ultimately finds solace in her once-derided grandfather's Theorem on the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Space Between Time is humorous and poignant and offers the metaphor that we are all connected, even to those we have loved and not quite lost.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed this book. It wraps you up within its pages and makes you really think about the world that surrounds you. Life can be sweet and it can be hard, but in the end, there are invisible threads that connect us all. A great read that offers introspection without forcing it on you. High...]]>

  <description>History wasn’t modest when it described the settling of the western frontier as wild. So, of course Eve lands in the middle of an unforgiving land, rife with conflict, and fueled by desperation. A treaty has been signed between the Native American’s and the settlers who keep pouring into the west, so while things seem settled, a tension lays over the land, as thick as the blood being spilt over it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are more than just gun fights and saloons in this place, there is an ancient source of magic that predicts a very disturbing image of Eve’s future. And she will have to fight to make sure what was predicted never comes true and that she doesn’t become the thing she hates the most…</description>

      <![CDATA[First, let me say this is not a series where you can't jump in without reading the books in order. It was well written, but the pace felt a little off, and some of the descriptions were a little too in-depth. I liked the story overall, and I think it makes a great addition to the series. Perfect...]]>

  <description>Years and light-years away, one father must find the courage to do whatever it takes to protect his children ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a surgeon for the Mercy Interplanetary Alliance, Micheel Reshi is no stranger to difficult choices. But when his wife, Nabelle, gives brith to their twins, Micheel is horrified to find Callox and Pasher bare the Sign of Gemini on their arms. The bright constellation marks them as carriers of the hidden code Earth’s last generation had engineered into human DNA—and marks them as targets by the Collectors, a group of people determined to wipe out all memory of Old Earth and its existence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Count Lux, Nabelle's cousin and a member of the Collectors, arrives on their starship, Micheel knows he must do something to save his family—even if it means breaking them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE SHORT STORY GRAPHIC NOVEL VERSION OF THE PREQUEL TO "THE SIGNS OF THE STARS," AN UPCOMING SPACE OPERA ADVENTURE SERIES FROM C.

  <description>For Eric Frost, Madagascar is a place of beauty and learning. A researcher in bio-robotics, Eric finds the sheer variety of flora and fauna fascinating – but when he finds Unseen Madagascar, an unassuming book by a missing British author named Richard Walters, Eric learns that there’s more to the nation than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text speaks of an island off the coast of Madagascar known only as Demon Island. There, the author suggests, lives an isolated and hostile tribe of natives who seem to jealously guard something held deeper in the island’s interior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric, along with his friends Ivy and Max, pledge to get to the bottom of the mystery. They travel to Madagascar and begin to plan a journey out to Demon Island, but instead they meet the mysterious Daniel, a self-proclaimed American explorer full of dark warnings and vague stories. He eventually agrees to help Eric and his friends get to Demon Island, but at a price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Demon’s Crystal is Lenard Hale’s thrilling first novel, and is sure to appeal to fans of sci-fi and adventure alike.</description>

      <![CDATA[The Demon's Crystal grabs you from the start. If I could, I would give this a higher rating. Earth, space, mystery, intrigue, and heart racing moments combine to keep you completely wrapped up within its pages. The characters are dynamic (although their back story isn't too in-depth).

      <![CDATA[The Vogt House is 90% sex and 10% plot. The book needs a once over by an editor as there are some spelling/grammar mistakes that while not detracting from the overall story are somewhat distracting. Not that there is much of a story to detract from. The sex is hot, don't get me wrong, but there i...]]>

  <description>Time Out is a dignified and effective method of discipline, endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association. This book, written by parenting experts, explains the Time Out process and provides step-by-step instructions for its proper and effective use. &lt;em&gt;Please Explain Time Out To Me&lt;/em&gt; is two books in one: an engaging story with colorful illustrations and a parent section which describes the Time Out process in detail, as well as the advantages and pitfalls of other methods of discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children will: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the story and illustrations Understand how Time Out works Empathize with the characters in the book Be treated respectfully when given a consequence Experience the benefits of Time Out as a mechanism of behavior change &lt;strong&gt;Parents and caregivers will: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Develop a plan for supplying responses to their child's unacceptable behavior Understand the rationale behind Time-Out as a management technique Learn how to use Time Out effectively Better handle behavioral issues wherever they occur Learn that physical forms of punishment do not work Drs. Zelinger book is clearly informed by literature and both clinical and personal experience. Its simplicity and ease-of-use and understanding allows for broad reach to all parents that face the normal challenges in raising children. The story to help the child understand makes this book unique, as well as the "fixer box" concept. Behavioral difficulties often stem from struggles around feeling in control. This book gives a concrete, more adaptive path for both parents and child to feel in control.&lt;br /&gt; -- David Salsberg, PsyD, DABPS Clinical Neuropsychologist; Director, Pediatric Assessment, Learning &amp;amp; Support (PALS), New York, NY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Please explain Time Out To Me&lt;/em&gt;, Drs. Laurie and Fred Zelinger offer a clear, concise and insightful look at the often misunderstood and misinterpreted concept of time out. Combining colorful illustrations and story line for children and step-by-step guidelines and principles for parents and adults, the book has unique appeal to both. I highly recommend this book, particularly to parents foraging through the tangled, complicated and sometimes scary web called parenthood.&lt;br /&gt; -- Iris Ackerman, LCSW, PhD, Clinical Social Worker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a child psychiatrist, finding parenting books that are straightforward, helpful, and concise is a rare find indeed. Drs. Laurie and Fred Zelinger offer just that in &lt;em&gt;Please Explain Time Out To Me&lt;/em&gt;. In its pages, they harness their expert clinical experience and judgment and offer it in a relatable, engaging, and entertaining way. I highly recommend this book to families who are struggling with the difficult journey of growing up and managing problem behaviors along the way.&lt;br /&gt; -- Stephen Perret, MD., Child Psychiatrist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up for Drs. Zelinger's book on explaining time out to kids. As a busy working mom with six children, I have used time out effectively. I would recommend reading this book to help understand the benefits of time out for both parents and children, and the effectiveness of time-out as a learning tool. Drs. Zelinger's thought out story will be a helpful, useful contribution for kids, parents and teachers.&lt;br /&gt; -- Chani Jacobowitz, LCSW; Mother of 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;Please Explain To Me...&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.DrZelinger.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.DrZelinger.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Loving Healing Press &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.LHPress.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.LHPress.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Best. Summer. Ever. At least it was supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate can't wait to attend the elite girls' hockey camp in Denver and go up against some of the best players from around the world. But then Mom says Kate has to stay with her grandma in Denver, who doesn't care about Kate's hockey dreams at all. And two players at the camp have it in for Kate both on and off the ice. Toss in a tough-as-nails coach and a huge family secret, and Kate's perfect summer isn’t turning out quite like she planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate's Really Good at Hockey is a story about family, friendship, and doing what it takes to follow your dreams.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved this book. It's a great story about not giving up in the face of adversity. Mixed in is a story of family love and how secrets can hurt. Sometimes you just have to reach a little further and push a little harder to achieve your goal and get closer to the ones you love.]]>

  <description>Four disparate high school seniors come together to compete in their school's battle of the bands. Sharing a love for playing rock and roll, the members name the band "The Stereotypical Freaks" because they feel stereotyped by their classmates - smart kid, geek, star athlete and quiet weirdo… when in fact they know they are much more than those labels that have been placed on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one member reveals life altering news, winning the competition takes on more of a meaning to each member. Scared and angry, upset and yet still with a lot of resolve they set out to win one for the good guys… will they?</description>

  <description>Based on a true story of Gina, a wire haired terrier, whose family snuck her out of Siberia and into the USA at the conclusion of the Cold War, this beautiful and thrilling tale follows Gina as her family travels by bus, train, car, plane and minivan. Upon arrival at her new home, 5,681 miles away from her old home, Gina is not happy and lets everyone around her know it. But slowly, she comes to accept her new surroundings with the help of her new friend Victor, a large boxer. Talking about her friends and family back home in Siberia heals the emotional wounds, making Gina believe that just maybe her new home isn't so bad after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Korea's demilitarized zone has become an amazing accidental nature preserve that gives hope for a brighter future for a divided land.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This unique picture book invites young readers&lt;/b&gt; into the natural beauty of the DMZ, where salmon, spotted seals, and mountain goats freely follow the seasons and raise their families in this 2.5-mile-wide, 150-mile-long corridor where no human may tread. But the vivid seasonal flora and fauna are framed by ever-present rusty razor wire, warning signs, and locked gates--and regularly interrupted by military exercises that continue decades after a 1953 ceasefire in the Korean War established the DMZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creator Uk-Bae Lee's lively paintings&lt;/b&gt; juxtapose these realities, planting in children the dream of a peaceful world without war and barriers, where separated families meet again and live together happily in harmony with their environment. Lee shows the DMZ through the eyes of a grandfather who returns each year to look out over his beloved former lands, waiting for the day when he can return. In a surprise foldout panorama at the end of the book the grandfather, tired of waiting, dreams of taking his grandson by the hand, flinging back the locked gates, and walking again on the land he loves to find his long-lost friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When Spring Comes to the DMZ&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;helps introduce children to the unfinished history of the Korean Peninsula playing out on the nightly news, and may well spark discussions about other walls, from Texas to Gaza.</description>

  <description>Through campy pop culture rhymes and beautiful oil paintings, the narrator of our book guides you though a list of things you CAN grab while offering more poetic ways to refer to a woman’s genitalia than the word “pussy” that Trump so vulgarly used. As the narrator goes on, she lets you know more about her relatives (a reclusive aunt with a lazy eye) and her interests (Justin Bieber’s Instagram) while never losing sight of her mission to make the President as uncomfortable as possible. We think that the President, not to mention men in Hollywood, Wall Street, the news media and beyond, can benefit from reading our book. No matter who you are, or how dumb you are, you’ll be able to understand this book’s simple message: Hands off my pussy!</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A girl comes of age with a vengeance—and help from a friend—in a tale of unnerving suspense from National Book Award winner and literary master Joyce Carol Oates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad things have been happening since Mia began to mature. Her dad left. Boys at school can’t keep their hands to themselves. A lecherous stepfather has moved in. Her only refuge is an abandoned lot on her suburban cul-de-sac, crawling with feral felines—one of which follows Mia home. Ghostly white and affectionate, she is Mia’s new companion and—as Mia’s tormenters will soon discover—her fierce protector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joyce Carol Oates’s&lt;/i&gt; Miao Dao &lt;i&gt;is part of &lt;/i&gt;Dark Corners&lt;i&gt;, a collection of seven heart-stopping short stories by bestselling authors who give you so many new reasons to be afraid. Each story can be read in a single sitting. Or, if you have the nerve, you can listen all by yourself in the dark.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The fate of a lonely girl becomes part of a town’s shameful secret history in Thriller Award winner Jennifer McMahon’s terrifying story of guilt, retribution, and one tragic Halloween night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-four years ago, on October 31, poor Hannah Talbott took part in a scavenger hunt gone violently wrong. The mean girls made sure of it. To this day, for a haunted local mother, the most unsettling Halloween costume of all is an urban legend they call Hannah-Beast. It’s a reminder of the past she can’t forget. Especially tonight when it’s come back, so close to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer McMahon’s &lt;i&gt;Hannah-Beast is part of &lt;i&gt;Dark Corners&lt;/i&gt;, a collection of seven heart-stopping short stories by bestselling authors who give you so many new reasons to be afraid. Each story can be read in a single sitting. Or, if you have the nerve, you can listen all by yourself in the dark.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;He’s a man with a body under siege—and the willingness to proceed with a cure so miraculous all one can do is gasp—in this chilling story by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adam Haslett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of traditional treatments and therapies, Derrick still suffers from pain ineluctable enough that it has become his identity. Then he hears of an exclusive, very private New York clinic that promises relief. It comes highly recommended by a friend. The multisession remedy unfolds as a sensorial wonder that’s so illuminating it’s enough to bring tears to Derrick’s eyes. It’s all working so well. So unexpectedly well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adam Haslett’s&lt;/i&gt; The Remedy &lt;i&gt;is part of &lt;/i&gt;Dark Corners&lt;i&gt;, a collection of seven heart-stopping short stories by bestselling authors who give you so many new reasons to be afraid. Each story can be read in a single sitting. Or, if you have the nerve, you can listen all by yourself in the dark.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Christy Award winner from the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;War Room&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Dogwood, West Virginia, Karin has buried her shattered dreams by settling for a faithful husband whose emotional distance from her deep passions and conflicts leaves her isolated. Loaded with guilt, she tries to raise three small children and "do life" the best she can. Will returns to Dogwood intent on pursuing the only woman he has ever loved--only to find there is far more standing in his way than lost years in prison. The secrets of Will and Karin's past begin to emerge through Danny Boyd, a young boy who wishes he hadn't survived the tragedy that knit those two together as well as tore them apart. The trigger that will lay their pain bare and force them to face it rather than flee is the unlikely figure of Ruthie Bowles, a withered, wiry old woman who leads Karin so deep into her anger against God that it forces unexpected consequences.</description>

  <description>Air pumps into the dark night sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade of the shovel digs deeper and deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cries from below are slowly devoured by the howl of a coyote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willow Ball and Cooper Chain are tied at the hip -- on some days that's a fantasy, other days a curse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's one thing they agree on: if they hope to outsmart a ruthless crime boss, luck will have to fall their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's only part of their perilous imbroglio. Life slips off the rails in a hurry . . . and the implications could be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shallow grave is uncovered… and it's the unthinkable. With little evidence, authorities have no suspects. But could this be connected to a similar incident more than two decades earlier?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When another girl goes missing, their world stops down. How is Cooper's daughter caught up in the web? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every path seems blocked, because every person wants something buried. Does that include what Willow and Cooper feel for each other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cops are gunned down, friends are framed and murdered -- how can Willow and Cooper make sense of it all to finally end the mayhem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when one more person goes missing, it shreds Cooper's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will Cooper and Willow sacrifice to save his daughter?</description>

  <description>Jes Harper loves her life. Being the production assistant for one of the most sought after producers in the music industry, Brett Winters, she gets to spend her time doing what she loves – listening to music. Working with the musicians is fun, too, but after being burned by them twice before in love, she’s sworn them off for anything more than friends. But, Brett’s best friend is back in town and perfect in every way, and he could change her mind…if she’d just let him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mitch Lansing has lived the musician life – the drugs, the women, the partying – but he’s over that now. At 40, you tend to want to settle down, even if you’re a musician. He’s happy to be back home with his best friend, Brett, and recording his own music. One look at Brett’s assistant and he knows he’s found the perfect woman for him…if he can just convince her of that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When coming on strong doesn't work, Mitch decides to take it slow and vows to not give up. Day by day, piece by piece, he chips away at the wall around Jes’s heart. Can he prove to her that not all musicians are the same? Or will a ghost from his past ruin everything for them both? The other musicians from her past broke her heart...Mitch could shatter it completely.</description>

  <description>Discover the magic of the Bradens and fall in love with Addison Cole's rich and romantic storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacy Snow wasn’t looking for love when she met strikingly handsome and seductive Dane Braden. But how could she ignore the six-foot-three darkly handsome god who tagged and researched sharks for a living—and made every nerve in her body tangle into an overly sensitive knot? Even her fear of sharks could not suppress their intense attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As founder of the Brave Foundation, Dane Braden travels from port to port, educating and advocating on behalf of the mammals he adores—and spends his nights finding solace in the arms of strangers. The last thing Dane was looking for when he met Lacy Snow was a relationship, and the last thing he expected was to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a year—and hundreds of flirty texts, steamy phone calls, and sensual video chats—later, they reunite and take passion to a whole new level. But as Lacy’s phobia meets Dane’s past love life, their steamy romance is upended, and when tragedy strikes, Dane and Lacy are forced to face their deepest fears head-on as they try to navigate their own sea of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Loving Lacy is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a more explicit romance, pick up the steamy edition, Sea of Love, written by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: WESTON BRADENS&lt;br /&gt;A Love So Sweet&lt;br /&gt;Our Sweet Destiny&lt;br /&gt;Unraveling the Truth About Love&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Loving Lacy&lt;br /&gt;Promise of a New Beginning&lt;br /&gt;And Then There Was Us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO AVAILABLE for your binge-reading pleasure, more fun, flirty, and romantic love stories. The Seaside and Bayside series are set in the quaint small towns of Cape Cod, making them perfect beach reads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: SEASIDE SUMMERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;Read, Write, Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Dreaming at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Hearts at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Sunsets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Secrets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Nights at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Seized by Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Embraced at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Lovers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Whispers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: BAYSIDE SUMMERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Love at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Passions at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Heat at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Escape at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Addison Cole's stories are the perfect blend of sizzle and sweet.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The line between good and evil isn’t always clear…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Madison Knight has risked her badge—and her life—in the pursuit of justice before, and she just might need to do so again. Two victims are found murdered and naked in the home of Steven Malone, who is the largest contributor to the Stiles PD. One victim is his wife. The other victim is a John Doe. This high-profile double homicide immediately pits Madison against her sergeant, who seems more intent on protecting the Malones’ reputation and retaining a benefactor than catching a killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madison will need to pull on her tenacity and courage if she’s going to follow the evidence without prejudice. In the process, it becomes clear that finding justice isn’t always black and white, and often the shades in between tell the fullest story—and it’s not something she will forget anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shades of Justice is a murder mystery with twists and turns that will have readers flipping the pages until the wee hours of the morning. The ninth installment in an international bestselling series, it doesn’t matter if this is the first book you’re reading in the Detective Madison Knight series or not; all the books stand alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this book now and join the investigation! Uncover clues, follow leads, and catch a killer like hundreds of thousands of readers in this series have done before you. Perfect for fans of James Patterson, Michael Connelly, and JD Robb.</description>

  <description>The summer of 1972 was the most pivotal of Matt Plumley’s childhood. While his beloved Pirates battle for back-to-back World Series titles, Matt’s family moves from Pittsburgh to Dogwood, West Virginia, where his father steps into the pulpit of a church under the thumb of town leader Basil Blackwood. A fish out of water, Matt is relieved to forge a fast bond with two unlikely friends: Dickie Darrel Lee Hancock, a mixed-race boy, and Jesse Woods, a tough-as-nails girl with a sister on her hip and no dad in sight.&lt;br /&gt;As the trio traipses the hills and hollers, Matt begins to fall for Jesse, and their promises to each other draw him deeper into her terrifying reality. One night, the wrath of the Blackwoods and the secrets of Jesse’s family collide, and Matt joins Jesse in a rescue that saves one life and ends another . . . and severs the bond of their friendship.&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Matt is pulled back to Dogwood and to memories of that momentous summer by news of Jesse’s upcoming wedding. He could never shake the feeling that there was more to the story of that fateful night, and he’s determined to learn the truth behind the only promise Jesse Woods ever broke.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A IS FOR AVENGER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she's got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A IS FOR ACCUSED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A IS FOR ALIBI&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A" Is for Alibi&lt;br /&gt;"B" Is for Burglar&lt;br /&gt;"C" Is for Corpse&lt;br /&gt;"D" Is for Deadbeat&lt;br /&gt;"E" Is for Evidence&lt;br /&gt;"F" Is for Fugitive&lt;br /&gt;"G" Is for Gumshoe&lt;br /&gt;"H" Is for Homicide&lt;br /&gt;"I" Is for Innocent&lt;br /&gt;"J" Is for Judgment&lt;br /&gt;"K" Is for Killer&lt;br /&gt;"L" is for Lawless&lt;br /&gt;"M" Is for Malice&lt;br /&gt;"N" Is for Noose&lt;br /&gt;"O" Is for Outlaw&lt;br /&gt;"P" Is for Peril &lt;br /&gt;"Q" Is for Quarry&lt;br /&gt;"R" Is for Ricochet &lt;br /&gt;"S" Is for Silence &lt;br /&gt;"T" Is for Trespass&lt;br /&gt;"U" Is for Undertow &lt;br /&gt;"V" Is for Vengeance &lt;br /&gt;"W" Is for Wasted &lt;br /&gt;"X" &lt;br /&gt; “Y” Is for Yesterday&lt;br /&gt;The letter Z was unfinished at the time of her death 12/28/2017</description>

  <description>Victor Shelton ran from his family's legacy of prophetic dreams at seventeen but finds at twenty-eight that he is unable to run from the nightmares that plague him. Haunted by images of his own death each night he follows the fleeting memory of the town limit's sign in his nightmare to a quaint Colorado town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beckoned to a forbidding mountain peak with a past riddled by ghost stories and legends, Victor must figure out who is friend or foe. Can he unravel the secrets of the enigmatic citizens of Carver's Corner and solve his own murder before it happens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Perhaps the answers are in the siren song of whatever is calling him to the caves under Maiden's Peak. The song in the darkness urges him on, but whether it is to his death or to his salvation, Victor can't say. All he knows is that once before he had not heeded the call of his dreams and someone had died. He can't let that happen again.</description>

  <description>The Onyx Crown is an exciting foray into the world of African fantasy. From the searing heat of the desert to the vastness of the savannah, it tells the story of three children--Sania, Gesi, and Jorann who grow up in a pre-medieval era of wars and successions, not fifteen years after the greatest king in the history of the continent has been deposed and assassinated. They must overcome the traumatic circumstances of their birth as well as many dangerous trials to fulfill the destiny bestowed upon them as infants. Can mere children use their courage, wits, and uncanny abilities to defeat legendary warriors, entire tribes, provinces, and kingdoms--allowing them to lead the worthy to the greatest prize of all, the Onyx Crown?</description>

  <description>Three hunters find a crashed cocaine plane in the Montana wilderness. Each has a reason to steal the cocaine – who will?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two who do steal it soon find themselves hunted by the Mexican cocaine cartel, the DEA, Las Vegas killers, their guide, and the police of several states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack, a former NFL star now a TV sports icon, owes two million to some nasty people in Vegas. Steve, a Wall Street broker, may have lost all of his and Zack’s investments. Curt, their guide, a half-Cheyenne mountain man, is trying to save his ranch from an energy company takeover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diego is an executioner for the cocaine cartel. María Christina, a Harvard grad and Yale MBA, runs the cartel. Whitney Castro is a black girl from the Denver slums, now a brilliant DEA agent. Kenny Stauffenberg is an easy-going Montana sheriff who never gives up a hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the frozen peaks of Montana to the heights of Wall Street, the slums of Denver and the million-dollar tables at Vegas, SNOW is an electric portrait of today’s American culture, the invisible line between good and evil, and what people will do in their frantic search for love and freedom.</description>

  <description>Archie, a snarky genderqueer artist, is tired of people not understanding gender neutral pronouns. Tristan, a cisgender dude, is looking for an easy way to introduce gender neutral pronouns to his increasingly diverse workplace. The longtime best friends team up in this short and fun comic guide that explains what pronouns are, why they matter, and how to use them. They also include what to do if you make a mistake, and some tips-and-tricks for those who identify outside of the binary to keep themselves safe in this binary-centric world. A quick and easy resource for people who use they/them pronouns, and people who want to learn more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;MAD ABOUT MOON is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fall in love with Jed and Josie in this emotionally captivating, sexy standalone romance by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;The perfect love story for those who enjoy fiercely loyal and insanely sexy alpha heroes, smart, sassy heroines, strong family bonds, bikers, babies, and more! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can true love strike twice in one lifetime? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Josie Beckley refuses to believe there is a limit on happiness. A decade after she escaped her abusive parents and lost touch with her siblings, the death of her husband leaves her and her son homeless. But Josie has never been one to wallow in sadness, and when she takes a chance on reconnecting with her siblings, a sinfully handsome bright light from her past shows up and offers to help her find a way out of the darkness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most people wouldn't see Jed Moon as someone to look up to. He's been in and out of jail and has lived a less-than-stellar lifestyle. But years ago one woman saw through his nonsense, and he's never forgotten her. Now she's back in his life, and as a prospect for the Dark Knights motorcycle club, Jed promises to keep an eye on the sassy, sexy single mother who has never stopped lighting his fantasies on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jed and Josie's combustible connection is stronger than ever. Having Josie and her son in his life brings out all of Jed's protective instincts-and visions of a future he never imagined having. But when a shocking revelation knocks the insatiable lovers to their knees, it forces them to make choices that could change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Earth's alien progenitors have returned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abuse survivor Tara Shifflet just wanted to catch her flight out of Milwaukee after an arduous event planning gig. Unfortunately, thanks to the mysterious bio-tattoos that are cropping up on airport tarmacs across the globe, she's not getting back home to her therapy cat anytime soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Navenah, an alien engineered to mix with humans, her mission has her searching for "generators" to save her dying race. The problem is, Navenah's intel on what kind of humans these generators will be is vague at best, and until she finds one, she's earth-bound...just as stuck as Tara. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance run-in at a hotel bar sets the two on a race against time to save Navenah’s people. Unexpected pleasure brightens the path, but amidst the worldwide chaos over first contact, will their newfound connection be enough to prevent a galactic die-off?</description>

      <![CDATA[I was really blown away by how *real* and organic Tara is. I wasn't quite expecting what this book delivered but I'm genuinely impressed. The sci-fi parts are unique, and Tara is completely relatable. A great sci-fi thrill with a little spice tossed in.]]>

  <description>"You're mine," he said, "forever"—and a chill ran through her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1978 and Johanna loves her adventurous new husband, Kurt, with all of her young, naive heart. She'll follow him anywhere—even far from their home in Germany to a small mining town deep in the Australian bush. Traveling across rocky seas, Kurt begins to unravel, revealing his true, disturbing personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alone and isolated from friends and family, Johanna struggles to navigate her husband's increasingly violent temper and manipulative behavior. Exploited to help him dig in the mines for the legendary black opal, Johanna faces a miserable life, filled with fear and abuse. Her fate seems sealed—unless she kills him first.</description>

  <description>Her death has haunted him for over thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he's hell-bent on making someone pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A father goes missing. Not just any father. But a person once worshipped for his world-class talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the most unconventional team around: Willow Ball and Cooper Chain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nurse at the community clinic, Willow has seen the painful effects of heroin addiction. But now she's compelled to help a grieving wife and mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dodging the mob at every turn, Cooper has a plan to bring them down while getting traction on his upstart career. Is he marching into a trap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their relationship bordering the "friends with benefits" stage, Willow and Cooper team up to find the missing person. But it's not that simple. Nothing with them is ever simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hunt corkscrews into an impossible maize of events -- their lives threatened by a swarm of twisted deviants and social misfits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emotions run rampant, stoking one savage response after another. A spark ignites the hate, but what is the real fuel for this wave of brutal crimes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, can Willow and Cooper save a family from the torment before it's too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only if they can overcome their own…fear.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book. Every time I think Mefford can't possibly top himself I read another one of his books and I'm blown away. If you haven't fallen in love with Cooper and Willow already, you soon will. Together they make this book thrilling, funny, and at times downright infuriating. A must read!]]>

  <description>War is coming between Lukas’ Goddess and an ancient Demon Lord. But the death of his parents shakes his faith, and with the loss of his remaining family it is shattered. Blinded by rage, Lukas turns away from his friends and trains under a deceptive, yet formidable master to hone his magic and prevent the demon’s final objective--obliteration of all life on earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​War begins! A forged weapon, Lukas rejoins his friends and sets after the Demon King. From a hidden crypt, where evil lies waiting, to the Iowa countryside, they battle to prevent the end of all they know. Lukas must overcome his doubts and allow the Light to work through him--to defeat both the foe of his Goddess and a new more familiar one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soul Dark: Chosen is a coming of age tale in the modern-day world when a war between ancient deities and demons culminates in a winner-takes-all battle that could determine the fate of all mankind.</description>

  <description>Sophie lives in a most peculiar cottage at the center of the Forgotten Forest, its inside much larger than its outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, the house must be large, for it holds a great troll as well as a little girl. As one might expect, working for such a creature is rather frightening to a seven-year-old, but the endless expanse of black trees outside is even scarier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s afraid to make even the slightest sound, for the troll abhors loud children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s not terribly fond of quiet children either―unless they’re in his stew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie’s precious light offers comfort in her darkest moments. She can’t remember where it came from, but it’s her only source of hope holding back the gloom that yearns to devour her soul. Trolls are covetous beasts, and when he spots her shiny bauble and steals it, Sophie faces two terrible options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay and suffer the wrath of a furious troll, or take her chances in a forest of her deepest fears.</description>

  <description>Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. Bayside Summers is a series of standalone steamy romance novels featuring alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, deeply emotional, always passionate, and easy to relate to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**BAYSIDE ESCAPE is a &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold on to your hat for Violet's wildly hot love story! Lizza is up to her old tricks again, and Violet is in for the surprise of a lifetime! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago Violet Vancroft was a nomadic artist who never wanted to put down roots and Andre Shaw was a prominent Boston physician whose roots ran too deep to unearth. Their love didn't stand a chance-or at least that's what Violet believed when she received a plea for help from the sister she'd never really known-so she snuck away like a thief in the night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Andre travels the world setting up new medical clinics, and Violet has finally found the family she'd always craved and the roots she'd never known she wanted. When their paths cross unexpectedly, it's not the reunion either one imagined. But they've never stopped loving each other, and after the dust of anger and hurt settles, passion ignites even hotter than before. As the end to Andre's time at the Cape nears, reality sets in, leaving them no closer to a future than they were before. Violet and Andre are forced to dig deep to discover if they're destined to live apart forever or if true love really can conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAYSIDE SUMMERS&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Desires&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Passions&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Heat&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Escape&lt;br /&gt;More Bayside books coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"​With her wonderful characters and resonating emotions, Melissa Foster is a must-read author!" -NYT Bestseller Julie Kenner​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Melissa Foster is synonymous with sexy, swoony, heartfelt romance!" -NYT Bestseller Lauren Blakely​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster.

Their love didn’t stand a chance—or at least that’s what Violet believed when she received a plea for help from the sister she’d never really known—so she snuck away like a thief in the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Andre travels the world setting up new medical clinics, and Violet has finally found the family she’d always craved and the roots she’d never known she wanted. When their paths cross unexpectedly, it’s not the reunion either one imagined. But they’ve never stopped loving each other, and after the dust of anger and hurt settles, passion ignites even hotter than before. As the end to Andre’s time at the Cape nears, reality sets in, leaving them no closer to a future than they were before. Violet and Andre are forced to dig deep to discover if they’re destined to live apart forever or if true love really can conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: BAYSIDE SUMMERS SERIES &lt;br /&gt;Sweet Love at Bayside &lt;br /&gt;Sweet Passions at Bayside &lt;br /&gt;Sweet Heat at Bayside &lt;br /&gt;Sweet Escape at Bayside &lt;br /&gt;More Bayside books coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW AVAILABLE for Binge Reading!

  <description>Fall in love with Addison Cole's rich and romantic storytelling, and discover the magic of the Montgomerys. The Corner of Heartbreak and Forever is a standalone novel featuring a fiercely loyal hero and a smart, sassy heroine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Corner of Heartbreak and Forever…&lt;br /&gt;Leaving New York City and returning to her hometown to teach a screenplay writing class seems like just the break Grace Montgomery needs. Until her sisters wake her at four thirty in the morning to watch the hottest guys in town train wild horses and she realizes that escaping her sisters’ drama-filled lives was a lot easier from hundreds of miles away. To make matters worse, she spots the one man she never wanted to see again—ruggedly handsome Reed Cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed was one of Michigan’s leading historical preservation experts, but on the heels of catching his girlfriend in bed with his business partner, his uncle suffers a heart attack. Reed cuts all ties and returns home to Oak Falls to run his uncle’s business. A chance encounter with Grace, his first love, brings back memories he’s spent years trying to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace is bound and determined not to fall under Reed’s spell again—and Reed wants more than another taste of the woman he’s never forgotten. When a midnight party brings them together, passion ignites and old wounds are opened. Grace sets down the ground rules for the next three weeks. No touching, no kissing, and if she has it her way, no breathing, because every breath he takes steals her ability to think. But Reed has other ideas…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Corner of Heartbreak and Forever is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a more explicit romance, pick up the steamy edition, Embracing Her Heart, written by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO AVAILABLE for your binge-reading pleasure, more fun, flirty, and romantic love stories. The Seaside and Bayside series are set in the quaint small towns of Cape Cod, and the Bradens feature fiercely loyal heroes and sassy heroines set in small towns and the big city--making them all, perfect beach reads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: SEASIDE SUMMERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;Read, Write, Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Dreaming at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Hearts at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Sunsets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Secrets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Nights at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Seized by Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Embraced at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Lovers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Whispers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: BAYSIDE SUMMERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Love at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Passions at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Heat at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Escape at Bayside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: WESTON BRADENS&lt;br /&gt;A Love So Sweet&lt;br /&gt;Our Sweet Destiny&lt;br /&gt;Unraveling the Truth About Love&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Loving Lacy&lt;br /&gt;Promise of a New Beginning&lt;br /&gt;And Then There Was Us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Addison Cole's stories are the perfect blend of sizzle and sweet.

  <description>Discover the magic of the Bradens, and fall in love with Addison Cole's rich and romantic storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Unraveling the Truth About Love…&lt;br /&gt;Small-town overachiever Riley Banks has finally scored her big break—working in Manhattan as a fashion design assistant for her childhood crush, Josh Braden. She enters her new job hoping to make a name for herself and—just maybe—explore the romance that slipped through her fingers way back when.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Braden has models at his beck and call, a staff that never says never, and an elegant clothing line for the holiday season. When he hires Riley Banks, he expects her to learn the business from the ground up. But the girl next door turns out to be much more than he remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Josh and Riley's friendship heats up, every steamy kiss, and every passionate caress stirs a love they cannot deny. But when Riley designs a wedding gown that would cause even the most jaded fashion editors to swoon, Riley's mentor accuses her of stealing the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing indisputable proof and the mistrust of her lover, Riley is not sure she can take the heat of life in the fast lane of the fashion industry—and Josh is forced to choose between the woman he loves and the career he adores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;Unraveling the Truth About Love is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a more explicit romance, pick up the steamy edition, Friendship on Fire, written by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster.

  <description>Hunted, shot, and without her memory, eighteen-year-old Ann Baker wakes in shallow water on a deserted Pacific Northwest island. She is soon approached by two young men claiming to be her friends. Something isn’t right, but when gunshots sound, Ann is left with little choice but to allow Devon and Archer to help her escape. Soon she finds herself in their North Bend mountain compound, where the higher evolved humans claim to be mind-readers. While Ann heals, she realizes they believe her to be one of the last and most powerful of all – The Lost One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s welcomed by most with opened arms, but not everyone is happy about her arrival. A jealous adversary has plans for Ann, which spirals the entire Reader community into chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As lies, murder, and betrayal threaten to rip apart the once harmonious mountain dwellers, Ann is thrust into making a decision that could save or devastate not only The Readers, but all of mankind. But there’s just one glitch: by doing so it may require her to make the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>Fall in love with Graham Braden and Morgyn Montgomery in TRAILS OF LOVE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Graham Braden travels to Oak Falls, Virginia to attend the wedding of his buddy Reed Cross to Grace Montgomery, he sticks around to help with renovations to Reed’s new theater. The last thing he expects is to be asked to assess and possibly invest in Grace’s sister Morgan’s business endeavor. Graham is a careful, keen businessman, and Morgyn is impulsive, disorganized, and more interested in the energy flow in her eclectic retail shop than in the accuracy of her records. While Graham isn’t ready to open his pockets to the sassy, sexy business owner, he may be ready to open his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bradens &amp;amp; Montgomerys are part of Melissa's Love in Bloom big-family romance collection. All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone and may also be enjoyed as part of the larger series, so dive right into this fun, sexy romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls). Order of future books is subject to change. &lt;br /&gt;Embracing Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;Anything For Love&lt;br /&gt;Trails of Love&lt;br /&gt;Our Wicked Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Searching for Love&lt;br /&gt;Wild Crazy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Summer of Love&lt;br /&gt;Hot For Love&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Sexy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Winter of Love&lt;br /&gt;Claiming Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note that future books in the original Montgomery series are crossing over to the Bradens at Pleasant Hill, and for this reason I have combined the series into THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Captivating and boldly imaginative, with a tale of sisterhood at its heart, Rena Rossner's debut fantasy invites you to enter a world filled with magic, folklore, and the dangers of the woods.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a remote village surrounded by vast forests on the border of Moldova and Ukraine, sisters Liba and Laya have been raised on the honeyed scent of their Mami's babka and the low rumble of their Tati's prayers. But when a troupe of mysterious men arrives, Laya falls under their spell-despite their mother's warning to be wary of strangers. And this is not the only danger lurking in the woods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As dark forces close in on their village, Liba and Laya discover a family secret passed down through generations. Faced with a magical heritage they never knew existed, the sisters realize the old fairy tales are true...and could save them all.</description>

  <description>After the end of her marriage, Kate Granger has retreated to her parents’ home on Lake Superior to pull herself together—only to discover the body of a murdered woman washed into the shallows. Tucked in the folds of the woman’s curiously vintage gown is an infant, as cold and at peace as its mother. No one can identify the woman. Except for Kate. She’s seen her before. In her dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hundred years ago, a love story ended in tragedy, its mysteries left unsolved. It’s time for the lake to give up its secrets. As each mystery unravels, it pulls Kate deeper into the eddy of a haunting folktale that has been handed down in whispers over generations. Now, it’s Kate’s turn to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the drowned woman reaches out from the grave, Kate reaches back. They must come together, if only in dreams, to right the sinister wrongs of the past.</description>

  <description>On January 15, 1947, the torture-ravished body of a beautiful young woman is found in a vacant lot. The victim makes headlines as the Black Dahlia—and so begins the greatest manhunt in California history. Caught up in the investigation are Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard: Warrants Squad cops, friends, and rivals in love with the same woman. But both are obsessed with the Dahlia—driven by dark needs to know everything about her past, to capture her killer, to possess the woman even in death. Their quest will take them on a hellish journey through the underbelly of postwar Hollywood, to the core of the dead girl's twisted life, past the extremes of their own psyches—into a region of total madness.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;CURSES. FORCED SERVITUDE. REBELLION.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Draekon conquered the human continent more than one thousand years ago. The powerful creatures are superior to their human subjects in every way, and they don't attempt to hide it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lissa Allaway is a healer in Caldiri, the poorest region in the continent. When she is recruited to the capital to serve the dominant beings, she is forced to reconsider what she thinks she knows about the beasts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are they truly the monsters from Lissa's childhood stories?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or was she misled about the draekon?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lissa is determined to get answers. But with the threat of a rebellion hanging overhead, she must tread carefully or risk incurring the wrath of the handsome, &lt;em&gt;but deadly&lt;/em&gt;, prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Discover the world of The Draekon Kingdom in &lt;strong&gt;Chosen: Curse of the Draekon Book One&lt;/strong&gt;. </description>

  <description>Finding a corpse buried with Native American artifacts wasn’t the first delay of the renovation Emily faced. But she was not prepared for what followed. A murder investigation, excavation to uncover more artifacts, and drug dealers looking for missing product further delay the mansion's restoration into an iconic B&amp;amp;B. While facing these setbacks, Emily is also realizing her growing attraction to a local chef, a man who believes a relationship isn't possible due to his commitment to care for his brain-injured brother.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not my cup of tea. From the synopsis I was really looking forward to reading this book, but like some reviewers I was having problems with how slow the story moved. I didn't finish, and I was disappointed that it didn't live up to it's promise.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;And they thought prison was hell…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a woman’s disappearance ticks off all the same boxes as two unsolved murders, Miami homicide detective Kelly Marsh is convinced there’s about to be a third. If she’s right and the killer sticks to their previous MO, she only has three days before Jenna Kelter’s decapitated head will show up somewhere in the city. With no time to waste, Kelly reaches out to the one person she knows can help: her former mentor and family friend Jack Harper, who just happens to lead a team with the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BAU special agent and profiler Brandon Fisher easily sees the similarities between Detective Marsh’s missing person case and the two cold cases: all three victims served time for DUI vehicular homicide and disappeared three days after being released from prison. But is that enough to assume Kelter has been abducted by a serial killer? Brandon’s not so sure and fears his boss may have let his personal connection to Marsh cloud his judgment. Surely there isn’t any other explanation for why they jumped into an investigation less than twenty-four hours after Kelter was reported missing. Then again, maybe Brandon is letting his own differences with the detective affect his perspective. He’ll need to move past it, though—and quickly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After all, this killer has evaded capture for the past six years, and they may be looking at a lot more victims than originally suspected. This serial killer is calling the shots and pulling them into a macabre game of cat and mouse. While the team has no choice but to play, if they don’t make the right moves, one of them may not make it out of Miami alive.</description>

  <description>She never knew what true love was.&lt;br /&gt;He’d never thought he’d love again.&lt;br /&gt;Can a fresh start and a Sweet Café provide healing recipe for love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria Tucker loves everything about her video game design job. Everything that is, except for the constant workplace harassment. When her grandfather dies, going home to grieve and regroup seems like the best option. She wants to keep her dream job, but not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Seiman isn't exactly sure how he wound up working at Sweet Blooms Café. He came in once to view his late wife's artwork on display, and now he's spent three years selling cupcakes and bouquets for the sweetest trio of little old ladies anyone could imagine. When his boss's granddaughter moves back home, he does everything he can to keep his distance and hold on to his wife’s memory, but every day with Victoria seems like a chance at a fresh start.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Ok and sweet</strong><br /><br />Reads more like a beta copy than a finished product. It's a sweet story but could use some polishing. The character development was fine, but the relationship didn't feel like it was built or growing. It was a very quick read with a lot of potential. Good way to kill a few hours.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Only Chrissy, a cute little Shih Tzu, can unlock this mystery!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Autumn Clarke survived the car crash that killed her parents. To help her cope with PTSD, she adopts Chrissy, a Shih Tzu with a remarkable secret. Chrissy is also the only witness to the mysterious death of her pet parent. Autumn vows to find the truth behind his death with the help of Chrissy, the neighbors and an attractive detective. Can Autumn unravel the clues while trying to heal Chrissy's trauma and overcome her own devastating emotional wounds in the midst of a dangerous murder investigation? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Chrissy the Shih Tzu may be the cutest sleuth on the job, but don't let that button nose fool you—it's perfectly able to sniff out a killer with a little help from her human friends. Great start to a fun new series!" &lt;br /&gt;--Sheila Webster Boneham, Author of the award-winning &lt;i&gt;Animals in Focus&lt;/i&gt; Mysteries &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Diane Wing does an excellent job of showing readers just how animals can communicate with us through images and actions when we are tuned into their frequency. Through the relationship between Autumn and Chrissy, Wing also shows the importance of therapy animals and how much they can help those who need them. Add in a sweet romance to the intrigue of the mystery and you've got a book that you won't want to put down." &lt;br /&gt;--Melissa Alvarez, Intuitive, animal communicator and author of &lt;i&gt;Animal Frequency&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Llewellyn's Little Book of Spirit Animals&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Diane Wing has created a wonderfully endearing little character in Chrissy the Shih Tzu. It really shines through that the author is an animal and dog lover. I can see these books quickly becoming a cherished addition to the cozy mystery genre." &lt;br /&gt;--J.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover the magic of the Bradens, and fall in love with Addison Cole's rich and romantic storytelling.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Sweet Destiny&lt;/i&gt; is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a spicier romance, pick up the steamy edition, &lt;i&gt;Destined for Love&lt;/i&gt;, written by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In OUR SWEET DESTINY...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ditching a troubled relationship—and her veterinary practice in the process—Jade Johnson returns to the safety of her small hometown and finally finds her footing. That is…until her horse is injured and the son of the man her father has been feuding with for more than forty years comes to her rescue. She’s spent forever trying to deny her attraction to headstrong, too-handsome-for-his-own-good cowboy Rex Braden. The last thing she needs is that particular man complicating her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely loyal Rex Braden has never put anyone or anything before his family. Despite the irate family history, sparks fly between Rex and Jade, unleashing fifteen years of stifled, forbidden love—causing the rebel in each of them to rear its powerful head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyalties are tested, and relationships are strained as Rex and Jade find out if true love really can conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: WESTON BRADENS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Love So Sweet&lt;br /&gt;Our Sweet Destiny&lt;br /&gt;Unraveling the Truth About Love&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Loving Lacy &lt;br /&gt;Promise of a New Beginning &lt;br /&gt;And Then There Was Us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALSO AVAILABLE for your binge-reading pleasure, &lt;/b&gt;more fun, flirty, and romantic love stories.

Although family loyalty is a strong theme, and the families don't exactly like each other, the resemblance ends there. This is much closer to a happier Romeo and Juliet (where the st...]]>

  <description>The small Montana town of Timberton tends to bring magic to the holidays, especially for guests of the local hotel. Resident artist and chef Mist has a way of touching people's lives with exquisite cuisine, imaginative art, and her own ethereal nature. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a nearby theatre burns down just before Christmas, cast members of The Nutcracker arrive at the Timberton Hotel with only a sliver of holiday joy. Camaraderie, compassion, and shared inspiration combine to help at least one hidden dream come true. As with every Christmas season in Timberton, this year's guests will face the New Year with a renewed sense of hope. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;*Recipes included!&lt;/i&gt;

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;A power that few have possessed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And a secret that will unleash it.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;He has a plan. He watches it unfold. And one by one, three lives crumble into dust. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flares of desperation divert the focus -- can Alex see through the fog of deception? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The killing season is just getting started. It's an evil too sadistic to fathom. Is there any way that Alex, Ozzie, and Ivy come out of this the same? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A brutal madness devours one life after another. But who's really behind this killing spree? Where does Alex fit in this nightmare? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a thirty-year-old secret emerges, the ties that bind people will be redefined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blood never had greater meaning for three people. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But is there enough trust to survive the terror? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get &lt;i&gt;AT Full Tilt&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redemption Thriller Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Suggested to read the books in the following order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Bay - RTS #1 &lt;br /&gt;AT Large - RTS #2 &lt;br /&gt;AT Once - RTS #3 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dawn - RTS #4 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dusk - RTS #5 &lt;br /&gt;AT Last - RTS #6 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivy Nash Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IN Defiance - RTS #7 &lt;br /&gt;IN Pursuit - RTS #8 &lt;br /&gt;IN Doubt - RTS #9 &lt;br /&gt;Break IN - RTS #10 &lt;br /&gt;IN Control - RTS #11 &lt;br /&gt;IN The End - book 12 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozzie Novak Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ON Edge - RTS #13 &lt;br /&gt;Game ON - RTS #14 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Rocks - RTS #15 &lt;br /&gt;Shame ON You - RTS #16 &lt;br /&gt;ON Fire - RTS #17 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Run - RTS #18 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Stake - RTS #19 &lt;br /&gt;AT Any Cost - RTS #20 &lt;br /&gt;Back AT You - RTS #21 &lt;br /&gt;AT Every Turn - RTS #22 &lt;br /&gt;AT Death's Door - RTS #23 &lt;br /&gt;AT Full Tilt - RTS #24 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scoop&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now you're probably aware that the Alex Troutt thrillers, Ivy Nash thrillers, and the Ozzie Novak thrillers are all under the same Redemption Thriller Series umbrella. Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WICKED WICKED LOVE is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After escaping abusive parents and, later, an abusive relationship, Sarah Beckley has spent a lifetime watching snakes shed their skin. With two small children to care for and another on the way, she's finally found a home in Peaceful Harbor with the brother she hasn't seen in more than a decade. She's still searching for her sister, but life is good. If only she could stop thinking about the sinfully sexy doctor/biker who has taken to her children like a loving uncle-and to her like a hungry man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust doesn't come easily for Sarah, but Bones Whiskey is patient and protective, amazing with her children, and he looks at her like she is the only woman he could ever want-and more. With two little ones underfoot, Sarah expects him to move on quickly, yet with every tender kiss and each trying moment with the children, Bones surprises her. But will the fiercely loyal biker stick around when Sarah's worst secret is revealed, or will he shed his skin, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more hot Whiskey love, check out Melissa's other Whiskey novels.&lt;br /&gt;TRU BLUE&lt;br /&gt;TRULY MADLY WHISKEY&lt;br /&gt;DRIVING WHISKEY WILD&lt;br /&gt;And don't miss RIVER OF LOVE, the first story in which the Whiskeys were introduced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whiskeys are perfect beach reads with depth of story, strong family ties, and a wealth of emotions. Small town love stories with happily ever afters guaranteed.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>2036 was the year that the ocean goddess Tiamat woke up and unleashed her wrath.&lt;br /&gt;Daily tsunamis.&lt;br /&gt;Sharks the size of merchant vessels.&lt;br /&gt;Humans survive by cluttering into mountaintop settlements. Cut off from natural resources, they only have one hope for survival.&lt;br /&gt;Us.&lt;br /&gt;The tsunami riders.&lt;br /&gt;Risks high and survival rates low, we ride at the peak of a mountain of water at five hundred miles an hour and love it. The rag-tag crew of the Ištar and I never miss a wave or lose a shipment container.&lt;br /&gt;But the ocean isn’t the only bitch we have to contend with.&lt;br /&gt;Admiral Parker wants to monopolize the trade routes with her state-of-the-art schooners, and she’s not opposed to taking out riders who won’t yield the wave. If she wins, all of the settlements in North America will live or starve at her say so.&lt;br /&gt;We’re not going to let that happen.&lt;br /&gt;Surf’s up, and as all tsunami riders know: you gotta catch the wave or die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book contains polyamory (one woman in a relationship with two men), non-explicit sex, and a lot of cussing.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Rogues, rapscallions, knaves, scoundrels, hellions, scallywags, blackguards, outcasts, and firebrands. They may be villains, but they're irresistible, and sometimes the right hero can steal their hearts and help them mend their wicked ways.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heiress to her Irish clan, spirited Temair O'Keeffe forsakes her destiny and instead joins a band of woodland outlaws who rob from the rich and give to the poor who've been impoverished by her greedy father. So when a powerful English knight, Sir Ryland de Ware, is sent by the newly crowned King John to form an alliance by wedding Temair, Ryland's first quest is to find his runaway bride. Independent Temair doesn't wish to be found, but she can't abandon her clan to a land-hungry foreigner. So she boldly waylays her bridegroom in the forest and holds him captive, demanding her rightful title as ransom, unaware the irresistible knight intends to earn her trust, steal her heart, and claim her as his prize.</description>

      <![CDATA[WOW I'm genuinely impressed. A lot of "scary" books are actually dull and slow paced. I must admit the most I was hoping for was a few spooky moments. This blew me out if the water. It's well paced and kept my heart racing. Definitely perfect for horror lovers.]]>

  <description>Collects Black Panther (1998) #1-17. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Panther reinvented as a sharp and witty political satire? Believe it! T’Challa is the man with the plan as Christopher Priest puts the emphasis on the Wakandan king’s reputation as the ultimate statesman, as seen through the eyes of the U.S. government’s Everett K. Ross. As the Panther investigates a murder in New York, Ross plays Devil’s Advocate in an encounter with Mephisto, and a new regime seizes control in Wakanda. When the truth behind the coup becomes clear, T’Challa finds himself an enemy of the state — and a major revelation threatens to destroy his relationship with the Avengers! Plus: Meet Queen Divine Justice — is she ready to join T’Challa’s deadly crew of female bodyguards, the Dora Milaje? Are they ready for her?</description>

  <description>Mistrust.&lt;br /&gt;It was all Adara did.&lt;br /&gt;Fear.&lt;br /&gt;It was all she ever knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adara Kerslake has kept her identity a secret from the Cynn Cruors for as long as she can remember. When Cynn Cruor warrior, Luke Griffiths, comes hurtling into her life, she flounders. Afraid of dealing with the Cynn Cruors and the man who captured her heart, she leaves, burning bridges in the process. Until a loved one forces her to rebuild those links that brings her back into the world she fought so hard to escape from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to the warrior whose passion haunts her every sleeping and waking moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke goes into a spiral after Adara leaves and it is only by the strength and love of his Cynn Cruor brethren and their women that keeps him from tripping into insanity. To forget her, he prepares to leave for the Ancients’ Faesten in Anglesey on a mission that can lead to his death and the banishment of the Manchester Cynn Cruors if he isn’t careful. When Adara returns, the last thing Luke wants is to get involved again. But he can’t stay away. What’s more, someone in the Ancients’ Faesten in Anglesey knows who she is and is out to get her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two missions merge to one. A desire to know the truth becomes entangled with the desire that never waned between Adara and Luke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a spectre from Adara’s past threatens them both…and brings in a new enemy for the Cynn Cruors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Although characters from other books in the series have cameo roles, this novel can be read as a standalone.</description>

Max is the perfect heroine - smart, sassy, who knows what she wants and refuses to take anything less. Treat has his work cut out to get to her very g...]]>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;It's the perfect system -- for the rich and powerful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But who has the guts to take them down?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is a slight shift in the tectonic plates and two thousand miles later, a tidal wave engulfs the Big Island. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This time, the deluge is in the form of greed and treachery. And many in the land of paradise will do anything to keep it hidden under the surface. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when severed limbs start rolling onto the shore, Alex has another thing in mind -- even when her heart is gutted. Despite the shock of a lifetime, Alex won't stop until someone pays the ultimate price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she be destroyed in the process? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get &lt;i&gt;AT Death's Door&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redemption Thriller Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Suggested to read the books in the following order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Bay - RTS #1 &lt;br /&gt;AT Large - RTS #2 &lt;br /&gt;AT Once - RTS #3 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dawn - RTS #4 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dusk - RTS #5 &lt;br /&gt;AT Last - RTS #6 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivy Nash Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IN Defiance - RTS #7 &lt;br /&gt;IN Pursuit - RTS #8 &lt;br /&gt;IN Doubt - RTS #9 &lt;br /&gt;Break IN - RTS #10 &lt;br /&gt;IN Control - RTS #11 &lt;br /&gt;IN The End - book 12 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozzie Novak Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ON Edge - RTS #13 &lt;br /&gt;Game ON - RTS #14 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Rocks - RTS #15 &lt;br /&gt;Shame ON You - RTS #16 &lt;br /&gt;ON Fire - RTS #17 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Run - RTS #18 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Stake - RTS #19 &lt;br /&gt;AT Any Cost - RTS #20 &lt;br /&gt;Back AT You - RTS #21 &lt;br /&gt;AT Every Turn - RTS #22 &lt;br /&gt;AT Death's Door - RTS #23 &lt;br /&gt;AT Full Tilt - RTS #24 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scoop&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now you're probably aware that the Alex Troutt thrillers, Ivy Nash thrillers, and the Ozzie Novak thrillers are all under the same Redemption Thriller Series umbrella. Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One wrong move, and she meets a guy with all the right ones…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talia Dalton lives her life on cruise control. Despite her successful career as a professor, she prefers protecting her broken heart to taking chances. She’s calm, cool, collected, and steady. Until the morning she takes her eyes off that familiar road and almost runs over the sexiest man she’s ever seen. It may not be the best way to start the day, but it might be the type of shake-up she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Male dancer Derek Grant has goals, and nothing is going to get in the way of achieving them. As a graduate student and the sole caretaker of his ailing father, he hasn’t much time for relationships. Then Talia crashes into his life. Sweet, pretty — and so buttoned-up that he can’t wait to help her cut loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Derek, falling in love was a beautiful accident waiting to happen. And it might be exactly what Talia needs — if she’s willing to let go of the past and embrace every surprise Derek has to offer.</description>

The stories were not very engaging, and unlike Sherlock Holmes stories did not leave the reader in suspense, dangling clues. They were short and undeveloped.

  <description>A THOUSAND-YEAR EPIC, A GALACTIC STRUGGLE, A MONUMENTAL WORK IN THE ANNALS OF SCIENCE FICTION &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION begins a new chapter in the story of man's future. As the Old Empire crumbles into barbarism throughout the million worlds of the galaxy, Hari Seldon and his band of psychologists must create a new entity, the Foundation-dedicated to art, science, and technology-as the beginning of a new empire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE describes the mighty struggle for power amid the chaos of the stars in which man stands at the threshold of a new enlightened life which could easily be destroyed by the old forces of barbarism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND FOUNDATION follows the Seldon Plan after the First Empire's defeat and describes its greatest threat-a dangerous mutant strain gone wild, which produces a mind capable of bending men's wills, directing their thoughts, reshaping their desires, and destroying the universe.</description>

  <description>Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. Bayside Summers is a series of standalone romance novels featuring fiercely loyal heroes and sassy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, and easy to relate to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drake Savage has always done the right thing, especially where beautiful and fiercely determined Serena Mallery is concerned—even when it means keeping his feelings for her to himself. Serena has always wanted more than what their small town of Wellfleet, Massachusetts has to offer, and Drake’s roots are so deeply entrenched in the Cape, it’s all he can do to watch her pack up her life and move away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serena has always had big dreams. As a teenager she dreamed of becoming an interior designer and marrying smart, musically inclined, sexy-as-sin Drake Savage. Now she’s finally landed a killer job with a top interior design firm, but though she has spent the last four years working side by side with Drake, he’s never made a move. Four years is long enough for her to accept reality, and her new job in Boston is the perfect way to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A weak moment leads to sizzling, sensual kisses, opening a door through which they’ve both been aching to walk. But Serena’s determined not to give up her shot at the career she’s always dreamed of, and Drake has loved her for too many years to stand in her way. With true love at their fingertips and a world of unstoppable passion igniting between them, can the two star-crossed lovers find their way to their happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sweet Heat at Bayside&lt;/i&gt; is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a spicier romance, pick up the steamy edition, &lt;i&gt;Bayside Heat&lt;/i&gt;, written by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.</description>

  <description> 
  &lt;strong&gt;When obsession crosses that thin line…&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;The crime scene was similar to the others -- but was Alex staring at something even more disturbing than the work of a noted serial killer? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex and her partner, Nick, piece together a convoluted puzzle. But how many pieces are missing? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Threats hit from all directions, including the legal kind. Just what Alex needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The deaths, brutal and violent beyond belief, show a pattern. And then another pattern. Is this the work of a copycat killer? If only it were that easy to figure out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The video hits. It rocks Alex's core -- her future forever altered. She pushes forward…only because the dead have no voice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And just when Alex can take no more, her world is shattered like never before. It just can't be. But it is, and she's all alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nothing will stop her from ending this obsession. No matter who gets in her way, there will be one final death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Alex live to see the next day? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Get &lt;i&gt;AT Every Turn&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redemption Thriller Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Suggested to read the books in the following order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Bay - RTS #1 &lt;br /&gt;AT Large - RTS #2 &lt;br /&gt;AT Once - RTS #3 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dawn - RTS #4 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dusk - RTS #5 &lt;br /&gt;AT Last - RTS #6 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivy Nash Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IN Defiance - RTS #7 &lt;br /&gt;IN Pursuit - RTS #8 &lt;br /&gt;IN Doubt - RTS #9 &lt;br /&gt;Break IN - RTS #10 &lt;br /&gt;IN Control - RTS #11 &lt;br /&gt;IN The End - book 12 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozzie Novak Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ON Edge - RTS #13 &lt;br /&gt;Game ON - RTS #14 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Rocks - RTS #15 &lt;br /&gt;Shame ON You - RTS #16 &lt;br /&gt;ON Fire - RTS #17 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Run - RTS #18 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Stake - RTS #19 &lt;br /&gt;AT Any Cost - RTS #20 &lt;br /&gt;Back AT You - RTS #21 &lt;br /&gt;AT Every Turn - RTS #22 &lt;br /&gt;AT Death's Door - RTS #23 &lt;br /&gt;AT Full Tilt - RTS #24 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scoop&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now you're probably aware that the Alex Troutt thrillers, Ivy Nash thrillers, and the Ozzie Novak thrillers are all under the same Redemption Thriller Series umbrella. Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>James Martin is a teacher, a powerful Psychic, and an alcoholic. He used to work for the Center for Magical Research and Development, a facility that houses people who can’t control their supernatural abilities, but left after one of his students was killed, turning to vodka to soothe his emotional pain. The problem is he still has one year left on his contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When James returns to the CMRD to fulfill the rest of his contract, he finds himself confronting the demons of his past and attempting to protect his new class from a possible death sentence, because if they don’t pass their final exams, they’ll be euthanized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James also discovers that his class isn’t bringing in enough sponsors, the agencies and world governments who supply grants and ultimately purchase graduates of the CMRD, and that means no profit for the facility. James and his students face impossible odds—measure up to the facility’s unreachable standards or escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word Count: 87300.</description>

  <description>Known by many names and with a wide array of characteristics Odin is a God who many people believe is just as active in the world today as he was a thousand years ago and more. A god of poetry he inspires us to create. A god of magic he teaches us to find our own power. A god of wisdom he challenges us to learn all we can. In this book you will find some of Odin's stories and history as well as anecdotes of what it can be like to honor him in the modern world.</description>

  <description>Fall in love in Sweet with Heat: Bayside Summers, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emery Andrews’s best friend, Desiree, moves away, falls in love, and opens an inn all in one summer, she feels her absence like a missing limb. Until she visits over the holidays and meets sinfully hot Dean Masters, who’s as easy on the eyes as he is to talk to. After returning home, what starts as a flurry of late-night flirtations quickly turns into a deep connection and unexpected friendship. Now, months later, Desiree offers Emery a job teaching yoga at the inn. Adventurous Emery jumps at the chance and heads for Wellfleet, Massachusetts, to reunite with her BFF and her new close friend, Dean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of sharing their lives, and their secrets, over video chats and phone calls, Dean’s ready to move things to the next level. The fact that Emery seems oblivious to the sparks between them and has recently put her foot down about dating friends just means he’ll have to bide his time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emery finds a man in her kitchen the first morning she’s there, Dean doesn’t hesitate to move her into his guest room. Maybe now Emery will see what’s right before her eyes–although that guy she’s got a date with might be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sweet Passions at Bayside&lt;/i&gt; is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a spicier romance, pick up the steamy edition, &lt;i&gt;Bayside Passions&lt;/i&gt;, written by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.</description>

  <description>Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. Bayside Summers is a series of standalone romance novels featuring fiercely loyal heroes and sassy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, and easy to relate to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Sweet Love at Bayside…&lt;br /&gt;As the co-owner of Bayside Resorts, Rick Savage has a fabulous job working with his best friends and brother, and a thriving business in Washington, DC, which he'll be returning to at the end of the summer. Spending time with his family is great, but being back on Cape Cod has unearthed painful memories. When sweet, smart, and overly cautious Desiree Cleary moves in next door, Rick is drawn to the sexy preschool teacher, and she just might prove to be the perfect distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running an art gallery was not in preschool teacher Desiree Cleary's plans, but after being tricked into coming to her impetuous, unreliable mother's aid, she's stuck spending the summer with the rebellious half sister she barely knows and a misbehaving dog. If that's not frustrating enough, she can't escape the sparks igniting with her strikingly handsome and pushy neighbor, Rick, who makes all her warning bells go off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion ignites as Desiree and Rick spend long summer nights sharing heartfelt confessions and steamy kisses. For the first time in years Rick is enjoying life again instead of hiding behind mounds of work miles away from his family. Desiree has touched him in a way that makes him want to slow down. Only slowing down means dealing with his demons, and he isn't sure who he'll be when he comes out the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sweet Love at Bayside&lt;/i&gt; is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a spicier romance, pick up the steamy edition, &lt;i&gt;Bayside Desires&lt;/i&gt;, written by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;The voice was altered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The painful truth was not.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;Alex gets a call no parent should ever hear. It's a dagger to her heart. But she can't afford to stop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced to carry out the wishes of the captors, Alex has to out-think new scum at every turn. It defiles her, but she'll do anything to get her daughter back. Will it work? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The treacherous journey is never-ending. Her life is threatened, but she brushes it off. The connection to her family member is still strong. But will she ever see her again? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An Amber Alert in San Antonio -- and Ivy Nash intercepts the assailant. But the story behind the story grabs her by the throat. Would a mother actually do such a thing, or is this simply a custody issue? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two paths intersect, and neither Alex nor Ivy will back down. They must save the lives of these young girls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The opioid crisis swallows people by the thousands. And those behind it slither around like snakes, using the addicted like they're animals on the end of a leash. Can anyone stop the cycle of abuse? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It all has to stop. One life at a time. One daughter at a time. Alex and Ivy will either succeed or die in the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who will make it out alive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in the end, could there be one shining moment? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get &lt;i&gt;Back AT You&lt;/i&gt; now!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redemption Thriller Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Suggested to read the books in the following order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Bay - RTS #1 &lt;br /&gt;AT Large - RTS #2 &lt;br /&gt;AT Once - RTS #3 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dawn - RTS #4 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dusk - RTS #5 &lt;br /&gt;AT Last - RTS #6 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivy Nash Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IN Defiance - RTS #7 &lt;br /&gt;IN Pursuit - RTS #8 &lt;br /&gt;IN Doubt - RTS #9 &lt;br /&gt;Break IN - RTS #10 &lt;br /&gt;IN Control - RTS #11 &lt;br /&gt;IN The End - book 12 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozzie Novak Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ON Edge - RTS #13 &lt;br /&gt;Game ON - RTS #14 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Rocks - RTS #15 &lt;br /&gt;Shame ON You - RTS #16 &lt;br /&gt;ON Fire - RTS #17 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Run - RTS #18 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Stake - RTS #19 &lt;br /&gt;AT Any Cost - RTS #20 &lt;br /&gt;Back AT You - RTS #21 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #22 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #23 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #24 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scoop&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now you're probably aware that the Alex Troutt thrillers, Ivy Nash thrillers, and the Ozzie Novak thrillers are all under the same Redemption Thriller Series umbrella. Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>Anything For Love is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Charlotte Sterling loses her last family member, she moves to Sterling House, her family’s Colorado mountain inn, to live a solitary life. As an erotic romance writer, her days and nights are filled with passion and intrigue—even if only fictional. She loves her busy, quiet lifestyle, and she learned early on that real men can’t live up to the fictional heroes she creates—until ruggedly handsome Beau Braden arrives to do some work at the inn and, for the first time in forever, she’s intrigued by a real man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau lost his first love years ago, and he’s never let go of his guilt over her death. As he nears the anniversary of his loss, he is on the cusp of becoming the star of a home-renovation reality show. Escaping the painful memories of his past to work at the defunct old inn is just the promise of solitude he needs to clear his head before diving in to the all-too-public career. But he didn’t count on being attracted to the whimsical, adorably sexy innkeeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither Charlotte nor Beau is looking for an attachment or a fling. But the more they learn about each other, the closer they become. Romantic evenings lead to intimate conversations, and neither can deny their deep connection or the passion it sparks. They’ve never fully healed on their own, but together maybe anything is possible.</description>

  <description>Geordie de la Rosa is a legend among wine lovers in Napa Valley. His ultra-fabulous style paired with a penchant for leading impromptu sing-a-longs has made him a star attraction at Conrad Winery. Co-owning a well-respected winery was never Geordie’s aspiration but he likes the niche he’s made for himself. He won’t deny that his job and his friends have helped ease his heartache and grief after the death of his longtime partner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levi Yeager excels at the art of reinventing himself. He’s been a minor league baseball player, a college coach and now a restaurant owner. The problem is he doesn’t know anything about the food business. And when his chef quits unexpectedly, he’s afraid his new venture is doomed. But Levi isn’t a quitter. It may be the only thing he has in common with the beautiful, sassy man from the neighboring winery who agrees to help get his new business up and running. Neither man counts on their fast friendship or the wild attraction they feel for each other. However, they know they won’t stand a chance until they let go of the past and lean into forever.</description>

  <description>Sweet with Heat: Seaside Summers features a group of fun, flirty, and emotional friends who gather each summer at their Cape Cod cottages. They’re sassy, flawed, and so easy to relate to, you’ll be begging to enter their circle of friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN WHISPERS AT SEASIDE...&lt;br /&gt;Having a mad crush on her boss’s son, Matt Lacroux—an intriguing mix of proper gentleman and flirtatious bad boy—is probably not the smartest idea for single mother Mira Savage. Especially when the company, and her job, is already on shaky ground. But as a Princeton professor, Matt’s life is hours away from Mira’s home on Cape Cod, keeping him safely in the fantasy-only zone. And as a single mother to six-year-old Hagen, with a floundering company to save, fantasies are all she has time for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With hopes of becoming dean off the table, and too many months of longing for a woman who lived too far away to pursue, Matt’s publishing contract couldn’t have come at a better time. He heads home to Cape Cod on a brief sabbatical, intent on starting his book, and finally getting his arms around sweet, beautiful Mira.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprise encounter leads to midnight confessions. The more time Matt and Mira spend together, the deeper their relationship grows, and the love and attention Matt showers on Hagen is more than she has ever dreamed of. But Matt’s sabbatical is only temporary, and Mira’s not saving his father’s company so she can leave it behind. Will their whispers of love be enough for one of them to change their life forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: SEASIDE SUMMERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;Read, Write, Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Dreaming at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Hearts at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Sunsets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Secrets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Nights at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Seized by Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Embraced at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Lovers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Whispers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whispers at Seaside&lt;/i&gt; is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a spicier romance, pick up the steamy edition, &lt;i&gt;Seaside Whispers&lt;/i&gt;, written by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The slayings are calculated and cold-blooded… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;…but it is deceit that has Alex staring into the face of death.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex goes off the books to finally get to the bottom of a group that has re-defined modern-day terrorism. Extortion, bombings, and assassinations have created fear inside and outside of the beltway -- all while being nearly invisible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex has no choice but to pull in Ozzie -- they only find more death. A young woman with so much hope…two bullets in the back of her head. How does she connect to all the other deaths in cities across the world? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex can only see one common thread: a blood-thirsty quest to obtain control. And that control will kill hundreds of thousands to pad the pockets of the group's leadership. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shots fly. Alex and Ozzie try to escape death. But how do all the pieces fit together? They can't. Not unless there's a betrayal that will turn Alex's world upside down -- just before she's shot in the face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You think you'll identify the Judas. But no one can predict how treacherous the mind becomes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is this the last day of Alex's life? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get AT Any Cost now!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redemption Thriller Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Suggested to read the books in the following order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Bay - RTS #1 &lt;br /&gt;AT Large - RTS #2 &lt;br /&gt;AT Once - RTS #3 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dawn - RTS #4 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dusk - RTS #5 &lt;br /&gt;AT Last - RTS #6 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivy Nash Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IN Defiance - RTS #7 &lt;br /&gt;IN Pursuit - RTS #8 &lt;br /&gt;IN Doubt - RTS #9 &lt;br /&gt;Break IN - RTS #10 &lt;br /&gt;IN Control - RTS #11 &lt;br /&gt;IN The End - book 12 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozzie Novak Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ON Edge - RTS #13 &lt;br /&gt;Game ON - RTS #14 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Rocks - RTS #15 &lt;br /&gt;Shame ON You - RTS #16 &lt;br /&gt;ON Fire - RTS #17 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Run - RTS #18 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AT Stake - RTS #19 &lt;br /&gt;AT Any Cost - RTS #20 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #21 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #22 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #23 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - RTS #24 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scoop&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now you're probably aware that the Alex Troutt thrillers, Ivy Nash thrillers, and the Ozzie Novak thrillers are all under the same Redemption Thriller Series umbrella. Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>Ancient Mariners is a dark coming-of-age revenge novel for adults and mature young adults. Beth, 14, and her crewmate, Silas, 45, have lost their families to violence. They sail the South Pacific, seeking solace for their grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beth Portman's parents died in a home fire four years ago, while Beth, then a normal, happy 14 year-old girl sails with Silas Tufts, an ex-Navy SEAL and family friend. With no other family, Beth stays with her best friend, Judy and her lecherous father. After a few uncomfortable months Judy asks Beth to leave and she's glad to go, beginning her coming-of-age journey to become anything but a "normal" teenager.&lt;br /&gt; Silas also lost his family to tragedy. He has roamed the sea for years fleeing his guilt and grief. Beth joins him on his sailboat, both seeking solace and peace. In Mexico, they believe they have found the new love and family they seek with a beautiful Mexican woman. Soon, though, tragedy forces Beth and Silas to sail into the South Pacific, wandering aimlessly.&lt;br /&gt; But Death, in the form of a black Albatross, has a task for them. Over the next four years Death surreptitiously guides their journey and prepares their bodies and minds for its mission. &lt;br /&gt; Beth's transformation begins with an attack in the Philippines that changes her life forever. In a beautiful Great Barrier Reef lagoon Beth saves a life, but another tragedy shows her and Silas Death's purpose.&lt;br /&gt; Pirates, butterfly poachers, a jungle spirit, and a merciless Hong Kong crime boss, are encountered on Beth and Silas's journey to an act of revenge that will set them free.</description>

  <description>Lost near lethal crevasses and cliffs in a blinding whiteout blizzard is the last place anyone would want to be… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Windy Corner on Denali has claimed lives, fingers, and toes. What would make someone brave lethal weather, crevasses, and slick ice to attempt to summit North America’s highest mountain? Denali has claimed over one hundred lives. It seems like the place for risky adrenaline seekers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this book, the author shares the lessons Denali teaches on managing goals and risks. Everyone takes chances at some time in their lives, even if it’s driving down the highway. Becoming a risk manager rather than a risk taker is what will keep you alive during difficult times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Experience the cold, solitude, and uncertainty of life on high mountains. Apply the message, build resilience, and overcome adversities in your life.</description>

  <description>In award-winning author Jeff Soloway’s timely new Travel Writer Mystery, Jacob Smalls sets sail for dangerous waters—a cruise headlined by the billionaire businessman who became president of the United States.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carlton Chomp, the notorious right-wing business tycoon and television personality, shocked the world by becoming the president—and then shocked it again by resigning after only two years in office. After months in exile, the ex-president is returning to public life by headlining a cruise to a private island in the Bahamas. Travel writer Jacob Smalls is assigned to review the cruise. He brings along an undercover ally: his mother. Together they plan to investigate the ultimate in political mysteries. Why did Chomp resign? And why is he making a comeback?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the day of the cruise, the departure city is enflamed with massive protests, counter-protests, and violence on both sides. When one of the ship’s passengers is found dead that evening, Jacob is faced with an even more urgent question: Was Chomp himself behind the murder, or was it one of his desperate political enemies? The search for the truth will take Jacob and his mother off the ship and into the dangerous tropical landscape of the cruiseline’s private island, where Chomp and his supporters will finally reveal what they’ve been planning all along.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Praise for The Travel Writer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Travel doesn’t just broaden the mind; it can also get you killed. Sassy, cynical Jacob Smalls is an ideal guide for journeying into unknown territories.”—Christopher Fowler, author of the Peculiar Crimes Unit Mystery series</description>

  <description>Landon can’t believe he’s let himself get roped into participating in a charity calendar, let alone one that features tastefully photographed nudes. The genius physicist is hardly model material, and he’s dreading the nude part of the photoshoot. Amid his reluctance, the one bright spot is his emails back and forth with the photographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Bailey turns out to be not exactly what Landon expects, and their first meeting is decidedly awkward. Bailey’s persistent though, and gradually Landon warms to the burly photographer, and they discover they have a shared love of gamer culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tentative friendship is born, but the road from friends to lovers isn’t easy. Landon’s battling past trauma and must decide how much of a risk he’s willing to take. A sexy connection may not be enough to keep them together unless both are willing to put their hearts on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Previously released as part of the EXPOSED anthology, and loosely linked to the #Gaymers universe, this friends-to-lovers, hurt/comfort story stands alone with a guaranteed happy ending. Contains a brief mention of a prior assault, but no on-screen violence or flashbacks.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I LOVE this collection. The mix of fantasy and paranormal and magic and steampunk and love is just beautiful. There's just enough sex to keep it spicy, but not so much that you need some...me time...between stories. The ideas are original and don't follow all the old expected tropes. Yes, there a...]]>

  <description>Every marriage has a secret, but this one is deadly. Lauren Stephens wakes up to find her husband, Gene, has vanished during the night. His phone is dead. Desperate, she hires Jake Wolfe and his war dog, Cody. They search the house and discover something so disturbing that Jake won't allow Lauren near it. "No, if you see this, there is no unseeing it."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren thought she had it all: a loving partner, two great kids, a successful business, and a beautiful home in the San Francisco hills. But all of that is about to come crashing down, due to a frightening secret that will shock a trusting wife to the core. Gene has enemies, and now they want something from Lauren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Wolfe is a flawed man who has a bad habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He wants to leave his secret, violent past behind him, but when Lauren and her children are threatened, his protective instinct takes command. Jake soon finds himself involved in a dangerous conspiracy, targeted for death, and engaged in battle with a powerful, unseen group who will stop at nothing to get what they want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake's going to have to think fast and fight hard to protect Cody, Lauren and her kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vigilante Assassin is Jake Wolfe book 2 in the ongoing series. It can be read as a stand-alone, or readers can start with book one, titled: Dead Lawyers Don't Lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these Kindle Unlimited books in the Jake Wolfe thriller series are available to read for free with your subscription to Kindle Unlimited.</description>

  <description>Author note - This book is edited in USA spelling and Grammar. These are not typos.

A necessity to her. That is until a promotion sends her straight into the presence of her young, super hot playboy billionaire boss and stuck as his right-hand man every waking moment of every single day. Like chalk and cheese, two people with no longing for love or complication this unusual pairing may either be just what she needs in her life or the absolute path to disaster. He is everything she is not, compulsive, confident, laid back, dominant and fun, with an ability to steamroller over her manicured ice maiden exterior. New love, overwhelming emotion and heartbreak. This tale will take you on a rollercoaster begging for more. Love-able sexy characters and deep emotional topics. Contains some mature, adult content and language.&lt;br /&gt;Book one in The Carrero Series.</description>

  <description>"This is a weird and wondrous book! Don't let the deceptively simple beginning fool you: there are clues planted throughout the novel suggesting nothing is quite what it seems. The ending is worthy of the best psychological thrillers. It still haunts me days later..." ~ Clarissa Harwood, author of Impossible Saints&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an award-winning novelist comes historical fiction with a psychological twist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When World War II drags Maggie Lerner’s husband off to Europe, Maggie joins the workforce as one of America’s Rosies. Though she savors her freedom, she is haunted by a dream that leads her to believe something terrible will happen to her husband. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the war, Sam returns home unscathed, and Maggie, who once again takes her place as a doctor’s wife, believes the dream will disappear. Instead, it evolves into an all-consuming world where Maggie is admired for her strength; where she can have whatever she wishes. Resenting her conventional life, she willingly surrenders to the temptation of imagined perfection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all is not as it seems. Beneath the dream’s flawless surface, a monster lies in wait. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an era of post-war feminism and the latest in psychoanalysis, Maggie will need to confront this evil—whether real or imagined—before it destroys both her worlds.</description>

  <description>Expanding his focus now, Kenneth Atchity adds a substantial new chapter, "Breaking into Show Business," and new material about recapturing the "high" of creativity and maintaining confidence despite setbacks. He shows you how to transform anxiety into "productive elation," how to separate vision from revision, and how to develop your own writing agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book, based on his writing seminars, research into dreams and creativity, and film development, is, as the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; states, "crammed with the sort of useful advice that it seems to take some people years to learn."</description>

  <description>David's business is a shambles. The trade in indulgences is dead and the bones of heretics smolder on the auto-da-fe'. All because of that mad monk, Martin Luther. What a prigg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David is a merchant of deceit, a poet of lies. A dwarf, he claims to be a prince of a lost tribe of Israel. Along with his manservant Diogo, an actor, the masquerade delights the citizens of Rome. The food and beds are warm, the ladies plump and willing. The Jews of Rome whisper that David is their Messiah. The time is right for Christendom to join a powerful desert tribe to rain down death and destruction on the Muslim Turks. How could Europe not prevail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In faraway France, a warlord struggles to regain his honor. He's the Duke of Bourbon, the victor in a great military conquest who has lost his family fortune. Bourbon turns traitor and joins his sworn enemy, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. But the mercenaries he enlists are unpaid, underfed, and poorly shod. The money to pay their wages is in Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richly researched and irreverent, this story weaves actual historical characters and institutions into a wry tale of three men, each on a quest for fame and fortune</description>

      <![CDATA[At first, I thought, how can you possibly mix historical fiction and comedy? It's such an odd combination...but it's a delightful one! Although greed and fame are the central themes of this story, it's so comical that one can't help but laugh at the desires that drive the main characters to such...]]>

  <description>One woman holds the fate of the country in her hands.&lt;br /&gt;Can she let her brother to die so the Confederacy might live?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Civil War grinds into its second year, an audacious and mysterious figure known only as the Lion of the South emerges from the shadows to rekindle the Confederacy's spirit of defiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Dandridge returns to the Virginia home where she was raised, only to discover that the war has changed everything—and everyone—once dear to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no one to turn to and nowhere to run, Julia is caught in a tangled web of secrets and deception. The only way to save her beloved brother from the hangman's noose is to unmask the Lion. But who is he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she finally discovers the enigmatic hero's true identity, Julia sets off on a desperate journey to stop the vengeful plot she unknowingly helped set in motion. But time is running out. The elusive Lion is walking straight into the Yankees' trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the danger, Julia is determined to save the two men whose lives hang in the balance—and redeem herself from the deadly mistake she has made.</description>

  <description>2018 INDEPENDENT PRESS AWARD, RELIGION FICTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE CORN is a story of genuine love, but also a story about the very human cost of nursing hatred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nell Dugan's hatred, as well as her love and determination, are indigenous to the Irish, both Protestant and Catholic, who bring to Revolutionary America their age-old grudges against longtime domination by the English crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Nell's wedding night in Ireland, English soldiers abduct her from the arms of her principled Scottish Lord and throw her on a ship, slave-fodder for a West Indies sugar plantation. But Nell uses her beauty and cunning to seduce the plantation owner's stoic son who sneaks her away to pre-revolutionary Philadelphia where she agrees to marry him, keeping secret her marriage to the Scottish lord she loves, and swearing to pay back the English not only for her own kidnapping but also for her mother's hanging two decades earlier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning in eighteenth century Ireland, and then set against the background of a burgeoning America, THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE CORN underscores the feistiness, heart-held faith, and courage of Scots Irish immigrants in their struggle toward individualism in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story is based on the life of the author’s eighth great-grandmother, who for ninety-nine years lived through it all. Of course, much is necessarily imagined. But England’s subjugation of Ireland’s people, the American Revolution, and some of the real players in both, are factually told.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A desperate attempt to survive, or the plot of a twisted killer?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bombs rip through the Boston Marathon crowd. Just like the last time, hysteria engulfs New England. Alex's injured partner clings to life, and she won't sleep until the culprit is found. Can she push her way on to the task force? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rumors swirl, but hard evidence is as elusive as an icy glacier. With her FBI team wrapped up in the formal investigation, Alex pulls in her newest confidante. Ozzie and Alex team up to quickly separate fact from fiction. But what seems right could be so very wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A brutal murder and robbery. Where is this hunt taking them? Could it be nothing more than a cover? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secrets from the past come to light, and that's when all bets are off. You think it's over, but it's not. Not by a long shot. The brains behind this crime aren't from this world, and Alex's family may not be able to escape the carnage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Alex handle losing another family member to a sick, twisted person? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The ties that bind people are impossible to detect…especially those with long-standing vendettas. It's a harrowing race to get to the killer…even as soldiers of death continue to make their mark on the city of Boston. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Alex survive the onslaught? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get AT Stake now!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redemption Thriller Series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Books should be read in the following order:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers: &lt;br /&gt;AT Bay - book 1 &lt;br /&gt;AT Large - book 2 &lt;br /&gt;AT Once - book 3 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dawn - book 4 &lt;br /&gt;AT Dusk - book 5 &lt;br /&gt;AT Last - book 6 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ivy Nash Thrillers: &lt;br /&gt;IN Defiance - book 7 &lt;br /&gt;IN Pursuit - book 8 &lt;br /&gt;IN Doubt - book 9 &lt;br /&gt;Break IN - book 10 &lt;br /&gt;IN Control - book 11 &lt;br /&gt;IN The End - book 12 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ozzie Novak Thrillers: &lt;br /&gt;ON Edge - book 13 &lt;br /&gt;Game ON - book 14 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Rocks - book 15 &lt;br /&gt;Shame ON You - book 16 &lt;br /&gt;ON Fire - book 17 &lt;br /&gt;ON The Run - book 18 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alex Troutt Thrillers: &lt;br /&gt;AT Stake - book 19 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - book 20 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - book 21 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - book 22 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - book 23 &lt;br /&gt;TBD - book 24 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Scoop&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By now you're probably aware that the Alex Troutt thrillers, Ivy Nash thrillers, and the Ozzie Novak thrillers are all under the same Redemption Thriller Series umbrella. Why? Because, ultimately, they all connect -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. How? That's part of the mystery that I'm slowly unveiling throughout the Redemption Thriller Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through each sub-series, characters from different books appear in the other novels. If it adds suspense, intrigue, or even a good laugh, I've included a cross-over character -- it's a lot more fun that way. Plus -- and here's the real kicker -- the final six novels will bring all of the major characters together -- Alex, Ivy, Ozzie. It will be explosive and gut-wrenching…in a way that will leave you breathless.</description>

  <description>Even though Nell felt right at home as the palm reader at Scotland’s Baillie Castle, a romantic bed and breakfast, her own love life fell short. Surrounded daily by married and engaged couples, Nell enjoyed her independence, though there was this one sweet crush she had on a fantasy knight in shining armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her delightful end of summer is shoved into a powerful hurricane of mystery when an evil druid battles for her service, throwing her into nightmares and catatonic trances. Will her infatuation with the professional knight rescue her from the darkness or is he entrenched with the dreaded Druid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hurricane reaches Category 5 intensity when a magic coin, the diva queen squad and a pair of witches collide at the castle. Will magic be enough to save Nell from a broken heart or cause certain death?</description>

  <description>"If you've ever wondered what the adjectives "rip-snorting" or "humdinger" mean, pick up The Chaos of Change by J.T. Riggen and you'll know." - Readers' Favorite Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"...Intense. Fast paced! A DEFINITE recommend!" - Author Viga Boland&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Political thriller writing at its best! A satisfying blend of fast-paced action and strong characterization makes for a fine story that's riveting, realistic, and hard to put down." - D. Donovan, Senior Reviewer, Midwest Book Reviews&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Riggen meticulously takes these characters and wraps them in both their pride and arrogance, before sending them off to dance to Death's tune." - Robin Goodfellow, Black Magic Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an explosive story!" - Author Kaylin McFarren&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second revolution...A second civil war...New-age American heroes will rise and fall...The struggle in the new world begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the imminent future: the American political gap is maximized; the individual states have begun clamoring for the disbandment of their federal government for its lack of stability; multiple power-hungry groups lick their chops at the thought of grabbing the reigns of the United States of America. And then a nation defining incident occurs, Article V of the U.S. Constitution is activated, and three sovereign territories come into existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this hardly bothers Thaddeus Jackson – the son of a popular former president – who had money, fame, and a promising career in politics…until he ran away to the Alaskan wilderness to live in peace away from his family and the growing civil unrest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What few know is that an elite group – led by Shane Wallace, Director of the CIA – has taken action. They recruit the very hesitant Thaddeus to be part of a diplomatic team tasked to negotiate the seemingly impossible peace between the liberal leaders of the North and his dysfunctional, republican family that now runs the South. The team includes Lozen Kyway, a highly-trained female agent turned bodyguard; Dr. Andreas Albrecht, a brilliant engineer and scientist who believes he’s discovered a truly sustainable, albeit dangerous, energy source; and Tomas Martinez, the former Vice President.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This elite group, and all its supporting team, will come together in a race against the clock to divert the territories away from war. New-age patriots will rise and fall, and new threats to democracy – never before imagined – will emerge from the shadows. Can the well-intentioned come together fast enough to ward off war in the states? Whose intentions are noble? Whose are full of malicious intent? Prepare yourself for an American era teeming with espionage, lies, murder, manipulation, and never ending hope...The Chaos of Change!</description>

  <description>ABOUT ALIGNING WITH THE DIVINE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are living in amazing times. Many people are awakening from their spiritual slumber and are seeking the deeper meanings of existence. Many are discovering that we are far more powerful than we have been led to believe--we are a direct reflection of creation; eternal beings of energy and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this time of great growth in human consciousness, now is the time to reclaim our power and to align with the divine. The wisdom shared within the pages of this book offers a simplified understanding of relatively difficult concepts. We hope these ideas will inspire you to join us on a path towards spiritual awareness and empowerment. We hope you travel well on this quest of awakening to your true power--the power that lies dormant within you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book will teach you about ancient principles that unlock some of the universe's best-kept secrets. It will serve you as you learn to cultivate compassion, to understand your fellow human beings more deeply, and to nurture your own inner peace and spiritual prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you read this book, you will learn, through simple, practical steps: &lt;br /&gt; - how to use the laws of physics to manifest a life of your choosing &lt;br /&gt; - how to understand the human body's energy systems &lt;br /&gt; - how to practice energy awareness and management &lt;br /&gt; - how to navigate your emotional state &lt;br /&gt; - how to love yourself on a deeper level&lt;br /&gt; - how to free yourself from sabotaging patterns that prevent your life from flowing in harmony with creation &lt;br /&gt; - how to become self-aware, and &lt;br /&gt; - how to create with emotion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By reading this book you will: &lt;br /&gt; - become more in tune with your intuition; your own direct connection with spirit &lt;br /&gt; - go deeply into your subconscious mind &lt;br /&gt; - challenge your borrowed beliefs, and &lt;br /&gt; - free yourself from the bondage of a limiting perspective. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book is a resource that you can turn to again and again to assist you in your sacred journey of exploration, experience, and spiritual expansion. We hope that this book will serve you in your awakening, empower you to connect directly to the divine, and lead you to your life's purpose. Fueled by the clarity of your intentions, may you pursue your dreams fearlessly and manifest abundantly!</description>

  <description>Embracing Her Heart is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Oak Falls, Virginia, home to horse farms, midnight rodeos, bookstores, coffee shops, and quaint restaurants where you’re greeted like family and treated like treasured guests. Buckle up for a wild ride. Like any Southern girls worth their salt, the sweet-talking, sharp-tongued Montgomery sisters can take men to their knees with one seductive glance or a single sugarcoated sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In EMBRACING HER HEART…&lt;br /&gt;Leaving New York City and returning to her hometown to teach a screenplay writing class seems like just the break Grace Montgomery needs. Until her sisters wake her at four thirty in the morning to watch the hottest guys in town train wild horses and she realizes that escaping her sisters’ drama-filled lives was a lot easier from hundreds of miles away. To make matters worse, she spots the one man she never wanted to see again—ruggedly handsome Reed Cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed was one of Michigan’s leading historical preservation experts, but on the heels of catching his girlfriend in bed with his business partner, his uncle suffers a heart attack. Reed cuts all ties and returns home to Oak Falls to run his uncle’s business. A chance encounter with Grace, his first love, brings back memories he’s spent years trying to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace is bound and determined not to fall under Reed’s spell again—and Reed wants more than another taste of the woman he’s never forgotten. When a midnight party brings them together, passion ignites and old wounds are opened. Grace sets down the ground rules for the next three weeks. No touching, no kissing, and if she has it her way, no breathing, because every breath he takes steals her ability to think. But Reed has other ideas…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;The Bradens &amp;amp; Montgomerys are part of Melissa's Love in Bloom big-family romance collection. All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone and may also be enjoyed as part of the larger series, so dive right into this fun, sexy romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls). Order of future books is subject to change &lt;br /&gt;Embracing Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;Anything For Love&lt;br /&gt;Trails of Love&lt;br /&gt;Our Wicked Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Searching for Love&lt;br /&gt;Wild Crazy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Summer of Love&lt;br /&gt;Hot For Love&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Sexy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Winter of Love&lt;br /&gt;Claiming Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note that future books in the original Montgomery series are crossing over to the Bradens at Pleasant Hill, and for this reason I have combined the series into THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love in Bloom features alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're flawed, funny, passionate, and relatable to readers who enjoy contemporary romance and women's fiction. Characters from each sub-series appear in future books. All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone without any unresolved issues or cliffhangers.</description>

  <description>Sweet with Heat: Seaside Summers features a group of fun, flirty, and emotional friends who gather each summer at their Cape Cod cottages. They're sassy, flawed, and so easy to relate to, you'll be begging to enter their circle of friends! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN LOVERS AT SEASIDE...&lt;br /&gt;After months of long-distance communication, actress Parker Collins and artist Grayson Lacroux finally plan to reconnect in the seaside town of Wellfleet, Massachusetts. But Parker never shows, and weeks pass without a word, leaving Grayson to believe he’s misinterpreted their budding relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parker has been running on autopilot ever since she lost her friend, mentor, and the only family she’s ever known, Bert Stein. Armed with junk food, tequila, and her big, lovable dog, she’s prepared to hole up and mourn—and determined to mend a fence Bert had never been able to with his estranged and bitter brother. But Parker didn’t count on the handsome artist she’s been fantasizing about for nearly a year walking in on her grief-induced drunken night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Grayson stumbles across Parker, he has no idea what to make of the gorgeous blonde who blew him off despite the chemistry between them. But that doesn’t stop him from feeling protective of the woman who’s consumed his thoughts for months, and when he learns of Parker’s plans to confront an angry old man, he refuses to leave her side. As Parker’s past unfolds, they’re led on an unexpected journey of discovery. Their connection deepens, until good intentions spark painful secrets, threatening the love they’ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET WITH HEAT: SEASIDE SUMMERS SERIES&lt;br /&gt;Read, Write, Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Dreaming at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Hearts at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Sunsets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Secrets at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Nights at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Seized by Love at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Embraced at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Lovers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;Whispers at Seaside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lovers at Seaside&lt;/i&gt; is a Sweet with Heat novel and conveys all of the passion you'd expect to find between two people in love without any graphic scenes or harsh language. If you're looking for a spicier romance, pick up the steamy edition, &lt;i&gt;Seaside Lovers&lt;/i&gt;, written by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Melissa Foster. Addison Cole is Melissa's sweet-romance pen name.</description>
