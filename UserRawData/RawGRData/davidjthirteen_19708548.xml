  <description>For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.</description>

  <description>John F.D. Taff's epic apocalypse of terror, &lt;i&gt;The Fearing&lt;/i&gt;, continues in &lt;i&gt;Book Two: Water &amp;amp; Wind&lt;/i&gt; when a group of battle-worn seniors pick up the pieces of their ravaged lives and grapple with survival after the end of the world. And for the first time, they begin to notice an ominous pattern in the deluge of fears now roaming the earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenagers Kyle, Sarah and Carli sift through the devastation of their lost lives to find anything resembling hope for a future. But when Carli goes missing, the stakes get higher as the search for her takes a diabolical turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the enigmatic Adam retains his tight-fisted grip on his submissive minion Jelnik as a series of unspeakable horrors follow in their wake as the two men travel west toward their dark destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey Matter Press: Where Dark Thoughts Thrive.</description>

  <description>Adaptation approved by the author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;i&gt;World War Z: The Complete Edition (Movie Tie-in Edition): An Oral History of the Zombie War&lt;/i&gt; is a new version of Max Brooks' episodic zombie novel. The abridged versions of the original stories are now joined with new, unabridged recordings of the episodes that were not included in the original (abridged) version of the audiobook. These additional episodes feature a star-studded cast of narrators to coincide with the upcoming release of the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New narrators include Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese, &lt;i&gt;Spiderman&lt;/i&gt; star Alfred Molina, &lt;i&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/i&gt; creator Frank Darabont, rapper Common, Firefly star Nathan Fillion, &lt;i&gt;Shaun of the Dead'&lt;/i&gt;s Simon Pegg, and members of the casts of &lt;i&gt;Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Heroes&lt;/i&gt; and more! Max Brooks will be reprising his role as The Interviewer. &lt;br /&gt;The original abridged edition, released in 2006, won an Audie Award for Best Multi-Voiced Performance. Original cast members include Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, Carl &amp;amp; Rob Reiner, and John Turturro. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this new classic of apocalyptic fiction that feels all too real, the Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. The documentary-style oral history records the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring five more hours of previously unrecorded content, this full-cast recording is read by F. Murray Abraham, Alan Alda, René Auberjonois, Becky Ann Baker, Dennis Boutsikaris, Bruce Boxleitner, Max Brooks, Nicki Clyne, Common, Denise Crosby, Frank Darabont, Dean Edwards, Mark Hamill, Nathan Fillion, Maz Jobrani, Frank Kamai, Michelle Kholos, John McElroy, Ade M’Cormack, Alfred Molina, Parminder Nagra, Ajay Naidu, Masi Oka, Steve Park, Kal Penn, Simon Pegg, Jürgen Prochnow, Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, Henry Rollins, Jeri Ryan, Jay O. Sanders, Martin Scorsese, Paul Sorvino, David Ogden Stiers, Brian Tee, John Turturro, Eamonn Walker, Ric Young, and Waleed Zuaiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

An enigmatic man who thrives on despair and embraces all fear. A man with his own dark and sinister goals. Someone who wants to ensure humanity goes out with the biggest bang possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proudly presented by Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher.

  <description>Who was Molly Southbourne? What did she leave behind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A burnt-out basement. A name stained in blood. Bodies that remember murder, one of them left alive. A set of rules that no longer apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly Southbourne is alive. If she wants to survive, she’ll need to run, hide, and be ready to fight. There are people who remember her, who know what she is and what she’s done. Some want her alive, some want her dead, and all hold a piece to the puzzles in her head. Can Molly escape them, or will she confront the bloody history that made her?</description>

      <![CDATA[Going into The Survival of Molly Southbourne I was excited to see where Thompson would take Molly next, but a little worried it might prove to be an unnecessary sequel or worse tarnish my memory of the first book, which stunned and amazed me. Happily, the follow-up is as good as book one. Althoug...]]>

  <description>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. As the Shadow of Mordor grows across the land, the Companions of the Ring have become involved in separate adventures. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, has joined with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and took part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by Orcs, escaped into Fangorn Forest and there encountered the Ents. Gandalf has miraculously returned and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Sam has left his master for dead after a battle with the giant spider, Shelob; but Frodo is still alive -- now in the foul hands of the Orcs. And all the while the armies of the Dark Lord are massing as the One Ring draws ever nearer to the Cracks of Doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 CDs.</description>

  <description>When David Caine, a celebrated skeptic of the supernatural, is invited by an old friend to spend a month in “the most haunted house in Virginia,” he believes the case will be like any other. But the Alexander House is different. Built by a 1700s land baron to contain the madness and depravity of his eldest son, the house is plagued by shadows of the past and the lingering taint of bloodshed. David is haunted, as well. For twenty-two years ago, he turned away the woman he loved, and she took her life in sorrow. And David suspects she’s followed him to the Alexander House.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by The Hobbit, and begun in 1937, The Lord of the Rings is the saga of the great War of the Rings. As he crafted the alphabets, languages, and landscapes of Middle-earth, Tolkien created one of the most popular and imaginative works in English literature. The Two Towers is the second volume of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. In this splendid, unabridged audio production of Tolkien’s great work, all the inhabitants of a magical universe— hobbits, elves, and wizards—step colorfully forth from the pages. Rob Inglis’ narration has been praised as a masterpiece of audio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Lucy Minor is the resident odd duck in the hamlet of Bury. He is a compulsive liar, a sickly weakling in a town famous for begetting brutish giants. Then Lucy accepts employment assisting the majordomo of the remote, foreboding Castle Von Aux. While tending to his new post as undermajordomo, he soon discovers the place harbours many dark secrets, not least of which is the whereabouts of the castle's master, Baron Von Aux. Thus begins a tale of polite theft, bitter heartbreak, domestic mystery, and cold-blooded murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undermajordomo Minor&lt;/em&gt; is an ink-black comedy of manners, an adventure, and a mystery, and a searing portrayal of rural Alpine bad behaviour, but above all it is a love story. And Lucy must be careful, for love is a violent thing.</description>

      <![CDATA[Undermajordomo Minor most closely resembles a children’s story written for adults, with its simple prose, fairy-tail logic, graphic scenes (such as an S&amp;M orgy), and an overall focus on death. If this seems like a strange combination, it is, and I find myself torn between the book’s positives...]]>

The tale of an Indian film star and a Bombay expatriate, Rushdie's masterpiece was deservedly honored with the Whitbread Prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: recordedbooks.com</description>

  <description>We each inhabit many worlds, often at the same time. From worlds on the inside, to the world on a cosmic scale. Worlds imposed on us, and worlds of our own making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In time, though, all worlds will end. Bear witness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After the death of their grandmother, two cousins return to their family’s rural homestead to find a community rotting from the soul outward, and a secret nobody dreamed their matriarch had been keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The survivors of the 1929 raid on H.P. Lovecraft’s town of Innsmouth hold the key to an anomalous new event in the ocean, if only someone could communicate with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The ultimate snow day turns into the ultimate nightmare when it just doesn’t stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An extreme metal musician compels his harshest critic to live up to the hyperbole of his trolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With the last of a generation of grotesquely selfish city fathers on his deathbed, the residents of the town they doomed exercise their right to self-determination one last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As history repeats itself and the world shivers through a volcanic winter, a group gathers around the shore of a mountain lake to once again invoke the magic that created the world’s most famous monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Skidding Into Oblivion, his fifth collection, award-winning author Brian Hodge brings together his most concentrated assortment yet of year’s best picks and awards finalists, with one thing in common:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the end of the world as we know it . . . and we don’t feel fine at all.</description>

      <![CDATA[This has to be one of the best single-author short story collections I have ever read. Brian Hodge’s writing really lands in the sweet spot for me and every tale in this volume hit the mark. These stories are beautifully written with a deep sense of character and emotion.

  <description>Jeff looked over his shoulder back to the hidden pigpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearl was all he could see. Pearl. Sitting on his ass like a person might, his front hooves limp at the sides of his belly, his head was cocked slightly to the side, his pink ears straight high above his head. His bad eye looked dark, hidden, but his good one was fixed on Jeff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it, Jeff saw an intelligence that scared him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A half smile appeared under the pig's snout, or maybe it was just the way his lips naturally curled up at their ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff fingered the latch. Pearl watched him. Staring. Assessing. Planning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff pulled his fingers away. A streak of shame ran down his back, like he'd come close to letting something very bad out of the pen...</description>

  <description>Four hundred years from now mankind is strung out across a region of interstellar space inherited from an ancient civilization discovered on Mars. The colonies are linked together by the occasional sublight colony ship voyages and hyperspatial data-casting. Human consciousness is digitally freighted between the stars and downloaded into bodies as a matter of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some things never change. So when ex-envoy, now-convict Takeshi Kovacs has his consciousness and skills downloaded into the body of a nicotine-addicted ex-thug and presented with a catch-22 offer, he really shouldn¿t be surprised. Contracted by a billionaire to discover who murdered his last body, Kovacs is drawn into a terrifying conspiracy that stretches across known space and to the very top of society.</description>

      <![CDATA[Altered Carbon is a good example of hard boiled cyberpunk. It’s filled with techno jargon and gadgets, tough detective, femme fatales, a convoluted murder mystery, and lots of philosophizing on the nature of life. These are all things a reader will expect based on the sub-genre and the book blurb...]]>

  <description>Trevor Noah, one of the comedy world's fastest-rising stars and host of The Daily Show, tells his wild coming-of-age story during the twilight of apartheid in South Africa and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. In this Audible Studios production, Noah provides something deeper than traditional memoirists: powerfully funny observations about how farcical political and social systems play out in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;"Nelson Mandela once said, 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.' He was so right. When you make the effort to speak someone else's language, even if it's just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, 'I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being.'" (Trevor Noah)&lt;br /&gt;Attuned to the power of language at a young age - as a means of acceptance and influence in a country divided, then subdivided, into groups at odds with one another - Noah's raw, personal journey becomes something extraordinary in audio: a true testament to the power of storytelling. With brutal honesty and piercing wit, he forgoes an ordinary reading and, instead, delivers something more intimate, sharing his story with the openness and candor of a close friend. His chameleon-like ability to mimic accents and dialects, to shift effortlessly between languages including English, Xhosa, and Zulu, and to embody characters throughout his childhood - his mother, his gran, his schoolmates, first crushes and infatuations - brings each memory to life in vivid detail. Hearing him directly, you're reminded of the gift inherent in telling one's story and having it heard; of connecting with another, and seeing them as a human being.&lt;br /&gt;The stories Noah tells are by turns hilarious, bizarre, tender, dark, and poignant - subsisting on caterpillars during months of extreme poverty, making comically pitiful attempts at teenage romance in a color-obsessed world, thrown into jail as the hapless fall guy for a crime he didn't commit, thrown by his mother from a speeding car driven by murderous gangsters, and more.&lt;br /&gt;--audible.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 hrs &amp;amp; 50 mins</description>

  <description>J is a student at a school deep in a forest far away from the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; J is one of only twenty-six students, all of whom think of the school’s enigmatic founder as their father. J’s peers are the only family he has ever had. The students are being trained to be prodigies of art, science, and athletics, and their life at the school is all they know—and all they are allowed to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But J suspects that there is something out there, beyond the pines, that the founder does not want him to see, and he’s beginning to ask questions. What is the real purpose of this place? Why can the students never leave? And what secrets is their father hiding from them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, on the other side of the forest, in a school very much like J’s, a girl named K is asking the same questions. J has never seen a girl, and K has never seen a boy. As K and J work to investigate the secrets of their two strange schools, they come to discover something even more mysterious: each other.</description>

  <description>For most of her fourteen years, Tasha Davis has languished in the rural-suburban town of Skillute, Washington. Her parents offer plenty of comfortable—if stifling—emotional support, but what she needs is a best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her final year at Clark Middle School, Tasha meets a strange, new classmate. Briar Kenny is the self-styled rebel Tasha wants to be, and the Davises are the kind of close-knit family Briar covets. A moment of unexpected violence spawns a secret between the two girls and awakens a mystery from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown to Tasha and Briar, their secret also attracts something monstrous from a forgotten corner of Skillute. The town is haunted by its history, scarred with the lingering spirit of broken and scattered families, abandoned real estate ventures, and old scores never settled between neighbors. But there’s more to the place than memory and legend. Beneath the landscape something malignant rages, and it will stop at nothing to find a route into the physical world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover art and design by Mikio Murakami.</description>

  <description>Never before available on unabridged audio! Dexter's Michael C. Hall reads this classic horror story described by Publishers Weekly as the "most frightening novel Stephen King has ever written". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dr. Louis Creed takes a new job and moves his family to the idyllic, rural town of Ludlow, Maine, this new beginning seems too good to be true. Yet despite Ludlow's tranquility, there's an undercurrent of danger that lingers...like the graveyard in the woods near the Creeds' home, where generations of children have buried their beloved pets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the "pet sematary", there is another burial ground, one that lures people to it with seductive promises...and ungodly temptations. A blood-chilling truth is hidden there - one more terrifying than death itself and hideously more powerful. An ominous fate befalls anyone who dares tamper with this forbidden place, as Louis is about to discover for himself....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Datlow’s The Best Horror of the Year series is one of the best investments you can make in short fiction. The current volume is no exception.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Adventures Fantastic&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more than three decades, Ellen Datlow has been at the center of horror. Bringing you the most frightening and terrifying stories, Datlow always has her finger on the pulse of what horror readers crave. Now, with the tenth volume of the series, Datlow is back again to bring you the stories that will keep you up at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Encompassed in the pages of The Best Horror of the Year have been such illustrious writers as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Gaiman Kim Stanley Robinson Stephen King Linda Nagata Laird Barron Margo Lanagan And many others &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With each passing year, science, technology, and the march of time shine light into the craggy corners of the universe, making the fears of an earlier generation seem quaint. But this light creates its own shadows. &lt;i&gt;The Best Horror of the Year&lt;/i&gt; chronicles these shifting shadows. It is a catalog of terror, fear, and unpleasantness as articulated by today’s most challenging and exciting writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>At the end of a dark prairie road, nearly forgotten in the Kansas countryside, lies the Finch House. For years it has perched empty, abandoned, and overgrown--but soon the door will be opened for the first time in many decades. But something waits, lurking in the shadows, anxious to meet its new guests. &lt;br /&gt;When best-selling horror author Sam McGarver is invited to spend Halloween night in one of the country's most infamous haunted houses, he reluctantly agrees. At least he won't be alone; joining him are three other masters of the macabre, writers who have helped shape modern horror. But what begins as a simple publicity stunt soon becomes a fight for survival--the entity they have awakened will follow them, torment them, threatening to make them part of the bloody legacy of Kill Creek.</description>

  <description>Both seventeen. Both afraid. But both saying yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounded like the perfect first date: canoeing across a chain of lakes, sandwiches and beer in the cooler. But teenagers Amelia and James discover something below the water’s surface that changes their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s got two stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s got a garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the front door is open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a house at the bottom of a lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the teens, there is only one rule: no questions. And yet, how could a place so spectacular come with no price tag? While the duo plays house beneath the waves, one reality remains:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because a house is empty, doesn’t mean nobody’s home.</description>

  <description>In the 1990s, heavy metal band Dürt Würk was poised for breakout success -- but then lead singer Terry Hunt embarked on a solo career and rocketed to stardom as Koffin, leaving his fellow bandmates to rot in rural Pennsylvania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two decades later, former guitarist Kris Pulaski works as the night manager of a Best Western - she's tired, broke, and unhappy. Everything changes when she discovers a shocking secret from her heavy metal past: Turns out that Terry's meteoric rise to success may have come at the price of Kris's very soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This revelation prompts Kris to hit the road, reunite with the rest of her bandmates, and confront the man who ruined her life. It's a journey that will take her from the Pennsylvania rust belt to a Satanic rehab center and finally to a Las Vegas music festival that's darker than any Mordor Tolkien could imagine. A furious power ballad about never giving up, even in the face of overwhelming odds, &lt;em&gt;We Sold Our Souls&lt;/em&gt; is an epic journey into the heart of a conspiracy-crazed, paranoid country that seems to have lost its very soul...where only a girl with a guitar can save us all.</description>

      <![CDATA[This novel was incredible fun. I was really taken by how Hendrix consistently “went for it” and didn’t hold anything back. The horror is truly horrific and when things get weird, he owns it. I’m far from being a metal-head but loved how he wove the tropes and stereotypes of the music genre into t...]]>

  <description>Something’s happening to the girls on Denton Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the summer of 1980 in Cleveland, Ohio, and Phoebe Shaw and her best friend Jacqueline have just graduated high school, only to confront an ugly, uncertain future. Across the city, abandoned factories populate the skyline; meanwhile at the shore, one strong spark, and the Cuyahoga River might catch fire. But none of that compares to what’s happening in their own west side neighborhood. The girls Phoebe and Jacqueline have grown up with are changing. It starts with footprints of dark water on the sidewalk. Then, one by one, the girls’ bodies wither away, their fingernails turning to broken glass, and their bones exposed like corroded metal beneath their flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As rumors spread about the grotesque transformations, soon everyone from nosy tourists to clinic doctors and government men start arriving on Denton Street, eager to catch sight of “the Rust Maidens” in metamorphosis. But even with all the onlookers, nobody can explain what’s happening or why—except perhaps the Rust Maidens themselves. Whispering in secret, they know more than they’re telling, and Phoebe realizes her former friends are quietly preparing for something that will tear their neighborhood apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating between past and present, Phoebe struggles to unravel the mystery of the Rust Maidens—and her own unwitting role in the transformations—before she loses everything she’s held dear: her home, her best friend, and even perhaps her own body.</description>

      <![CDATA[Rust Maidens is one of the most original stories I’ve read in a long time. Kiste defies genre and convention, placing the novel in the gray zone between magical realism and modern fairy-tale, but yes, there is horror. Although, here the main horror doesn’t stem from the titular monsters but from...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this contemporary fantasy, the grieving biographer of a Victorian fantasist finds himself slipping inexorably into the supernatural world that consumed his subject.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American Charles Hayden came to England to forget the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Failed father, failed husband, and failed scholar, Charles hopes to put his life back together with a biography of Caedmon Hollow, the long-dead author of a legendary Victorian children's book, &lt;i&gt;In the Night Wood&lt;/i&gt;. But soon after settling into Hollow's remote Yorkshire home, Charles learns that the past isn't dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the neighboring village, Charles meets a woman he might have loved, a child who could have been his own lost daughter, and the ghost of a self he thought he'd put behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And in the primeval forest surrounding Caedmon Hollow's ancestral home, an ancient power is stirring. The horned figure of a long-forgotten king haunts Charles Hayden's dreams. And every morning the fringe of darkling trees presses closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Soon enough, Charles will venture into the night wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Soon enough he'll learn that the darkness under the trees is but a shadow of the darkness that waits inside us all.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This short novel was quite enchanting. Told as a callback to an old fairytale with characters set firmly in modern day, it follows a grieving and broken couple as they are drawn into an age-old mystery and actual fairy story. The language is lush and straddles antiquated and contemporary prose. I...]]>

  <description>A gripping, surprising, and sexy thriller with a big, pounding heart, &lt;i&gt;Blood Highway&lt;/i&gt; takes a seventeen-year-old girl on a brutal journey into adulthood on a road trip that threatens to kill her before she reaches the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rainy Cain, a tough, troubled high school senior, desperately wants to escape the confines of her life in Minneapolis. When her increasingly unstable mother suddenly commits suicide, Rainy thinks she has found her chance. Instead, her father, Sam—who she had always believed died before she was born—escapes from prison and abducts her, taking her on a cross-country trek in pursuit of millions of dollars that he believes her mother had kept from a botched robbery years earlier. On their heels the whole way is a young Minneapolis detective intent on bringing Rainy safely home. It is an odyssey that will test Rainy’s considerable instincts about sanity and madness, and keep readers turning pages till the twisty end.</description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code: little chalk stick figures they leave for one another as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing is ever the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out that his friends got the same message, they think it could be a prank . . . until one of them turns up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.</description>

Now in the present day, those events begin to resurface. This is an engrossing mystery filled with as many twists and turns as a carnival ride. One o...]]>

  <description>"This is every card in the horror deck, played by someone who knows the game better than most of us ever will."—Stephen Graham Jones, author of MONGRELS, AFTER THE PEOPLE LIGHTS HAVE GONE OFF, and THREE MILES PAST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"'Hell is other people,' Jean-Paul Sartre tells us. 'Especially the one we see in the mirror,' implicitly says Tim Waggoner. Both give us the theme of Waggoner's splendid Dark and Distant Voices.

Waggoner delivers a diversity of well composed stories, exploring many aspects of the horror genre. There was really very little here I disliked, but also nothing that gave me a thrill....]]>

  <description>An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is found in a town park. Eyewitnesses and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens. He is Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney soon add DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems ironclad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the investigation expands and horrifying answers begin to emerge, King’s propulsive story kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.</description>

  <description>The New Moral Order. A ferocious military dicatorship. A new, extreme detainment system in which the Tanks are the terrible instrument for a radical purge of society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni Corte, a young man full of hopes, gets the long sought role of Keeper of Tank 9, where he will spend a whole year. And so he starts walking a new path - inexorable, clastrofobic, unreal - on the darkest corners of the human soul, towards the pitch-black heart of the horrors living both inside and outside us.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

The Tank is a horror story that eschews the supernatural and delves into the real terror of what a totalitarian regime can be capable of. and could easily sit alongside Orwell’s 1984.

  <description>First he gave us &lt;i&gt;Little Deaths: The Definitive Edition&lt;/i&gt;. Then he unleashed his unique brand of pain in &lt;i&gt;The End in All Beginnings&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bram Stoker Award-nominated John F.D. Taff – modern horror’s King of Pain – returns with &lt;i&gt;Little Black Spots&lt;/i&gt;. Sixteen stories of dark horror fiction gathered together for the first time, exposing the delicate blemishes and sinister blots that tarnish the human condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a man who stumbles on a cult that glorifies spontaneous human combustion, to a disgraced nature photographer who applies his skills for a vile outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where a darkened city parking structure seems malevolently alive, and a Halloween costume has a husband seeing his wife in a disturbing new light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a ruined man sees far too much of himself in his broken family, and a mysterious bottle of liquid arrives with a deadly secret inside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Black Spots is a beacon shining its light into some of life's most shadowy corners, revealing the dark stains that spatter all mankind.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in a dangerous near future world, &lt;i&gt;The Book of M&lt;/i&gt; tells the captivating story of a group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man’s shadow disappears—an occurrence science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: the loss of all their memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max’s shadow disappears too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure.</description>

      <![CDATA[This novel has an amazing premise and a powerful opening, however the rest of the novel never fully actualizes the promise. Except for the story’s central couple (Ory and Maxine), the characters are only thinly sketched out. And there are a few integral characters that we barely see but are told...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every time she bleeds a murderer is born. Experience the horror of Tade Thompson's &lt;i&gt;The Murders of Molly Southbourne.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rule is simple: don't bleed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as Molly Southbourne can remember, she's been watching herself die. Whenever she bleeds, another molly is born, identical to her in every way and intent on her destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly knows every way to kill herself, but she also knows that as long as she survives she'll be hunted. No matter how well she follows the rules, eventually the mollys will find her. Can Molly find a way to stop the tide of blood, or will she meet her end at the hand of a girl who looks just like her?</description>

  <description>Theodore Papakostas lives a normal life. Holds down a day job. Struggles with his weight. With women, he’s more ‘miss’ than ‘hit.’ He’s humble – a far cry from the bullying behaviour of his childhood. Days long forgotten. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Almost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Something has caught wind of him. Something that warned Theo long ago that if their paths crossed again, Theo would not survive. And Theo’s world is turned into a waking nightmare: a struggle to stay ahead of the terror. Because all those years ago, sunset was just the beginning …but worse will come.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: This is an alternate-cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25185057-the-boy-in-the-woods" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Boy in the Woods&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IAfter a devastating accident takes Jess's parents, a cold and controlling uncle is the only family she has left. Ripping away everything she’s ever known, he takes her far from her home in the big city to live on the rural family estate. With a spoiled and stuck up older cousin the only other young person in the home, Jess struggles to adjust to her new life of loneliness and quiet isolation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While exploring the woods surrounding her home one day, she stumbles upon a mysterious boy. Desperate for a friend, she's instantly drawn to him, but he's deeply distrustful and wants nothing to do with her. Sneaking away to see him, she works hard to break through his walls and slowly gains his trust. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As time passes, their bond grows from forbidden friendship into something more, but the threat they'll be caught looms closer. How far will Jess have to go to protect the boy she's fallen in love with? Or will her uncle find out about them before she can escape his control? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Boy in the Woods is a mysterious and poignant coming of age novel set in the late 1950’s, with the same classic feel as A Little Princess and The Secret Garden. As one of the top ten most read historical fiction stories on the popular reading website Wattpad.com, it’s already loved by tens of thousands of readers. This compelling story is twice the length of the average young adult novel, and is appropriate for ages 14 to adult.</description>

It begins shortly after Jess loses both of her parents and is sent off to live with her tyrannical uncle. The story then fol...]]>

Picture if you will a collection of fairy tales, the old kind: dark and twisted. Only what if they aren't fantastical stories but family histories?...]]>

And who's that woman following her? The mystery behind what's happening to Amanda in &lt;i&gt;Come Closer&lt;/i&gt; is so frightening that it "ought to carry a warning to...readers."</description>

  <description>The Great God Pan" is a novella written by Arthur Machen. A version of the story was published in the magazine Whirlwind in 1890, and Machen revised and extended it for its book publication (together with another story, "The Inmost Light") in 1894. On publication it was widely denounced by the press as degenerate and horrific because of its decadent style and sexual content, although it has since garnered a reputation as a classic of horror. Machen’s story was only one of many at the time to focus on Pan as a useful symbol for the power of nature and paganism. The title was taken from the poem "A Musical Instrument" published in 1862 by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in which the first line of every stanza ends "... the great god Pan.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A short, irresistible, and bittersweet coming-of-age story in the vein of "Stranger Things" and "Stand by Me" about a group of misfit kids who spend an unforgettable summer investigating local ghost stories and urban legends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1980s Niagara Falls--a seedy but magical, slightly haunted place--Jake Baker spends most of his time with his uncle Calvin, a kind but eccentric enthusiast of occult artifacts and conspiracy theories. The summer Jake turns twelve, he befriends a pair of siblings new to town, and so Calvin decides to initiate them all into the "Saturday Night Ghost Club." But as the summer goes on, what begins as a seemingly lighthearted project may ultimately uncover more than any of its members had imagined. With the alternating warmth and sadness of the best coming-of-age stories, &lt;i&gt;The Saturday Night Ghost Club&lt;/i&gt; examines the haunting mutability of memory and storytelling, as well as the experiences that form the people we become.</description>

  <description>How to tell a shattered story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By slowly becoming everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By slowly becoming everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ministry of Utmost Happiness takes us on a journey of many years – the story spooling outwards from the cramped neighbourhoods of Old Delhi into the burgeoning new metropolis and beyond, to the Valley of Kashmir and the forests of Central India, where war is peace and peace is war, and where, from time to time, ‘normalcy’ is declared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anjum, who used to be Aftab, unrolls a threadbare carpet in a city graveyard that she calls home. A baby appears quite suddenly on a pavement, a little after midnight, in a crib of litter. The enigmatic S. Tilottama is as much of a presence as she is an absence in the lives of the three men who love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ministry of Utmost Happiness is at once an aching love story and a decisive remonstration. It is told in a whisper, in a shout, through tears and sometimes with a laugh. Its heroes are people who have been broken by the world they live in and then rescued, mended by love – and by hope. For this reason, they are as steely as they are fragile, and they never surrender. This ravishing, magnificent book reinvents what a novel can do and can be. And it demonstrates on every page the miracle of Arundhati Roy’s storytelling gifts.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a challenging book to rate. It is written with love, passion, and beauty, but suffers from serious flaws. It often feels like a notebook containing character studies, poems, and creative essays strung together by the device of a novel. But the plot isn’t fleshed out enough to bring cohesi...]]>

  <description>It’s only water, so why should we fear large bodies of it, such as the sea or the ocean? However, when you’re all alone, you realize how scary a place it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Devil and the Deep, award-winning editor Ellen Datlow shares an original anthology of horror that covers the depths of the deep blue sea. Whether its tales of murderous pirates who stalk the waters in search of treasure and blood, creatures that haunt the depths below―ones we’ve only seen in our nightmares, or storms that can swallow you whole, the open water can be a dangerous and terrifying place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With new stories from New York Times-bestsellers and award-winning authors such as Seanan McGuire, Christopher Golden, Stephen Graham Jones, and more, Devil and the Deep guarantees you’ll think twice before going back into the water.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The fate of New Orleans rests in the hands of a wayward grifter in this novel of gods, games, and monsters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The post–Katrina New Orleans of &lt;i&gt;The City of Lost Fortunes &lt;/i&gt;is a place haunted by its history and by the hurricane’s destruction, a place that is hoping to survive the rebuilding of its present long enough to ensure that it has a future. Street magician Jude Dubuisson is likewise burdened by his past and by the consequences of the storm, because he has a secret: the magical ability to find lost things, a gift passed down to him by the father he has never known—a father who just happens to be more than human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jude has been lying low since the storm, which caused so many things to be lost that it played havoc with his magic, and he is hiding from his own power, his divine former employer, and a debt owed to the Fortune god of New Orleans. But his six-year retirement ends abruptly when the Fortune god is murdered and Jude is drawn back into the world he tried so desperately to leave behind. A world full of magic, monsters, and miracles. A world where he must find out who is responsible for the Fortune god’s death, uncover the plot that threatens the city’s soul, and discover what his talent for lost things has always been trying to show him: what it means to be his father’s son.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Why is everyone talking about the ending of Sarah Pinborough's &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind Her Eyes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise is a single mom, a secretary, stuck in a modern-day rut. On a rare night out, she meets a man in a bar and sparks fly. Though he leaves after they kiss, she’s thrilled she finally connected with someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Louise arrives at work on Monday, she meets her new boss, David. The man from the bar. The very married man from the bar…who says the kiss was a terrible mistake but who still can’t keep his eyes off Louise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Louise bumps into Adele, who’s new to town and in need of a friend, but she also just happens to be married to David. David and Adele look like the picture-perfect husband and wife, but then why is David so controlling, and why is Adele so scared of him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Louise is drawn into David and Adele’s orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong, but Louise can’t guess how wrong―and how far a person might go to protect their marriage’s secrets.</description>

  <description>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; the second expedition ended in mass suicide, the third in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another. The members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within weeks, all had died of cancer. In &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt;, the first volume of Jeff VanderMeer's &lt;i&gt;Southern Reach Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, we join the twelfth expedition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain, record all observations of their surroundings and of one another, and, above all, avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.</description>

Annihilation resembles a sci-fi story of explorers encountering a strange new world, only instead of an alien planet, it’s our own or rather part of it that has been transformed into a place where nature and logic don’t work by the expected rules.

She can no longer trust her own mind, because she is convinced that her memories have somehow betrayed her, forcing her to question her very identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with her perception of reality, Imp must uncover the truth about an encounter with a vicious siren, or a helpless wolf that came to her as a feral girl, or neither of these things but something far, far stranger...</description>

  <description>Magically gifted aristocrats rule--and commoners are doomed to serve. But a rebellion threatens the old order. The dystopian trilogy that began with Gilded Cage and Tarnished City concludes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where the lower classes must endure ten years of forced service to unfairly advantaged, magically powered rulers, a teenage boy dreams of rebellion, his older sister yearns for love and knowledge, and a dangerous young aristocrat seeks to remake the world with his dark gifts. In Bright Ruin, the final book in the trilogy set in modern-day England, our heroes will lead a revolution that will transform--or destroy--the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two terrifying classics by “the best kept secret in contemporary horror fiction” (&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas Ligotti’s debut collection, &lt;i&gt;Songs of a Dead Dreamer&lt;/i&gt;, and his second, &lt;i&gt;Grimscribe&lt;/i&gt;, permanently inscribed a new name in the pantheon of horror fiction. Influenced by the strange terrors of Lovecraft and Poe and by the brutal absurdity of Kafka, Ligotti eschews cheap, gory thrills for his own brand of horror, which shocks at the deepest, existential, levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ligotti’s stories take on decaying cities and lurid dreamscapes in a style ranging from rich, ornamental prose to cold, clinical detachment. His raw and experimental work lays bare the unimportance of our world and the sickening madness of the human condition. Like the greatest writers of cosmic horror, Ligotti bends reality until it cracks, opening fissures through which he invites us to gaze on the unsettling darkness of the abyss below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One man’s thrilling journey through an enchanted world to find his wife, who has disappeared after seemingly committing an unforgiveable act of violence, from the award-winning author of the &lt;i&gt;The Devil in Silver&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Machine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apollo Kagwa has had strange dreams that have haunted him since childhood. An antiquarian book dealer with a business called Improbabilia, he is just beginning to settle into his new life as a committed and involved father, unlike his own father who abandoned him, when his wife Emma begins acting strange. Disconnected and uninterested in their new baby boy, Emma at first seems to be exhibiting all the signs of post-partum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles go far beyond that. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act—beyond any parent’s comprehension—and vanishes, seemingly into thin air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins Apollo’s odyssey through a world he only thought he understood to find a wife and child who are nothing like he’d imagined. His quest begins when he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to have information about Emma’s whereabouts. Apollo then begins a journey that takes him to a forgotten island in the East River of New York City, a graveyard full of secrets, a forest in Queens where immigrant legends still live, and finally back to a place he thought he had lost forever. This dizzying tale is ultimately a story about family and the unfathomable secrets of the people we love.</description>

  <description>When a young writer finds himself cornered by a beautiful widow in the waning hours of a late-night cocktail party, he seeks at first to escape, to return to his wife and infant son, but the tale she weaves, of her missing husband, a renowned English professor, and her lost stepson, a soldier killed on a battlefield on the other side of the world, of phantasmal visions, a family curse, and a house... the Belvedere House, a striking mansion whose features suggest a face, hidden just out of view, draws him in, capturing him. What follows is a deeply psychological ghost story of memory and malediction, loss and remorse.</description>

      <![CDATA[House of Windows is an unapologetic old-school ghost story — really old-school, fitting in with the supernatural tales of Dickens and Henry James more than it does with King and Koontz. Although this is largely a reflection of its structure and tone as the story deals with both themes that are un...]]>

  <description>"Long live the King" hailed Entertainment Weekly upon the publication of Stephen King's On Writing. Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported near-fatal accident in 1999 -- and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it -- fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>John Persons is a private investigator with a distasteful job from an unlikely client. He’s been hired by a ten-year-old to kill the kid’s stepdad, McKinsey. The man in question is abusive, abrasive, and abominable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s also a monster, which makes Persons the perfect thing to hunt him. Over the course of his ancient, arcane existence, he’s hunted gods and demons, and broken them in his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Persons investigates the horrible McKinsey, he realizes that he carries something far darker than the expected social evils. He’s infected with an alien presence, and he’s spreading that monstrosity far and wide. Luckily Persons is no stranger to the occult, being an ancient and magical intelligence himself. The question is whether the private dick can take down the abusive stepdad without releasing the holds on his own horrifying potential.</description>

The narration is done in an over-the-top tough-guy noir speak which will either appeal to readers or won’t.

  <description>Walking through his own house at night, a twelve-year-old thinks he sees another person stepping through a doorway. Instead of the people who could be there, his mother or his brother, the figure reminds him of his long-gone father, who died mysteriously before his family left the reservation. When he follows it he discovers his house is bigger and deeper than he knew. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house is the kind of wrong place where you can lose yourself and find things you'd rather not have. Over the course of a few nights, the boy tries to map out his house in an effort that puts his little brother in the worst danger, and puts him in the position to save them . . . at terrible cost.</description>

  <description>Danielle Cain is a queer punk rock traveller, jaded from a decade on the road. Searching for clues about her best friend’s mysterious and sudden suicide, she ventures to the squatter, utopian town of Freedom, Iowa. All is not well in Freedom, however: things went awry after the town’s residents summoned a protector spirit to serve as their judge and executioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danielle shows up in time to witness the spirit—a blood-red, three-antlered deer—begin to turn on its summoners. Danielle and her new friends have to act fast if they’re going to save the town—or get out alive.</description>

  <description>The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, "None of what’s going to happen is your fault." Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: "Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 9 hrs and 25 mins</description>

      <![CDATA[The Cabin at the End of the World is a novel that is far bigger than its physical dimensions. It’s not a long book. The story itself never goes beyond seven characters and one location but the concepts and possibilities it delves into are vast. Tremblay strikes deep at the core of everyone's wors...]]>

  <description>"Goblin is a mesmerizing, terrifying tight-rope walk." —CLIVE BARKER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Malerman has created a Derry for a new generation." —SARAH PINBOROUGH &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MAN IN SLICES: A young man wants to prove to his long-distance girlfriend that they have "legendary love," better than Vincent van Gogh, so he sends her more body parts than just his ear in the mail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KAMP: A man so horrified of encountering a ghost that he sets up a series of "ghost traps" all over his apartment, desperate to catch one before it can sneak up on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HUNTER! Big game hunter Neal Nash leaves his own meat-themed birthday bash to go hunting for Goblin's hallowed (and protected) Great Owl. But the North Woods are unkind at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRESTO: In the pages of Presto magazine, a young boy reads that his favorite magician, Roman Emperor, is coming to town. Problem is, Pete doesn't know that Emperor's magic is real, and his latest trick involves audience participation... a little boy volunteer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MIX-UP AT THE ZOO: Dirk Rogers works at both the Goblin Slaughterhouse and the Goblin Zoo, but the workload is really getting to him. Will he be able to separate the two jobs on the night he finally breaks down, or will the slaughterhouse and the zoo overlap in his cracked, dark mind? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HEDGES: A young girl finally reaches the end of Goblin's biggest tourist attraction, The Hedges. But what she finds there sparks a mad chase between the owner of the Hedges and the Goblin Police, through the streets of the rainy city and into the terrible North Woods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of Bird Box and Black Mad Wheel welcomes you to Goblin. May your night there be wet with rain, breathless with adventure, and filled with fright.</description>

  <description>Carol Evers is a woman with a dark secret. She has died many times . . . but her many deaths are not final: They are comas, a waking slumber indistinguishable from death, each lasting days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two people know of Carol’s eerie condition. One is her husband, Dwight, who married Carol for her fortune, and—when she lapses into another coma—plots to seize it by proclaiming her dead and quickly burying her . . . alive. The other is her lost love, the infamous outlaw James Moxie. When word of Carol’s dreadful fate reaches him, Moxie rides the Trail again to save his beloved from an early, unnatural grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the while, awake and aware, Carol fights to free herself from the crippling darkness that binds her—summoning her own fierce will to survive. As the players in this drama of life and death fight to decide her fate, Carol must in the end battle to save herself.</description>

  <description>Writing Madness is a new, massive collection of short fiction, novellas, and essays by Patrick McGrath. It features the complete contents of McGrath’s brilliant 1987 debut collection, Blood and Water and Other Tales, the three novellas of Ghost Town, six previously uncollected short stories, seven essays, and over 20 of McGrath’s insightful and engaging introductions and book reviews from over the years. &lt;br /&gt; For thirty years Patrick McGrath’s novels have received high critical acclaim worldwide, and won prizes internationally. Writing Madness is the first large-scale collection of McGrath’s short fiction and nonfiction, including the stories in Blood and Water and Other Tales, and Ghost Town: Tales of Manhattan Then and Now. Also included in this unique volume are a number of McGrath’s essays, introductions and book reviews, and several uncollected stories. An account of his childhood in the shadow of the walls of Britain’s largest top-security mental hospital, “A Boy’s Broadmoor,” is reprinted here, as is his astonishing account of a bizarre true-life tragedy, “Death of a Silent Twin.” Gorgeously illustrated by Harry Brockway, Writing Madness has both an introductory essay by Joyce Carol Oates, and an endnote by Danel Olson. The writer who first coined the term The New Gothic, and has been called by one critic “possibly the best gothic novelist ever,” is here published in a beautiful volume from Centipede Press, sure to become a treasured item on every collector’s bookshelf.</description>

  <description>A mysterious “fear disease” is scaring to death the citizens of Longzhou, China. Literally. Victims go insane or die frozen in terror, while survivors rant maniacally about demons infiltrating the city. But what’s really behind the sudden epidemic? To find the answer, Chief Inspector Luo Fei teams up with a controversial historian and a brilliant psychologist to track down the true source of the illness and halt the wave of horror that threatens the metropolis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the trio ventures to the primitive jungles and mountains of Yunnan, they’re haunted by tales of a seventeenth-century general whose demonic soul, said to have been sealed away in a vial of his blood, has been unleashed on the modern world. Now, trekking deep into the legendary Valley of Terror, they find themselves being stalked by someone—or something—daring them to uncover the truth. And as superstition, science, and history collide, their discovery could be as heart-stopping as fear itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A landscape of frozen darkness punctuated by grim, gray days. &lt;br /&gt;The feeling like a buzz in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The scrape of bone on bone. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Gallo saw the report on the news: a mass murderer leading police to his victims graves, in remote Dread's Hand, Alaska.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not even a town; more like the bad memory of a town. The same bit of wilderness where his twin brother went missing a year ago. As the bodies are exhumed, Paul travels to Alaska to get closure and put his grief to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the mystery is only beginning. What Paul finds are superstitious locals who talk of the devil stealing souls, and a line of wooden crosses to keep what's in the woods from coming out. He finds no closure because no one can explain exactly what happened to Danny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the more he searches for answers, the more he finds himself becoming part of the mystery. . .</description>

      <![CDATA[This is an engaging horror thriller that plays on the tropes of the devil in the woods to good effect. It was an entertaining page turner. Although, it fell short of being excellent.

  <description>A multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this "divinely inspired" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five "plural wives," several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.</description>

  <description>John Truby is one of the most respected and sought-after story consultants in the film industry, and his students have gone on to pen some of Hollywood's most successful films, including &lt;i&gt;Sleepless in Seattle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Scream,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Shrek&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Anatomy of Story&lt;/i&gt; is his long-awaited first book, and it shares all of his secrets for writing a compelling script. Based on the lessons in his award-winning class, Great Screenwriting, &lt;i&gt;The Anatomy of Story&lt;/i&gt; draws on a broad range of philosophy and mythology, offering fresh techniques and insightful anecdotes alongside Truby's own unique approach for how to build an effective, multifaceted narrative. Truby's method for constructing a story is at once insightful and practical, focusing on the hero's moral and emotional growth. As a result, writers will dig deep within and explore their own values and worldviews in order to create an effective story. Writers will come away with an extremely precise set of tools to work with--specific, useful techniques to make the audience care about their characters, and that make their characters grow in meaningful ways. They will construct a surprising plot that is unique to their particular concept, and they will learn how to express a moral vision that can genuinely move an audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundations of story that Truby lays out are so fundamental they are applicable--and essential--to all writers, from novelists and short-story writers to journalists, memoirists, and writers of narrative non-fiction.</description>

  <description>Nicholas is a would-be poet and video-store clerk with a weeping hole in his hand - weeping not blood, but a plasma of tears...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began with Nakota and her crooked grin. She had to see the dark hole in the storage room down the hall. She had to make love to Nicholas beside it, and stare into its secretive, promising depths. Then Nakota began her experiments: First, she put an insect into the hole. Then a mouse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now from down the hall, the black hole calls out to Nicholas every day and every night. And he will go to it. Because it has already seared his flesh, infected his soul, and started him on a journey of obsession - through its soothing, blank darkness into the blinding core of terror...</description>

      <![CDATA[Nearly 20 years-old, this novel still stands up as a pillar of the horror genre. It is extremely raw and delves into the truly weird territory of weird fiction. It is also perhaps the literary equivalent of lying in bed with a fever, halfway between wakefulness and nightmare. It reads like a diso...]]>

  <description>An ancient evil roams the desolate landscape of an America ravaged by nuclear war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is the Man with the Scarlet Eye, a malevolent force that feeds on the dark desires of the countless followers he has gathered into his service. His only desire is to find a special child named Swan—and destroy her. But those who would protect the girl are determined to fight for what is left of the world, and their souls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a wasteland born of rage, populated by monstrous creatures and marauding armies, the last survivors on earth have been drawn into the final battle between good and evil that will decide the fate of humanity....</description>

  <description>Two warring horror filmmakers are haunted by each other's work in this tense, chilling tale of dark artistic vision set in 1960s Hollywood. Gordon Ghastle and Allan Yule are promising young directors who help reshape the genre. But as their careers take off, will their need to outdo each other bring them to commit acts more macabre than what they commit to film? Told in intimate detail by their mutual cinematographer, Ghastle and Yule chronicles the rise and fall of two geniuses at the stormy height of their powers—and what happens when obsessions go too far. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Josh Malerman is the author of Bird Box and the songwriter for the band the High Strung. He lives in Ferndale, Michigan with his fiancee Allison Laakko. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Praise for Bird Box: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"This completely compelling novel contains a thousand subtle touches but no mere flourishes- it so well, so efficiently, so directly written I read it with real admiration. Josh Malerman does the job like a fast-talking, wised-up angel." -Peter Straub &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Immersive, mesmerizing, and deliciously dark- this the best kind of horror, where your imagination becomes your own worst enemy." -Jamie Ford &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Chilling and beautifully told. A must-read." -Hugh Howey, bestselling author of WOOL. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Hitchcockian. A notably strong study of modern psychological terror." -USA Today &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Startlingly fresh and potent." -Rue Morgue Magazine &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cover design by: Adil Dara</description>

  <description>Jon Padgett's &lt;i&gt;The Secret of Ventriloquism,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;named the Best Fiction Book of 2016 by &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rue Morgue Magazine&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; heralds the arrival of a significant new literary talent. With themes reminiscent of Shirley Jackson, Thomas Ligotti, and Bruno Schulz, but with a strikingly unique vision, Padgett's work explores the mystery of human suffering, the agony of personal existence, and the ghastly means by which someone might achieve salvation from both. A bullied child seeks vengeance within a bed's hollow box spring. A lucid dreamer is haunted by an impossible house. A dummy reveals its own anatomy in 20 simple steps. A stuttering librarian holds the key to a mill town's unspeakable secrets. A commuter's worldview is shattered by two words printed on a cardboard sign. An aspiring ventriloquist spends a little too much time looking at himself in a mirror. And a presence speaks through them all.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction by Matt Cardin &lt;br /&gt;The Mindfulness of Horror Practice &lt;br /&gt;Murmurs of a Voice Foreknown &lt;br /&gt;The Indoor Swamp &lt;br /&gt;Origami Dreams &lt;br /&gt;20 Simple Steps to Ventriloquism &lt;br /&gt;Infusorium &lt;br /&gt;Organ Void &lt;br /&gt;The Secret of Ventriloquism&lt;br /&gt;Escape to Thin Mountain</description>

  <description>The #1 internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Demonologist&lt;/i&gt; radically reimagines the origins of gothic literature’s founding masterpieces—&lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt;—in a contemporary novel driven by relentless suspense and surprising emotion. This is the story of a man who may be the world’s one real-life monster, and the only woman who has a chance of finding him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a forensic psychiatrist at New York’s leading institution of its kind, Dr. Lily Dominick has evaluated the mental states of some of the country’s most dangerous psychotics. But the strangely compelling client she interviewed today—a man with no name, accused of the most twisted crime—struck her as somehow different from the others, despite the two impossible claims he made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, that he is more than two hundred years old and personally inspired Mary Shelley, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Bram Stoker in creating the three novels of the nineteenth century that define the monstrous in the modern imagination. Second, that he’s Lily’s father. To discover the truth—behind her client, her mother’s death, herself—Dr. Dominick must embark on a journey that will threaten her career, her sanity, and ultimately her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusing the page-turning tension of a first-rate thriller with a provocative take on where thrillers come from, &lt;i&gt;The Only Child&lt;/i&gt; will keep you up until its last unforgettable revelation.</description>

  <description>Nobody expects to get turned into a vampire, especially a guy like Bob. Everybody hopes that if they somehow get transformed into a vampire, they will instantly become some kind of superhero vampire out of the movies. Bad news guys: not gonna happen. More likely than not, you're gonna be one of the poor clueless bastards hanging out on Thursday nights with Bob in his vampire support group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think you know what being a vampire is supposed to be like, but Bob is here to set you straight. He’s made it his personal mission to get answers about the reality of being a vampire. He’s been shot, stabbed, thrown off rooftops, survived bad coffee and endured crippling boredom - all in the name of answering the eternal question of what it means to be a vampire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you might be a vampire, this is the book for you.</description>

  <description>After attacking Devil’s Reef in 1928, the U.S. government rounded up the people of Innsmouth and took them to the desert, far from their ocean, their Deep One ancestors, and their sleeping god Cthulhu. Only Aphra and Caleb Marsh survived the camps, and they emerged without a past or a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government that stole Aphra's life now needs her help. FBI agent Ron Spector believes that Communist spies have stolen dangerous magical secrets from Miskatonic University, secrets that could turn the Cold War hot in an instant, and hasten the end of the human race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aphra must return to the ruins of her home, gather scraps of her stolen history, and assemble a new family to face the darkness of human nature.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The Cities of Dead: the highly anticipated third book in Alys Arden’s spellbinding The Casquette Girls series.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old World witches collide with the French Quarter’s strangest denizens, setting off events that could tear the fabric of the Natural and Supernatural worlds, and only the most elusive, mischievous Voodoo lwa hold the key to stopping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Adele struggles with her losses, Nicco’s secrets draw her closer, but Isaac questions Nicco’s motives and refuses to let go without a fight. While the coven works to make the streets safe from the Ghost Drinkers, Nicco’s family of vampires is ready to break the Saint-Germain curse at all costs and settle a centuries-old feud. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her loved ones and her cherished city, Adele must unearth New Orleans’s best-kept Voodoo secret and piece together fragments of history from sixteenth-century Spain—even if it means discovering secrets she never wanted to know. If she fails, she may lose her magic forever.</description>

  <description>"First rule. Never open your story with a corpse. It's a cliché. If you do it to be ironic, I'll throw your manuscript in your face."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greta didn't set out to solve a murder. But if the first thing you see when you come home after a long day at a lousy job is your own dead body, it can make even the most cynical non-starter in 1994 Seattle take an interest. Refusing to believe her dead eyes, the one-time theater editor at the city's least noteworthy periodical - now a bitter ghost haunting the streets and busways of the Emerald City - will happily break every rule of crime fiction to tell her story and prove she didn't die a lame-ass, suicidal Cobain imitator. If Greta manages to figure out who really killed her, in the process? That's just an extra shot in her overpriced espresso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hauntingly scary, darkly funny, and occasionally nostalgic, I Wish I Was Like You is one vengeful spirit's look at a city learning to embrace narcissism and the dead inhabitants who will always call it home.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of the hit literary horror debut Bird Box (”Hitchcockian.” —USA Today) comes a chilling novel about a group of musicians conscripted by the US government to track down the source of a strange and debilitating sound&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Danes—the band known as the “Darlings of Detroit”—are washed up and desperate for inspiration, eager to once again have a number one hit. That is, until an agent from the US Army approaches them. Will they travel to an African desert and track down the source of a mysterious and malevolent sound? Under the guidance of their front man, Philip Tonka, the Danes embark on a harrowing journey through the scorching desert—a trip that takes Tonka into the heart of an ominous and twisted conspiracy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in a nondescript Midwestern hospital, a nurse named Ellen tends to a patient recovering from a near-fatal accident. The circumstances that led to his injuries are mysterious-and his body heals at a remarkable rate. Ellen will do the impossible for this enigmatic patient, who reveals more about his accident with each passing day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part Heart of Darkness, part Lost, Josh Malerman’s breathtaking new novel plunges us into the depths of psychological horror, where you can’t always believe everything you hear.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;For readers of Joe Hill, Cormac McCarthy, and classic Anne Rice, a chilling tale of suspense and horror set deep in the Texas desert.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis Stillwell spends his nights searching out women in West Texas honky-tonks. What he does with them doesn’t make him proud, just quiets the demons for a little while. But his nights soon take a terrifying turn in a desert cantina, where Travis crosses paths with a mysterious pale-skinned girl in red boots. Come the morning, he wakes weak and bloodied in his cabover camper, no sign of a girl, no memory of the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle Gaskin spies the camper parked behind her rundown motel and offers the disheveled cowboy inside a few odd jobs to pay his board. Travis takes her up on the offer, if only to buy time, to lay low, to heal. By day, he mends the old motel, insinuating himself into the lives of Annabelle and her ten-year-old son. By night, in the cave of his camper, he fights an unspeakable hunger. Before long, Annabelle and her boy come to realize that this strange cowboy they’ve taken in is not what he seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half a state away, a grizzled Texas ranger is hunting Travis down for his past misdeeds, but what he finds will lead him to a revelation far more monstrous than he could ever imagine. A man of the law, he’ll have to decide how far into the darkness he’ll go for the sake of justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these lives converge on a dusty autumn night, an old evil will find new life—and new blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deftly written and utterly compelling, this is an atmospheric literary fiction debut perfect for fans of horror, psychological suspense, and Western fiction.</description>

      <![CDATA[Before I read this novel I’d heard two things about it: one, it was brilliant, and two, it was essentially a story about a serial killer turned into a vampire. This is a minor spoiler since the blurb hints strongly at this. It also turned me off the book as I could easily imagine what such a stor...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Cold Hand in Mine&lt;/i&gt; was first published in the UK in 1975 and in the US in 1977. The story &lt;i&gt;Pages from a Young Girl's Journal&lt;/i&gt; won Aickman the World Fantasy Award in 1975. It was originally published in &lt;i&gt;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction&lt;/i&gt; in 1973 before appearing in this collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cold Hand in Mine&lt;/i&gt; stands as one of Aickman's best collections and contains eight stories that show off his powers as a 'strange story' writer to the full, being more ambiguous than standard ghost stories. Throughout the stories the reader is introduced to a variety of characters, from a man who spends the night in a Hospice to a German aristocrat and a woman who sees an image of her own soul. There is also a nod to the conventional vampire story (&lt;i&gt;Pages from a Young Girl's Journal&lt;/i&gt;) but all the stories remain unconventional and inconclusive, which perhaps makes them all the more startling and intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The Swords &lt;br /&gt;• The Real Road to the Church &lt;br /&gt;• Niemandswasser &lt;br /&gt;• Pages from a Young Girl's Journal&lt;br /&gt;• The Hospice &lt;br /&gt;• The Same Dog &lt;br /&gt;• Meeting Mr. Millar &lt;br /&gt;• The Clock Watcher</description>

  <description>Four old university friends reunite for a hiking trip in the Scandinavian wilderness of the Arctic Circle. No longer young men, they have little left in common and tensions rise as they struggle to connect. Frustrated and tired they take a shortcut that turns their hike into a nightmare that could cost them their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost, hungry and surrounded by forest untouched for millennia, they stumble across an isolated old house. Inside, they find the macabre remains of old rites and pagan sacrifices; ancient artefacts and unidentifiable bones. A place of dark ritual and home to a bestial presence that is still present in the ancient forest, and now they’re the prey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the four friends struggle toward salvation they discover that death doesn’t come easy among these ancient trees...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A spellbinding and darkly humorous coming-of-age story about an unusual boy whose family lives on the fringes of society and struggles to survive in a hostile world that shuns and fears them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was born an outsider, like the rest of his family. Poor yet resilient, he lives in the shadows with his Aunt Libby and Uncle Darren, folk who stubbornly make their way in a society that does not understand or want them. They are mongrels, mixedblood, neither this nor that. The boy at the center of Mongrels must decide if he belongs on the road with his aunt and uncle, or if he fits with the people on the other side of the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ten years, he and his family have lived a life of late-night exits and close calls—always on the move across the South to stay one step ahead of the law. But the time is drawing near when Darren and Libby will know if their nephew is like them or not. And the close calls they’ve been running from for so long are catching up fast, now. Everything is about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compelling and fascinating journey, &lt;i&gt;Mongrels&lt;/i&gt; alternates between past and present to create an unforgettable portrait of a boy trying to understand his family and his place in a complex and unforgiving world. A smart and innovative story—funny, bloody, raw, and real—told in a rhythmic voice full of heart, Mongrels is a deeply moving, sometimes grisly novel that illuminates the challenges and tender joys of a life beyond the ordinary in a bold and imaginative new way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A short and entertaining book on the modern art of writing well by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Steven Pinker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is so much writing so bad, and how can we make it better? Is the English language being corrupted by texting and social media? Do the kids today even care about good writing? Why should any of us care?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Sense of Style&lt;/i&gt;, the bestselling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the twenty-first century, Pinker doesn’t carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Filled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>With nothing but the clothes on his back—and something horrific snapping at his heels—Jack Winter fled his rural Georgia home when he was still just a boy. Watching the world he knew vanish in a trucker’s rearview mirror, he thought he was leaving an unspeakable nightmare behind forever. But years later, the bright new future he’s built suddenly turns pitch black, as something fiendishly familiar looms dead ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jack, his wife Aimee, and their two small children survive a violent car crash, it seems like a miracle. But Jack knows what he saw on the road that night, and it wasn’t divine intervention. The profound evil from his past won’t let them die…at least not quickly. It’s back, and it’s hungry; ready to make Jack pay for running, to work its malignant magic on his angelic youngest daughter, and to whisper a chilling promise: I’ve always been here, and I’ll never leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country comfort is no match for spine-tingling Southern gothic suspense in Ania Ahlborn’s tale of an ordinary man with a demon on his back. Seed plants its page-turning terror deep in your soul, and lets it grow wild.</description>

  <description>People move to New York looking for magic and nothing will convince them it isn't there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Thomas Tester hustles to put food on the table, keep the roof over his father's head, from Harlem to Flushing Meadows to Red Hook. He knows what magic a suit can cast, the invisibility a guitar case can provide, and the curse written on his skin that attracts the eye of wealthy white folks and their cops. But when he delivers an occult tome to a reclusive sorceress in the heart of Queens, Tom opens a door to a deeper realm of magic, and earns the attention of things best left sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A storm that might swallow the world is building in Brooklyn. Will Black Tom live to see it break?</description>

  <description>Once a year, scoutmaster Tim Riggs leads a troop of boys into the Canadian wilderness for a three-day camping trip—a tradition as comforting and reliable as a good ghost story and a roaring bonfire. But when an unexpected intruder—shockingly thin, disturbingly pale, and voraciously hungry—stumbles upon their campsite, Tim and the boys are exposed to something far more frightening than any tale of terror. The human carrier of a bioengineered nightmare. An inexplicable horror that spreads faster than fear. A harrowing struggle for survival that will pit the troop against the elements, the infected ... and one another.</description>

      <![CDATA[A truly skin crawling horror novel. Nick Cutter builds a controlled experiment in terror, as a boy scout troop is stranded on island during a field trip along with a monstrous contagion. The desperation among the adolescent boys would be enough for a novel in itself. It has a slight ring of Lord...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed author of The Troop—which Stephen King raved “scared the hell out of me and I couldn’t put it down.…old-school horror at its best”—comes this utterly terrifying novel where The Abyss meets The Shining.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strange plague called the ’Gets is decimating humanity on a global scale. It causes people to forget—small things at first, like where they left their keys…then the not-so-small things like how to drive, or the letters of the alphabet. Then their bodies forget how to function involuntarily…and there is no cure. But now, far below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, deep in the Marianas Trench, an heretofore unknown substance hailed as “ambrosia” has been discovered—a universal healer, from initial reports. It may just be the key to a universal cure. In order to study this phenomenon, a special research lab, the Trieste, has been built eight miles under the sea’s surface. But now the station is incommunicado, and it’s up to a brave few to descend through the lightless fathoms in hopes of unraveling the mysteries lurking at those crushing depths…and perhaps to encounter an evil blacker than anything one could possibly imagine.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was incredibly addictive. Each chapter was like a perfect salty buttered piece of popcorn. Except instead of light and fluffy, they were all meat and substance.

  <description>On a split of land cut off by the Gulf, three Victorian summer houses stand against the encroaching sand. Two of the houses at Beldame are still used. The third house, filling with sand, is empty...except for the vicious horror which is shaping nightmares from the nothingness that hangs in the dank, fetid air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The McCrays and Savages, two fine Mobile families allied by marriage, have been coming to Beldame for years. This summer, with a terrible funeral behind them and a messy divorce coming up, even Luker McCray and little India down from New York are looking forward to being alone at Beldame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they won't be alone. For something there, something they don't like to think about, is thinking about them...and about all the ways to make them die.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winston Smith works for the Ministry of truth in London, chief city of Airstrip One. Big Brother stares out from every poster, the Thought Police uncover every act of betrayal. When Winston finds love with Julia, he discovers that life does not have to be dull and deadening, and awakens to new possibilities. Despite the police helicopters that hover and circle overhead, Winston and Julia begin to question the Party; they are drawn towards conspiracy. Yet Big Brother will not tolerate dissent - even in the mind. For those with original thoughts they invented Room 101 . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/i&gt; is George Orwell's terrifying vision of a totalitarian future in which everything and everyone is slave to a tyrannical regime.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S. Morgenstern classic, &lt;i&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/i&gt;. But as a grown-up he discovered that the boring parts were left out of good old Dad's recitation, and only the "good parts" reached his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Goldman does Dad one better. He's reconstructed the "Good Parts Version" to delight wise kids and wide-eyed grownups everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's it about? Fencing. Fighting. True Love. Strong Hate. Harsh Revenge. A Few Giants. Lots of Bad Men. Lots of Good Men. Five or Six Beautiful Women. Beasties Monstrous and Gentle. Some Swell Escapes and Captures. Death, Lies, Truth, Miracles, and a Little Sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it's about everything.</description>

  <description>There are a thousand stories in the land of Narnia, and the first is about to be told in an extraordinary motion picture, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the never-ending war between good and evil, The Chronicles of Narnia set the stage for battles of epic proportions. Some take place in vast fields, where the forces of light and darkness clash. But other battles occur within the small chambers of the heart and are equally decisive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journeys to the ends of the world, fantastic creatures, betrayals, heroic deeds and friendships won and lost -- all come together in an unforgettable world of magic. So join the battle to end all battles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second volume in&lt;br /&gt;The Chronicles of Narnia®&lt;br /&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narnia .... a land frozen in eternal winter ... a country waiting to be set free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four adventurers step through a wardrobe door and into the land of Narnia -- a land enslaved by the power of the White Witch. But when almost all hope is lost, the return of the Great Lion, Aslan, signals a great change ... and a great sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt; met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001). Unforgettable!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>16 CDs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his fortress tower in Mordor, the evil sorcerer Sauron sends forth a darkness that creeps across the enchanged land of Middle-earth. Men and elves and dwarves have raised armies in futile efforts to combat this evil. Great wizards have failed to keep it in check. Sauron's shadow threatens to engulf all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the peaceful, far-off Shire, a hobbit named Frodo Baggins holds a ring that may be the key to defeating Sauron. Joining together in a fellowship of his closest friends and a mix of unlikely allies, under the guidance of the wizard Gandalf, Frodo prepares for a perilous journey in a desperate quest that may be the only hope for restoring light to the land. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let master narrator Rob Inglis guide you through all the awesome beauty and terrifying evil of J.R.R. Tolkien's timeless world. This first part of the only completely unabridged recording of one of the most beloved stories of all time includes Tolkien's original Forward and Prologue to The Lord of the Rings.&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>Here is the first volume in George R. R. Martin’s magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GAME OF THRONES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;source: georgerrmartin.com</description>

  <description>Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of &lt;i&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/i&gt; who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from &lt;i&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide&lt;/i&gt; ("A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox—the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.</description>

  <description>'A narrative particle accelerator that zooms between Wild Turkey Whiskey and Bob Dylan, unicorn skulls and voracious librarians, John Coltrane and &lt;i&gt;Lord Jim&lt;/i&gt;. Science fiction, detective story and post-modern manifesto all rolled into one rip-roaring novel, &lt;i&gt;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&lt;/i&gt; is the tour de force that expanded Haruki Murakami's international following. Tracking one man's descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.'</description>

  <description>Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family - and would bring to fruition humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.&lt;br /&gt;A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt; won the first Nebula Award, share the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science-fiction.</description>

  <description>When the young members of a British acid-folk band are compelled by their manager to record their unique music, they hole up at Wylding Hall, an ancient country house with dark secrets. There they create the album that will make their reputation, but at a terrifying cost: Julian Blake, the group’s lead singer, disappears within the mansion and is never seen or heard from again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, years later, the surviving musicians, along with their friends and lovers—including a psychic, a photographer, and the band’s manager—meet with a young documentary filmmaker to tell their own versions of what happened that summer. But whose story is true? And what really happened to Julian Blake?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Lottery&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most terrifying stories written in this century, created a sensation when it was first published in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;. "Power and haunting," and "nights of unrest" were typical reader responses. This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites "The Lottery:" with twenty-four equally unusual stories. Together they demonstrate Jackson's remarkable range--from the hilarious to the truly horrible--and power as a storyteller.</description>

  <description>In 1961, the small town of Haven thought they'd gotten rid of their monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a series of child killings, Paul Greymore was caught carrying a wounded girl. His face, disfigured from a childhood accident, seemed to confirm he was the monster the community hoped to banish. With Paul in prison, the killings stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seventeen years, Haven was peaceful again. But Paul served his time and has now returned to Haven--the town where he grew up, and the scene of his alleged crimes. Paul insists he didn't commit those crimes, and several townspeople believe him including the local priest, a young boy named Denny, and his best friend Billy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble is, now that Paul is back home, the bizarre killings have started again--and the patterns match the deaths from Haven's past. If Paul isn't the killer, who is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or WHAT is? An unlikely band of adventurers attempts to uncover the truth, delving into long-hidden tunnels that might actually be inhabited by a strange, predatory creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven is a compelling horror epic in the spirit of It or Summer of Night, and a stunning debut novel from a gifted author who knows that the darkest horrors lurk inside human beings, even when there is a monster on the loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for Haven;&lt;br /&gt;"Haven is a big, generous, Stephen King-like small town boys vs. monster epic."&lt;br /&gt;— Stewart O'Nan, author of The Night Country and A Prayer for the Dying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A wonderfully entertaining ride, reminiscent of the Creature Features of yesteryear."&lt;br /&gt;— Sloane Kady, author of Irreparable Deeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Full of well-drawn characters and slow burn suspense, Tom Deady's Haven is a terrific dose of New England horror that harkens back to some of my favorite classic monster fiction from writers like Rick Hautala and Charles L. Grant. If you’re a fan of this sort of thing, you’ll know that’s damn high praise. Give it a read."&lt;br /&gt;— Christopher Golden, New York Times bestselling author of Snowblind and Dead Ringers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Haven is about scars, both literal and figurative; it's about second chances and broken memories. This is a great small-town horror novel—a bullet-read with deep characters and perfect pacing. Best of all, it's creepy as hell."&lt;br /&gt;— Rio Youers, author of Westlake Soul and Point Hollow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If coming-of-age novels with a bad-ass monster sound good to you… if mounting suspense with a true to life cast of characters peaks your interest…then Tom Deady’s HAVEN is right up your alley. Reminiscent of Charles L. Grant, HAVEN is a fun and nostalgic romp that brought me back to my own youth in small-town New England. And who doesn’t love a good monster tale?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; – John McIlveen, author of HANNAHWHERE, winner of the 2015 Drunken Druid Award and Stoker Award nominee.</description>

      <![CDATA[Haven won the Bram Stoker award for first novel and It truly represents what a first novel can be, good and bad. It’s filled with ambition, energy, and lots of heart. It is also clunky, uneven, filled with unpolished prose, and several plot holes. The story of a group of outsiders fighting a smal...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A corrupted city. A dark dream of power.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke is a prisoner, condemned for a murder he didn’t commit. Abi is a fugitive, desperate to free him before magic breaks his mind. But as the Jardines tighten their grip on a turbulent Britain, brother and sister face a fight greater than their own.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New alliances and old feuds will remake the nation, leaving Abi and Luke questioning everything – and everyone – they know. And as Silyen Jardine hungers for the forgotten Skill of the legendary Wonder King, the country’s darkest hour approaches. Freedom and knowledge both come at a cost. So who will pay the price?</description>

These themes involve privilege, abuse of power, and personal freedom and gives both books a dark hue, although things get even...]]>

  <description>In the spirit of John Carpenter's The Thing and Jacob's Ladder comes a terrifying, icebound thriller where nothing is quite what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badly battered by an apocalyptic storm, the crew of the Arctic Promise find themselves in increasingly dire circumstances as they sail blindly into unfamiliar waters and an ominously thickening fog. Without functioning navigation or communication equipment, they are lost and completely alone. One by one, the men fall prey to a mysterious illness. Deckhand Noah Cabot is the only person unaffected by the strange force plaguing the ship and her crew, which does little to ease their growing distrust of him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dismissing Noah's warnings of worsening conditions, the captain of the ship presses on until the sea freezes into ice and they can go no farther. When the men are ordered overboard in an attempt to break the ship free by hand, the fog clears, revealing a faint shape in the distance that may or may not be their destination. Noah leads the last of the able-bodied crew on a journey across the ice and into an uncertain future where they must fight for their lives against the elements, the ghosts of the past and, ultimately, themselves.</description>

  <description>Rosemary Woodhouse and her struggling actor husband Guy move into the Bramford, an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and mostly elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building, and despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, her husband takes a shine to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Rosemary becomes pregnant—and the Castavets start taking a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castavets' circle is not what it seems...</description>

  <description>The Great Lakes Horror Company presents this collection of 19 new and previously published horror stories from some of the best writers lurking on the chilling shores of the wild and wicked north. Cannibals, zombies, vampires, vengeful gods, psychotics and the supernatural are just a few of the terrifying things waiting for you in this collection featuring members of the Horror Writer's Association Ontario Chapter. Gathered here are award-winning best-selling authors, bold and bloody newcomers, and more than a few unhinged souls telling tales that will make your blood run cold. Illustrated by celebrated genre artists, Group Hex Vol. 1 transports you to the hungry shores of future worlds, to the heart of mystical planes, and to the rooms of what seem like perfectly normal suburban houses...but they aren't. And after reading these tales, you may never be the same again.</description>

  <description>A worldwide diaspora has left a quarter of a million people at the foot of a space station. Cultures collide in real life and virtual reality. The city is literally a weed, its growth left unchecked. Life is cheap, and data is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Boris Chong returns to Tel Aviv from Mars, much has changed. Boris’s ex-lover is raising a strangely familiar child who can tap into the datastream of a mind with the touch of a finger. His cousin is infatuated with a robotnik—a damaged cyborg soldier who might as well be begging for parts. His father is terminally-ill with a multigenerational mind-plague. And a hunted data-vampire has followed Boris to where she is forbidden to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rising above them is Central Station, the interplanetary hub between all things: the constantly shifting Tel Aviv; a powerful virtual arena, and the space colonies where humanity has gone to escape the ravages of poverty and war. Everything is connected by the Others, powerful alien entities who, through the Conversation—a shifting, flowing stream of consciousness—are just the beginning of irrevocable change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Central Station, humans and machines continue to adapt, thrive...and even evolve.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Central Station is a bit of a mixed bag, which is probably why it left me with mixed feelings. At its heart it is a collection of short stories about characters (not always human) living around the titular space port a few hundred years from now. However, this is presented as a novel and there is...]]>

  <description>Aging, self-absorbed rock star Judas Coyne has a thing for the macabre -- his collection includes sketches from infamous serial killer John Wayne Gacy, a trepanned skull from the 16th century, a used hangman's noose, Aleister Crowley's childhood chessboard, etc. -- so when his assistant tells him about a ghost for sale on an online auction site, he immediately puts in a bid and purchases it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black, heart-shaped box that Coyne receives in the mail not only contains the suit of a dead man but also his vengeance-obsessed spirit. The ghost, it turns out, is the stepfather of a young groupie who committed suicide after the 54-year-old Coyne callously used her up and threw her away. Now, determined to kill Coyne and anyone who aids him, the merciless ghost of Craddock McDermott begins his assault on the rocker's sanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can find an alternative cover edition for this ISBN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33805355-dracula" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34810834-dracula" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rich selection of background and source materials is provided in three areas: Contexts includes probable inspirations for Dracula in the earlier works of James Malcolm Rymer and Emily Gerard. Also included are a discussion of Stoker's working notes for the novel and "Dracula's Guest," the original opening chapter to Dracula. Reviews and Reactions reprints five early reviews of the novel. "Dramatic and Film Variations" focuses on theater and film adaptations of Dracula, two indications of the novel's unwavering appeal. David J. Skal, Gregory A. Waller, and Nina Auerbach offer their varied perspectives. Checklists of both dramatic and film adaptations are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criticism collects seven theoretical interpretations of Dracula by Phyllis A. Roth, Carol A. Senf, Franco Moretti, Christopher Craft, Bram Dijkstra, Stephen D. Arata, and Talia Schaffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Chronology and a Selected Bibliography are included.</description>

  <description>The critically acclaimed cult novelist makes visceral the terrors of life in Jim Crow America and its lingering effects in this brilliant and wondrous work of the imagination that melds historical fiction, pulp noir, and Lovecraftian horror and fantasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicago, 1954. When his father Montrose goes missing, twenty-two year old Army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New England to find him, accompanied by his Uncle George—publisher of The Safe Negro Travel Guide—and his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to the manor of Mr. Braithwhite—heir to the estate that owned Atticus’s great grandmother—they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the manor, Atticus discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by a secret cabal named the Order of the Ancient Dawn—led by Samuel Braithwhite and his son Caleb—which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that shockingly centers on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be the seed of his—and the whole Turner clan’s—destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chimerical blend of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse members of one black family, Lovecraft Country is a devastating kaleidoscopic portrait of racism—the terrifying specter that continues to haunt us today.</description>

  <description>The only trace of the first victim was his Shriner's fez washed up on the Miami beach. The second victim, the head of the city's chamber of commerce, was found dead with a toy rubber alligator lodged in his throat. And that was just the beginning... Now Brian Keyes, reporter turned private eye, must move from muckraking to rooting out murder, in a caper that will mix football players, politicians, and police with a group of fanatics and a very hungry crocodile.</description>

  <description>Xibalba, home of torture and sacrifice, is the kingdom of the lord of death. He stalked the night in the guise of a putrefied corpse, with the head of an owl and adorned with a necklace of disembodied eyes that hung from nerve cords. He commanded legions of shapeshifting creatures, spectral shamans, and corpses hungry for the flesh of the living. The Mayans feared him and his realm of horror. He sat atop his pyramid temple surrounded by his demon kings and demanded sacrifices of blood and beating hearts as tribute to him and his ghostly world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These legends, along with those that lived in fear of them, have been dead and gone for centuries. Yet now, a doorway has been opened in Georgia. A group of college students seek their missing professor, a man who has secretly uncovered the answer to one of history’s greatest mysteries. However, what they find is more than the evidence of a hidden civilization. It’s also a gateway to a world of living nightmares. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In upstate New York, in the woods around Woodstock, Dutchman’s Creek flows out of the Ashokan Reservoir. Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other’s company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It’s a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.</description>

  <description>Whoever is born here, is doomed to stay 'til death. Whoever settles, never leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Black Spring, the seemingly picturesque Hudson Valley town haunted by the Black Rock Witch, a 17th century woman whose eyes and mouth are sewn shut. Muzzled, she walks the streets and enters your homes at will. She stands next to your bed for nights on end. Everybody knows that her eyes may never be opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elders of Black Spring have virtually quarantined the town by using high-tech surveillance to prevent their curse from spreading. Frustrated with being kept in lockdown, the town's teenagers decide to break their strict regulations and go viral with the haunting, but in so doing send the town spiraling into the dark, medieval practices of the past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An all-new epic tale of terror and redemption set in the hinterlands of midcentury New Mexico from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Troop&lt;/i&gt;—which Stephen King raved “scared the hell out of me and I couldn’t put it down...old-school horror at its best.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From electrifying horror author Nick Cutter comes a haunting new novel, reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy's &lt;i&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/i&gt; and Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt;, in which a trio of mismatched mercenaries is hired by a young woman for a deceptively simple task: check in on her nephew, who may have been taken against his will to a remote New Mexico backwoods settlement called Little Heaven. Shortly after they arrive, things begin to turn ominous. Stirrings in the woods and over the treetops—the brooding shape of a monolith known as the Black Rock casts its terrible pall. Paranoia and distrust grips the settlement. The escape routes are gradually cut off as events spiral towards madness. Hell—or the closest thing to it—invades Little Heaven. The remaining occupants are forced to take a stand and fight back, but whatever has cast its dark eye on Little Heaven is now marshaling its powers...and it wants them all.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have seen many reviews call Little Heaven a throwback to classic horror and there is something wonderfully classic about it, except I can’t think of a single classic horror novel I’d compare it to. Sure there’s hints of KIng here and there and more than whiff of Lovecraft in the air, but this b...]]>

  <description>A contemporary gothic from an author in the company of Kelly Link and Aimee Bender, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Splitfoot&lt;/i&gt; tracks two women in two times as they march toward a mysterious reckoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruth and Nat are orphans, packed into a house full of abandoned children run by a religious fanatic. To entertain their siblings, they channel the dead. Decades later, Ruth’s niece, Cora, finds herself accidentally pregnant. After years of absence, Aunt Ruth appears, mute and full of intention. She is on a mysterious mission, leading Cora on an odyssey across the entire state of New York on foot. Where is Ruth taking them? Where has she been? And who — or what — has she hidden in the woods at the end of the road?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an ingeniously structured dual narrative, two separate timelines move toward the same point of crisis. Their merging will upend and reinvent the whole. A subversive ghost story that is carefully plotted and elegantly constructed, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Splitfoot&lt;/i&gt; will set your heart racing and your brain churning. Mysteries abound, criminals roam free, utopian communities show their age, the mundane world intrudes on the supernatural and vice versa.</description>

  <description>Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A groundbreaking work from a master, &lt;i&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/i&gt; is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.</description>

  <description>In me are the memories of a boy's life, spent in that realm of enchantments. These are the things I want to tell you.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert McCammon delivers "a tour de force of storytelling" (BookPage) in his award-winning masterpiece, a novel of Southern boyhood, growing up in the 1960s, that reaches far beyond that evocative landscape to touch readers universally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy's Life is a richly imagined, spellbinding portrait of the magical worldview of the young -- and of innocence lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zephyr, Alabama, is an idyllic hometown for eleven-year-old Cory Mackenson -- a place where monsters swim the river deep and friends are forever. Then, one cold spring morning, Cory and his father witness a car plunge into a lake -- and a desperate rescue attempt brings his father face-to-face with a terrible, haunting vision of death. As Cory struggles to understand his father's pain, his eyes are slowly opened to the forces of good and evil that surround him. From an ancient mystic who can hear the dead and bewitch the living, to a violent clan of moonshiners, Cory must confront the secrets that hide in the shadows of his hometown -- for his father's sanity and his own life hang in the balance....</description>

  <description>Two men rebel together against tyranny—and then become rivals—in this first sweeping book of an epic fantasy series from Ken Liu, recipient of Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy awards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wily, charming Kuni Garu, a bandit, and stern, fearless Mata Zyndu, the son of a deposed duke, seem like polar opposites. Yet, in the uprising against the emperor, the two quickly become the best of friends after a series of adventures fighting against vast conscripted armies, silk-draped airships, and shapeshifting gods. Once the emperor has been overthrown, however, they each find themselves the leader of separate factions—two sides with very different ideas about how the world should be run and the meaning of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of intrigue, intimate plots, and action will find a new series to embrace in the Dandelion Dynasty.</description>

      <![CDATA[For the longest time, I kept from reading Stephen King’s second novel because the TV mini-series had freaked me out when I was a kid (watched it way too young). As luck would have it, I finally got around to it a few short months after reading Stoker’s Dracula. King had intended it to build on th...]]>

Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon—both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle—are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . . </description>

If you’re a fan of Terry Pratchett and dry British humor the comedy element is on the money. There’s lots of amusing lines and witty obse...]]>

  <description>Experimental Film is a contemporary ghost story in which former Canadian film history teacher Lois Cairns-jobless and depressed in the wake of her son's autism diagnosis-accidentally discovers the existence of lost early 20th century Ontario filmmaker Mrs. A. Macalla Whitcomb. By deciding to investigate how Mrs. Whitcomb's obsessions might have led to her mysterious disappearance, Lois unwittingly invites the forces which literally haunt Mrs. Whitcomb's films into her life, eventually putting her son, her husband and herself in danger. Experimental Film mixes painful character detail with a creeping aura of dread to produce a fictionalized "memoir" designed to play on its readers' narrative expectations and pack an existentialist punch.</description>

  <description>It is autumn 1981 when the inconceivable comes to Blackeberg, a suburb in Sweden. The body of a teenage boy is found, emptied of blood, the murder rumored to be part of a ritual killing. Twelve-year-old Oskar is personally hoping that revenge has come at long last—revenge for the bullying he endures at school, day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the murder is not the most important thing on his mind. A new girl has moved in next door—a girl who has never seen a Rubik's Cube before, but who can solve it at once. There is something wrong with her, though, something odd. And she only comes out at night....</description>

  <description>It's the summer of 1960 in Elm Haven, Illinois, and five 12-year old boys are forming the bonds that a lifetime of changes will never erase. But then a dark cloud threatens the bright promise of summer vacation: on the last day of school, their classmate Tubby Cooke vanishes. Soon, the group discovers stories of other children who once disappeared from Elm Haven. And there are other strange things happening in town: unexplained holes in the ground, a stranger dressed as a World War I soldier, and a rendering-plant truck that seems to be following the five boys. The friends realize that there is a terrible evil lurking in Elm Haven...and they must be the ones to stop it.</description>

  <description>Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a thunderous hangover, a raging headache . . . and a pair of horns growing from his temples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;, and more—he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone, that is, but the devil inside. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You will be scared. But you won’t know why…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’m thinking of ending things. Once this thought arrives, it stays. It sticks. It lingers. It’s always there. Always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake once said, “Sometimes a thought is closer to truth, to reality, than an action. You can say anything, you can do anything, but you can’t fake a thought.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here’s what I’m thinking: I don’t want to be here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this deeply suspenseful and irresistibly unnerving debut novel, a man and his girlfriend are on their way to a secluded farm. When the two take an unexpected detour, she is left stranded in a deserted high school, wondering if there is any escape at all. What follows is a twisted unraveling that will haunt you long after the last page is turned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this smart, suspenseful, and intense literary thriller, debut novelist Iain Reid explores the depths of the human psyche, questioning consciousness, free will, the value of relationships, fear, and the limitations of solitude. Reminiscent of Jose Saramago’s early work, Michel Faber’s cult classic &lt;i&gt;Under the Skin&lt;/i&gt;, and Lionel Shriver’s &lt;i&gt;We Need to Talk about Kevin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;I’m Thinking of Ending Things&lt;/i&gt; is an edgy, haunting debut. Tense, gripping, and atmospheric, this novel pulls you in from the very first page…and never lets you go.</description>

  <description>Melanie is a very special girl. Dr. Caldwell calls her "our little genius."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning, Melanie waits in her cell to be collected for class. When they come for her, Sergeant Parks keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his people strap her into the wheelchair. She thinks they don't like her. She jokes that she won't bite, but they don't laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melanie loves school. She loves learning about spelling and sums and the world outside the classroom and the children's cells. She tells her favorite teacher all the things she'll do when she grows up. Melanie doesn't know why this makes Miss Justineau look sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Girl with All the Gifts&lt;/i&gt; is a sensational thriller, perfect for fans of Stephen King, Justin Cronin, and Neil Gaiman.</description>

  <description>It's America in 1962. Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war—and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.</description>

      <![CDATA[I find this a hard review to write because the things I want to mention the most are all spoilers. There was a lot I enjoyed here. As a child of the 80s, the nostalgia elements were spot on. There was a near constant sense of dread that built tension throughout the story. There were moments of tr...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Original and imaginative . . . Ripping suspense, sheer terror, and a wrenching love story.” —Sandra Brown, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Friction&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terrible truth about Manderley is that someone is always watching. Manderley Resort is a gleaming, new twenty-story hotel on the California coast. It’s about to open its doors, and the world--at least those with the means to afford it--will be welcomed into a palace of opulence and unparalleled security. But someone is determined that Manderley will never open. The staff has no idea that their every move is being watched, and over the next twelve hours they will be killed off, one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King, and with a deep bow to Daphne du Maurier, author Gina Wohlsdorf pairs narrative ingenuity and razor-wire prose with quick twists, sharp turns, and gasp-inducing terror. &lt;i&gt;Security&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;grand guignol&lt;/i&gt; storytelling at its very best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shocking thriller, a brilliant narrative puzzle, and a multifaceted love story unlike any other, &lt;i&gt;Security&lt;/i&gt; marks the debut of a fearless and gifted writer.</description>

  <description>All of the stories included in this anthology used the same prompt: "Write a short story between 4,000 and 5,000 words using the word ‘nemesis’ as your inspiration."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star Log (K. J. Gillenwater)&lt;br /&gt;Stranded on a desolate planet far outside the interstellar shipping lanes, a solitary man struggles to survive and to overcome the disturbing memories that haunt him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guardian (Louis F.

Left for dead, Moll's pleas for vengeance are answered by a forgotten goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stagnant (Dave Cardwell)&lt;br /&gt;In a world where nobody dies, society endures until a single death threatens it all. On the run, Skyla must follow the thread left for her where a devastating discovery awaits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polarity (Holly Gonzalez)&lt;br /&gt;Decades after a genocidal war with human colonists, a lonely alien priestess hides to survive, believing she is the last of her kind.

When the supervillain, Shapetwister, attacks her city, however, she discovers she has a superhero identity so secret, even she didn't know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Walk (Jinn Tiole)&lt;br /&gt;In need of a job, Rhône joins a mission to find a planet worth terraforming. As a geologist, she delves into the study of the young target planet's tectonic activity. Xenobiologist, Shea, is happy to find a possible alien life form. But then things start to go terribly wrong…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Shades of Black (Matthew Thrush)&lt;br /&gt;Chaos rules the day and Fear the night. Humanity has lost its morality as the surviving humans resort to acts they never thought they could commit just to stay alive. Tray is the last human on the planet not inflicted with the curse. Hope still burns within him. That is, until the ones from the sky come back for the rest of them. When Tray loses all connection to the world he’s ever known, he must choose a new path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outwitting Alexa (Jesse Sprague)&lt;br /&gt;Seb is a simple man. He wants simple things: to live out his contract and to buy his freedom. But between a worldwide catastrophe and his mistress’s state-of-the-art home security system, Alexa, both living and freedom may be far more complicated than anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mordecai (Hannah Ansley)&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of his lover, Mordecai is left with only the burning desire to avenge her. With his loyal companion by his side, an injured dog whose life he saved, he traverses the desolate wasteland hunting down the man who murdered his soul mate.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A family is shaken to its core after the mysterious disappearance of a teenage boy in this eerie tale, a blend of literary fiction, psychological suspense, and supernatural horror from the author of &lt;i&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late one summer night, Elizabeth Sanderson receives the devastating news that every mother fears: her fourteen-year-old son, Tommy, has vanished without a trace in the woods of a local park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search isn’t yielding any answers, and Elizabeth and her young daughter, Kate, struggle to comprehend his disappearance. Feeling helpless and alone, their sorrow is compounded by anger and frustration. The local and state police haven’t uncovered any leads. Josh and Luis, the friends who were with Tommy last, may not be telling the whole truth about that night in Borderland State Park, when they were supposedly hanging out at a landmark the local teens have renamed Devil’s Rock— rumored to be cursed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in an all-too-real nightmare, riddled with worry, pain, and guilt, Elizabeth is wholly unprepared for the strange series of events that follow. She believes a ghostly shadow of Tommy materializes in her bedroom, while Kate and other local residents claim to see a shadow peering through their own windows in the dead of night. Then, random pages torn from Tommy’s journal begin to mysteriously appear—entries that reveal an introverted teenager obsessed with the phantasmagoric; the loss of his father, killed in a drunk-driving accident a decade earlier; a folktale involving the devil and the woods of Borderland; and a horrific incident that Tommy believed connected them all and changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search grows more desperate, and the implications of what happened becomes more haunting and sinister, no one is prepared for the shocking truth about that night and Tommy’s disappearance at Devil’s Rock.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Is blood thicker than magic in La Nouvelle-Orléans?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele scours Storm-ravaged New Orleans for the truth about her family’s magical past, tormented by the fate she condemned her mother to, and by the lies she’s forced to tell to cover it up. But every turn leads her back to the one person she’s determined to forget: Niccolò Medici. Not even the multitude of enchanted locks on the attic door trapping Nicco within can break their connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac tries relentlessly to keep Adele from exploring paths too dark that would endanger them all. But a new threat is rising: the Medici’s presence has attracted something else to New Orleans…an older enemy, one that will bring Isaac’s haunted past to life, test the witches’ friendships, and jeopardize Adele and Isaac’s blossoming relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this spellbinding continuation of The Casquette Girls saga, Adele must draw on the past—from seventeenth-century Florence, a time bubbling with alchemy and fraternal betrayal—and sort history from fantasy if she is to have any chance of saving her mother, her coven, and her magic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From the award-winning, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt; comes a chilling novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes and a band of improbable heroes who battle to save it, led by one powerful and enigmatic man known as the Fireman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fireman is coming. Stay cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob’s dismay, Harper wants to live—at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads—armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn’t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter’s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman’s secrets before her life—and that of her unborn child—goes up in smoke.</description>

      <![CDATA[Like most anthologies this was a mixed bag. There were some stories that will stay with me for a long time and others I'm already forgetting. Interestingly, reading the reviews on here, other readers favorites were not the same as mine. So it is safe to say, there is something for all tastes here...]]>

  <description>From the winner of the XOXO Connects flash fiction contest comes a story about an uber-focused executive knocked off her stride by a riding accident and then swept off her feet when she least expects it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alejandra Barros doesn’t know the meaning of failure until fate pulls the rug right out from under her Louboutin stilettos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Board of Directors’ meetings, corporate takeovers, and jet setting around the globe don’t allow for much of a personal life—and even Ali’s limited free time is dedicated to her beloved horses, show jumping at a championship level. When a freak riding accident shatters her wrist and messes with her confidence at work, her boss mandates a month-long hiatus. If she wants to save her career, she has no choice but to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pebble Creek Lodge is not far from Denver, but the high-end retreat might as well be a world away from the frenzied pace of Manhattan. From the moment she arrives, Ali feels so out of place she’s practically ready to skip the whole “required recovery” nonsense and hop on the next plane back to New York. The only thing stopping her is the ranch hand Hank Mathis and his perfectly chiseled abs, which are intriguing and delicious enough to make her linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time Ali admits she’s in a bit of a funk, not even the moral and physical support of a gorgeous cowboy is enough to bring her back to her old self—especially when the object of her desires is secretly battling his own demons. To get her life back on track, Ali will have to decide what it is she’s really fighting to regain and what it will take to find it—or she’ll risk losing the one thing that could truly make her happy.</description>

So I was thrilled when I heard she had won the contest to have this book published. I don’t often read romance but I knew I’d be reading this one.<br /><br />The novel is a sl...]]>

  <description>"If it had another name, I never knew, but the locals called it the Loney - that strange nowhere between the Wyre and the Lune where Hanny and I went every Easter time with Mummer, Farther, Mr and Mrs Belderboss and Father Wilfred, the parish priest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was impossible to truly know the place. It changed with each influx and retreat, and the neap tides would reveal the skeletons of those who thought they could escape its insidious currents. No one ever went near the water. No one apart from us, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I always knew that what happened there wouldn't stay hidden for ever, no matter how much I wanted it to. No matter how hard I tried to forget...."</description>

  <description>This Omnibus Edition collects the five Wool books into a single volume. It is for those who arrived late to the party and who wish to save a dollar or two while picking up the same stories in a single package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Wool story was released as a standalone short in July of 2011. Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. My thanks go out to those reviewers who clamored for more. Without you, none of this would exist. Your demand created this as much as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18626815-wool-omnibus-edition" rel="nofollow"&gt;B0071XO8RA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A missing God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A library with the secrets to the universe. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A woman too busy to notice her heart slipping away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn's not so different from the other people around her. She likes guacamole and cigarettes and steak. She knows how to use a phone. Clothes are a bit tricky, but everyone says nice things about her outfit with the Christmas sweater over the gold bicycle shorts. After all, she was a normal American herself once.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a long time ago, of course. Before her parents died. Before she and the others were taken in by the man they called Father. In the years since then, Carolyn hasn't had a chance to get out much. Instead, she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient customs. They've studied the books in his Library and learned some of the secrets of his power. And sometimes, they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God.  Now, Father is missing—perhaps even dead—and the Library that holds his secrets stands unguarded. And with it, control over all of creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her, all of them with powers that far exceed her own. But Carolyn has accounted for this. And Carolyn has a plan. The only trouble is that in the war to make a new God, she's forgotten to protect the things that make her human. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Populated by an unforgettable cast of characters and propelled by a plot that will shock you again and again, &lt;i&gt;The Library at Mount Char&lt;/i&gt; is at once horrifying and hilarious, mind-blowingly alien and heartbreakingly human, sweepingly visionary and nail-bitingly thrilling—and signals the arrival of a major new voice in fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, &lt;i&gt;Bird Box&lt;/i&gt; is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

      <![CDATA[A wonderful novel that kept me on edge from the first page right through to the end. The writing appears simple but has the magical quality of falling away and leaving you stranded in the middle of the story with no artifice to distract. <br /><br />The story itself is two tales.

  <description>A tale of family, ghosts, secrets, and mystery, in which the lives of the living and the dead intersect in shocking, surprising, and moving ways &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy Richard Walker has just died, leaving behind his country house full of rooms packed with the detritus of a lifetime. His estranged family—bitter ex-wife Caroline, troubled teenage son Trenton, and unforgiving daughter Minna—have arrived for their inheritance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Walkers are not alone. Prim Alice and the cynical Sandra, long dead former residents bound to the house, linger within its claustrophobic walls. Jostling for space, memory, and supremacy, they observe the family, trading barbs and reminiscences about their past lives. Though their voices cannot be heard, Alice and Sandra speak through the house itself—in the hiss of the radiator, a creak in the stairs, the dimming of a light bulb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The living and dead are each haunted by painful truths that will soon surface with explosive force. When a new ghost appears, and Trenton begins to communicate with her, the spirit and human worlds collide—with cataclysmic results.</description>

  <description>NOS4A2 is a spine-tingling novel of supernatural suspense from master of horror Joe Hill, the New York Times bestselling author of Heart-Shaped Box and Horns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria McQueen has a secret gift for finding things: a misplaced bracelet, a missing photograph, answers to unanswerable questions. On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether it’s across Massachusetts or across the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing – and terrifying – playground of amusements he calls “Christmasland.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, one day, Vic goes looking for trouble—and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manx’s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. He’s on the road again and he’s picked up a new passenger: Vic’s own son.</description>

  <description>A thrilling and original coming-of-age novel for adults about a young man practicing magic in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren’t black and white, love and sex aren’t simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.</description>

  <description>Padlocked doors. Strange light fixtures. Mutant cockroaches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some odd things about Nate’s new apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, he has other things on his mind. He hates his job. He has no money in the bank. No girlfriend. No plans for the future. So while his new home isn’t perfect, it’s livable. The rent is low, the property managers are friendly, and the odd little mysteries don’t nag at him too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, not until he meets Mandy, his neighbour across the hall, and notices something unusual about her apartment. And Xela’s apartment. And Tim’s. And Veek’s. Because every room in this old Los Angeles brownstone has a mystery or two. Mysteries that stretch back over a hundred years. Some of them are in plain sight. Some are behind locked doors. And all together these mysteries could mean the end of Nate and his friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or the end of everything...</description>

  <description>The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her parents' despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie's descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.</description>

  <description>Hermann Kermit Warm is going to die. The enigmatic and powerful man known only as the Commodore has ordered it, and his henchmen, Eli and Charlie Sisters, will make sure of it. Though Eli doesn't share his brother's appetite for whiskey and killing, he's never known anything else. But their prey isn't an easy mark, and on the road from Oregon City to Warm's gold-mining claim outside Sacramento, Eli begins to question what he does for a living - and whom he does it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Sisters Brothers&lt;/i&gt;, Patrick deWitt pays homage to the classic Western, transforming it into an unforgettable comic tour de force. Filled with a remarkable cast of characters - losers, cheaters, and ne'er-do-wells from all stripes of life - and told by a complex and compelling narrator, it is a violent, lustful odyssey through the underworld of the 1850s frontier that beautifully captures the humor, melancholy, and grit of the Old West, and two brothers bound by blood, violence, and love.</description>

      <![CDATA[I picked up The Sisters Brothers after a recommendation that it was like "reading a Coen Brothers movie." And with its quirky characters and odd, verging on surreal, events, it certainly could be one. Or considering its casual and bloody violence perhaps a Quentin Tarantino film. I just hope whoe...]]>

  <description>In modern-day Britain, magic users control everything: wealth, politics, power—and you. If you’re not one of the ultimate one-percenters—the magical elite—you owe them ten years of service. Do those years when you’re old, and you’ll never get through them. Do them young, and you’ll never get over them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the darkly decadent world of &lt;i&gt;Gilded Cage&lt;/i&gt;. In its glittering milieu move the all-powerful Jardines and the everyday Hadleys. The families have only one thing in common: Each has three children. But their destinies entwine when one family enters the service of the other. They will all discover whether any magic is more powerful than the human spirit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have a quick ten years. . . .</description>

It’s a genre mashup in the best possible way, involving alternate history, dystopian adventure, and a heap of fantasy. Vic James buil...]]>

I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise, I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cap mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead...</description>

  <description>Set in the days of civilization's collapse, &lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One snowy night a famous Hollywood actor slumps over and dies onstage during a production of &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt;. Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.</description>

  <description>From the award-winning author of the acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;Poe&lt;/i&gt; comes an edgy and bone-chilling new novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona Dunn is approached in a bar by a man who claims he’s the devil, she figures it’s just some kind of postmodern-slash-ironic pickup line. But a few drinks in, he offers her a wish in exchange for her immortal soul, and in addition, Fiona must perform a special favor for him whenever the time comes. Fiona finds the entire matter so absurd that she agrees. Bad idea. Not only does Fiona soon discover that she really was talking to the devil incarnate, but she’s now been initiated into a bizarre support group of similar “dead souls”—those who have done the same thing as Fiona on a whim, and who must spend their waking hours in absolute terror of that favor eventually being called in...and what exactly is required from each of them in order to give the devil his due.</description>

  <description>Bod is an unusual boy who inhabits an unusual place-he's the only living resident of a graveyard. Raised from infancy by the ghosts, werewolves, and other cemetery denizens, Bod has learned the antiquated customs of his guardians' time as well as their timely ghostly teachings-like the ability to Fade. Can a boy raised by ghosts face the wonders and terrors of the worlds of both the living and the dead? And then there are things like ghouls that aren't really one thing or the other. &lt;br /&gt;This chilling tale is Neil Gaiman's first full-length novel for middle-grade readers since the internationally bestselling and universally acclaimed Coraline. Like Coraline, this book is sure to enchant and surprise young readers as well as Neil Gaiman's legion of adult fans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;44 SCOTLAND STREET - Book 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The residents and neighbors of 44 Scotland Street and the city of Edinburgh come to vivid life in these gently satirical, wonderfully perceptive serial novels, featuring six-year-old Bertie, a remarkably precocious boy—just ask his mother.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Back are all our favorite denizens of a Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh. Bertie the immensely talented six year old is now enrolled in kindergarten, and much to his dismay, has been clad in pink overalls for his first day of class. Bruce has lost his job as a surveyor, and between admiring glances in the mirror, is contemplating becoming a wine merchant. Pat is embarking on a new life at Edinburgh University and perhaps on a new relationship, courtesy of Domenica, her witty and worldly-wise neighbor. McCall Smith has much in store for them as the brief spell of glorious summer sunshine gives way to fall a season cursed with more traditionally Scottish weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of McCall Smith’s gentle humor and sympathy for his characters, &lt;i&gt;Espresso Tales&lt;/i&gt; is also an affectionate portrait of a city and its people who, in the author’s own words, “make it one of the most vibrant and interesting places in the world.”</description>

  <description>Bombs are exploding in the streets of London, but life seems to have planted more subtle booby-traps for Miles Flint. Miles is a spy. His job is to watch and to listen, then to report back to his superiors, nothing more. The job, affording glimpses into the most private lives of his victims, appeals to Miles. He doesn't lust after promotion, and he doesn't want action. He wants, just for once, not to botch a case. Having lost one suspect - with horrific consequences - Miles becomes too involved with another, a young Irishwoman. His marriage seems ready to crumble to dust. So does his home. But Miles is given one last chance for redemption - a trip to Belfast, which quickly becomes a flight of terror, murder and shocking discoveries. But can the voyeur survive in a world of violent action?</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm a big admirer of Haruki Murakami's writing and have read nearly everything he has written, which was why this book was such a big disappointment. It felt like an early draft that for some reason was rushed to publication. Don't get me wrong there are moments of brilliance and elements sure to...]]>

  <description>Following a scalding row with her mother, fifteen-year-old Holly Sykes slams the door on her old life. But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: a sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as “the radio people,” Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mystics—and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of Holly’s life, affecting all the people Holly loves—even the ones who are not yet born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Cambridge scholarship boy grooming himself for wealth and influence, a conflicted father who feels alive only while reporting from occupied Iraq, a middle-aged writer mourning his exile from the bestseller list—all have a part to play in this surreal, invisible war on the margins of our world. From the medieval Swiss Alps to the nineteenth-century Australian bush, from a hotel in Shanghai to a Manhattan townhouse in the near future, their stories come together in moments of everyday grace and extraordinary wonder.</description>

  <description>In a small New England town, in the early 60s, a shadow falls over a small boy playing with his toy soldiers. Jamie Morton looks up to see a striking man, the new minister. Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls – including Jamie’s mother and beloved sister – feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll. Addicted to heroin, stranded, desperate, he sees Jacobs again – a showman on stage, creating dazzling ‘portraits in lightning’ – and their meeting has profound consequences for both men. Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil’s devising, and Jamie discovers that &lt;i&gt;revival&lt;/i&gt; has many meanings. Because for every cure there is a price…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rich and disturbing novel spans five decades on its way to the most terrifying conclusion Stephen King has ever written. It’s a masterpiece from King, in the great American tradition of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe.</description>

  <description>This eerie tale of psychological horror sees the real inhabitants of turn-of-the-century Princeton fall under the influence of a supernatural power. New Jersey, 1905: soon-to-be commander-in-chief Woodrow Wilson is president of Princeton University. On a nearby farm, Socialist author Upton Sinclair, enjoying the success of his novel &lt;i&gt;The Jungle,&lt;/i&gt; has taken up residence with his family. This is a quiet, bookish community - elite, intellectual and indisputably privileged. But when a savage lynching in a nearby town is hushed up, a horrifying chain of events is initiated - until it becomes apparent that the families of Princeton have been beset by a powerful curse. The Devil has come to this little town and not a soul will be spared. 'The Accursed' marks new territory for the masterful Joyce Carol Oates - narrated with her unmistakable psychological insight, it combines beautifully transporting historical detail with chilling fantastical elements to stunning effect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colette and Alison are unlikely cohorts: one a shy, drab beanpole of an assistant, the other a charismatic, corpulent psychic whose connection to the spiritual world torments her. When they meet at a fair, Alison invites Colette at once to join her on the road as her personal assistant and companion. Troubles spiral out of control when the pair moves to a suburban wasteland in what was once the English countryside. It is not long before the place beyond black threatens to uproot their lives forever. This is Hilary Mantel at her finest--insightful, darkly comic, unorthodox, and thrilling to read.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had mixed feeling about this novel from beginning to end. I had picked it up as a recommended ghost story, but upon reflection I think it needs to be looked at as a creature feature (think something like the Wolfman), where the malevolent force in the house is the creature.

  <description>First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/i&gt; has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, the lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.</description>

  <description>Luisa has met the love of her life ... now she just needs to figure out what to do with her husband.&lt;br /&gt;Luisa has fallen madly in love with sculptor Jarvis, so she comes up with a plan to find a new wife for her husband Luke so she can exit stage left. She wants to screen potential stepmothers for her 8-year-old son Max and has strict criteria: the woman must be a single mother; have no more than two children; she can't be authoritarian; she must be creative, nurturing and not much prettier than Luisa.&lt;br /&gt;After a few carefully orchestrated meetings with different women that fail to raise a spark, Luke finally connects with a potential replacement wife. However, Luisa isn't prepared for the fact that Luke's interest in the other woman makes him a better man and a more attractive husband. After suffering for years in a half-dead marriage, Luisa starts to remember what it was about Luke that she originally fell in love with. But is it too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2007 Crime Writers’ Association Debut Dagger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delightfully dark English mystery, featuring precocious young sleuth Flavia de Luce and her eccentric family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summer of 1950 hasn’t offered up anything out of the ordinary for eleven-year-old Flavia de Luce: bicycle explorations around the village, keeping tabs on her neighbours, relentless battles with her older sisters, Ophelia and Daphne, and brewing up poisonous concoctions while plotting revenge in their home’s abandoned Victorian chemistry lab, which Flavia has claimed for her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a series of mysterious events gets Flavia’s attention: A dead bird is found on the doormat, a postage stamp bizarrely pinned to its beak. A mysterious late-night visitor argues with her aloof father, Colonel de Luce, behind closed doors. And in the early morning Flavia finds a red-headed stranger lying in the cucumber patch and watches him take his dying breath. For Flavia, the summer begins in earnest when murder comes to Buckshaw: “&lt;i&gt;I wish I could say I was afraid, but I wasn’t. Quite the contrary. This was by far the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the stranger die of poisoning? There &lt;i&gt;was &lt;/i&gt;a piece missing from Mrs. Mullet’s custard pie, and none of the de Luces would have dared to eat the awful thing. Or could he have been killed by the family’s loyal handyman, Dogger… or by the Colonel himself! At that moment, Flavia commits herself to solving the crime — even if it means keeping information from the village police, in order to protect her family. But then her father confesses to the crime, for the same reason, and it’s up to Flavia to free him of suspicion. Only she has the ingenuity to follow the clues that reveal the victim’s identity, and a conspiracy that reaches back into the de Luces’ murky past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thoroughly entertaining romp of a novel, &lt;b&gt;The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie&lt;/b&gt; is inventive and quick-witted, with tongue-in-cheek humour that transcends the macabre seriousness of its subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>As Eiji Miyake's twentieth birthday nears, he arrives in Tokyo with a mission - to locate the father he has never met. So begins a search that takes him into the seething city's underworld, its lost property offices and video arcades, and on a journey that zigzags from reality to the realm of dreams. But until Eiji has fallen in love and exorcised his childhood demons, the belonging he craves will remain, tantalizingly, just beyond his grasp.</description>

  <description>David Mitchell's electrifying debut novel takes readers on a mesmerizing trek across a world of human experience through a series of ingeniously linked narratives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oblivious to the bizarre ways in which their lives intersect, nine characters—a terrorist in Okinawa, a record-shop clerk in Tokyo, a money-laundering British financier in Hong Kong, an old woman running a tea shack in China, a transmigrating "noncorpum" entity seeking a human host in Mongolia, a gallery-attendant-cum-art-thief in Petersburg, a drummer in London, a female physicist in Ireland, and a radio deejay in New York—hurtle toward a shared destiny of astonishing impact. Like the book's one non-human narrator, Mitchell latches onto his host characters and invades their lives with parasitic precision, making Ghostwritten a sprawling and brilliant literary relief map of the modern world.</description>

  <description>Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life ... as only a dog could tell it.</description>

  <description>While everyone else may be fooled, psychiatrist Leo Liebenstein knows better. His wife is not his wife. She is a dead-ringer—a doppelganger—but something is very wrong. This isn’t Rema. Could it be that his wife is involved in some infidelity? But why would infidelity lead to disappearance? Or false appearance? With nothing for Leo to go on except a potential clue relating to one of his patients, Harvey—a man who believes he is a secret agent with control over the weather—Leo sets off on a humorous and science-steeped odyssey to unravel the mystery of his missing wife and to resolve Harvey’s “conflict with the consensus view of reality.” Moving from New York City to the southern reaches of Patagonia, &lt;em&gt;Atmospheric Disturbances &lt;/em&gt;is a brilliantly inventive and addictive adventure, mixed with a scientific exploration of the uncontested truths we know are false.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“There is something of E. M. Forster in Unsworth’s knowing depiction of a decaying empire.”—&lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this masterful work of historical fiction set during the dying days of the Ottoman Empire, the schemes of Western powers grappling for a foothold in Mesopotamia come vividly to life. English archaeologist John Sommerville begins excavating a historical site, believing he has uncovered a find that will revolutionize his field. But when the Germans threaten his dig with their railroad, he hires an Arab spy, not recognizing the spies dwelling in his own house. .</description>

  <description>There's trouble in Arizona. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenna Cieres is a struggling young college student on the verge of graduating. She hasn't had a social life since enrollment into law school, but she has her best friend and loyal dog, Benji, by her side. She's full of fight and has the potential to be a successful lawyer – if she lives long enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jenna begins to receive strange emails and frightening phone calls, she does the logical thing and informs the local police. Disheartened by their inability to help, the young woman tries to ignore the sensation that someone is watching everything she does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Jenna is reaching her breaking point, FBI agent Terry Miles becomes involved when he discovers a stark correlation between her case and a series of macabre murders strewn about the state. Even Terry feels the fear inflicted by the killer, who threatens everything he stands for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she no longer feels safe in her own home, Jenna turns to ex boyfriend, Will Thompson. He appears to be the perfect person to comfort her, but it seems as if Will has some secrets of his own – and uncovering them could lead to her death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Scream For Me' tangles lives and twists secrets around everyone involved in this dark thriller. Increasing troubles and dangerous passion will leave the reader wondering just how deeply everything is connected, and just how far obsession can stretch. Jenna's life is in the hands of a terrifying killer, unless she can use her quick wits to save herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stunningly original and wildly inventive, &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Road&lt;/i&gt; melds the influences of Margaret Atwood, Neil Gaiman, and Erin Morgenstern for a dazzling debut.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Meena, a young woman living in a futuristic India, gets out of bed with mysterious snake bites on her chest, she decides India has become too dangerous. As she plots her exit, she hears of The Trail and knows this is her salvation. The Trail is a bridge that spans the Arabian Sea, connecting India to Africa like a silver ribbon extending to the horizon.  Its purpose is to harness the power of the ocean—“blue energy”—but it also offers a sub-culture of travelers a chance for escape and adventure. Meena gathers supplies—a pozit GPS system, a scroll reader, a sealable water-proof pod—and embarks on a journey to Ethiopia, the place of her birth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     Mariama, a girl from a different time, is on a quest of her own. Forced to flee her home, she joins up with a caravan of strangers heading across Saharan Africa. She meets Yemaya, a beautiful and enigmatic woman who becomes her protector and confidante. Yemaya tells Mariama of Ethiopia, where revolution is brewing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     As one heads east and the other west, Meena and Mariama's fates will entwine in ways that are profoundly moving and ultimately shocking.  Monica Byrne’s vision of the future is vividly imagined and artfully told and she writes with stunning clarity and deep emotion, making &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Road&lt;/i&gt; a true tour de force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>After the Storm of the Century rips apart New Orleans, Adele Le Moyne and her father are among the first to return to the city following the mandatory evacuation. Adele wants nothing more than for life to return to normal, but with the silent city resembling a mold-infested war zone, a parish-wide curfew, and mysterious new faces lurking in the abandoned French Quarter, normal will have to be redefined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events too unnatural – even for New Orleans – lead Adele to an attic that has been sealed for three hundred years, and the chaos she unleashes threatens not only her life but everyone she knows. Mother Nature couldn’t drain the joie de vivre from the Big Easy, but someone or something is draining life from its residents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught suddenly in a hurricane of eighteenth-century myths and monsters, Adele must quickly untangle a web of magic that links the climbing murder rate back to her own ancestors. But who can you trust in a city where everyone has a secret, and where keeping them can be a matter of life and death – unless, that is, you’re immortal.</description>

  <description>Three friends descend upon an art auction in search of some excitement. Mike Mackenzie-retired software mogul, bachelor and fine art enthusiast-wants something that money can't buy. Fellow art-lover Allan Cruickshank is bored with his banking career and burdened by a painful divorce. And Robert Gissing, an art professor, is frustrated that so many paintings stay hidden in corporate boardrooms, safes and private apartments. After the auction-and a chance encounter with crime boss Chib Calloway-Robert and Allan suggest the "liberation" of several paintings from the National Gallery, hoping Mike will dissuade them. Instead, he hopes they are serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As enterprising girlfriends, clever detectives, seductive auctioneers and a Hell's Angel named Hate enter the picture, Ian Rankin creates a highly-charged thriller, a fast-pasted story of second guesses and double crosses that keep changing the picture, right until the harrowing finish.</description>

  <description>Days before his release from prison, Shadow's wife, Laura, dies in a mysterious car crash. Numbly, he makes his way back home. On the plane, he encounters the enigmatic Mr Wednesday, who claims to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together they embark on a profoundly strange journey across the heart of the USA, whilst all around them a storm of preternatural and epic proportions threatens to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scary, gripping and deeply unsettling, &lt;i&gt;American Gods&lt;/i&gt; takes a long, hard look into the soul of America. You'll be surprised by what - and who - it finds there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the author's preferred text, never before published in the UK, and is about 12,000 words longer than the previous UK edition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A Boeing 777 arrives at JFK and is on its way across the tarmac, when it suddenly stops dead. All window shades are pulled down. All lights are out. All communication channels have gone quiet. Crews on the ground are lost for answers, but an alert goes out to the CDC. Dr. Ephraim "Eph" Goodweather, head of their Canary project, a rapid-response team that investigates biological threats, gets the call and boards the plane. What he finds makes his blood run cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a pawnshop in Spanish Harlem, a former professor and survivor of the Holocaust named Abraham Setrakian knows something is happening. And he knows the time has come, that a war is brewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a battle of mammoth proportions as the vampiric virus that has infected New York begins to spill out into the streets. Eph, who is joined by Setrakian and a motley crew of fighters, must now find a way to stop the contagion and save his city - a city that includes his wife and son - before it is too late.</description>

  <description>2013 Winner — Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award — Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Halloween, and life is grim for 23-year-old Dimitri Petrov. It’s the one-year anniversary of his parents’ deaths, he’s stuck on page one thousand of his Rasputin zombie novel, and he makes his living writing obituaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things turn from bleak to terrifying when Dimitri gets a last-minute assignment to cover a séance at the reputedly haunted Aspinwall Mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, Dimitri meets Lisa, a punk-rock drummer he falls hard for. But just as he’s about to ask her out, he unwittingly unleashes malevolent forces, throwing him into a deadly mystery. When Dimitri wakes up, he is in the morgue—icy cold and haunted by a cryptic warning given by a tantalizing female spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As town residents begin to turn up gruesomely murdered, Dimitri must play detective in his own story and unravel the connections among his family, the Aspinwall Mansion, the female spirit, and the secrets held in a pair of crumbling antiquarian books. If he doesn’t, it’s quite possible Lisa will be the next victim.</description>

  <description>In 1984, the twelve-year old Caldwell twins, Reese and Luke, are living the typical middle-class American childhood, until Luke is brutally murdered. In present day, Reese is a forty-two year old life coach in the public's eye but a vigilante in private, never believing the system was adequate in finding her brother's killer. Her secret identity is partnered with the ghost of her twin, and together they hunt the criminal scum of the earth, child killers and rapists. Although their relationship is unorthodox, they are closer now than ever and together they manage to dig up past demons that won't stay dead.</description>

  <description>Leonard wants to bequeath his tattooed skin to the National Gallery of Australia. He has been almost completely inked by one of Australia's best contemporary artists, but he is a canvas that nobody wants. Strange things start happening to Leonard, Darwin’s moth, a tattoo from his calf, flutters around him one night, he wakes with a Cold War gas mask on his head, Mao Tse Tung appears in his bed. Tattoos from his skin come alive before him and he becomes more convinced than ever that his skin is truly precious.</description>

  <description>"Every story of &lt;i&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/i&gt; has something riveting about it … so perfectly realized, they became the model for much of twentieth-century horror/fantasy." — &lt;i&gt;New York Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most important works of American supernatural fiction since those of Poe, &lt;i&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/i&gt; was among the first attempts to establish the horror of the nameless and the unimaginable. A treasured source used by almost all the significant writers in the American pulp tradition — H. P. Lovecraft, A. Merritt, Robert E. Howard, and many others — it endures as a work of remarkable power and one of the most chillingly original books in the genre.&lt;br /&gt;This collection reprints all the supernatural stories from &lt;i&gt;The King in Yellow&lt;/i&gt;, including the grisly "Yellow Sign," the disquieting "Repairer of Reputations," the tender "Demoiselle d'Ys," and others. Robert W. Chambers' finest stories from other sources have also been added, such as the thrilling "Maker of Moons" and "The Messenger." In addition, an unusual pleasure awaits those who know Chambers only by his horror stories: three of his finest early biological science-fiction fantasies from &lt;i&gt;In Search of the Unknown&lt;/i&gt; appear here as well.</description>

  <description>Living and Dying with Dogs is about people falling in lonely little spots and rotting for your edification; it's an invitation to come along on a journey from war to epidemic to famine. There are no great morals here, no uplifting messages; only a hesitant, unsure narrator who drifts, stumbles, and sketches the poetry of human decay. Be warned: An uncomfortable honesty is at play here. Far removed from the misery, we can have another drink, earn more money, and turn a blind eye. And while the notion that the horrors of this world start with each of us is not a pleasant thought, don't worry - the flaw has been with us forever. It's how we're wired. And on and on it will go, until it stops.</description>

  <description>Simon Madison is unlike any other boy in his hometown. He doesn't date. He doesn't drive. He doesn't play sports. He's too busy avoiding life as the sole heir to the family business, Mad Brothers Renaissance Faire. After witnessing the star of the Faire, Ginger, a Bengal tiger, maul his father to death, Simon's world crumbled into tiny shards of glass. But with the arrival of the newest member to Mad Brothers, the mysterious young psychic, Amanda Moon, he is confronted with his well-guarded past, unraveling from his fisted grip. Challenged with the brutal murder of one of his employees and fellow students, Simon and Amanda embark on a dangerous journey to discover the dark secrets of the disappearance of her mother, the twisted affairs which traumatized Simon's family, and the identity of a crazed murderer in their own back yard. They soon discover they don't know who to trust and their lives are in just as much danger as the boy whose mutilated body is found in the swamp behind the Madison's home.</description>

  <description>For sixty years, Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a "temporary" safe haven created in the wake of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>Barcelona, 1945. Just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother’s face. To console his only child, Daniel’s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona’s guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel’s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, 'The Shadow of the Wind', by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax’s work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn’t find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.</description>

  <description>From master storyteller Carlos Ruiz Zafon, author of the international phenomenon The Shadow of the Wind, comes The Angel’s Game — a dazzling new page-turner about the perilous nature of obsession, in literature and in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole of Barcelona stretched out at my feet and I wanted to believe that when I opened those windows — my new windows — each evening its streets would whisper stories to me, secrets in my ear, that I could catch on paper and narrate to whomever cared to listen…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an abandoned mansion at the heart of Barcelona, a young man, David Martin, makes his living by writing sensationalist novels under a pseudonym. The survivor of a troubled childhood, he has taken refuge in the world of books and spends his nights spinning baroque tales about the city’s underworld. But perhaps his dark imaginings are not as strange as they seem, for in a locked room deep within the house lie photographs and letters hinting at the mysterious death of the previous owner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a slow poison, the history of the place seeps into his bones as he struggles with an impossible love. Close to despair, David receives a letter from a reclusive French editor, Andreas Corelli, who makes him the offer of a lifetime. He is to write a book unlike anything that has ever existed — a book with the power to change hearts and minds. In return, he will receive a fortune, and perhaps more. But as David begins the work, he realizes that there is a connection between his haunting book and the shadows that surround his home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, Zafon takes us into a dark, gothic universe first seen in The Shadow of the Wind and creates a breathtaking adventure of intrigue, romance, and tragedy. Through a dizzyingly constructed labyrinth of secrets, the magic of books, passion, and friendship blend into a masterful story.&lt;br /&gt;(jacket)</description>

  <description>At once a fiendishly devious mystery, a beguiling love story, and a brilliant symposium on the power of art, &lt;i&gt;My Name Is Red&lt;/i&gt; is a transporting tale set amid the splendor and religious intrigue of sixteenth-century Istanbul, from one of the most prominent contemporary Turkish writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Part fantasy and part philosophical puzzle, &lt;i&gt;My Name is Red&lt;/i&gt; is a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.</description>

  <description>A spellbinding tale of disparate yearnings – for love, art, power, and God – set in a remote Turkish town, where stirrings of political Islamism threaten to unravel the secular order; by the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the acclaimed author of My Name Is Red comes a spellbinding tale of disparate yearnings–for love, art, power, and God–set in a remote Turkish town, where stirrings of political Islamism threaten to unravel the secular order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following years of lonely political exile in Western Europe, Ka, a middle-aged poet, returns to Istanbul to attend his mother's funeral. Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school. An apparent thaw of his writer's curiosity–a frozen sea these many years–leads him to Kars, a far-off town near the Russian border and the epicenter of the suicides. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sooner has he arrived, however, than we discover that Ka's motivations are not purely journalistic; for in Kars, once a province of Ottoman and then Russian glory, now a cultural gray-zone of poverty and paralysis, there is also Ipek, a radiant friend of Ka's youth, lately divorced, whom he has never forgotten. As a snowstorm, the fiercest in memory, descends on the town and seals it off from the modern, westernized world that has always been Ka's frame of reference, he finds himself drawn in unexpected directions: not only headlong toward the unknowable Ipek and the desperate hope for love–or at least a wife–that she embodies, but also into the maelstrom of a military coup staged to restrain the local Islamist radicals, and even toward God, whose existence Ka has never before allowed himself to contemplate. In this surreal confluence of emotion and spectacle, Ka begins to tap his dormant creative powers, producing poem after poem in untimely, irresistible bursts of inspiration. But not until the snows have melted and the political violence has run its bloody course will Ka discover the fate of his bid to seize a last chance for happiness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending profound sympathy and mischievous wit, Snow illuminates the contradictions gripping the individual and collective heart in many parts of the Muslim world. But even more, by its narrative brilliance and comprehension of the needs and duties</description>

  <description>A funny, often poignant tale of boy meets girl with a twist: what if one of them couldn't stop slipping in and out of time? Highly original and imaginative, this debut novel raises questions about life, love, and the effects of time on relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey Niffenegger’s innovative debut, &lt;i&gt;The Time Traveler’s Wife&lt;/i&gt;, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Time Traveler’s Wife&lt;/i&gt; depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare’s marriage and their passionate love for each other as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals—steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Nobel Prize–winning author José Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A city is hit by an epidemic of "white blindness" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As &lt;i&gt;Blindness&lt;/i&gt; reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.</description>

  <description>From the recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature, a “brilliant...enchanting novel” (New York Times Book Review) of romance, deceit, religion, and magic set in eighteenth-century Portugal at the height of the Inquisition. National bestseller. Translated by Giovanni Pontiero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When King and Church exercise absolute power what happens to the dreams of ordinary people? In early eighteenth century Lisbon, Baltasar, a soldier who has lost a hand in battle, falls in love with Blimunda, a young girl with strange visionary powers. From the day that he follows her home from the auto-da-fe where her mother is condemned and sent into exile, the two are bound body and soul by a love of unassailable strength. A third party shares their supper that evening: Padre Bartolemeu Lourenço, whose fantasy is to invent a flying machine. As the inquisition rages and royalty and religion clash, they pursue his impossible, not to mention heretical, dream of flight.</description>
