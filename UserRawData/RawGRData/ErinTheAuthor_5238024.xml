  <description>Princess Sienna is the most beautiful, the most charming, the most beloved of King Trident's daughters in the enchanted underwater kingdom. Not much is denied her, and all of Merdom favors her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a few days after her fifteenth birthday, Sienna does the unthinkable. She makes a bargain with the sea witch to trade her tongue and tail for a pair of legs and a chance to live a human life. Stung by her betrayal, Merdom turns its back on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having grown up in Sienna's shadow at court, Ariel is used to being unnoticed. So when the sea witch specifically asks her to go after Sienna and convince her to return home, Ariel is under no illusions; she is expendable. Still, out of obligation to her king and kingdom, she goes, thinking to slip in and out unnoticed as always. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment she sets foot on land, however, everything changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful To Me is the third installment in the End of Ever After companion series that rewrites classic tales of happily ever after.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if Belle’s mother cursed the Beast?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belle is a lot of things: smart, resourceful, restless. She longs to escape her poor provincial town for good. She wants to explore the world, despite her father’s reluctance to leave their little cottage in case Belle’s mother returns—a mother she barely remembers. Belle also happens to be the captive of a terrifying, angry beast. And that is her primary concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Belle touches the Beast’s enchanted rose, intriguing images flood her mind—images of the mother she believed she would never see again. Stranger still, she sees that her mother is none other than the beautiful Enchantress who cursed the Beast, his castle, and all its inhabitants. Shocked and confused, Belle and the Beast must work together to unravel a dark mystery about their families that is twenty-one years in the making.</description>

  <description>What if the sleeping beauty never woke up? &lt;i&gt;Once Upon a Dream&lt;/i&gt; marks the second book in a new YA line that reimagines classic Disney stories in surprising new ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be simple—a dragon defeated, a slumbering maiden, a prince poised to wake her. But when said prince falls asleep as soon as his lips meet the princess', it is clear that this fairy tale is far from over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a desperate fairy's last curse infiltrating her mind, Princess Aurora will have to navigate a dangerous and magical landscape deep in the depths of her dreams. Soon she stumbles upon Phillip, a charming prince eager to join her quest. But with Maleficent's agents following her every move, Aurora struggles to discover who her true allies are, and moreover, who &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; truly is. Time is running out. Will the sleeping beauty be able to wake herself up?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Marriage Lie&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Three Days Missing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; comes a riveting new novel of suspense about a woman who, in a fight for survival, must decide just how far she'll go to escape the person she once loved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beth Murphy is on the run...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly a year, Beth has been planning for this day. A day some people might call any other Wednesday, but Beth prefers to see it as her new beginning--one with a new look, new name and new city. Beth has given her plan significant thought, because one small slip and her violent husband will find her.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabine Hardison is missing...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple hundred miles away, Jeffrey returns home from a work trip to find his wife, Sabine, is missing. Wherever she is, she's taken almost nothing with her. Her abandoned car is the only evidence the police have, and all signs point to foul play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the police search for leads, the case becomes more and more convoluted. Sabine's carefully laid plans for her future indicate trouble at home, and a husband who would be better off with her gone. The detective on the case will stop at nothing to find out what happened and bring this missing woman home. Where is Sabine? And who is Beth? The only thing that's certain is that someone is lying and the truth won't stay buried for long.</description>

  <description>22 November 1963: Dallas, Texas. US President John F Kennedy is assassinated as his motorcade passes through the city’s streets. The assassin is soon captured, and revealed to be disaffected Communist sympathizer Lee Harvey Oswald. Did Oswald act alone, or did he have help? Is the Bilderberg Group simply a group of international financiers concerned with promoting democracy throughout the world, or is there a more sinister power at work? And what really happened to Princess Diana’s Mercedes one warm August nigh in a Paris underpass?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conspiracy looks at a range of the most interesting theories of this nature, from the risibly far-fetched, such as the belief that the world is run by the lizard people, to the only-too-true and tragic such as the overthrow and murder of Chilean President Salvador Allende.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A light-hearted STANDALONE CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE that will make you believe in love again.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I first met William McAlister when I was just a teenager. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He was handsome, had a beautiful wife and was on the verge of success, having just joined my father as his business partner. Mr. McAlister was full of smooth charm, but back then he was barely a blip on my radar. Just a family friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward ten years: I’m 25 years old and a single mom trying to make things right for her seven-year old son. I’ve made some mistakes, grappled with my demons and now I’m back in the city of Vancouver, getting a second chance at a better life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve started by working for my father’s production company as an executive assistant. My first day on the job and I already know I could have a promising career there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is until I see Will McAlister for the first time in a decade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now recently divorced and as sophisticated as always, Will has gone from being my father’s friend and business partner to something so much more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We’re both older, for one thing, and he just oozes this worldly confidence and stark sexuality. Combined with his tall, muscular build and sharp suits, strong jaw and bedroom eyes, Will has turned into one hell of a distraction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A distraction I’m having a hard time staying away from, considering his office is right across from my desk and I work with him in such close proximity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it’s just a harmless crush, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s just an innocent fantasy of screwing him on his desk, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It can’t ever be more because he’s my father’s best friend, business partner, and my boss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This novel is a light-hearted, swoony read. It doesn't contain any cheating but it does have ample amounts of sex and swearing.</description>

  <description>An R&amp;amp;B songstress….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad boy that got away…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they get a second chance at love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monique Starr’s music career is at an all-time low: she’s in danger of losing her label contract and an embarrassing event has her front and center in all the gossip blogs—for all the wrong reasons! She decides to head back to D.C. and the MacLaine Academy of the Performing Arts to revamp her image, give her career a badly needed boost, and get her groove back. But she comes home to find her old Academy ailing financially, her mentor battling cancer, and her ex—whom she left behind to seek fame and fortune—very angry and unwilling to give her a second chance. But being back home reminds Monique of her old dreams and what she lost along the way to success. Now faced with second chances, will the music diva choose between love or fame, passion or ambition?</description>

  <description>I was born a monster. Cruelty ran in my veins like poison. It ran in the veins of every Vitiello man, passed on from father to son, an endless spiral of monstrosity. A born monster shaped into an even worse monster by my father’s blade and fists and harsh words. I was raised to become Capo, to rule without mercy, to dish out brutality without a second thought.Raised to break others. When Aria was given to me in marriage, everyone waited with baited breath to see how fast I’d break her like my father broke his women. How I’d crush her innocence and kindness with the force of my cruelty.Breaking her would have taken little effort. It came naturally to me.I was gladly the monster everyone feared. Until her.Author's note: Bound By Honor in Luca's POV.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Welcome to the Den... &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seven years ago, Niklaus "Red" Volkov was offered an opportunity, one that would give him the ability to even the score with the Albanian mobsters that had tortured him for days and took the life of the only girl he'd loved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; But that gift came with strings... &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Molded into the perfect soldier, Niklaus joined an elite group of mercenaries, loyal to a mysterious man known only as The Kingmaker. He willingly paid the price for means to fulfill the vendetta that plagued him each day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Vengeance was all he knew... &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; And death was all he lived for... &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Until it wasn't... &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Until her... &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It all came down to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one who followed the rules, never went looking for trouble – I kept to myself. I just wanted to take care of my family. To not constantly look over my shoulder, worried about the things that went bump in the night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to survive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But that wasn’t meant to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As luck – or fate, or something – would have it, the trouble found me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I followed a rabbit through the wreckage of a half-ruined world to get back what was mine, and wound up at the end of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Wonderland. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there’s nothing magical about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(While Wonder does feature a central love story, it is not a contemporary romance novel)</description>

  <description>“In the Ring” introduces Dario “DC” Caivano, heavyweight champion, who is also a man with a heavy heart. It isn’t without reason, however. As a teenager, Dario witnessed the murder of someone that he loved like a brother, and it took a lot out of him. It hardened him and left little to trust. Years have passed since the horrific crime, but it hasn’t gotten Dario any closer to being a man that can love . . . or be loved. In fact, he’s his best self when he’s in the ring where he can release his aggressions, if only for twelve rounds of “play”, to escape to a world where he can repeatedly annihilate the person responsible for his cousin’s death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when he allows himself to come up for air?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chanel Norwood is a single parent and club owner who is something like a “Boss”. She’s fiercely independent and knows exactly what she wants out of life, and right now it isn’t to be in an intimate relationship. She’s too busy taking care of business and raising a preteen son. After a failed relationship, Chanel has sworn off men—especially athletes. In her eyes, she’s already had one too many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how long can you fight fate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dario and Chanel are thrown together, while the attraction is there, sparks don’t immediately fly. Both of them have lives and hearts that they’re very protective of. But as time goes on, they find there’s more to guard than just emotions when their worlds collide in a way that no one ever expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In the Ring” is not without secrets and drama. And along with that, it’s a story about love, loss, life and paths to new beginnings.</description>

The scandal of his affair has sent shockwaves through his re-election campaign, and threatens to derail everything he has worked for.

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Zane's legion of fans can't get enough of her way of telling a juicy, sexy story. In &lt;i&gt;Nervous,&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling queen of erotica brings us a tale of a woman with a split personality. Jonquinette has always been nervous around men, but on the weekends her alter ego, Jude, goes on intense sexual escapades. When Jonquinette seeks the help of Dr. Marcella Spencer, the psychiatrist Zane originated in her bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;Addicted,&lt;/i&gt; Jude's response is to go on a sexual rampage. In the meantime, Jonquinette becomes interested in her new neighbor, Mason, but Jude has no intention of letting Jonquinette fall in love -- not when Jude's having so much fun. Based on a short story of the same title from her bestselling collection &lt;i&gt;The Sex Chronicles, Nervous&lt;/i&gt; is classic Zane with an edge. So, relax, sit back. You're in for a nerve-tingling read.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As with everything else in my life, the descent into Hell was not so simple. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I jumped into the portal I expected to find the Sins on the other side. I expected to find my people—demons—waiting and ready. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What I found were flames and fire and ash. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The apocalypse hadn’t waited for me. It had already begun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hell’s barriers were collapsing in on themselves—making my task of finding the Sins infinitely harder. As the Horsemen and I set out on our journey to find them, we discover that not all is what it seems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A white-haired assassin once told me to beware of the evil that hides in plain sight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fight for Hell has begun, and the duty of saving it lies solely on my shoulders, but to win—to survive—I must unravel the secrets of the past if any of us are to see the future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will take what is mine, even if I have to bleed for it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They say there’s no rest for the wicked, and New Orleans never knew how true that was until I came to town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody told me that when I entered the transition, the very gifts of my demonic lineage would be used against me. Nobody warned me that the flames of Hell would burn from within. Or that I’d be driven to lust and madness, my chaotic magic becoming more wild and unruly than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to save myself—and the world—was to give the beast what she wanted: control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if transitioning wasn’t enough, my presence was now known, and my enemies were mounting. While the beast was intent on claiming our Four Horsemen, there were things to be done. People to find. Demons to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when they make a deal with the devil—let’s just say that neither world will ever be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long live the Queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can survive becoming immortal, that is.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;So…as it turns out, I really am Lucifer’s Daughter. Hell’s Heir. And—you guessed it—the next Queen of the Damned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if I don’t want to rule?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the imp in hiding, and Josh gone from this world, I still wasn’t safe. Not by a long shot. Dear ol’ Dad didn’t just pass on his legacy and mark. He also passed on all of Hell’s problems, and that means his enemies, are now mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for me, I have the Four Horsemen, my banshee best friend, and a pissed off raccoon on my side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I have the beast to contend with. My psychotic, possessive, and downright scary alter-ego was dead set on having the Horsemen, not only at my back, but in my bed. As if learning to control the flames of Hell wasn’t a hard enough job by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would it have been too hard for Lucifer to write a handbook before he died?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;We’ve all heard the story of the Four Horsemen. Harbingers of the apocalypse. Destruction given form. Four of the sexiest—wait no—forget that. You get my point.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise when I find out everything I’ve ever been told, is a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. Let’s start from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Ruby Morningstar. I run a tattoo parlor in Portland with my bestfriend, have a pet raccoon, a crazy ex that stalks me, not to mention this one little thing… I’m a demon. Half-succubus, to be exact. For the last twenty-three years of my life, that’s the story I believed, but on the day a handsome stranger bails me out of jail my world is turned upside down, and suddenly I don’t know who I am anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Four Horsemen aren’t the bringers of the apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about never catching a break.</description>

  <description>Alika Cambridge is the wife of Rush, mother to an adorable set of twins and stepmother to a beautiful preteen. But she is also someone's daughter. A someone that Alika has absolutely no connection to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Davina Bianchi. Having abandoned Alika as an infant, Davina has been desperately seeking out the daughter she walked away from. Alika, on the other hand, has no desire to enter a relationship with this woman from her past. In fact, Alika has made it perfectly clear that she already has a family and that she has on room for any more. But Davina is not giving up. She plans to do whatever she can to get just a moment to speak her peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, for Davina, she's never met Rush. She doesn't know that Rush does whatever he needs to do to protect his family. This time is no different. Davina better watch out. Especially, when it's revealed that her intentions for Alika, aren't as pure as she's made them out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get ready for this rollercoaster ride of both highs and lows that will finish out the Rapture series. There will be a few new characters introduced, but this will always be Rush &amp;amp; Alika's story, so expect to see plenty of the couple as they weave through the thick webs that await them.</description>

  <description>The first novel in Colleen Oakes’s epic, imaginative series tells the origin of one of the most infamous villains—the Queen of Hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinah is the princess who will one day reign over Wonderland. She has not yet seen the dark depths of her kingdom; she longs only for her father’s approval and a future with the boy she loves. But when a betrayal breaks her heart and threatens her throne, she is launched into Wonderland’s dangerous political game. Dinah must stay one step ahead of her cunning enemies or she’ll lose not just the crown but her head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evil is brewing in Wonderland and maybe, most frighteningly, in Dinah herself.</description>

  <description>Nobody expected them to fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;When Aria was given to Luca in marriage, people were sure he’d break her. &lt;br /&gt;Aria feared the worst from a man like him. &lt;br /&gt;A man without mercy. &lt;br /&gt;But somehow she gained his love. &lt;br /&gt;Love - a weakness a Capo like Luca shouldn’t risk. &lt;br /&gt;When Aria betrays Luca by going behind his back for her family, she realizes too late that she might have lost what she’s fought so hard to get in the first place: Luca’s trust. &lt;br /&gt;The trust of a man who never allowed himself to trust someone unconditionally before. &lt;br /&gt;Can their love survive in a world of betrayal and death?</description>

  <description>To get what he wants, he’ll have to play a game of dirty pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michel Marcello never wanted to be a mafioso like every other man in his family—he wanted to be more. That doesn’t mean he’s unfamiliar with the life, or that he can’t hold his own against other made men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They forgot where he came from …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His chance encounter with the fiery and beautiful daughter of Detroit’s most notorious Irish mob boss stokes flames beyond the ones that ignite between Michel and Gabbie Casey. Rivals shouldn’t mix, but these opposites have never been more attracted, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lines between family loyalty, their duties, and responsibility begin to blur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love ruins all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these two aren’t the only ones playing this game, and it just became far more dangerous to get out alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dirty Pool is a standalone romantic suspense.</description>

  <description>The genius and the prodigy ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nazio “Naz” Donati is brilliant, sinful, and criminal. A genius from the moment he was born, and a man who's still trying to learn how to navigate and balance this thing called life. He certainly wasn't expecting love to practically fall right into his hands, never mind for love to take the form of his best friend's little sister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rosalynn ”Roz” Puzza is talented, beautiful, and driven. A pianist prodigy from the second they sat her at a piano as a little girl, and a young woman who isn't sure if she's truly earned her spot on the stage. She wasn't expecting a man like him to take her focus and change her muse, never mind to distract her from the thing she thought she wanted the most. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, first love is intense. &lt;br /&gt;All-consuming. &lt;br /&gt;Crazy. &lt;br /&gt;And you just have to ride it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When brilliance and talent crash together, it can make magic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Naz &amp;amp; Roz is a contemporary romance that is meant to be read as an add-on to the Cross + Catherine series, and is not intended to be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>When the Maldives meet the mistletoe, it's sure to be a beautiful Christmas ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Business in the Maldives brings the Chicago Outfit's boss away for the holidays, but why not bring everyone else along for the ride, too? Wives, kids ... the whole bunch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nothing can go wrong, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Join the original crew from The Chicago War one more time as they celebrate Christmas in the Maldives, tinsel and mistletoe included. Meet the babies, and catch up with everything that's happened since the last time we were with them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For once, no one is spilling blood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The war has already been won. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Featuring all the original couples, Maldives &amp;amp; Mistletoe is a 20k Chicago War Christmas Novella meant for fans of the series, and is not intended to be read as a standalone novel.</description>

  <description>They say heavy is the head that wears the crown … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Andino Marcello’s world is turned upside down when he becomes the next heir apparent to the Marcello empire. He was comfortable in his place as a Capo, but comfort is for the weak in the world of mafioso. The boss’s seat is waiting. It takes meeting a tattooed beauty who has no idea who &lt;br /&gt;Andino is or the criminal legacy he now carries beneath his three-piece suits, and charming smile for him to finally bend the rules set out for him. That doesn’t mean he can keep her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say things that never challenge you won’t change you … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Haven Murphy is doing her own thing, and she does it well. The owner of a successful Brooklyn strip club, she makes it her only goal to never fail. She’s just trying to live her life when a morning jog puts her face to face with a man that will change the direction of her life with a single conversation. She knows there’s a dark side to him beyond his good looks, and three-piece suits, but it’s hard for her to care when she wants him. That doesn’t mean he can be hers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s going to break her heart; she’s going to keep his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because duty waits on no one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Duty is part one of a two-part Duet following the same couple.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From acclaimed author Alyssa Cole comes the tale of a city Cinderella &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;and her Prince Charming in disguise . . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between grad school and multiple jobs, Naledi Smith doesn’t have time for fairy tales…or patience for the constant e-mails claiming she’s betrothed to an African prince. Sure. Right. &lt;em&gt;Delete! &lt;/em&gt;As a former foster kid, she’s learned that the only things she can depend on are herself and the scientific method, and a silly e-mail won’t convince her otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Thabiso is the sole heir to the throne of Thesolo, shouldering the hopes of his parents and his people. At the top of their list? His marriage. Ever dutiful, he tracks down his missing betrothed. When Naledi mistakes the prince for a pauper, Thabiso can’t resist the chance to experience life—and love—without the burden of his crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between them is instant and irresistible, and flirty friendship quickly evolves into passionate nights. But when the truth is revealed, can a princess in theory become a princess ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selected as one of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; 100 Notable Books of 2018! &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>A shadow meets the light … &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When someone needs to disappear, the Chicago mob calls on Joe Rossi. A man who can move without a sound, and kill without a word, they don’t call him the Shadow for nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, it’s a New York crime family in need of his skills, but it takes one glimpse of her to make him agree to the job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liliana Marcello is every inch a principessa della mafia. Her life has taught her to be wary of strangers, yet her ballet career contradicts everything by putting her on display. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a man with a dark smile and a constantly changing demeanor that makes her feel safe again, but it’s the unknown that holds her back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes one look … &lt;br /&gt;One dance …&lt;br /&gt;One word … &lt;br /&gt;One smile to captivate a man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one second to kill a woman because of it, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all monsters hide in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;How are you supposed to see them coming?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the wealthy Murdochs of Chesterton, Virginia, managing scandalous damage and killer drama is now their only chance at survival . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For Evan Murdoch, the bad news just won't stop. As he battles an attempted murder charge, he’s on the verge of getting forced out of the family corporation—and fears he can't trust his new wife, Lelia. Enter savvy family matriarch Ella, whose wild-card schemes might be the answer to his prayers—or lead to disaster like he’s never seen. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; With Evan sidelined, his ex-playboy brother Terrence struggles to keep Murdoch Conglomerated from catastrophe by becoming the new public face for the company. But a secret he tries to hide from his fiancée could send his best intentions—and last chance at love—down in flames.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Fiery Murdoch sister, Paulette, will do anything to protect her infant son—and her secrets. But her worst nightmare is about to come true. And with their vengeful half-brother, Dante Turner, closing in on the family he despises, the Marvelous Murdochs could pay a price that could finish them once and for all . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Best Kept Secrets&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;“Secrets abound in this full-bodied tale.” --USAToday.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This fantastic novel is replete with scandal, entitlement, treachery and passion up to the surprising end.”&lt;i&gt; –RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Drama, hot sex, and betrayals are all wrapped up in this addictive yet well-written story.” —AAMBC Book Club</description>

  <description>She’s in the mood for a little distraction . . . but will she take a chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bina MacLaine is having a rough time. Still haunted by an ugly breakup that meant walking away from her fiancé and her high-rise apartment, now the dance teacher faces the possibility of losing her job, too, if her performance academy closes. When Maurice Hewett, one of her old ballet students, arrives in town, Bina sees he’s not the goofy boy she once knew—but a very handsome, very sexy grown man. She wonders if he can weave a spell that can help her forget all her woes. But can Bina let her desire take the lead without feeling like she’s robbing the cradle—and making a huge mistake?</description>

  <description>Details of the sea witch’s banishment have been exaggerated. The body count that preempted it was not. Once an illustrious princess, her hands and tentacles were stained with the blood of thousands. No one could comprehend how the hooks of madness dragged her down from her life of privilege. Born Princess Vanessa of Atlantica, the ambitious young royal was one of two children born to the great King Poseidon. She and her brother, Triton, were groomed from birth to rule. Yet only one would ascend that coveted throne. While carefree Triton flits through his training with a cavalier demeanor and beguiling charm, Vanessa’s hunger for her father’s acceptance drives her to push herself to the limits of magic, and combat to become a leader worthy of her people. When war against the humans ravages their once regal kingdom, political sides are chosen. Factions from the seven seas challenge the existing leadership, pitting Vanessa against her brother in a vicious battle for the crown. Traitors are exposed, dark family secrets revealed, and a once strong sibling bond is strained to its breaking point. Only when the ink black waters from the ultimate betrayal rescind, will the truth be known of how the villainous sea witch rose with one name on her vengeful lips--Triton.</description>

  <description>The crime boss and the hustling queen are back for one last goodbye … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cross and Catherine watch as their kids grow up, and everything changes again. Life is still as busy as it ever was for these two, and their family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cece and Nazio are trying to figure this life thing out. From toddling babies to wedding bells, everything they’ve ever wanted is already at their fingertips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Go behind the scenes and beyond the final chapter of the Cross + Catherine series in The Companion to find never-before-seen POVs, deleted scenes, future outtakes, and short stories—all requested by readers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Each snapshot is written in short-story form, and meant to be enjoyed as individual pieces by the readers of the Cross + Catherine series. It is not standalone, and is not intended to be read as one.</description>

  <description>The Alchemy Initiative—a doomed scientist’s failed attempt to harvest human souls from the afterlife and bind them to complex machines—has been reinitiated. But it doesn’t take long to discover why the program responsible for making Ethan Remington the ultimate weapon was shut down when the spirit of the highly unstable and murderous Agent Drekker goes rogue, embarking on a sinister rampage in an attempt to claim the ultimate prize. That prize is Ethan—everything that Ethan has and everyone who he loves. No one is safe, especially young Hogan who has begun to display some frightening and incredible abilities. To stop this insatiable evil, Ethan may have to forfeit his humanity…and even his soul.</description>

  <description>Siena Calabrese is no longer the prized daughter of la famiglia. Her transgressions against her brothers and family have stained more than just her reputation. Her best chance at keeping breath in her lungs would be to sit down and shut up like she was taught to do. She definitely shouldn't be feeding information to her family's enemies. And yet, she is still willing to risk it all for a chance at forever with Johnathan Marcello. After everything, how could she not? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The disgraced one … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Johnathan Marcello’s life and secrets have now been put on display for everyone to see. There's no hiding the things he's tried to keep hidden, but maybe that's the best thing that could have happened. Now he's about to walk straight into a war between rival mafia families, and he's got choices to make. His love is on one side, he's on the other, and everybody is playing for keeps. He'll play the game just as dirty as anyone else to get what he wants, even to the detriment of himself. For her, how could he not? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shamed one … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's time that the forgotten king takes back his throne. It's already been too long since it was taken from him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when has anything in this life been easy?</description>

  <description>Fresh out of prison after serving a three-year sentence, Johnathan Marcello wants to get back to normal business as a mafia capo. The rules set out for him are clear—keep out of trouble, maintain a low profile, and stay stable. But stability is a delicate balance for a man like John, and shaky ground is only a single step away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter with a blue-eyed woman might just change his whole world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Siena Calabrese’s life revolves around cooking numbers, and scrubbing books clean. After all, a girl is only useful to men in the mafia, if she isn’t totally useless. As long as she does what they want, then she can maintain the illusion of freedom. But illusions are only delusions in the grand scheme of her life, and reality is far more dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A man with secrets might just be the one thing she didn’t know she needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this life, family is everything. Or, that’s how it should be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Distrust. &lt;br /&gt;Love. &lt;br /&gt;Betrayal. &lt;br /&gt;Loyalty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mix it all together, and it makes for a volatile city. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A war is coming.</description>

  <description>Sex is his weapon. &lt;br /&gt;Power is her drug. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caesar Accardo is gasoline. Mostly harmless while stable, but Aria holds the match to set the dishonored Cosa Nostra prince on fire in more ways than one. And if he burns down everything in his path because of it—so be it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is … she just wasn’t prepared for all of him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aria De Rose is a hurricane. Amazing from afar, but destructive up close. Caesar keeps getting pulled into the Camorra queen’s plans in her effort to gain power, but he’s a better player than she knows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing is … women like her are the reason why rules are meant to be broken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Philadelphia isn’t ready for game these two are playing—the sacrifices they make might not be worth it in the end, and someone will always lose in a war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’re broken, so very vicious, and they are not the good guys. But for every villain in the world, there’s a monster at his back who made him that way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And monsters like those hide in plain sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is a standalone romance with content that some might find triggering. Be warned, and read with caution.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;on April 4, 1968. A young lawyer named Cotton Malone happened upon an explosive secret about what really happened that day—one that haunts him still. . . &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Known as a maverick in the field, Malone was doing legal work for the U.S. Navy when Stephanie Nelle, a high-ranking member of the Justice Department, sought his help in investigating a delicate situation involving a stolen rare coin and a rogue FBI faction. Soon, Malone realizes that the Justice Department and the FBI are really at war over something else entirely: a cadre of secret files about the King assassination. Caught in the midst of this epic clash, Malone ultimately discovers a shocking truth—one that could ruin innocent lives and threaten the legacy of the civil rights movement’s greatest martyr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, from the raucous bars of Mexico to the clear waters of the Dry Tortugas, the annals of history to the halls of power within Washington, D.C., Malone’s decision to see this case through to its rightful conclusion will not only change his own life but the course of history itself. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; “Fast-paced and exciting…Berry has a knack for presenting alternative history that seems as though it might be true.”—&lt;i&gt;Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;(starred review) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A compelling historical mystery with a terrific payoff.”—Associated Press&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>What’s done in the dark… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Murderer is a title she never expected to wear. Friend? Sure. Boss? Hell yes. But murderer? Never. If only she hadn’t threatened exactly that, just before someone winds up dead, and her fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. &lt;br /&gt;Always comes to light… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All he wanted was to live a quiet life, without all the danger and darkness of his past. Those plans are blown when he’s accused of a crime he has nothing to do with, leaving him with a hard decision… remain in the shadows, or do what he can to help a friend? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When other crimes start stacking up – the handiwork of an anonymous suspect with an unknown vendetta, they’ll discover something that flips their worlds upside down… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A murder accusation may be the least of their worries.</description>

  <description>Camilla Donati doesn’t do relationships—it’s just not her thing. She wants a fun time, not a long time. She might be exactly what Tommaso Rossi needs to make his vacation from the responsibilities as a Capo, a break worth taking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He didn’t expect to find a woman like her with a mind full of filth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn’t expect a man who would shatter all of her rules with only a grin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicago keeps calling Tommaso home, and further out of reach from the one thing he wants more than ever. Camilla’s restless heart keeps getting in the way even when it’s stuck between what is, and what could be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should have been easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn’t have to be messy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love is effortless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s people who make it hard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effortless: A Legacy Novel is a standalone contemporary erotic romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;To save mankind’s future, the members of Sigma Force must make a devil’s bargain as they join forces with their most hated enemy to stop an ancient threat in this gripping adventure from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author James Rollins.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE DEMON CROWN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the coast of Brazil, a team of scientists discovers a horror like no other, an island where all life has been eradicated, consumed and possessed by a species beyond imagination. Before they can report their discovery, a mysterious agency attacks the group, killing them all, save one, an entomologist, an expert on venomous creatures, Professor Ken Matsui from Cornell University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangest of all, this inexplicable threat traces back to a terrifying secret buried a century ago beneath the National Mall: a cache of bones preserved in amber. The artifact was hidden away by a cabal of scientists—led by Alexander Graham Bell—to protect humankind. But they dared not destroy it, for the object also holds an astonishing promise for the future: &lt;i&gt;the very secret of life after death&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, nothing stays buried forever. An ancient horror—dormant in the marrow of those preserved bones—is free once more, nursed and developed into a weapon of incalculable strength and malignancy, ready to wreak havoc on an unsuspecting world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To stop its spread, Commander Grayson Pierce of Sigma Force must survive a direct attack on the island of Maui. &lt;i&gt;To be there first&lt;/i&gt; has always been the core mission of Sigma Force, a covert team forged to be America’s front line against emerging threats. But this time, even Sigma may not be able to decipher this deadly mystery, one that traces back to the founding of the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each new discovery, the menace they hunt is changing, growing, spreading—adapting and surviving every attempt to stop it from reconquering a world it once ruled. And each transformation makes it stronger . . . and smarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running out of time and options, Commander Grayson Pierce will be forced to make an impossible choice. To eradicate this extinction-level threat and expose those involved, he will have to join forces with Sigma’s greatest enemy—the newly resurrected Guild—even it if means sacrificing one of his own.</description>

  <description>In this life, nothing comes easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James "Mac" Maccari is proof of that. Having fought his way through the ranks of the Pivetti Crime Family, Mac is willing to do whatever it takes to maintain that position. His wife and son are his everything. But sometimes when a man thinks he has it all, life throws a curveball. When it comes to Cosa Nostra, some curveballs are deadly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melina Morgan Maccari never imagined having the life she does now. A powerful husband. A child she loves more than her own life. Newly secure in her position as a made man’s wife, Melina is finally starting to believe a happily ever after might exist. That is, until she's reminded that there is danger where you least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some bosses are made, not born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the powerful Pivetti crime boss is targeted by law enforcement, his seat is up for grabs, and there is more than one man who thinks he is right for the job. But one man in power could spell disaster for Mac and Melina. Mac is left with no choice but to make one last attempt to secure the future for both his families or watch everything he loves go up in flames. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come Hell or high water, when Melina vowed to be Mac's moll, it was for life. With an organization in chaos, and threats facing her family, she is ready to do anything necessary to stamp out the danger once and for all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, bloodshed requires a woman's touch.</description>

  <description>Max Masters was born into a post-Incident world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, a beast decimated the population of the Americas and the resulting carnage was enough to weaken the very barriers separating Earth from other, far more dangerous worlds—and the monsters that roam within them. As a paranormal marshal struggling with her own less-than-human identity, Max is responsible for hunting down the most dangerous of supernatural creatures, working side-by-side with government operatives who specialize in keeping the human population safe. One of those operatives happens to be a six-foot-five, bullheaded but charming ex-boyfriend who won’t accept no for an answer—especially when it comes to Max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an abnormal energy spike indicates that a being of exponential power has migrated through a barrier, people across Max’s territory suddenly began dying or disappearing. But when a particularly gruesome murder hits too close to home, Max is forced into the fight of her life.</description>

  <description>"Between Lost and Found is moving, thoughtful, and entirely original. The small town of Mammoth Falls, with its cast of characters that are wild, imperfect, and human, leaps off the page. Shelly Stratton is adept at portraying just how complicated the human heart can be." - Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of Maybe in Another Life &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janelle Marshall's life is finally going according to plan. Her perfect, upscale career and her perfect, successful boyfriend will make her future as secure and predictable as her childhood never was. And with luck, Little Bill, the grandfather who raised her, will someday understand why she d rather play it safe than be impulsive. But just when she should be happiest, she gets a distressing call: Little Bill has gone missing. Now Janelle must go to the one place she's long avoided the tiny mountain town of Mammoth Falls, South Dakota. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracking down her eccentric grandfather is easier said than done, and Janelle has no choice but to stay as long as it takes. Yet little by little, she's drawn in by the unique town, the helpful locals, and their distinctly straightforward ways. Before long, she realizes that those who also care about Little Bill are struggling with their own vulnerabilities and secrets as deep as the mistakes they try to set right. As Janelle learns to draw on their support and hard-won experience, she'll challenge her past, come to terms with her present and chart her own surprising course forward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant, heartfelt, and uplifting, &lt;i&gt;Between Lost and Found&lt;/i&gt; is about gaining the courage to take chances, learning to let go, and rediscovering the family and the self you thought you knew "</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She was irresistible to every man…except one&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily Borsage is the ultimate siren: gorgeous, aloof and irresistible to all the men in Bayou La Siryna. All of them, that is, until Nashoba Bowman comes back to town. The Native American kid whose innocent first kiss Lily remembers fondly is now all grown-up, hot as an Alabama summer—and immune to Lily's charms. What self-respecting mermaid could resist finding out more? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nash has a dark history that puts any woman he loves in grave danger, and a heritage of power he isn't ready to accept. And Lily has a secret that no mortal man can ever know. When a mysterious enemy starts menacing Lily, they will both have to risk everything—and embrace their deepest destinies—if they want to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: the ISBN for this book was reused on a completely different book - ISBN 13: 9780373009336&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in the bayou, a strange and beautiful world of merfolk exists… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mermaid Jet Borsage never fit in with her own kind. Her dark hair and eyes set her apart from the other merfolk. Which was why she fell for the wrong man, and why she is still paying the price. One that has made her unwilling to trust any man. Until she meets Landry Fields… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agent Landry Fields is investigating Jet's former boyfriend, but he knows Jet is hiding something, as well. At first he believed the beauty was involved in her ex-boyfriend's dangerous undersea excavations. But when he realizes he is falling for a real-live mermaid, Landry's by-the-book beliefs are rocked. Now can he save Jet and her clan from modern-day pirates to claim a future with the feisty beauty?</description>

  <description>What a difference a day can make. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mia Caruso grew up under the roof of a tyrant. Her father was an enforcer for the DeLuca crime family who ruled his home with the same brutality that his job required, her mother was the silent trophy he'd always wanted and Mia was only ever in the way. She'd endured the abuse for years, her only solace was the hope that one day she would be free from his iron fists. Just shy of her eighteenth birthday and four months away from a fresh start at college, he showed up and turned her world upside down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carlo DeLuca was at the top of his game, master of his own universe, he ran the most successful organized crime syndicate on the west coast. He'd worked his ass off to build his empire after his father had nearly bled it dry, and he wouldn't allow anything to threaten that. Carlo ruled with a cold indifference that terrified even the most brutal of men, and today was no exception, he had a rat to dispose of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when he looked into a of pair amber eyes and saw a fire that rivaled his own, he knew nothing would be the same again.</description>

  <description>Gian Guzzi has everything a mafia boss could want, but it comes with strings. He shouldn’t be wasting time on a redhead he can’t have, when men like him are not allowed to be affected by silly things like love. A boss’s job is never done, and Gian has far better things to worry about—what with someone wanting him dead, and someone else wanting him in prison for good. Yet, he keeps risking it all for one more taste of Cara Rossi. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A man without love is no man at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cara Rossi is left devastated by the things Gian Guzzi didn’t say. She also can’t forget all the things he did say. She needs to focus on moving on from him, not falling right back into his bed once more. Then again, reality has a way of ruining those plans with far more beautiful, unexpected things. Even if it means Cara is forced to question everything, from her morals to her reputation. All to be one woman to one man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A woman without respect is a dirty word. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Duty. Legacy. Love. &lt;br /&gt;Always in that order. &lt;br /&gt;Or … that’s how it should be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But life is messy, when entangled with love. &lt;br /&gt;Rules don’t apply.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the iconic and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Mummy&lt;/i&gt; and The Vampire Chronicles, a mesmerizing, glamorous new tale of ancient feuds and modern passions. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramses the Great, former pharaoh of Egypt, is reawakened by the elixir of life in Edwardian England. Now immortal with his bride-to-be, he is swept up in a fierce and deadly battle of wills and psyches against the once-great Queen Cleopatra. Ramses has reawakened Cleopatra with the same perilous elixir whose unworldly force brings the dead back to life. But as these ancient rulers defy one another in their quest to understand the powers of the strange elixir, they are haunted by a mysterious presence even older and more powerful than they, a figure drawn forth from the mists of history who possesses spectacular magical potions and tonics eight millennia old. This is a figure who ruled over an ancient kingdom stretching from the once-fertile earth of the Sahara to the far corners of the world, a queen with a supreme knowledge of the deepest origins of the elixir of life. She may be the only one who can make known to Ramses and Cleopatra the key to their immortality--and the secrets of the miraculous, unknowable, endless expanse of the universe.</description>

  <description>The first time the Nightmares came, it nearly cost Alice her life. Now she's trained to battle monstrous creatures in the dark dream realm known as Wonderland with magic weapons and hardcore fighting skills. Yet even warriors have a curfew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life in real-world Atlanta isn't always so simple, as Alice juggles an overprotective mom, a high-maintenance best friend, and a slipping GPA. Keeping the Nightmares at bay is turning into a full-time job. But when Alice's handsome and mysterious mentor is poisoned, she has to find the antidote by venturing deeper into Wonderland than she’s ever gone before. And she'll need to use everything she's learned in both worlds to keep from losing her head . . . literally.</description>

  <description>Cara Rossi’s life has been a mess ever since her identical twin was killed. She blames the mafia, its ways, and the people within the caustic culture for a painful reality that turned her world on its side. In an attempt to momentarily pause her misery, a night out puts her on a path with a man she shouldn’t get involved with simply because of his last name—Gian Guzzi. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s the kind of man that makes it hard to say no. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gian Guzzi’s problems are piling up fast. A murdered grandfather, an unpredictable mafia, and a new boss that threatens both his family’s legacy and his life. As a Cosa Nostra underboss, Gian has a duty. First to la famiglia, and only then to himself. In the midst of the violent uncertainty that has become unrelenting in his days, Cara Rossi should only be a distraction for him to enjoy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s a happiness that he was never allowed to choose before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His lies. &lt;br /&gt;This life. &lt;br /&gt;Their love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It all unravels eventually.</description>

But his relationship with his journalist girlfriend may not survive--especially when she reconnects with her family, her church--and her ex... &lt;br /&gt;After the attempt on his life, half-brother Dante Turner lays low--but not for long.

  <description>For centuries, historians have speculated that the Queen of Sheba is nothing more than a seductive legend; but when undercover agent Omar Zagouri finds a tomb in a tunnel beneath Jerusalem, he unearths cryptic clues that may lead to the queen’s final resting place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This discovery, if authentic, could throw into question the governmental claim to the Holy Land—and prove the Bible false. Wealthy collectors, ruthless archaeologists, and officials from Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel, and Yemen scramble to find and lay claim to the secret site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Richard Lyon of Brown University, the world’s leading expert on the queen, is found murdered in his office, setting off a chain of deadly events. Omar desperately works to piece together the puzzle to locate the queen’s burial ground, fearing another assassination will take place. He teams up with one of Lyon’s protégées as well as with his ex-girlfriend, agent Mia Golding, in order to unravel the truth about the queen, expose a murderer, and reveal a timeless story of love, revenge, and sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revised edition: This edition of &lt;i&gt;Finding Sheba&lt;/i&gt; includes editorial revisions.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Long before she was the terror of Wonderland—the infamous Queen of Hearts—she was just a girl who wanted to fall in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine may be one of the most desired girls in Wonderland, and a favorite of the unmarried King of Hearts, but her interests lie elsewhere. A talented baker, all she wants is to open a shop with her best friend. But according to her mother, such a goal is unthinkable for the young woman who could be the next queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Cath meets Jest, the handsome and mysterious court joker. For the first time, she feels the pull of true attraction. At the risk of offending the king and infuriating her parents, she and Jest enter into an intense, secret courtship. Cath is determined to define her own destiny and fall in love on her terms. But in a land thriving with magic, madness, and monsters, fate has other plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her first stand-alone teen novel, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author dazzles us with a prequel to &lt;i&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>"The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came into the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the heroes of renown." Genesis 6:4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Nephilim, and a princess. &lt;br /&gt;I do not follow The One God.&lt;br /&gt;I am destined to be a queen, to rule a city beside whichever aged Nephilim king or prince my father betroths me to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I meet Japheth, son of Noah, son of Lamech, and he changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He changes me, and his father changes the world.</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Joyce Meyer teaches readers how to transform their lives by tapping into the power of hope. One of the most powerful forces in the universe is hope--the happy and confident anticipation that something good is going to happen. Regardless of where one is in life, it is impossible to live successfully and to the fullest without hope. With GET YOUR HOPES UP! Joyce will help readers achieve a lasting sense of hope, built on their faith in God. Hope is only as strong as its source. This book will help readers avoid misplacing their trust in unreliable things, and help them ground their hope steadfastly in God for limitless joy and possibilities for their lives. As Joyce explains, "Without hope in God, there isn't much you can do, but with Hope in God, there isn't much you can't do."</description>

  <description>I know exactly why it turns you on…because you’re messed up too. &lt;br /&gt;Asha’s life is no fairytale, by any stretch of the imagination. There was no kind, generous father to care for and protect her from the Vegas that exists beyond the glitz and glamour of The Strip. No wise, doting mother to look over and guide her, passing down essential lessons and leading her to the right path. And certainly no Prince Charming just around the corner, ready to rescue her from working late nights to cover steadily mounting bills. &lt;br /&gt;But she’s alive. Overwhelmed with responsibility she never asked for, carrying secrets and scars that haunt her, and singularly focused on an uncertain path to escape, but… alive. &lt;br /&gt;You’re not born to sharks without becoming one yourself. &lt;br /&gt;In Vegas, King is exactly what his name implies. Born into money and influence, but respected – and feared – in his own right. The privileges of wealth have afforded him many things: freedom, power, massive eligibility – while simultaneously leaving him exposed to others: betrayal, exploitation, and manipulation. &lt;br /&gt;But he learned. The tolls of duplicity, wrath, and vengeance have taught him to be more mindful, more shrewd, to keep himself clear of the vulnerability of certain situations, certain business deals, certain places, and certain women. &lt;br /&gt;Women like Asha. &lt;br /&gt;Like attracts like… &lt;br /&gt;Her poker face has kept her alive all this time, and he keeps his cards close to his chest. Neither is interested in gambling their hearts, but when they can’t stay away from each other, there’s only one choice… ante up. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>***STANDALONE NOVEL. NO CLIFFHANGER*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Malina &lt;br /&gt;Everything I do is for my daughter. I only want the best for her life. So when her father finally decided that after three years he wanted to get to know her, I put my feelings aside and allowed him in. Not to be with me, but to be a daddy to her. Well, a few things came with him that I wasn’t prepared for—a crazy ass girlfriend who wanted to guard her territory at any cost, and a fine ass uncle that made it clear he wanted my attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My best friend Laney is telling me to go for it, but my conscience is messing with me on a daily and telling me that it’s just too close for comfort. But the heart wants what the heart wants and before long, I start to feel that pull toward this man who makes me feel like no other man ever has. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zeke &lt;br /&gt;When I first saw Malina, I knew I had to have her. Yeah, there’s code that says if your family has touched the merchandise, then you don’t entertain it. But Malina isn’t just any woman. Because not one woman that I’ve ever encountered made me want to reach out and touch her on sight—but she did. From the way she carried herself, to the way she looked at me, I knew that if she let me in, she would know what it was like to be loved for real . . . and by a real man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rocco &lt;br /&gt;I’m not perfect by any means. I’ve done my share of dirt. I can’t even say for sure that my dirty deeds are done. I love women . . . a lot of them. As a result, I’ve had a few babies along the way—babies that I haven’t always done right by; so I’m setting out to change that and do what a real father is supposed to do. Problem is the woman that I’m “with” doesn’t really grasp the concept of what it is I’m trying to do and her reaction to it all causes a whole lot of chaos. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kia &lt;br /&gt;I’m territorial. I don’t make excuses for it. It’s who I am. And when I feel that somebody is trying to step into my zone and steal what belongs to me, I react. This chick, Malina, who opened her legs to my man and had his child, thinks she’s going to come in with her daughter and claim a spot that never belonged to her. She’s dead wrong. If I have to show her what that means, that’s what it’ll be. But she won’t like it if it does come down to that, so if I was her, I’d tread carefully. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Family Ties” is a love story at its core, but inside of this love story, many other themes appear; the primary one being that love really has no boundaries when it comes to family… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A FULL Excerpt can be found here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.perriforrest.com/category/family-ties/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.perriforrest.com/category/...&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Strong language content that some readers may find to be offensive.***</description>

  <description>Everybody knows you don’t marry the rebound guy. &lt;br /&gt;And yet, that’s exactly what Charlie does. But once the husband is out of picture — kinda — she’s ready to leap forward with her life. She returns to the neighborhood she left, the business she missed, and into arm’s reach of Nixon — the reason she needed a rebound guy in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Other than rebuilding her life, Charlie has one main goal now that she’s back in the place she considers home: Stay as far away from Nixon as she can. But their long history, his magnetic charm, and a certain sense of unfinished business makes that much, much harder than Charlie thought.&lt;br /&gt;Nixon is willing to own up to his part in their break up, but for Charlie, finding a place of forgiveness is going to take much more than that. She’s willing to take a chance on friendship — something they’ve had since they were kids — but falling in love again? That’s a whole different story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I hate you.&lt;/i&gt; I heard those words so many times from his mouth that they lost their meaning. His “three loving words” is how I mockingly referred to them. It didn’t bother me, though, because I hated him, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was gorgeous, with dark tousled hair, full lips, a strong jaw, and a body deserving of a magazine cover. He was rich and cared for his mother deeply. On paper, he was the perfect husband. The problem? He was &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dreamed of a fairytale love story for as long as I could remember. I dreamed of a boy to fall head over heels for me and treat me like the sun rose and set at my feet, especially after living in the shadow of my perfect sister and never feeling good enough for my family. When I decided to earn my parents’ love in a dramatic fashion, I’ll admit that I never imagined marrying him would end up part of the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker? Enzo Faust didn’t want to marry me, either. And yet, here we are, a man that I both fear and loathe is my “I do…for better or worse.” I just didn’t anticipate that it’d be more ‘worse’ than ‘better.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m Paige Stiles, and here’s my story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A war that will fuel her. A bond that will destroy her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emelina Flores has come home to Ruina. After rescuing her sister, Olivia, from imprisonment in rival kingdom Lera, Em and Olivia together vow to rebuild Ruina to its former glory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just because Em and Olivia are out of Lera doesn’t mean they are safe. Their actions over the past year have had consequences, and they are now targets of retaliation. Olivia will destroy everyone who acts against Ruina. Em isn’t as sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Em posed as Prince Casimir’s betrothed in Lera, she’s started to see another side to this war. Lera may have destroyed the Ruined for decades, but Em knows that Cas is different. And now that he’s taken the throne, Em believes a truce is within reach. But Olivia suspects that Em’s romantic feelings for Cas are just coloring her judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em is determined to bring peace to her home. But when winning the war could mean betraying her family, she faces an impossible choice between loyalty and love. Em must stay one step ahead of her enemies—and her blood—before she’s the next victim in this battle for sovereignty.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A revenge that will consume her. A love that will ruin her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emelina Flores has nothing. Her home in Ruina has been ravaged by war. She lacks the powers of her fellow Ruined. Worst of all, she witnessed her parents’ brutal murders and watched helplessly as her sister, Olivia, was kidnapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because Em has nothing, she has nothing to lose. Driven by a blind desire for revenge, Em sets off on a dangerous journey to the enemy kingdom of Lera. Somewhere within Lera’s borders, Em hopes to find Olivia. But in order to find her, Em must infiltrate the royal family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a brilliant, elaborate plan of deception and murder, Em marries Prince Casimir, next in line to take Lera’s throne. If anyone in Lera discovers Em is not Casimir’s true betrothed, Em will be executed on the spot. But it’s the only way to salvage Em’s kingdom and what is left of her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em is determined to succeed, but the closer she gets to the prince, the more she questions her mission. Em’s rage-filled heart begins to soften. But with her life—and her family—on the line, love could be Em’s deadliest mistake.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Knights of the Golden Circle was the largest and most dangerous clandestine organization in American history. It amassed billions in stolen gold and silver, all buried in hidden caches across the country. Treasure hunters searched for over a century, but little of that immense wealth was ever found—until now.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When the news about the found treasure gets out, two factions of what remains of the Knights rush to seize their fair share. Thrust into this battle is former Justice Department agent Cotton Malone, who has his own ancestral connection to the Knights—one that is far more complicated than he ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A masterpiece of storytelling genius that is not to be missed.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;—Providence Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Malone tries to uncover the truth about one of the United States’ most legendary secrets, he finds himself on a perilous adventure that takes him from the Senate floor and the backrooms of the Smithsonian Institution to the deepest woods in rural Arkansas and finally into the rugged mountains of New Mexico. &lt;i&gt;The Lost Order&lt;/i&gt; illuminates our country’s dark past, and the risks of a potentially darker future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Excellent…weaves fact and fiction, history and the present…a page-turning read that is hard to put down.”&lt;i&gt;—Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(starred review)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>As a newly Made Capo in the Pivetti Crime Family, all eyes are on James “Mac” Maccari, and not for a particularly good reason. The way to his new position in the family was paved with blood, and that left some all too suspicious of where—or who—he might be going after next. Mac isn’t interested in playing to the politics of other Made men or Cosa Nostra. His only goal is to keep his promise and be waiting for his gun moll when she’s finally released from prison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until all hell breaks loose … again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh off her six month sentence, Melina Morgan is all too ready to get back to life, and Mac. The mafia life has been one learning curve after another, but with Mac at her side, there’s nothing that they can throw at her that she can’t handle. Even with a ring on her finger, and a new last name to go with it, Melina won’t be domesticated. But with a man like Mac, he wasn’t exactly looking for that kind of a woman, anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, wedding bells bring bloodstains … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When directed attacks start to happen, taking the lives of some of the highest Made men in the Pivetti family, distrust and unrest begins to breed throughout the ranks. Someone is making a move on the boss’s seat, and it seems far too easy to put the blame at Mac’s feet when every single attack is somehow connected to him. All over again, Mac and Melina find they’re fighting an uphill battle to keep each other safe and survive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But this time, they might not be fighting alone …</description>

  <description>Justin and Toni were friends. &lt;br /&gt;Besties, with a whole list of life rules developed over a friendship that started when they were kids. As long as they stuck to the rules, even when they blended a business relationship into the friendship, things went off without a hitch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then one of them broke the rules - It was Justin. Justin broke the rules- and Toni has been mad about it ever since. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s spent the last several years traveling the globe to cultivate her business, but now she’s back in town. Her only goals? Help her parents with “Mr. Bestseller’s” signing at the store, help them pack up their house to sell, and get out of town without too much interaction with her former best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Bestseller has different goals. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He broke the rules - no getting around that, and he’s not trying to. His main goal now that Toni is finally home is to get her to hear him out… and get his friend back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither of them anticipated that the rift in their relationship would be the catalyst for seeing each other in a whole different light. But now that they do, they’re wondering if it may be time to make some amendments to those rules. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or at the very least… bend a few.</description>

  <description>As the son of an Irish mobster, Connor O’Neil spent his boyhood hiding from the horrors of his own home. His one reprieve was a girl he knew only as Evelyn, but even she was taken away. As a man, Connor is determined to stay away from his father’s business. With Sean, participation is not a request, but a demand. The truth is, Connor might be more like the evil he’s trying to hide away from than he would like to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he’s already spent years trying to cover the scars left over from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter puts the lost girl from his past back on his path, and he no longer has a choice but to face the darkness he’s been ignoring for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evelyn. Sasha. Slave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t really know who she is anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe she does, and she doesn’t want to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She isn’t the same as she once was—now a thing to be kept and maintained, shuffled from owner to owner until it was her time to go. She only became Connor’s because he took her when he knew she wasn’t his to take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except she isn’t Connor’s at all …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he can’t keep her hidden forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Inflict is a Standalone Romance with graphic depictions of violence, sexual scenes, dark elements and a HEA. It is not recommended for those under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>DeLuca Duet, Part Two &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Chicago Mob is the same as it has always been—violent, greedy, and excessive. The Outfit families have turned their backs when they were needed the most one too many times, but Dino DeLuca didn’t expect anything different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His whole life has been lived for the Outfit—for his family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He has a whole new set of reasons to live and fight now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karen Martin makes Dino change all the rules. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s finally ready to show everyone just how much waste is truly worth in the mafia, and just how far one will go for freedom from it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s learned these lessons well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: The DeLuca Duet is a standalone duet with a HEA ending that can be read independently.</description>

  <description>In Debbie Herbert's debut novel, there are two secrets, each one with a deadly consequence….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelly Connors's worlds—on land and in the sea—are turned upside down when an evening swim turns into a nightmare. On a sweltering night deep in the bayou, the mystical mermaid witnesses a horrifying act. With a monstrous killer now hot on her trail, her life and the lives of her kin are in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrified of becoming the next victim, Shelly has no choice but to turn to Sheriff Tillman Angier. Tillman has had his intense gray eyes on the sultry honey-haired beauty for a while. The feelings are mutual …and impossible to ignore. But he's determined to solve the murders, and he knows Shelly's hiding something. Can she trust him with her deepest secret?</description>

  <description>DeLuca Duet, Part One &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ask anyone and they will all say the same thing about just who Dino DeLuca is. A criminal, the son of a traitor, and a mafia Capo who can’t be trusted. His past has shaped his life, creating demons he can’t escape from that live in his mind day and night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He is all too aware of just how people see him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Closed off. &lt;br /&gt;Cold. &lt;br /&gt;Different. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t care—keeping people out means no one can get close enough to hurt him again, and he already has one too many monsters with their claws stuck in his back that he’s still fighting off. His walls are so high, no one is climbing over them. Or so he thinks … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karen came into his life like a spring shower, her light shining through the darkness and making him see something other than the hell that surrounded him for so long. She doesn’t know who he is or what he has done to become the man he is today. If he can help it, she’ll never know, and his monsters will never hurt her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She sees his differences as beauty. &lt;br /&gt;She never asks for more. &lt;br /&gt;She is perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem with happiness for Dino DeLuca is that his monsters don’t mind taking away what makes him happy. After all, what isn’t given cannot be kept. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These lessons will be the hardest he has ever learned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AUTHOR’S NOTE: The DeLuca Duet is a two book tale following the same couple through their journey. It is a standalone Duet that can be read independently with a HEA ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the perfect marriage has its dark side… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris and Will's marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris's happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</description>

  <description>There’s no such thing as a right time to fall in love. It happens, or it doesn’t. Possible to fake, but not force. Impossible to simply wish away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the path that hero and heroine find themselves on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither of them quite ready to entertain the idea of dating, let alone love… but they can’t seem to avoid each other either. &lt;br /&gt;He calls it “fate”. &lt;br /&gt;She calls it “crazy”. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe neither of them is wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When pretense is stripped away, and feelings – good, bad, and ugly – are laid bare, all they’re left with is their truth. It’s up to them to figure out what to do with it. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>If the biblical plagues of Egypt truly happened--could they happen again--on a global scale?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years after vanishing into the Sudanese desert, the leader of a British archeological expedition, Professor Harold McCabe, comes stumbling out of the sands, frantic and delirious, but he dies before he can tell his story. The mystery deepens when an autopsy uncovers a bizarre corruption: someone had begun to mummify the professor's body--while he was still alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His strange remains are returned to London for further study, when alarming news arrives from Egypt. The medical team who had performed the man's autopsy has fallen ill with an unknown disease, one that is quickly spreading throughout Cairo. Fearing the worst, a colleague of the professor reaches out to a longtime friend: Painter Crowe, the director of Sigma Force. The call is urgent, for Professor McCabe had vanished into the desert while searching for proof of the ten plagues of Moses. As the pandemic grows, a disturbing question arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are those plagues starting again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Director Crowe can investigate, a mysterious group of assassins leaves behind a fiery wake of destruction and death, erasing all evidence. With the professor's body incinerated, his home firebombed, Sigma Force must turn to the archaeologist's only daughter, Jane McCabe, for help. While sifting through what's left of her father's work, she discovers a puzzling connection, tying the current threat to a shocking historical mystery, one involving the travels of Mark Twain, the genius of Nikola Tesla, and the adventures of famous explorer, Henry Morgan Stanley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To unravel a secret going back millennia, Director Crowe and Commander Grayson Pierce will be thrust to opposite sides of the globe. One will search for the truth, traveling from the plague-ridden streets of Cairo to a vast ancient tomb buried under the burning sands of the Sudan; the other will struggle to stop a mad genius locked within a remote Arctic engineering complex, risking the lives of all those he holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the global crisis grows ever larger, Sigma Force will confront a threat born of the ancient past and made real by the latest science--a danger that will unleash a cascading series of plagues, culminating in a scourge that could kill all of the world's children . . . decimating mankind forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Best Seller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Marilyn Monroe died among suspicious circumstances on the night of August 4, 1962, there have been queries and theories, allegations and investigations, but no definitive evidence about precisely what happened and who was involved . . . until now. In &lt;i&gt;The Murder of Marilyn Monroe: Case Closed&lt;/i&gt;, renowned MM expert Jay Margolis and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Richard Buskin finally lay to rest more than fifty years of wild speculation and misguided assertions by actually naming, for the first time, the screen goddess’s killer while utilizing the testimony of eye-witnesses to exactly what took place inside her house on Fifth Helena Drive in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Implicating Bobby Kennedy in the commission of Marilyn’s murder, this is the first book to name the LAPD officers who accompanied the US Attorney General to her home, provide details about how the Kennedys used bribes to silence one of the ambulance drivers, and specify how the subsequent cover-up was aided by a noted pathologist’s outrageous lies. This blockbuster volume blows the lid off the world’s most notorious and talked-about celebrity death, and in the process exposes not only the truth about an iconic star’s tragic final hours, but also how a legendary American politician used powerful resources to protect what many still perceive as his untarnished reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</description>

  <description>Seasons of Betrayal, Book 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood always leaves the brightest stains where the snow falls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of lockup, Kazimir Markovic is focused on two things only—having Violet Gallucci back at his side, and putting his father in the ground. With his plans already in motion the very second he’s free, Kaz goes after what’s most important. Violet first. Vasily second. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Russians are out for blood. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Italians want their blood back. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s only a matter of time before someone comes for Kaz and Violet—hiding was never in their plans. And they’ve been waiting for this … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The game they’re playing is dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone always has to lose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From authors London Miller &lt;i&gt;(Den of Mercenaries)&lt;/i&gt; and Bethany-Kris &lt;i&gt;(The Chicago War)&lt;/i&gt; comes the second installment in the &lt;i&gt;Seasons of Betrayal&lt;/i&gt; series that has readers calling it “A modern day Romeo and Juliet.”</description>

The things that happen in families are always surprising and sometimes shocking! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rich and powerful Josephine Lazarow, matriarch of Fairham Island, is dead.

After walking away from his mother and her controlling ways five years ago, he's built a new life in LA. He's also accumulated a fortune of his own. But as soon as he learns of his mother's death, he returns to Fairham. He feels he owes it to his grandfather to put the family empire together again—and he's determined to find his mother's killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is…coming home to Fairham puts him back in contact with Nancy Dellinger, the woman he hurt so badly when he left before. And digging that deep into his mother's final days and hours entails a very real risk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the person who killed her could be someone he loves…</description>

  <description>Did she once have a sister? Has her mother lied all these years? Why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a painful divorce, Maisey Lazarow returns to Fairham, the small island off the North Carolina coast where she grew up. She goes there to heal—and to help her brother, Keith, a deeply troubled man who's asked her to come home. But she refuses to stay in the family house. The last person she wants to see is the wealthy, controlling mother she escaped years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, she finds herself living next door to someone else she'd prefer to avoid—Rafe Romero, the wild, reckless boy to whom she lost her virginity at sixteen. He's back on the island, and to her surprise, he's raising a young daughter alone. Maisey's still attracted to him, but her heart's too broken to risk… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then something even more disturbing happens. She discovers a box of photographs that evoke distant memories of a little girl, a child Keith remembers, too. Maisey believes the girl must've been their sister, but their mother claims there was no sister. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maisey's convinced that child existed. So where is she now?</description>

      <![CDATA[This was the first novel I have read by this author. It started off a bit slow, but when the pace increased I was unable to put it down. This was a wonderful story full of second chances, buried secrets, and misconceptions. I enjoyed it very much.]]>

  <description>Fallon is the definition of a woman with her “ish” together. Flourishing business, a home of her own in a new city, a relationship on the verge of marriage, and the opportunity to create a life that looks exactly as she wants it. She’s ready, and willing, to embark on a new adventure.&lt;br /&gt;She just didn’t expect to have to do it on her own.&lt;br /&gt;Business is great, but the home? A total mess. The relationship? Dead in the water. The “new adventure”? Looking more like a disaster.&lt;br /&gt; Until Sean.&lt;br /&gt;With their shared track record of betrayal and broken hearts, it may be better to stay away, but neither of them can resist. Even their contentious first meeting can’t hide the spark of attraction, and that spark leads to a deeper involvement than either of them is sure they’re ready for. But love doesn’t wait until you’re ready— it blooms in its own time.&lt;br /&gt;That’s just the way love goes.</description>

  <description>From Amazon Bestselling Author, Perri Forrest. A man's job is never done. It holds especially true when you're Rush Cambridge. The story is back and with something of a vengeance. In RAPTURE, new couple Alika and Rush were brought together under severe circumstances. Alika literally crashed into Rush's life and created a need that he didn't realize existed until she was there to awaken it. By RAPTURE 2, the couple had already been faced with the first of many obstacles: Rush's father was murdered, his mother's return after years of absence, and the arrival of a daughter that Rush never knew existed. RAPTURE 3 promises to keep the momentum going. Rush wrote off his sister, Jamie, when he realized that she knew about his daughter. Will they mend their relationship? Or will they remain siblings in name, only? What will happen when tragedy strikes and the traumatic event touches several of the lives that Rush holds dear? And what about Siobhan, Rush's mother, who was being sought for his father's murder? Somebody doesn't want to let it go, and wants to make sure that Siobhan pays for her crime. It's just too much, isn't it? Well, it's happening all while Rush and Alika await the birth of their first child. We know this couple can overcome just about anything, but will it still hold true in the end?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us into a dangerous and exhilarating world where a deadly, beautiful archangel and his once-mortal consort are caught in a fury of twisted darkness…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most vicious archangels in the world has disappeared. No one knows if Lijuan is dead or has chosen to Sleep the long sleep of an immortal. But with her lands falling into chaos under a rising tide of vampiric bloodlust, a mysterious and ancient order of angels known as the Luminata calls the entire Cadre together to discuss the fate of her territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanying her archangelic lover Raphael to the Luminata compound, guild hunter-turned-angel Elena senses that all is not as it seems. Secrets echo from within the stone walls of the compound, and the deeper Elena goes, the uglier the darkness. But neither Raphael nor Elena is ready for the brutal truths hidden within—truths that will change everything Elena thinks she knows about who she is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever be the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the acclaimed Immortal Guardians series comes an enchanting new series full of romance, danger, and loyalty: The Gifted Ones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the day Lord Dillon earned his spurs, rumors of his savagery on the battlefield have preceded him into every room, stilling tongues and sparking fear. Weary of battle, he wishes only to find a woman he can wed who will approach him not with fear, but with the tenderness that has been absent from his life for so long. Yet only the wisewoman seems invariably at ease in his presence. Perhaps because she garners the same fear in others that he does himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For seven years, Alyssa has been by Lord Dillon's side, counseling him from the shadows, healing him with her hands, and staving off the worst of his loneliness while his fearsome reputation keeps others at bay. Blessed--or cursed--with gifts that label her a sorceress, she is forced to conceal her youth and the love she harbors for him beneath umbral robes that lead Dillon and his people to believe she is the same aged wisewoman who served his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All is revealed, however, and passions flare when an enemy threatens Dillon's life and Alyssa sacrifices everything to save him. When Dillon discovers that the wisewoman is far from elderly, he is instantly entranced. And, as he and Alyssa work together to defeat an enemy bent on destroying them both, Dillon will risk anything--even the wrath of his king--to be with her.</description>

  <description>The Final &lt;i&gt;Donati Bloodlines&lt;/i&gt; Novel &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emma Donati &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some days, it felt like Emma had just imagined it all. &lt;br /&gt;Like maybe everything she had been with Calisto was just a dream. &lt;br /&gt;Emma knew it was crazy—it was impossible to forget what she had shared with Calisto Donati. All their love, the stolen moments, their foulness together, and the beauty underneath it all were real. &lt;br /&gt;They were real. &lt;br /&gt;But he didn't know. &lt;br /&gt;He didn’t know any of it. &lt;br /&gt;And little by little, with every day that passed her by, Emma found she was losing those pieces that reminded her they had existed once. &lt;br /&gt;Just like the rosary. &lt;br /&gt;All too soon, Emma knew … there would be nothing left. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Calisto Donati &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emma hadn’t given him a choice. &lt;br /&gt;Her, not him. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, that’s what Calisto was going to keep telling himself. He refused to feed into the strange curiosity he had about Emma Donati. It had been building from the moment he’d first seen her face after he’d awakened. He wouldn’t admit that for longer than he cared to admit, he thought there was more behind her false smile, polite words, and the distance she put between her and him—that there might be more to them. &lt;br /&gt;He couldn’t. &lt;br /&gt;Except … he was feeding into it. &lt;br /&gt;Calisto just wasn’t sure what it was. &lt;br /&gt;But tonight he was going to find out. &lt;br /&gt;Whether she wanted to tell him or not.</description>

  <description>Calisto Donati &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Calisto had never been a fan of pain, but he found it provided a certain relief. &lt;br /&gt;It was a high that couldn’t compete with anything else he experienced. That was why he fought bare-knuckled, why he drove fast, despite knowing he might crash, and why he still enjoyed looking at Emma Donati—no matter her current status. &lt;br /&gt;Pain felt good. &lt;br /&gt;He might have been a fool for doing so, but as long as he got what he wanted from it, he didn’t really care. &lt;br /&gt;When he fought, he was given release. When he drove, he was given freedom. When he looked at Emma, he was given memories. &lt;br /&gt;All of them brought a certain level of pain. All three might kill him someday. &lt;br /&gt;Calisto glanced at Emma, taking her in again when she didn’t know he was looking. &lt;br /&gt;He realized then that only one might actually be worth dying for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emma Donati &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emma kept her gaze on the book in her lap, pretending like there wasn’t an argument going on across the room. She had become terribly good at acting like she didn’t hear. &lt;br /&gt;Calisto watched her out of the corner of his eye while he argued on with Affonso. &lt;br /&gt;She was too focused on Calisto to care about their fight. &lt;br /&gt;His anger. The tightness of his jaw. Searing soul-black eyes. &lt;br /&gt;The two men were not the same. They might have shared blood, but their hearts were entirely different. One man never let her out of his sight when he was nearby. The other acted like she didn’t exist. &lt;br /&gt;This was what it was like, she realized, to be in love with someone she couldn’t have. &lt;br /&gt;Calisto Donati would never be hers. &lt;br /&gt;This wasn’t a fairy tale that would end happily. &lt;br /&gt;They weren’t star-crossed. They were impossible. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“Big Bad Bill” Edwards, the biggest, baddest cowboy in Bear Creek Saddle, Idaho, has only gotten meaner in the years since his bride Melody died young… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miami bartender Allie Crawford has no idea what she’s getting into when she buys half-ownership of the sexy cowboy’s bar, inherited from his late uncle. She’d thought they’d built a friendship based on several months of emails back and forth. But in person, Big Bad Bill will do anything to keep her at arm’s length... only he can’t. The man is sinfully sexy trouble — big trouble. Especially since Allie is just one year out from when her cheating ex destroyed their marriage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can Bill and Allie be together if their hearts can’t handle the risk of breaking once more? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill has just three rules for dealing with Allie: Don’t kill her. Don’t kiss her. And above all, don’t fall in love... not ever again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of cowboy romance, Idaho ranchers (heck, even Montana ranchers, since they're neighbors), and sizzling hot contemporary romance, this short novel by New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Shoshanna Evers is set in the mountains of small-town Bear Creek Saddle, Idaho. Ride 'em, cowboy!</description>

  <description>All Devyn wants – besides a tall, fine husband and eventually a few babies to fulfill her “about to turn thirty, running out of time, cute black family” dreams – is to finish her yearlong internship at University Hospital. She’s excited about the experience, eager to learn, glad to help wherever she can… it should be easy, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, it would be… if it weren’t for arrogant, know-it-all, always-got-something-to-say Dr. Joseph Wright. Devyn can’t stand him, and if his attitude is any indication, the feeling is mutual… or is it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Joseph doesn’t “do” doctors. Or nurses. Or patients. Or anybody else who has anything to do with the hospital, for that matter. University Hospital has infiltrated enough of his life, and the last thing he needs is a blurring of the lines between professional and private. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;… until smart, sexy, sassy Nurse Devyn Echols comes along, and stomps all over those lines. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you’re pulling doubles with the person you hate to want so bad… something is bound to ignite.</description>

  <description>“I can't wait to see what Trice Hickman does next!”—Mary Monroe, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Two couples, two unhappy spouses—one shocking solution…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Five years into her happy marriage, Geneva Mayfield is devastated to find that things have taken a turn for the worse. Her husband, Johnny, is suddenly hard to reach, distant, and works late too often for Geneva not to be suspicious. Is it because she’s been pressuring him about having a baby? Feeling lonely and neglected, Geneva bonds with Samuel Owens, a colleague who is having marital trouble of his own. Soon, their relationship blossoms into an uncontrollable affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bored with her husband, Samuel, and dead set against having a child with him, Vivana Owens is biding her time until she’s ready to leave—and she’s spending it with Johnny Mayfield. It’s just a fling—until Vivana becomes obsessed with Johnny, especially once he tries to win back his wife. But affairs don’t end easy—and soon one of the unfaithfuls will end up dead, one will end up in jail, and one just might get away with murder…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Playing the Hand You’re Dealt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Will keep you guessing straight through to the explosive ending."—Victoria Christopher Murray&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Unforgettable characters and a page-turning storyline.”—Lutishia Lovely</description>

  <description>The Shady Sisters Trilogy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this thrilling new series, acclaimed author Lutishia Lovely dives into the scandalous heart of romantic obsession with a cunning, sexy seductress, and the object of her affections. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freelance writer Jacqueline Tate arrives in Los Angeles and soon meets brilliant, award-winning scientist Randall Atwater, the man she's come to cover at a conference on trends and technology. He is everything she's read about--brainy, witty, handsome, and cool. And after a week spent with the most fascinating man she's ever known, there's no way she can give him up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem: Randall's wife of twenty years. No matter--men like Randall are few and far between. Jacqueline knows that with a few bold moves, she can win the man she loves. But what happens when her love story is not a love story? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There's drama, laughter, and little bit of naughtiness. . .An exceptional read." --Urban Reviews on All Up In My Business &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The action, dialogue and well-crafted characters are so riveting that they'll make your heart race in anticipation . . ." --RT Book Reviews on Heaven Forbid</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When Mr. Right is oh so wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'll never let you go&lt;/i&gt; . . . Allina had always dreamed of hearing those words. But when her fiancé, Isaac, utters them, it isn't a promise-it's a threat. Scared and confused, with only moments before the wedding, Allina knows what she must do. Forget walking down the aisle; it's time to run. Back to Michigan. Back to Kent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kent has loved Allina for longer than he can remember. Out of respect for their friendship, he's never crossed the line, but when she turns up on his doorstep wearing her torn, tearstained wedding gown, the fire inside him ignites. He'll do whatever it takes to make Allina feel safe-like the beautiful, desirable woman she is. But as Kent and Allina grow closer, and their passion pushes deeper, it's clear that something bigger than a botched wedding still lingers between them . . .</description>

  <description>Daveigh Little is preparing for college, planning to leave behind the tiny hick town she’s spent her entire life in once and for all. But plagued by troubles at home and school, Daveigh makes a series of bad choices that land her in hot water with a local kingpin. Suddenly, people around her are dying and Daveigh finds herself on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there’s Ethan. Fresh out of the academy, Ethan Remington represents the authority Daveigh has come to despise, but she is inexplicably drawn to the handsome rookie of few words. From the first moment she laid eyes on him, Daveigh knew Ethan was different. She just didn’t realize how different. Reasons of his own have led Ethan into the tangled strands of danger within the town of Harpey…but those reasons aren’t nearly as mysterious as Ethan’s origins or the irresistible passion between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Contains Mature Content**</description>

  <description>Sometimes the thing you want most can cost you everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ten tumultuous years as the wife of a feared mob boss—five of them spent alone, thanks to her husband’s incarceration—Rena Rosetti is tired of watching the men Tony left in charge ruin his criminal empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though she has a fight on her hands, she’s determined to prove that the old-school ways of the Cosa Nostra need to be permanently laid to rest. But power means nothing with no one at her side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rena has done her best to ignore the fire Shane Van Adams ignites in her, because…well, he’s her daughter Tricia’s boyfriend. But when Tricia decides she no longer wants him, Rena isn’t prepared for the onslaught when Shane turns those penetrating hazel eyes her way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Rena has everything she ever wanted. But all things come with a price, and she’s made some dangerous enemies. Forced to battle mob rivals out to take her down, she must face the harshest truth of all—that the greatest danger she faces is the man sharing her bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Advanced mind games between a sassy broad who bites her tongue for no one, and a younger man who, given the chance, could have been the smoothest criminal of all.</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1962, nothing could prepare Dr. Charles Campbell for his first meeting with his new client, Marilyn Monroe. A reputable psychiatrist, he's been hired by a studio executive to handle and subdue the star, no matter what it takes. Although he's been warned about Ms. Monroe's unpredictability, she's not what he expected. In the days that follow, Charles' world is turned upside-down. Marilyn shares her secrets and threatens to go public with information that could ruin her career and destroy President Kennedy's administration. Saving Marilyn from her self-destructive ways and crossing doctor-patient boundaries, might also cost Charles Campbell his life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Seasons of Betrayal, Book 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In places where the sun can hide, the darkest betrayals are made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Violet Gallucci and Kazimir Markovic have grown up in the same city, but on opposite sides of the game they call life—Violet, an Italian &lt;i&gt;principessa della mafia&lt;/i&gt;, and Kaz, a Russian &lt;i&gt;Bratva&lt;/i&gt; heir. Lines have been drawn, and they know not to cross them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their paths crossed once, a long time ago, but when they meet again, the territory and rules set out by their families that have kept them separated seem to bleed away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She's more than her last name …&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;He’s more than a Russian … &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But secrets from the past—and the people determined to keep them hidden—have other plans for Violet and Kaz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rival families.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Star-crossed lovers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They should be enemies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could mean war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From authors Bethany-Kris (&lt;i&gt;The Chicago War&lt;/i&gt;) and London Miller (&lt;i&gt;Volkov Bratva&lt;/i&gt;) comes a thrilling, sexy new series—&lt;i&gt;Seasons of Betrayal&lt;/i&gt;. Where the Russians and Italians clash in culture, mafia … and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming June 2016</description>

  <description>For Immortal Huntress and cunning private investigator Nikki Glass, vengeance trumps all in the final novel in acclaimed author Jenna Black's addictive urban fantasy series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when fertility goddesses go on strike? Nothing much—except maybe the end of the human race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When private investigator Nikki Glass became immortal as a descendant of Artemis, she never dreamed she’d find herself playing marriage counselor to the gods. But she doesn’t really have much of a choice when the crazed ex-wife of Anderson Kane—a god in disguise who just happens to be the son of a Fury—decides to enact revenge by wiping out all of humanity. Somehow, Nikki must convince the two to kiss and make up, but with Anderson now gone AWOL, she'll have to find him first. To top it all off, the cat’s out of the bag that Anderson killed Konstantin, the Olympians’ deposed leader. Now their new boss—Konstantin’s son—is out for blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every mere mortal’s fate now resting in Nikki’s hands, can she outsmart the gods…or will she be doomed to spend the rest of eternity in a barren and desolate world?</description>

  <description>James “Mac” Maccari’s career in the mafia is at a standstill. As the best solider in his Capo’s crew, all he wants is to be noticed enough to get Made in the Pivetti Crime Family. But instead, his Capo’s interests seem more focused on keeping his solider hidden from the boss, and every other Made man he can. Seemingly stuck right where he is with no chance of going up, Mac doesn’t know what will finally get him the attention he needs to earn his button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she shows up and all eyes are on them …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melina Morgan survives—that’s just what she does. She’s never been able to depend on anyone but herself to keep her safe and get things done. When a chance encounter puts her in a bad situation with the cops and the mafia, Melina has no choice but to put her faith in the hands of a man that not only infuriates her with his cocky arrogance, but catches her interest, too. Playing pretend in a fake relationship with Mac doesn’t seem all that terrible, until pretend turns real and bullets start to fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man is nothing without his woman …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the attention on Mac and Melina turns from bad to worse, and someone in the Pivetti Crime Family decides the couple needs to go, they know they’re fighting an uphill battle alone. But making it to the end alive means Mac could get what he’s always wanted, and Melina might find what she didn’t even know she needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they’ll make waves the mafia has no choice but to notice …</description>

  <description>When 26 year old Reese accepts a position as a grad assistant, she has no idea an unpleasant encounter with a student will lead to the discovery of what she calls “the trifecta”: fine, intellectual, and a little bit rude – three qualities she finds irresistible in a man. She has no intention of doing anything with that discovery – nothing long term, at least. But everybody knows what happens to best laid plans. &lt;br /&gt;Jason is a grown man. 28 years old, seasoned and scarred by his real-life experience in the world, he’s at Blakewood State University to finish his degree and move on. The last thing he’s interested in is the female population on campus… but sexy, infuriating Reese might be a notable exception. &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a story of opposites attract. &lt;br /&gt;More like counterparts clash. &lt;br /&gt;Neither of them is afraid to do battle, and neither is willing to back down. Love and war, win or lose… somebody’s gonna end up getting schooled. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early 1990s, I visited eastern Oregon for the first time. Inspired by its breathtaking scenery, I wrote &lt;i&gt;Love Letters&lt;/i&gt;, a trilogy about a town called Rimrock--whose secrets come to light when the patriarch of its wealthiest family is murdered. Now here it is, collected in one volume, with a new cover, and a new title, &lt;i&gt;Revenge&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, Jonah McKee acquired vast wealth, power, and an unsavory reputation. Though his fatal car crash is ruled accidental, his widow is convinced otherwise and begs her children to find the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eldest son Max knew his late father could be manipulative, but a letter found among Jonah's possessions shows just how many lives were subject to his meddling. That list includes Max's brother, Jenner--rodeo rider and rebel--who is confronted by a confession that changes his life. But even while the siblings reel from new revelations, stubborn, beautiful Casey McKee is kidnapped by an enemy who hates the family enough to destroy them, one by one…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've enjoyed my earlier novels like &lt;i&gt;Unspoken, Running Scared, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Whispers&lt;/i&gt;, then I believe you're going to love reading &lt;i&gt;Revenge&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Jackson</description>

  <description>The chemistry between Stephen Foster and Nubia Perry is an undeniable fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handsome, dynamic former rugby star is used to getting who he wants with minimal effort, but Nubia’s steadfast refusal to acquiesce – while also making it clear that she’s equally interested in him – is compelling enough to keep his attention firmly planted on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even once it’s clear that Nubia’s polished façade is something she puts on for the public, to hide the scarred, vulnerable woman underneath, Stephen persists. He isn’t intimidated by the model-turned-mogul’s aggressive personality – it only draws him in further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relationships aren’t even on Nubia’s radar. She has friends, family, and her steadily growing brand. After a failed engagement to the man she thought she’d build her life with – an athlete, at that – she’s not interested in anything beyond having her physical needs met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unavoidable chemistry and close proximity work in tandem to bring these two onto the same wavelength. With the eyes of the world watching, will they deny the obvious, or give in to the inevitable seductions of passion, companionship, and love?</description>

      <![CDATA[Nubia was a tough nut to crack. It took me some time to warm up to her, but boy when I did...I realized just how much she was a woman after my own heart. The author did a wonderful job of creating a multi-faceted, successful woman with a story that made you weep and root for her at the same time....]]>

  <description>Calisto Donati&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was just a woman. That’s what Calisto wanted to tell himself; that’s what he wanted to believe. Emma was nothing more than a woman. There were other women for him to want. To obsess over.&lt;br /&gt;It couldn’t be Emma Sorrento.&lt;br /&gt;Not for Calisto.&lt;br /&gt;She was taken.&lt;br /&gt;She was claimed.&lt;br /&gt;She was not his.&lt;br /&gt;In a few days, Calisto would hand her off, and that would be that. He wondered why it wouldn’t be that easy to let her go. &lt;br /&gt;What good had saving her done?&lt;br /&gt;He had simply taken her from one monster to give her to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Sorrento&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma slid on her mask. All someone would need to do was look close enough to see what was really beneath the sheer falseness of her smile.&lt;br /&gt;At the other end of the table, Emma found her lies staring her right in the face.&lt;br /&gt;He smirked.&lt;br /&gt;And winked.&lt;br /&gt;Calisto Donati was her worst mistake, her greatest shame, and the one thing she still wanted more than anything. Emma could still feel him all over her, long after his touch and kiss was gone. In thirty days, her entire world had changed—he had changed her.&lt;br /&gt;Emma had a feeling that if she played another game with Calisto, she would surely lose.&lt;br /&gt;She had already lost once.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn’t it enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WARNING: The first two books in the Donati Bloodlines Trilogy end on a cliffhanger, the third is a HEA.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Who is Belladonna?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In New York City, she's known only as the mysterious masked woman who presides over the most exclusive, opulent club of the times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Virginia's blue-blood countryside, she's known as the Contessa, the elusive heiress who flaunts convention and shuns human contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there are a wretched few who remember her from "The Club" and knew her as a fresh-faced innocent whom they desired...and misled...and left to the sadistic devices of a nobleman who robbed her of her youth, her dignity, and, ultimately her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Belladonna's story, told by one of her faithful manservants, slowly unfolds, we learn the horrifying truth behind Belladonna's masks and her insatiable desire for vengeance. It is a truth that involves betrayal, murder, depravity -- a truth so chilling that it will pit brother against brother, father against son, and will force Belladonna to ultimately confront the one man who can ultimately either destroy her, or set her free.</description>

  <description>Abadinsky provides a detailed analysis of the origins, history, theoretical explanations, and structure of organized crime, including drug trafficking, gambling, and loan sharking. The author also explains the methods employed by law enforcement agencies to combat organized crime, and the policy decisions reached by various investigating committees and commissions, including the President's Commission on Organized Crime. This text is known for presenting a comprehensive history of the subject and for being written in an engaging, "storytelling" style. In addition to presenting information on traditional organized crime groups in the United States, particularly New York and Chicago, Abadinsky covers organized crime groups on the international stage, including Chinese, Columbian, Italian, Jamaican, Japanese, Mexican, Nigerian, Russian, as well as outlaw motorcycle clubs with chapters throughout the world.</description>

  <description>Hi I’m Gabriella Alexis Sandoval. Readers first met me in the short story, "Rendezvous". "Rendezvous" told of a mere moment in my life. "Revolving Doors", however, is my coming-of-age story and delves further into my life, and reveals how sometimes a broken heart can be a delicately packaged new beginning.&lt;br /&gt;When I was 18 years old, my heart was shattered by my college-bound boyfriend, causing me to escape to the comfort of a well-known exotic land…to the familiarity of my best friend’s abode…and ultimately, to the welcoming beds of unknown men.&lt;br /&gt;Through this experience, I gained a mentor, and quickly fixated on a world where I am boss, where the rules are my own, and where glass ceilings cease to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardly the broken girl I once was…I returned home, a young woman on a mission…a mission to own my sexuality, take control of my destiny, and create the blueprint to my erotic fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I unwrap my beautifully wrapped future, and remove the lid from my once ordinary life, I become a Lioness who is unstoppable. And with my stealth-like swagger…and undeniable prowess…winning, has become my only option.</description>

  <description>"Shelly Ellis is a new favorite to our list." --Christina Lauren, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets and scandals are a way of life for the Murdochs of Chesterton, Virginia. But the lies that bind them may end up tearing them apart…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his drama-filled marriage behind him, Evan Murdoch has finally found happiness with his longtime friend turned fiancée, Leila Hawkins. But when his party boy brother, Terrence, is seriously injured in a car accident, a gossiping press puts the family back in the spotlight. Soon Terrence could face a lawsuit--and much worse, if his vengeful half-brother, Dante, has his way. Terrence's only bright spot is journalist C.J. Aston--but is she really on his side, or does she have another motive?. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Terrence struggles to recover from his injuries, Paulette, the little sister of the family, is struggling with a secret: she's pregnant, and unsure whether the father is her blackmailing ex or her husband. Amid the turmoil, Evan does his best to stay above the fray, but a shocking revelation makes that impossible--he's a Murdoch after all, and trouble seems to be their business…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Another Woman's Man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nominated for a NAACP Image Award &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A fast-paced and very gratifying story." --&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 4 Stars</description>

  <description>Ana Avdonin had always been a little difficult. Particular, hard to please, and she didn’t deny any of it. As a Bratva princess and the daughter of Anton Avdonin, she was taught that if—not when—she chose to have a man stand by her side, he should be worthy of the position. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Koldan Vasin swept into her life like a hurricane, he quickly turned everything that Ana thought she knew upside down. He’d always called her beautiful even at her ugliest; even in her worst moments, she was so beautiful to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From engagement, to a wedding, a move to Jersey, and even children, the snapshots of Ana and Koldan’s life haven’t always been perfect, but they have been honest, filled with love, and painfully real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving is the easy part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living is what’s hard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: The Jersey Vignettes is an 18k COMPANION novella to The Russian Guns series. It follows a decade of time in the life of Ana and Koldan Vasin from marriage, and far beyond. It is NOT to be read as a standalone in the series.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What happens if both the president and vice-president-elect die before taking the oath of office? The answer is far from certain—in fact, what follows would be nothing short of total political chaos.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot down over Siberia, ex-Justice Department agent Cotton Malone is forced into a fight for survival against Aleksandr Zorin, a man whose loyalty to the former Soviet Union has festered for decades into an intense hatred of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before escaping, Malone learns that Zorin and another ex-KGB officer, this one a sleeper still embedded in the West, are headed overseas to Washington D.C. Noon on January 20th—Inauguration Day—is only hours away. A flaw in the Constitution, and an even more flawed presidential succession act, have opened the door to disaster and Zorin intends to exploit both weaknesses to their fullest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with a weapon leftover from the Cold War, one long thought to be just a myth, Zorin plans to attack. He’s aided by a shocking secret hidden in the archives of America’s oldest fraternal organization—the Society of Cincinnati—a group that once lent out its military savvy to presidents, including helping to formulate three invasion plans of what was intended to be America’s 14th colony—Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a race against the clock that starts in the frozen extremes of Russia and ultimately ends at the White House itself, Malone must not only battle Zorin, he must also confront a crippling fear that he’s long denied, but which now jeopardizes everything. Steve Berry’s trademark mix of history and speculation is all here in this provocative new thriller.</description>

  <description>Filthy Marcellos: La Cosa Nostra is not just a choice of regime and routine, it’s a culture. Born as mafia royalty, the Marcello brothers were raised ingrained with the beliefs and rules of what it meant to be a Mafioso prince. It is for life. Their status is considered a given right. They will always be these people. They will always be Marcellos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Family first. God second.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From bosses and sons, to husbands and lovers. Made men, fathers, and killers. Life is a chess board in Cosa Nostra and these men are the kings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't be a Marcello if you're not filthy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Complete Collection features the short novel Antony, and the three full length novels Lucian, Giovanni, and Dante. It also includes 'Legacy', the 20k prequel to the Legacy series, featuring the Filthy Marcellos next generation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming February 2016</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Legacy Prequel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLURB:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;filth·y (fĭl′thē)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;adj. filth·i·er, filth·i·est&lt;br /&gt;1. Covered or smeared with filth; disgustingly dirty.&lt;br /&gt;2. Obscene or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;3. Vile; dirty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;adv. filth·y&lt;br /&gt;1. To an extreme and often disgusting extent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly released from prison after serving a three-year term, Johnathan Marcello just wants to get his head straight, but he's the only one who believes he can do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stepping into her mother's shoes is the very last thing on Catherine Marcello's mind, but it's already too late and she's got her own games to play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spotlight wasn't in Andino Marcello's plan, but the Capo might not be given a choice when Cosa Nostra starts looking for la famiglia's next boss. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the baby of the family and a good girl is all Lucia Marcello knows, but a little freedom and space could give her the chance to shed those masks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Marcellos, being filthy isn't a birthright, it's earned. A new generation is ready to take their thrones, but it's not that simple. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This family is a legacy and this generation might just be the filthiest yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Filthy Marcellos: Legacy is a COMPANION piece to the Marcellos series. It is NOT intended to be a standalone in the series. It is not intended to be a full length story with a formal HEA, but a 20k PREQUEL to a new series featuring the involved characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming December 2015</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Zenobia takes control of her own fate, will the gods punish her audacity?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zenobia, the proud daughter of a Syrian sheikh, refuses to marry against her will. She won’t submit to a lifetime of subservience. When her father dies, she sets out on her own, pursuing the power she believes to be her birthright, dreaming of the Roman Empire’s downfall and her ascendance to the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defying her family, Zenobia arranges her own marriage to the most influential man in the city of Palmyra. But their union is anything but peaceful—his other wife begrudges the marriage and the birth of Zenobia’s son, and Zenobia finds herself ever more drawn to her guardsman, Zabdas. As war breaks out, she’s faced with terrible choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the decadent halls of Rome to the golden sands of Egypt, Zenobia fights for power, for love, and for her son. But will her hubris draw the wrath of the gods? Will she learn a “woman’s place,” or can she finally stake her claim as Empress of the East?</description>

  <description>Friends? &lt;br /&gt;Lovers? &lt;br /&gt;Both? &lt;br /&gt;For Kora and Tariq, those lines have been blurred for a long time. Every time clarity seems to be within reach, something shifts, and in a single moment, focus is lost. Once again, they’re in limbo. &lt;br /&gt;Between them, there is only one secret, with the power to permanently alter their relationship. For good or bad, neither of them knows – nor are they willing to take that risk. &lt;br /&gt;Through the pain of past tragedies and the pressure of current dramas, they always find solace in each other’s arms. Inescapably connected by the interminable bond of friendship, Tariq and Kora navigate family, life, and love, searching for separate answers to a problem that has only has one, unavoidable solution.</description>

  <description>O! Jackie explores the private life of Jackie Kennedy, her heartbreaking struggles, difficult relationships, and deep desire to end JFK's wandering ways. As a faithful wife devoted to an unfaithful husband, Jackie knew humiliation well. Living in the public eye intensified her disgrace. Through the years, Jack Kennedy's lustful escapades grew in carelessness and frquency. When his trysts with Marilyn Monroe threaten to become public, Jackie must decide how far she'll go to save the presidency and her marriage.</description>

  <description>Don't say it unless you mean it…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a simple concept, one I've said time and again, but something people don't seem to comprehend. You should choose every syllable carefully, because you never know when somebody will hold you to your word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not a good man. I'm not. I know. I have enough darkness inside of me to rid the world of every stitch of light. But there's one I could never harm, one light I couldn't bring myself to snuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karissa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks I'm a monster, and maybe I am. I taunt her with my touch, get a thrill out of torturing her soul. But I'm not the only one. The world is full of monsters, and I'm not the most dangerous one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even close…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God help me, I love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And God help anyone who tries to take her from me.</description>

  <description>Ignazio Vitale is not a good man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect it, the first time I see him, sense the air of danger that surrounds the man. He has a way of commanding attention, of taking control, of knowing what I'm thinking before I even do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's alarming and alluring. It's dark and deadly. It's everything I've ever wanted but the last thing I truly need. Obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't take him long to draw me into his web, charming me into his bed and trapping me in his life, a life I know nothing about until it's too late. He has secrets, secrets I can't fathom, secrets that make it so I can't walk away, no matter how much I beg him to let me go. I see it sometimes in his eyes, a darkness that's both terrifying and thrilling. He's a monster, wrapped up in a pretty package, and what I find when I unmask him changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to hate him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn't stop me from loving him, too.</description>

  <description>Corrado Moretti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world knows the notorious Kevlar Killer, but few have ever seen what lies beneath his armor. The abused child. The neglected teenager. The broken man. He always did whatever he had to do in order to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's kill or be killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout his life, he has been there in the shadows, a witness to everything from beginning to end. Bound by loyalty and honor, there's only one thing he would sacrifice it all for: family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never get close. Never get attached. It's a lesson that has been brutally pounded into him since childhood, but they're words the DeMarcos make it difficult for him to follow. Through them he finds love and grieves loss, realizing the world isn't quite as black and white as it's made out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made.</description>

  <description>When you think of rapture, you think of ecstasy, bliss, elation, and things of that nature. In short, a feeling of intense pleasure or joy. Rush had that. Or rather, Rush has that in the beautiful Alika Collins. Alika brings forth everything he wants in a woman. The two literally crashed into each other’s lives, and their whirlwind love story is safely set on solid ground. But is it really? And if so, for how long? There are certainly things that can disrupt what they have just begun to build. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently, Rush was dealt a devastating blow: He has a young daughter who he never knew existed. After this life-shattering secret is exposed, Rush finds out that those close to him are the ones behind it all. Feeling betrayed, he instantly dismisses those individuals from his life. In his mind, their actions were unforgivable and mending fences is not of urgency. At present, his primary goal is finding, and forging a relationship, with his child. Nothing will keep him from doing that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But while Rush is establishing this new phase of life, things are in disarray in the old life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For one, someone wants Rush's father dead and will go to great lengths to make it happen. Then there’s the mother of Rush's daughter who wants more than to co-parent. This leaves Alika feeling the strain of it all while trying to remain by his side. Yes, things become chaotic. But, Rush is no stranger to chaos. Hell, he even has a club called Chaos, as a testament to where he's been and what he's made of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But how much can one person take? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rapture 2 brings many things to question, but it will be interesting to see how it all turns out in the end. Specifically, which relationships will remain intact, and which ones will be forever altered to the point of no return.</description>

  <description>No war is won without a few bloodstains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tommas Rossi wants what belongs to him—he wants it bad. At thirty-years-old, he’s on course to become the youngest boss in the Chicago Outfit’s history. He just has to make it to the end alive. But being the boss of the Outfit means nothing to Tommas if a certain blue-eyed girl isn’t standing with him when the city finally crumbles. The crown is so close he can taste it. Blood paves his way. Every king needs a queen, but he doesn’t know how to get his anymore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abriella Trentini has always been the rebel. She’s quicker than most men, dangerous when she wants something, and more careful than anyone knows. Her relationship with Tommas Rossi has been a dangerous game she loved to play, but someone always has to lose. With choices to make, the kind that determines who will live and who will die, Abriella doesn’t know what to do. This should have been easy, but nothing ever is, and her time to choose is running out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much blood has spilled for this. The Outfit is in shambles, grieving and angry. The families just want peace. No one knows who will take the Chicago throne because too many men have a stake in this game. In wars like these, no one will let it go easily. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’ll be bloodstained until the very bitter end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And left breathless in the devastation of it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has it been worth it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: Breathless is the fourth book in a series and should only be read after the first three books have also been read. It is NOT a standalone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tommas Rossi &amp;amp; Abriella Trentini&lt;br /&gt;Releasing 2016</description>

      <![CDATA[Vengeance comes when and where you least expect it. What a way to end a series! Tommas was a boss in every sense of the word. He went after what he wanted and let nothing and no one get in the way of what he wanted. At times I was reading and literally said out loud, "No. He wouldn't. He didn't."...]]>

  <description>Secrets and wars leave the deepest scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evelina Conti has always worn a mask. She is an Outfit principessa, respected and adored. She wasn’t allowed to be anything else. Her father went from a grieving husband to the Outfit boss, and now that Riley heads the family, Eve is more suffocated than ever. No matter how much she hates it, the Conti princess still has a role to play. A little attention from Theo DeLuca seems innocent enough, but nothing is when it comes to him. And certainly not when everyone believes that Theo is out to kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo DeLuca has a target on his back. His biggest problem is figuring out who put it there when everyone is aiming at him. He doesn’t need a woman causing him issues, but the Conti princess keeps showing up at the worst times, and he’s the one left saving her. Between the men surrounding him that Theo can’t trust, and the past he can’t outrun, Evelina might be the one thing he doesn’t have to question. But when Riley decides to use Eve as his next move, even Theo might not be able to save her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war in Chicago is not even close to being over. This game is deadly. Each hand played cuts another mark into someone else. The Outfit boss is struggling while the men around him are rallying. As the body count continues to rise, the families keep losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sacrifices are a part of war. No one will walk away from this without scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Scarless &amp;amp; Sacred is not intended to be read as a standalone in this series. It is the third book in the series and should be read after the first two books. Trigger Warning: Scarless features graphic violence and scenes of past abuse. </description>

  <description>Play dirty. It’s the only way to win in a war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alessa Trentini follows the rules, or so it seems on the outside. A certain Conti has always been able to sway her inner rebel and keep her out of trouble, but even Adriano won’t be able to get her out of her brother’s mess. In a war, no woman is safe if her hand in marriage can advance her family in the world of the mafia. But mistakes of the past have a way of slipping into the present and Alessa will soon learn that even the most shameful of secrets can get her everything she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adriano Conti’s loyalties are torn as he’s forced to stand at his father’s side while Riley uses his wife’s murder as a way to get higher. Blood comes first and then the Outfit. The one thing he doesn’t question in the war between the families is Alessa Trentini and even that doesn’t seem possible when he’s forced to watch Alessa be used as another man’s pawn. Adriano has his own role to play to get what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The families in the Outfit have never been more divided than they are now. Blood continues to spill as revenge takes center stage and more lives are lost. But every man in the family is fighting for something different and no one’s intentions can be trusted. Playing a dirty game might be the only way to stay alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if that means ruining it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please Note: Reckless should not be read before Deathless &amp;amp; Divided. This novel is NOT considered a standalone in the series.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Beverly Jenkins returns with the first book in a breathtaking new series set in the Old West&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhine Fontaine is building the successful life he's always dreamed of—one that depends upon him passing for White. But for the first time in years, he wishes he could step out from behind the façade. The reason: Eddy Carmichael, the young woman he rescued in the desert. Outspoken, defiant, and beautiful, Eddy tempts Rhine in ways that could cost him everything . . . and the price seems worth paying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddy owes her life to Rhine, but she won't risk her heart for him. As soon as she's saved enough money from her cooking, she'll leave this Nevada town and move to California. No matter how handsome he is, no matter how fiery the heat between them, Rhine will never be hers. Giving in for just one night might quench this longing. Or it might ignite an affair as reckless and irresistible as it is forbidden . . .</description>

  <description>After becoming widowed unexpectedly, image consultant Ava Hill is doing the best she can to raise her young daughter and distance herself from the ugliness of her past. But some associations are hard to escape and Ava soon finds herself caught in the web of lies surrounding her late husband, Joseph, a dangerous mob boss. &lt;br /&gt; Her world is further turned upside down when a man claiming to be her late husband’s son arrives and demands a share of her daughter’s inheritance. Ava vows to stop Dominic Sambarino by any means necessary, but what she doesn’t count on in the midst of their battle is the smoldering chemistry between them. &lt;br /&gt; When a chance to put her problems on the backburner presents itself, Ava accepts a friend’s invitation for a weekend away. But there is no escape when trouble is determined to find you. Ava’s weekend quickly threatens to cost her, her freedom or send her into the arms of the very person she needs to stay away from…Dominic. &lt;br /&gt; Ava soon finds herself at the mercy of a stalker determined to have her for his own. As the threats and acts of violence escalate, a shocking revelation proves that some dirty little secrets should remain buried. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's The Moth. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He's been waiting for this moment. With every kill, he can feel her getting closer. Very soon--just a few more victims to go. All he needed was the girl, Dani, and now that he has her, his plan is in motion, and no one can stop it. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving Dangerously Close. . .&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The police don't believe Shannon Flannery when she says someone is out there, watching her, trying to kill her. The only person on her side is Travis Settler. The former Special Forces agent is convinced Shannon's dark past has something to do with the disappearance of his daughter, Dani--a child whose connection to Shannon is just the beginning of a nightmare. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To The Flame. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets have been kept from Shannon. Dark, dangerous, and very fatal secrets. Now, with no one to trust but a man who has every reason to doubt her, Shannon's determined to discover the shocking truth, even if it brings her face to face with a serial killer whose slow burn for vengeance will not be denied. . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When you follow your heart, never count the cost.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Migrations of the Heart&lt;/i&gt;, Book 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trusting in the One who orders her steps, Nettie Bledsoe is determined not to deviate from her route to the charity kitchen. &lt;i&gt;Don’t stop for anything&lt;/i&gt;, her sisters say. &lt;i&gt;Pittsburgh isn’t like Georgia&lt;/i&gt;, they warn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet when low moans of unholy suffering drift from an alley, she can’t help but investigate. It’s a man. The most beautiful man she’s ever seen. Despite his scandalous reputation, something within her responds to his sinfully rich voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Evans is trying hard to stay on the straight and narrow, and doesn’t want help from any church do-gooder. But until his wound heals, he needs help caring for his young daughter, Goldie. Especially since Nettie saw fit to fire Goldie’s barely competent nanny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their mismatched backgrounds, Nettie and Jay fight a losing battle against their growing attraction. But it’s only when Nettie is kidnapped that Jay realizes that if he doesn’t get her back safe and sound, his heart will shatter into uncountable pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Contains a single father with a photographic memory for numbers, and a country girl out of her element in the city. It all adds up to a heart-winning tale.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They’re cut from different cloths…but their hearts are a perfect fit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asa Caldwell returned from the Great War with nothing to show for it—as in nothing below his left knee. Forget about the journalism career he loved. His story is over. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he finds the strength to journey to Winslow, Georgia, to get Ruby Bledsoe Morson’s sister out of trouble. Before he can bring Mags Bledsoe home, though, a spate of mysterious attacks reawakens his investigative instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the war, Mags did her duty to God and country by stepping into a management role at the textile mill. Now she’s been shuffled back to the rank and file—and Asa has her hard-earned job. Not only is the infernal man doing &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; wrong, her plan for revenge against the mill owner who lynched her childhood sweetheart is farther out of reach than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they clash over almost everything, Mags begins to set fire to Asa’s soul, bright enough to dim the memory of the killing fields of France. Enough to give him a new mission in life—to make her feel the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Contains a wounded warrior who’s done with fighting…and one feisty woman who makes him snap to attention.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unexpected love in a small, Southern town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After fifteen months of hiding from the shame of bearing an illegitimate child, two words drive Ruby Bledsoe to face the good citizens of Winslow, Georgia. Never again. She vows to speak out against injustice. For her sisters. For her parents. For her infant son, Solomon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she comes to help an injured mill worker, she bristles when a tall, handsome man claiming to be a doctor brushes her aside. Despite his arrogance, Ruby senses he’s someone like her, whose light skin doesn’t quite hide who he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up north, Dr. Adam Morson easily kept his mixed race a secret. Now that he’s in Georgia, summoned by his white father, he can feel restrictions closing in around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something powerful draws him to the beauty whose activist spirit is as fiery as her name. And soon, Adam wants nothing more than to take Ruby and her child far from Georgia’s toxic prejudice. But Ruby must choose between seeking her own happiness and staying to fight for the soul of her hometown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: Contains a doctor learning there’s more to healing his patients than stitching a wound, and more to a woman than knowing her place—and it’s not in the shadows with her head down. Sorry, Buckeye fans, this hero’s a Wolverine—but we won’t hold that against him.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Deception and betrayal always carry a price, and sooner or later, someone has to pay.&lt;br /&gt;For a long time, Terry King and Damien Wolfe have dodged those debts while the people around them paid – in loneliness, grief, constant fear, and the loss of innocent lives.&lt;br /&gt;But no more.&lt;br /&gt;It’s time to settle up, and though the difference between victim and villain isn’t always clear, this familiar band of hackers, spies, and federal agents are holding nothing back. In this final installment of the “If You Can” series, questions are answered, hidden motives are revealed, secrets are brought to light, and this dangerous adventure comes to a conclusion. &lt;br /&gt;Partnerships ruined by betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;Lovers tested by secrets.&lt;br /&gt;Families broken by lies.&lt;br /&gt;With everything around them in shambles, which relationships will endure?&lt;br /&gt;And when the story comes full circle… who will come out alive?</description>

The whole time I was reading Save Me If You Can, I kept looking at everyone sideways. Who could you really trust? And who had sinister motives. I like that the author gave us a taste of...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;One: Sign the contract.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette Romero had a debt to pay, a debt that wasn’t even hers. But it was the only way to keep her family safe and all she had to do was sell her body and soul to the devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killian McClary wasn’t called the Scarlet Wolf for nothing. He’d been the head of the McClary Organization since he was fifteen and had built a reputation for being a ruthless son of a bitch when it came to running the city’s underbelly, not to mention merciless when it came to punishing those who betray him. He didn’t believe in weaknesses. Only results. Juliette, with her shy smiles and hot little body was a weakness unlike any other and yet he was powerless to resist one more taste of her sweet flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two: Become his for a year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When given the choice between her life or her body, what could Juliette possibly do, but submit to a man whose very name invoked fear in the hearts of others? She just never anticipated falling for his dark, hungry eyes and clever hands, or the way the beast in him made her feel oddly safe and cherished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what will happen when Killian’s dark past finally catches up to him and threatens the woman he can no longer imagine himself without? What will happen when both sides find themselves caught in a web of passion, lies and broken promises? Can Juliette tame the wolf or will her love for him devour them both?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three: Don’t fall in love.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boundaries will be crossed, loyalties will be tested and lives will be changed forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dirty Promises is the final book in The Dirty Angels Trilogy. While the first two books can be read as standalones, Dirty Promises can not. Reading Dirty Angels and Dirty Deeds beforehand is HIGHLY recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people sensitive to violence and immoral characters who make questionable decisions should refrain from reading this book. The real cartel life is not pretty, not easy and certainly NOT romantic and that is more than reflected in Dirty Promises.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood. Sex. Revenge.&lt;br /&gt;It ain't easy being king.&lt;br /&gt;Drug lord Javier Bernal has sliced and diced his way to the top of the Mexican drug trade, presiding over the country's largest cartel. But his rise to power comes at a brutal price: the death of his sister, Alana. Devastated and wracked with guilt, he turns away from his new wife, Luisa, forcing their marriage into a steady decline. But it isn't until she's pushed into the waiting arms of Esteban Mendoza, his right-hand man, that Javier realizes everything he's lost.&lt;br /&gt;And it isn't until he learns the truth about Alana, that he realizes everything there is to gain.&lt;br /&gt;Blood will spill.&lt;br /&gt;Cities will burn.&lt;br /&gt;Heads will roll.&lt;br /&gt;Because Javier will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;And what he wants is raw, ruthless revenge.&lt;br /&gt;The most dangerous man is the one with nothing left to lose.</description>

  <description>“He’s fearless and ruthless. Soulless.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a flight attendant, Alana Bernal has had her share of suitors. She's also had more than her fair share of tragedy within her messed-up family. But what she hasn't had is love. Real, rip-your-heart-out, tear-your-clothes-off, all-consuming love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that was the case until she met an American tourist, Derek Conway, a ripped ex-soldier with steely eyes and a commanding presence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started as a chance encounter between the two in Puerto Vallarta, a weekend full of hot sex and mindless passion, has led to something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Derek isn't the type of man to fall in love. He's not a man who sticks around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he's definitely not in Mexico on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek is a mercenary, a killer-for-hire, a man who does the ugly jobs for the highest bidder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Alana and Derek, the highest bidder has the power to destroy whatever worlds they have created for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest bidder can destroy everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is a romantic suspense book, #2 in the Dirty Angels trilogy but can be read as a standalone novel*</description>

  <description>**warning: this book contains situations which might be triggers for some people. Please see the bottom of this description to see if this is the kind of book that you'll love or piss you off**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Luisa Chavez, a twenty-three year old former beauty queen, a better life has always been just out of her reach. Sure, she’s had men at her feet since she was a young teenager but she’s never had the one thing she’s craved – security. Having grown up in near poverty, her waitressing job in Cabo San Lucas can barely let her take care of herself, let alone her ailing parents. Every day is another unwanted advance, every day is a struggle to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Salvador Reyes, the depraved leader of a major Mexican cartel, takes an interest in her, Luisa is presented with an opportunity she can’t afford to pass up. She’ll become Salvador’s wife and exchange her freedom and body for a life of riches – riches she can bestow upon her deserving parents. But Luisa quickly finds out that even the finest wines and jewels can’t undo the ugliness in her marriage, nor the never-ending violence that threatens her every move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Luisa is looking for an escape, a way out of the carefully controlled life she’s leading. She finally gets her wish in the worst way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, being the wife of Salvador makes her an ideal target for rival cartels and there’s one particular man who needs Luisa as part of his cartel’s expansion. One particular man whose quest for power has destroyed lives, slit throats and gotten him out of an American prison. One particular man who will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That man is Javier Bernal. And he wants Luisa. He wants to take her, keep her, ruin her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless she ruins him first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***WARNING*** This book deals with drug cartels and as such it contains a lot of sex and violence and some violent sex. It can get pretty ugly, pretty dark and pretty crazy. There is drug use, abuse, a bit of torture and dubious consent. The hero is not a hero and the villains...well, they're even worse. If this sort of thing bothers you, PLEASE DO NOT READ IT. This ain't no cupcake farting unicorn kind of book. If you are even a bit squeamish about violence, brutality and rape, this is your warning to stay away from a book that you certainly will not like (and why read books that you know you won't like?)***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***While this is a spin-off of The Artists Trilogy, prior knowledge of the books is not needed. DIRTY ANGELS is the first in a trilogy, however each book can standalone and follows or introduces different characters***</description>

  <description>Simone is a woman on a mission: Stop being boring, and fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;That's easier said than done with no prospects on the table... or under the table... or near the table. Her luck changes when fellow neighborhood business owner Roman Taylor walks through the door of her flower shop.&lt;br /&gt;Roman is single, successful, and sexy — everything Simone is looking for to embark on a whirlwind summer romance with the potential to spark an everlasting love.&lt;br /&gt;But things are never as "perfect" as they seem, and Simone — and Roman — have to decide if they're willing to risk their hearts when things get a little messy in their pursuit of a crazy little thing called love.</description>

  <description>A war is coming, a battle that will stretch from the prehistoric forests of the ancient past to the cutting-edge research labs of today, all to reveal a true mystery buried deep within our DNA, a mystery that will leave readers changed forever . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this groundbreaking masterpiece of ingenuity and intrigue that spans 50,000 years in human history, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author James Rollins takes us to mankind’s next great leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will it mark a new chapter in our development . . . or our extinction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the remote mountains of Croatia, an archaeologist makes a strange discovery:  a subterranean Catholic chapel, hidden for centuries, holds the bones of a Neanderthal woman. In the same cavern system, elaborate primitive paintings tell the story of an immense battle between tribes of Neanderthals and monstrous shadowy figures. Who is this mysterious enemy depicted in these ancient drawings and what do the paintings mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before any answers could be made, the investigative team is attacked, while at the same time, a bloody assault is made upon a primate research center outside of Atlanta. How are these events connected? Who is behind these attacks?  The search for the truth will take Commander Gray Pierce of Sigma Force 50,000 years into the past. As he and Sigma trace the evolution of human intelligence to its true source, they will be plunged into a cataclysmic battle for the future of humanity that stretches across the globe . . . and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the fate of our future at stake, Sigma embarks on its most harrowing odyssey ever—a breathtaking quest that will take them from ancient tunnels in Ecuador that span the breadth of South America to a millennia-old necropolis holding the bones of our ancestors. Along the way, revelations involving the lost continent of Atlantis will reveal true mysteries tied to mankind’s first steps on the moon. In the end, Gray Pierce and his team will face to their greatest threat: an ancient evil, resurrected by modern genetic science, strong enough to bring about the end of man’s dominance on this planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only this time, Sigma will falter—and the world we know will change forever.</description>

  <description>They say that love happens when you least expect it. Meet the star of this story, Hunter "Rush" Cambridge: Heartthrob, somewhat of a local celebrity, and hugely guarded of those he loves. Rush has never been in love. Lust is more his thing. In fact, he's all business. The former athlete and current bar owner is solely focused on getting his new mega club up and running. But then Alika Collins comes crashing into his life-literally. Alika has flown from Las Vegas, to the Bay Area to meet up with someone that she met online. Only when she arrives, things quickly go south and Alika realizes that she has made the biggest mistake of her life. But did she? Sometimes bad things occur so that better things can replace them... After Alika manages to escape her situation, she finds refuge in the backseat of Rush's car. Everything moves quickly from that point as she is insinuated into his world. Although Rush is preparing for the opening of his new club, he is compelled to be a source of help to her, in the process. But while Rush is helping to sort out pieces of Alika's life, he's got a few problems of his own. There are forces conspiring to take down everything that he has worked so hard for, and he's not having it. Will Rush emerge unscathed once the truth comes out? Will there be love at the end for him and Alika, or is he just the person who happened to come along when she needed a friend the most?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; I knew I was taking a risk loving a man like Julian Markham. But I thought that love was enough to cover over his darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought wrong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy Leavold came to Markham Hall looking for a home and a new start, and instead she found the enigmatic Julian Markham--along with a love that threatened to consume them both.  Now Mr. Markham is offering her a new life as his bride, as the mistress of Markham Hall, and Ivy wants nothing more than to say yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ivy knows that the closer she binds herself to Mr. Markham, the closer she binds herself to danger.  And the deeper their love grows, the closer she gets to discovering the truth surrounding her cousin's death.  Once she does, the explosive secret will rip them apart... possibly forever.</description>

  <description>When Nathan Hamilton was accused of killing Landy Connor just weeks before their college graduation, he lost everything—his friends, his reputation, and the love of his life, Tenile Barnes. For ten long years, the murder has remained unsolved, nothing but false leads and dead ends. Desperate to bring Landy’s killer to justice and win back Tenile’s heart, Nathan starts his own investigation. But the first break in the case comes at a high price: Landy’s old roommate Nicole is kidnapped . . . possibly by the same person who killed Landy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan and his old friends comb through every memory, every photograph, and every trace of evidence for clues about who killed Landy then and who has taken Nicole now. As they separate fact from vicious rumor and piece together what really happened that night, they discover that the truth is darker and more twisted than they ever imagined. The killer is close, waiting in the shadows, ready to strike again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shocking sequel to &lt;i&gt;Rumors&lt;/i&gt;, will the friends finally reveal Landy’s killer . . . or will Nicole be the next to fall?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Her death tore them apart. Will solving her murder bring them back together?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best friends Landy, Tenile, Nicole, Nathan, Justin, and Kareem were the golden children of Tanner University. Their paths were set: doctors, lawyers, business moguls, they were going to light the world on fire. Then, two weeks before graduation, Landy was murdered—and Nathan was blamed. Though he was never charged, vicious rumors drove him from town, and the circle of friends broke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Nathan is back in Tanner, determined to clear his name. He’s asking questions no one wants answered, and soon rumors threaten to divide the community once more. Everyone in this small town is keeping big secrets—especially Landy’s old friends—and someone is willing to kill to keep their darkest deeds buried.</description>

  <description>Lies and love. This is how a war starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A life for a life. That’s the mafia way. Damian Rossi owes his life to a man who is ready to collect. That payment comes in the form of an arranged marriage to the daughter of another leading family in the Chicago Outfit. He’s ready to follow through, even if that means making sure Lily knows she’s his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily DeLuca isn’t being given a choice. Forced home to marry a man she doesn’t know and back into a life she’d rather forget, her world is full of half-truths, buried pain, and uncertainty. But Damian is nothing like she expects. His motives aren’t clear. Her beliefs are being tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to this world, no man can be trusted. Someone is ready to flip the Chicago Outfit on its side all for the promise of something better. But no one runs a clean game and these men play for keeps. When blood begins to paint Chicago red, four families will be divided by loyalty, hatred, and revenge. There is no hiding. There is no safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is deathless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one.</description>

  <description>“Don’t fall in love with me. I ruin beautiful things.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love made him this way, but life makes him stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life doesn’t give a redo. There’s no rewind or pause button to take you back or stop time. Once something happens, it happened. The most tragic of those times in his life, the ones he wouldn’t get back and the moments he could never fix, reminded Demyan Avdonin of a bullet meeting glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The impact of the bullet doesn't break the glass into pieces, but instead, leaves behind a single hole surrounded by a spider web of cracks. Fragile cracks that, when handled with the utmost care, would splinter into shards of what used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demyan thought he had been broken beyond repair once, four long years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She touched the glass, unknowing of the cracks holding him together. These are the broken pieces of a shattered man and the woman who made him live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life made him this way, but love makes him stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demyan's Story&lt;br /&gt;The Final Russian Guns Novel</description>

  <description>Between the fall-out from his father’s latest shady business dealings and his wife Clarisse’s alcoholism, Evan Murdoch has his hands full. But he should be most concerned about the scandalous affair Clarisse is having right under his nose—with his half-brother. Evan’s being pushed to the edge, and no one knows that better than Leila Hawkins…&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Leila is back in Chesterton, divorced, penniless, and desperate enough to do anything to save her mother’s home from foreclosure—including turning to Evan, her former best friend. But Evan isn’t interested in friendship. Instead he makes Leila a shocking indecent proposal…&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, Evan’s newlywed sister, Paulette, wants to be the perfect wife. But a blackmailing bad boy ex has reappeared in her life—and he’s threatening to reveal her most painful secret... &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The scandals just won’t quit—and for everyone involved, desire, betrayal, and lies are all in a day’s work…</description>

  <description>Kali’s maturity into the warrior she once was could not have come at a better time. Still haunted by his gruesome punishment in Golden Mountain, Rhane is slowly coming undone as the pressure mounts to save this world and preserve the lives of those closest to him. But given a miraculous chance to fix mistakes from the past, Rhane and Kali soon realize that the undertaking may be beyond the reach of even their combined powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battle lines have been drawn as evil marches toward their doorstep. But who fights for which side has never been more unclear. And time is running out to separate friend from foe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torn between saving their family and saving the world, Rhane and Kali are faced with impossible choices…and devastating consequences. Because sometimes, a little evil is necessary to protect what is loved most…and sometimes, even that may not be enough.</description>

  <description>Antony Marcello didn’t break the rules. Not the ones that mattered, anyway. In the world of La Cosa Nostra, justice was served with a single word and a bullet, not a courthouse and a judge. When he was told to jump, there was only one appropriate response: How high, Boss? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some rules are worth bending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La famiglia has been Antony’s goal for longer than he cares to remember. Getting his button is everything alongside family, honor, God, and loyalty. Meeting Cecelia Catrolli puts what he thought he knew upside down as the mafia, friendship, secrets and love carry him through life. Nothing is ever easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some rules are worth the killing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cosa Nostra, the one thing he has always known and trusted, takes away his best friend, leaving Antony to pick up the pieces, he’ll have to decide if the rules are finally worth breaking. He didn’t start out as the boss, he began as just Antony. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, you have to learn how to be filthy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Filthy Marcellos&lt;/i&gt; Prequel</description>

  <description>Olivia has one goal upon returning to London: Find Lord Langley and seduce him. &lt;br /&gt;It was no secret that her stepsister was a miserable excuse for a human being and the secrets shrouding her demise only added confirmation that even in death---she wasn't worthy of the handsome Lord. &lt;br /&gt;According to rumors, Lord Langley is after revenge, but she's after something far more dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;His heart. &lt;br /&gt;One masquerade aligns their paths in ways neither of them could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;Will he succumb to the fair beauty? Or forever allow his heart to be entrenched by the beastly claws of her dead sister?</description>

  <description>Sarai was willing to throw it all away for what she thought was love. Even she didn't know why. All she knew was that her feelings were in deep. However, there was a price to pay. Her friendship with Brooklyn, her relationship with Pandora's Box...both gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the root of it all was Erik Warren. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Readers will remember Erik Warren from Installment I of the Pandora's Box series. He was a cheater then, and he's a cheater now. However, Sarai doesn't know that, and throws all of what she previously knew about him on the back burner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she will soon learn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are more surprises for Sarai's life as the story unfolds. A past she had long left, comes to surface, and leaves her in an emotional tailspin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With everything piling on, Sarai is forced to re-examine herself, and her past actions so that she can confront...and possibly undue what has been done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***THE SERIES*** &lt;br /&gt;All short stories of no more than 25k that are meant to be similar to "episodes"... each one telling a different story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Installment I : The Color of Lies &lt;br /&gt;Introducing Brooklyn Kellogg and her agency, Pandora's Box &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Installment II : What Lies beneath the Surface &lt;br /&gt;A mother's love is what takes Sherry Laguna in to see Brooklyn.

      <![CDATA[Erik is a character all by himself. I was so happy to see him miserable and realizing that he lost the best thing he ever had. I found myself wanting to bash Sarai up the head sometimes and I was so happy when she and Brooklyn had their conversation. Brooklyn said all the things I wanted to say!...]]>

  <description>Leah Barnett can't believe how far fate has carried her: from Boston to the towering Colorado Rockies...and into the life of an angry, ruggedly sexy man. Ryder Damien is not about to welcome this beauty with open arms, however, especially since Leah was the one who won the affection of Ryder's late father and now may inherit, his considerable wealth. But when she stands before him in the flesh -- proud, vulnerable, and intoxicatingly lovely -- desire replaces hatred in Ryder's heart. Yet can passion survive this wild land and its dangerous men...and the most breathtaking peril: untamed love?</description>

  <description>Dante Marcello’s life has been a carefully planned event as an heir to a Cosa Nostra throne. For as long as he can remember, he’s had one goal in mind, and that’s becoming the Don. With his father ready to step down, it’s Dante’s turn to step up. But without a wife at his side, his seat as the boss is on shaky ground. Until she shows up with an offer he wants to refuse, but can’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her, he’s got everything to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catrina Danzi is known for her angel face and a predator’s grace. For over a decade, she’s worked as a successful Queen Pin dealing with a repertoire of clientele who can’t afford a scandal. That’s why they ask for her and why they call her Queen. Marrying Dante Marcello means giving up the business and status she loves in order to gain protection she can’t provide on her own, but she no longer has a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without him, she’s got everything to lose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rules for their arrangement are simple: no intimacy, no emotions. Dante isn’t looking for love and Catrina doesn’t need attachments. In the end, life has a way of breaking down walls when you least expect it to, and once love gets in, there’s no bleeding it out. Together, they make a formidable team the Commission won’t be able to ignore. Catrina’s secret of what she’s kept safe will put the entire Marcello family in danger when it finally catches up with her. The Marcellos have yet to be beaten, and they’re not about to start bowing down now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the most beautiful things are a little filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be read as a standalone in the series.</description>

  <description>Giovanni Marcello lives life by his own terms and has no intention of changing. As a Capo and the son of a mob boss, he knows what is and is not acceptable conduct. That doesn’t stop him from doing whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it. The one thing he would never do is disobey the principles of La Cosa Nostra. That is, until he spends a night with a beautiful stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll break every rule for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Abella has made some mistakes—no doubt about it. She’s paying for them by a forced marriage she doesn’t want to a man who suffocates her with his demands and abuse. After everything, she knew better than to get mixed up with another family, especially their youngest son. Then again, when she’s with him, he reminds her of who she is beneath the control that’s slowly killing her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just can’t leave him alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being spoken for by a made man means Kim is off-limits, but Giovanni doesn’t play nice when it comes to taking what should be his. The only thing that might save them both from a bullet and a makeshift grave for what they’ve done are the very same rules they already broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, love has to start out a little filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filthy Marcellos, Book Two&lt;br /&gt;Can be read as a standalone in the series. &lt;br /&gt;Please note: not suitable for people under the age of 18 due to minor drug use, scenes of violence, and sexual situations intended for adults only.</description>

  <description>Lucian Marcello is aware of the expectations following him as the oldest son of one of North America’s most infamous Cosa Nostra Dons. Family in his world is more than blood and sharing a last name. It’s the honor, respect, business, and the life. Being a Capo is just a stepping stone until it’s time for him to take on the role of underboss but a chance meeting with her could be the one thing he’d risk it all for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is exactly what he didn’t know he was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordyn Reese spends her time trying to stay under the radar of a man who wouldn’t think twice about killing her. Unwillingly affiliated with a dangerous MC gang, her life is dominated by the men surrounding her and her future rests solely in how useful she can be for them. The last thing she needs is some Mafioso gaining her more unwanted attention from the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is everything she should stay away from but can’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notoriously violent when it comes to getting what he wants, Lucian will stop at nothing to make the target on Jordyn’s back disappear. But sometimes the worst threats are the ones you can’t see until it’s too late. The truth behind Lucian’s history is about to take center stage in more ways than one, and it’ll either save him … or kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This world leaves everyone a little filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filthy Marcellos, Book One&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filthy Marcellos: La Cosa Nostra is not just a choice of regime and routine, it’s a culture. Born as mafia royalty, the Marcello brothers were raised ingrained with the beliefs and rules of what it meant to be a Mafioso prince. It is for life. Their status is considered a given right. They will always be these people. They will always be Marcellos.</description>

  <description>Popular fantasy author Kelley Armstrong (Women of the Otherworld series) makes her first foray into crime fiction, with the debut of a series of non-paranormal novels featuring female assassin Nadia Stafford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Nadia Stafford is one of the world’s few female contract killers. A former cop, drummed out of the force because of a scandal, she is an expert at disguise and cool under pressure. But when fellow hitman Jack arrives on the scene, Nadia’s very private existence is seriously challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A series of victims are being murdered seemingly at random all over the country — different areas, different walks of life, different MOs. There is nothing to tie them together except a random page torn out of a single book: &lt;i&gt;Helter Skelter&lt;/i&gt;. But does the Helter Skelter killer — as the hysterical media now dub him — have a real connection to Charles Manson? Or is there something even more sinister at work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this, in fact — as Jack believes — the carefully planned exit strategy of a fellow professional killer, determined to leave the life, but equally determined to clear up an old mistake? And, if so, which is the real victim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the highly suspicious and secretive hitman community will have to break their cover — at least, to each other — and help take down this killer before the cops and the Feds discover his true connection to their own secret, exclusive society….</description>

  <description>15k word short story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A fantasy tale created from a myth that derives from the Trobriand Islands (today officially known as the Kiriwina Islands). Isa is the beautifully tortured soul who has never known love, and who has pretty much traveled through life alone. When tragic circumstances lead her into the depths of the sea, she has no idea what her fate may hold, and thus prepares for worst. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, as in life, sometimes we have to go through our very worst to get to the place we were destined to be. Such is the case with Isa. Just when she thinks all is lost, she meets Chief Topileta, headman of the villages of the dead, and an unexpected love affair ensues. As Isa will soon find, nothing in her life stays peaceful for long, and before she knows it, she is separated from the only person to ever care for her. When tragedy strikes and Isa finds herself awake after two years of falling into a deep sleep, she is surprised to find that all thoughts are still with the man she has not forgotten. But has he forgotten her? Will he come for her? Will she find love again? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is only the beginning of Isa’s story, in the full length novel that is set for 2015 release, readers will find out the many layers of Isa and be able to journey with her as she finds out about her lineage and the family she was sure did not exist. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt; This is a standalone BWWM love story &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tessa DeCarlo is a career woman, and a devoted wife. Her work life is good-fulfilling, even. However, she can't say the same about her marriage. But Tessa loves her husband, and she is determined to make their union work. She overlooks their lackluster sex life, as well as his disinterest in doing 'couple stuff'. It's what she signed on for, after all. For better or worse, right? But, when Tessa is hit with the ultimate betrayal just days before her class reunion, maintaining loyalty inside of a failing marriage is the last thing on her mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite what she has gone through, and rather than wallow in self-pity, Tessa decides to attend the event. She has no idea what to expect from the evening, its sole purpose is meant to serve as a getaway. But, when she encounters August, a former college classmate, sparks fly. But not for long . . . There will be twists, turns, and added cast members to bring this story to life. Will Tessa return to her marriage and try to make it work? Will she decide on a road untraveled? Or, will she choose to be alone? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed reading this novel. Tessa is a strong, independent woman who takes no mess and refuses to let a trifling man hold her down. The author did an excellent job fleshing out Tessa's world and giving the readers a glimpse into the life of a woman I'm sure many of us know in real life....]]>

  <description>Demyan and Ana have lived in privilege and protection as the children of Anton and Viviana Avdonin. With a Russian mob boss for a father and a mafia queen for a mother, they’ve got big shoes to fill. Love and life are messy games to play, especially when you’re new at it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An attack on one Avdonin will leave the family stunned and hurting. Their retribution is brutal, but the repercussions for their revenge will be even more devastating. Because when blood is spilled in their world, more must fall, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one is safe. They have always been formidable—unstoppable. But they are not bulletproof. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Giving all of your heart to one person means running the risk of losing it when life comes crashing down. A happily ever after is just beyond their grasps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One will get theirs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the other won’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Russian Guns Novella, Prequel to Shattered &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Possible triggers and scenes of violence. &lt;br /&gt;Demyan &amp;amp; Ana can be read as a standalone in the series.</description>

  <description>When Gianna watched her sister Aria getting married to a man she barely knew, she promised herself she wouldn’t let the same thing happen to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matteo – The Blade – Vitiello set his eyes on Gianna the moment he saw her on his brother Luca’s wedding, and Rocco Scuderi is more than willing to give his daughter to him, but Gianna has no intention of marrying for any other reason than love. A few months before the wedding, Gianna escapes her bodyguards and runs away. She has enough money to flee to Europe and begin a new life. But staying undetected when the mob is searching for her is a challenge that takes everything, especially as one of their best hunters and assassins is after her: Matteo Vitiello. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months on the run, Gianna finally settles into a tentative routine in Munich, but then Matteo and a couple of her father’s soldiers find her with another man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her pleads they kill her boyfriend, and Gianna is forced to marry Matteo. Her emotions alternating between guilt over having dragged an innocent into her world and hatred toward Matteo, Gianna is determined to make life hell for her husband. But Matteo is a master at mind games and their struggle for power soon turns into hate-fueled nights of passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book three in the &lt;b&gt;Born in Blood Mafia Chronicles&lt;/b&gt;. This book can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Dante – The Boss – Cavallaro’s wife died four years ago. On the verge of becoming the youngest head in the history of the Chicago mafia, Dante needs a new wife and Valentina was chosen for the role. &lt;br /&gt;Valentina lost her husband, too, but her first marriage had always been for show. When she was eighteen, she agreed to marry Antonio in order to hide the truth: that he was gay and in love with an outsider. Even after his death, she kept his secret, not only to preserve the honor of a dead man, but also to protect herself. But now that she’s about to marry Dante, her castle of lies threatens to crash. Dante is only thirty-six but already feared and respected in the Outfit, and he’s notorious for always getting what he wants. Valentina is terrified of the wedding night that might reveal her secret, but her worries prove unfounded when Dante shows her the cold shoulder. Soon her fear is replaced by confusion and indignation. Valentina is tired of being ignored. She’s determined to get Dante’s attention and desire, even if she can’t get his heart that still belongs to his dead wife.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every Serial Killer...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; A serial killer is stalking the streets of New Orleans. The victims are killed in a ritual fashion, a series of numbers tattooed into their bodies. There are no clues, no connections except one: a crumbling old asylum that was once the scene of unspeakable madness--and is now the calling card of a new kind of fear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Is Searching For...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eve Renner knows Our Lady of Virtues Hospital well. As the daughter of one of its doctors, she spent her childhood exploring its secrets chambers, hidden rooms, and forbidden passageways. Now, somewhere in the decaying asylum lies the key to a betrayal from the past whose echoes are being felt with a vengeance--a crime beyond imagining that seems to lead to Eve herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Perfect Victim...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As each new body is found and forgotten, memories surface, and Eve must race to put together a deadly puzzle, one terrifying piece at a time. A killer is watching, planning, luring her back to the ruins of Our Lady and the shocking truths hidden there. For the sins of the past must be revealed, and the price paid--in blood...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Within the bounds of complacency, there exists a boring, beautiful sort of peace, and Khalida has found it. Welcomes it, in fact. A nice, comfortable life, with a great job, a good, albeit on and off again boyfriend, a great relationship with her younger sister... She has nothing to complain about. &lt;br /&gt;But that's only if she ignores the sense of unrest that has haunted her ever since she could remember, overshadowing her ability to connect in love. Only if she glosses over the fact that she’s leaning more toward a permanent off switch when it comes to Travis. Only if she tunes out her way-too-old-for-make-believe younger sister's sudden insistence that some things are a little suspicious when it comes to the details of their past. &lt;br /&gt;A month ago... Everything was fine. But now — and suspiciously timed with the entry of sexier than possible Aram Duncan into her life — unexplained hallucinations have Khalida questioning if maybe there’s something other-worldly happening around her. But all of that nonsense... Psychic abilities, immortals, time manipulation, mind control.... None of that really exists... Right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;First One Dead Body. . .&lt;/b&gt;A prostitute lies strangled in a seedy French Quarter hotel room. Miles away, in a rambling plantation house on the sultry shores of Lake Ponchartrain, popular late-night radio host Dr. Samantha Leeds receives a threatening crank call. All in a day's work for a celebrity. Who would think to link the two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then Another. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second hooker's corpse turns up. Samantha's ominous caller persists, along with a mysterious claiming to be a woman from her past--a woman who's been dead for years. With Detective Rick Bentz convinced that the serial killer prowling the shadowy streets of New Orleans is somebody close to Samantha, she doesn't dare trust anyone. Especially not Ty Wheeler, her seductive new neighbor who seems to know more about her than a stranger should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;. . .And Another&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody has discovered Samantha's darkest secret. Somebody is convinced that lives must be sacrificed to pay for her sins. So far, the victims have been strangers. But as a cunning, cold-blooded killer grows bolder, Samantha wonders in dread if she will be the next to die. . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;His Vengeance Will Be Repeated.  .  . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;A woman's slashed, incinerated corpse is found in a seedy New Orleans apartment. Her killer is certain there were no witnesses, unaware that his every move was seen by a beautiful stranger--from her bed in a bayou cottage on the outskirts of town.  .  . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Repeated.  .  . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weeks later, another violent vision shatters Olivia Bechet's sleep. Convinced a serial killer is stalking the city, Olivia turns to the authorities. But jaded detective Rick Bentz doesn't believe her--even when a second body turns up, slain in exactly the same bizarre, ritualistic manner Olivia described.  .  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Repeated.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As New Orleans panics in the icy grip of a merciless killer, Olivia is frustrated by Bentz's skepticism--and captivated by her attraction to him. But soon her dreams are invaded by images of another murder. One that has yet to be committed. This time, Olivia recognizes not only the victim's face--but the murderer's. And both are closer than she ever imagined.  .  .</description>

  <description>Gavin Brooks is back and he's in love... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In book I, Gavin was an unstoppable player. He was a married man living a bachelor's life. But when he encountered the beautiful Christina, he had an unexpected, and extremely undeniable attraction to her. Book I ended with Gavin in the early stages of a whirlwind relationship with Christina. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, Christina still has no idea that the man she has strong feelings for, is married to someone else. The deeper that Gavin falls, the more he comes to realize that he needs to tell her. But how can he do that without losing her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Sharon...a woman scorned, and who still carries a torch for Gavin. She is out for revenge feeling that Gavin used her then threw her away. She wants him to pay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While Gavin contemplates on how, and when he will break the news to Christina, someone else manages to beat him to the punch. It's a devastating blow to Christina and she walks away. But for how long? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is more to Gavin than meets the eye, and in this book readers get to find out about a piece of his past that plays a huge role in how he came to be the man he is today. Gavin is forced to relive a past hurt, as he comes to terms with the fact that he may never win Christina back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will he do all that he can to win her back? Or will he feel that she is better off without him?</description>

  <description>Secrets always have a way of coming to light.&lt;br /&gt;Special Agent Renata Parker learns this the hard way, when the secret she’s held close for many years is finally revealed, exposing her as traitor to the team of thieves, spies, hackers, and federal agents who thought they shared a common goal — take down Damien Wolfe. Her dedication to their cause doesn’t quite stand up to scrutiny — especially for Quentin, a fellow hacker who was drawn to Renata’s quiet energy before her true identity was exposed. &lt;br /&gt;With her loyalty in question, Renata finds herself in a position where she’s forced to rely on help from the very people she may have unwittingly betrayed. &lt;br /&gt;Quentin wants to trust Renata, but repairing their friendship — and possibly taking it further — requires the healing of past wounds, answering unresolved questions, and revealing unknown connections that bring new light to Damien Wolfe’s misdeeds.&lt;br /&gt;While Quentin and Renata search for common ground, Marcus and Naomi navigate unexpected circumstances in their budding relationship, and Inez tries to resist Kendall’s magnetic, dangerous appeal.&lt;br /&gt;Romance, danger, a little hacking, and a bit of espionage ensue as the team struggles to be released from the traumas of their past.</description>

  <description>It all started in college, in the turbulent sixties, when Randolph and Jenna became lovers. Randolph knew the moment he saw Jenna Haywood that he had to make her his. But the path to love is not an easy one. His wealthy Grandmother Julia disapproves of the match and unbeknowst to him, his brother's seemingly docile fiancee has a few plans of her own that she would like to set in motion. Betrayal and devastation lurks in unexpected places and tests the bond they believed was unbreakable. As they struggle with love and passion, secrets and lies the question is: Is love enough to help them see each other through the storms that await them ahead?</description>
