  <description>&lt;b&gt; Ariana has been kidnapped. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ariana hoped never to know the horrors of living in captivity again. But she wakes to find herself a prisoner once more, and no one can save her this time. Her captors have bound her beasties inside her, her mates don’t know where she is, and a betrayal shatters her last hope. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon she learns the terrible truth. Her captors plan to use her blood to exterminate vampires. Trapped in a science experiment from hell, Ariana has no escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there are two things her captors didn’t count on. Ariana’s blood does more than turn vampires human. And no one knows just what Ariana is truly capable of—not even Ariana herself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a reverse harem paranormal romance that features one kick-butt woman and her four shifter mates. It contains violence, medium burn romance, sexually explicit content, magic, vampires, and a lot of action. For ages 18+. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Everybody wants a piece of Ariana. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After surviving the latest vampire attack, Ari's mates are certain that the bloodsuckers are out to get her. Is someone else after her, too? Vampires, humans, and warlocks all have reasons to want her. Worse, she’s not sure she can trust her own mates. Maximus struggles with jealousy, and Jett still hasn't accepted the mate bond. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As tensions rise between her mates and the clans, Ariana struggles with her role as peacemaker. She’s barely gotten a taste of freedom and begun to adjust to her role as the Silver Shifter when another attack rocks the New York clans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She and her alphas may never recover from this one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a reverse harem paranormal romance that features one kick-butt woman and her four shifter mates. It contains violence, medium burn romance, sexually explicit content, magic, vampires, and a lot of action. For ages 18+. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Ariana has been stuck inside a cage as long as she can remember.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;From one master to the next, she hasn’t known kindness since her parents were alive, and even then, she never belonged to herself. When a handsome werewolf saves her from the fighting pits, Ariana’s life is turned upside down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thrown into a brand new world, Ariana discovers she’s not only a wolf, but the Silver Shifter, a being born every hundred years, and she’s supposed to be the last. But her hot new alpha is hiding more than he’s telling, including the alphas of the other New York packs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wolves. Dragons. Bears. Panthers. Each pack is holding back a secret from her, like why Ariana feels an unnatural pull to each. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a reverse harem paranormal romance that features one kick-butt woman and her four shifter mates. It contains violence, medium burn romance, sexually explicit content, magic, vampires, and a lot of action. For ages 18+.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;For Remi St. James, It started with the blackouts. Then the vivid nightmares. That’s nothing compared to waking up naked, alone in a forest with no recollection of how she got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scary as hell, but what she discovers is far worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remi was changing into something more--something supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After coming to terms with what she is, Remi starts school at the Gladwell Academy of Shifters, an exclusive and secretive college designed to awaken those with extraordinary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remi meets Laith Brighton, an impossibly hot, mountain lion shifter who's also an irresistible jerk. Then there's the cliques of werewolves and bears. Plenty of mean girls with mind powers. Everything a regular college has--just a bit weirder. But what she discovers is far darker than anyone could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Can she maintain her sanity in a place that is incredibly insane?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of the &lt;em&gt;Fallen Academy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Supernatural Academy&lt;/em&gt; series will love this snarky paranormal fantasy filled with shifters and romance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>I barely survived my first year at Darkhen Academy, and now with Ryder gone and my heart shattered I’m not sure I’ll outlive the second. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I have to, right? Because Luxora and her evil minions aren’t waiting around for me to get over my broken heart. With increased attacks in the human world, the supe slayer squad must ride on! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then there’s my father. He’s kind of obsessed with unlocking my new super powers. As the first female warlock ever, he’s dead set on harnessing my abilities, even my darkest ones. But if I do, will the dark oracle’s prophecy prove true? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, I can’t focus on any of that when all I want to do is tear apart the Underworld until I find Ryder. But after months apart, will the man I find be the same one I fell for? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***This is an upper YA/NA crossover with schmexy supernatural guys and is best suited for age 16 and over. Be warned, the steaminess factor does increase through the course of the series!</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the Supernatural Slayer Squad! &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our task is simple. Kill all the demon baddies before they wreak havoc on the human realm and destroy the fragile peace between our two worlds. Easy peasy, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, if I can’t figure out how to get this devil’s mark off my chest, the demons won’t stop coming for me. Luckily, my long lost father has shown up promising to help me get rid of it. But do I really want a dark warlock’s help? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s my love life—or serious lack there of. I broke all the rules my first semester, and the worst was falling for my demon bad boy instructor. Our so-called relationship is strictly forbidden and if he can’t get his inner demon under control, we’re totally screwed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the dark lord of the Underworld has set her sights on me and my unique powers. She’s dead set on making the human world her evil minions’ playground and thinks I’m the key to stopping her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I guess I have to be… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;***This is an upper YA/NA crossover with schmexy supernatural guys and is best suited for age 16 and over. Be warned, the steaminess factor does increase through the course of the series! &lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Welcome to Darkblood—oops, I mean Darkhen Academy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three rules to survive the elite supernatural school:&lt;br /&gt;1.	Do not talk or even look at The Seven, the uber-powerful supes that rule the academy.&lt;br /&gt;2.	Never go into the Fae forest on a full moon… or else.&lt;br /&gt;3.	And most definitely do not fall for one of the extremely hot and unattainable instructors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I’ve never really been a rule follower…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago the supernaturals came out of the closet on primetime TV, and about a minute ago I found out I was one of them—well, a half-blood anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am at Darkhen Academy, the only human and no magical abilities to speak of. The only reason I’m here is because of my father—a man I didn’t even know existed until now. He’s crazy powerful, and they think I could be too. But what could I possibly contribute to an exclusive squad of dragon shifters, fae, witches, and vampires? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we’re about to find out because the merging of the supernatural and human realms isn’t going as smoothly as planned. If word gets out that humans are no longer safe from the supes, our worlds will once again be closed off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s up to us to stop that from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "Darkblood Academy" books are a spinoff of the "Hitched" series by G.K. DeRosa. The storyline is set after the events in "Hitched". It references some of it's storyline and shares some characters that were introduced there. Therefore it is advisable to read the "Hitched" books first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Finishing our first year at Witchling Academy brings a wave of new experiences. Now with Semester Three approaching it's time for me to decide what path I want to walk as I enter young adulthood.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, Brianne Marie Harlow, am now dating the Notorious Four. It's still quite a shock in my mind, but to be surrounded by my supportive family and friends, it's become something life changing for me and my four amazing boyfriends - Jax, Connor, Finnick, and Kaito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With summer break, brings moments of adventure and exploration, as I begin to figure out what I want in this group relationship and deal with my own insecurities. Adding my new familiar to the mix and having two amazing best friends to help me figure out the goods and bads about dating, summer goes by like a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Semester Three is where things start getting messy.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the professors warned us about the change in dynamic with year one to year two, we never would have thought it would escalate to magic battles, car chases, and end us in the middle of a magic crime case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding the continuous bullying, old memories, girl jealousy, and issues developing within my own team, we're going to have to stick tightly together or we'll be pulled apart forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I won't let that happen. If I'd have to be the middle ground to keep my Notorious Four from tearing apart, I'd do it right here and now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in the name of protecting the people I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Now let's all pray this goes as well as it does in my head.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>I thought I had it all: twin sister, cute boyfriend, and magic beyond my years. Night Shade Academy should’ve been easy for me, but nothing could prepare me for the moment when I’m kicked out of my birthright House and placed with the evil witches known as the Darks—despite being born a Light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m stuck with a bunch of evil witches who compete in this crazy tradition where they pit the first years against each other, fighting for their place in the hierarchy at the Academy. The only rule, try not to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I mention it’s not just witches we have to contend with? There’s also Vampires and Lycans, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the help of a gorgeous Dark that I find myself a little too attracted to, I’m able to keep my ass-whoopings to a minimum, until someone pushes me too far, and I find out exactly why my magic affinity is Dark.</description>

  <description>“It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been granted a place at Vice College for Young Demons… It is our duty to remind all students that your attendance is government mandated and enforced.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vice College for Young Demons; It’s beautiful, elitist and filled to the brim with other demons Lilith’s age. All of them are stuck there waiting for the ten seconds of agony, called the Showing, that will sort them into one of the seven castes. And they’re all praying that they aren’t one of the unlucky few destined to be one of the powerless Unshown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Lilith’s Showing happens, the crystal that appears on her body marks her as a degenerate Lust demon. And the icing on the cake? She grows horns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demons don't grow horns. It's supposed to just be a myth. But Lilith has, and in doing so she's caught the eye of some powerful people who want her dead. Fortunately, she's also got the attention of the Strange God, the demonic deity, and he's decided to appoint seven men to protect her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she can find them first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an 18+ Reverse Harem Novel, Book 1 of 4 in the Vice College for Young Demons series.</description>

  <description>Fate always interrupts a good lay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started when I was bare-ass naked with my boyfriend, Tommy, riding atop a rock in Middle-of-Nowhere, Nevada. &lt;br /&gt;Tommy’s eyes were just starting to roll back in his head when in walks this wolf like he’s my mom on a meth trip, staring at us like all the bouncing came from clowns at a rodeo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not against an audience, but this beast is growling like he’s an over-protective husband, and according to Tommy, I’m growling back. Next thing I know, Tommy is halfway across the desert and I’m at an elite academy for Witches, Shifters, Vampires, and Fae looking like the on-call hooker from the local bunny club. &lt;br /&gt;It was the lacy red bra that did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloodwood Academy for the Supernatural has only one rule: Don’t bang students outside your race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, of course, that just so happens to be the first thing I do. After all, how can you say no to a Fae God with golden eyes, a moody Werewolf with daddy issues, and a Vampire who doesn’t sparkle (Thank God)… but with the things he can do with his fingers, I just might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My men are not only sending my panty budget through the roof but now my life is in danger. &lt;br /&gt;Like, really, it turns out that if I don’t vamoose back to my single wide at the trailer park some jealous females are going to rip my throat out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to figure out why I’m connected to all of them, and why the headmaster has it out for me, before I find myself ten feet under. My guys think it’s in my boobs. I mean blood. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah… blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloodwood Academy is a full-length Reverse Harem with a snarky heroine, shirtless men, love scenes that will send you swooning, no end to pulsing… muscles, action to gasp to, and an ending that you will never see coming.&lt;br /&gt;Settle in for a heart-pounding college age reverse harem that will unwrap all of your paranormal fantasies, and take you on a self-discovery story that celebrates the strength, compassion, and our heroines right to choose one man, or all of them.&lt;br /&gt;After all, why choose one paranormal sex-muffin when you can have them all.</description>

  <description>My friends always bitched about their parents and their rules. Their consequences. Well, I had them beat. My dad tortured souls for a living. Dealt their punishments. Condemned them to suffer in the fiery pits of hell. Literally. So what consequence does the devil give his own daughter?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've always been labeled as the disruptive one. The one to act impulsively, to take matters into my own hands. I can't help it, it's just the way I am. My father, Lucifer, didn't seem to care what I did until I was expelled during my senior year in high school for breaking a guy's nose. He's sending me to a school for angels. Only problem is, I'm half angel and have no wings. &lt;br /&gt;Now I must decide if I want to live a mediocre existence as a high school flunkey or as the Celestial Academy's pariah. Being the devil's daughter in a school full of angels is no walk in the park. It's a tough pill to swallow, but with three men at my side anything is possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is, unless the Fallen get what they want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ascend is book 1 in a trilogy. This novel is full length and reverse harem. It contains multiple POVs with most of the chapters being the female main character's voice. It contains sexual scenes, foul language, bullying, a college level teacher/student relationship, abduction, and PTSD scenes. There is build up to male/male encounters. Some of these things may trigger or not be for some readers. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A few months after escaping the coven that drained my magic, life is golden. My little sister Maddie is safe and happy. I have my pack. I’m in love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But nothing gold can stay… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maddie’s violent, dangerous birth pack wants her back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My four men and I face dozens of wolves, intent on taking my little sister by force. If we keep fighting, my pack will be destroyed all over again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s only one sacrifice I can make to end this pack war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But you know me. I won't let that be the end of my story.</description>

  <description>I’m trying to follow the rules—really, I am, but these bastards are getting on my last nerve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what I say, both the Arcane Authorities and the Arcane Council deny any witch involvement in the kidnapping and slaughter of the shifters and vampires.&lt;br /&gt;It’s total bullshit. I know what I saw, and I’ll prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when I think I’m onto something—disaster strikes. A student is found dead on Academy grounds. Drained of blood. A gnarly bite mark in her neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, all fingers point to my familiars. Cal and Adrian are easy targets… you know, since they live here now. Except they were with me when it happened. And it couldn’t have been the dangerously sexy vamp who’s been visiting me after dark, either, right? Draven wouldn’t do that. I’m sure of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, then who? Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing becomes terrifyingly clear after the second body is found—the longer we take to figure it out—the more students will wind up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find out why Potter fans are devouring this series—enroll in Arcane Arts Academy today and follow Harper as she comes of age in a world of shifters, witches, and vampires—where nothing is quite as it seems, and the stakes are higher than ever.</description>

As soon as I’m eighteen, as soon as I can take custody of my little sister myself, I’m going to run. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Survivors don’t fall in love.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But my world is turned upside down by four mysterious men. The heat between us is intense. Their protectiveness feels real. Overnight, they become gods in our town. They can’t seem to stay away from me. I can’t resist them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lovers don’t survive. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can't risk my chance to save my sister, though. Not even to save my heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is there any hope I can take care of her…and still lose myself in the arms of these men? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THEIR SHIFTER PRINCESS is the first book in an exciting new reverse harem romance series&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>***Academy Reverse Harem***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magic exists. I know—it’s in my blood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not all people from magical bloodlines have powers, and at 22, I’m several years past the age they usually appear. So I’ve resigned myself to a boring, magic-less life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then something strange happens…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get stuck in the middle of a bar fight, and instead of just punching the guy back, I blow a hole in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So… I guess I do have powers. But they’re unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. This shit is definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it seems the magical authorities agree, because they give me a choice: either I go to school to learn to control my crazy new magic, or they’ll take it away. Permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I can just survive the bitchy mean girls determined to take me down a peg, the mysterious attacks on students, the three hot-as-hell guys who don’t seem turned off by my prickly exterior, and the professor who makes me long for detention, maybe I’ll get out of here in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn’t bet on it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Academy of Unpredictable Magic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spark is the first book in the Academy of Unpredictable Magic series, a medium-burn reverse harem story intended for ages 18+, featuring a badass chick and the four sexy men who fall in love with her.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; My one piece of advice: Never kiss a stranger.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I kind of kissed this sexy man at the bar on a dare once, and it turns out he's a Royal Fae destined to be my mate. Now I've been dragged to the Elemental Fae Academy to control the powers I unlocked that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So kissing? Yeah, that won't happen again. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, I kind of kissed Titus, too. And well, now, I'm in a world of trouble. I keep burning things down, flooding dorms, and I've attracted the campus mean girl brigade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fae Realm is a nightmare come to life. Truly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are dreams here, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sexy ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they're in the form of five Elemental Fae mentors. They're supposed to help me control my powers, but who's going to keep the elements from controlling me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; This is a medium burn reverse harem paranormal romance, and book one of the Elemental Fae Academy trilogy.</description>

  <description>Katalina Winter was prepared for life to change when she turned eighteen—but she never expected to actually change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning that her birth parents were purebred wolf shifters is shocking enough. Now she’s expected to take her place in their unfamiliar world. Caught between two warring packs, Katalina must learn fast. One pack, led by the father she has only just met, wants to control her—and the other one wants her dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one bright spot to shifting, and his name is Bass Evernight. Tall, dark, and oh-so-handsome, Bass is the wolf that Katalina craves. He’s also strictly forbidden: a member of Dark Shadow, Bass is the son of her father’s mortal enemy. Yet deep down inside, Katalina’s new primal instincts howl that Bass is her mate. Can their love bring an end to the brutal war that has raged for so long, or will it spark the fighting around them into an all-consuming fire?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised edition: This edition of Winter Wolf includes editorial revisions.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Havenwood Falls, a small town in the majestic mountains of Colorado. A town where legacies began centuries ago, bloodlines run deep, and dark secrets abound. A town where nobody is what you think, where truths pose as lies, and where myths blend with reality. A place where everyone has a story. This is only but one… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Graysin Ravenal hasn’t seen her sister in years, but when she learns Jenni has mysteriously died in a library fire, she leaves her upscale beach community for the mountains of Colorado in search of answers. She needs a job, and Havenwood Falls happens to need an interior designer for the new library. The last thing she needs, though, is to fall for the dark and sexy Everett Weston, aka her new boss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their undeniable mutual attraction aside, keeping their relationship professional proves impossible as their lives collide in more ways than one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Graysin finds herself immersed in a world heavily guarded by secrets and lies—a world Everett seems to know quite well, making him her only hope in finding the answers she seeks. As they work together to unlock the mystery surrounding Jenni’s death, their ever-increasing passion must be denied, no matter what their hearts say. Because the story they’re thrown into is one of desire and danger that not only uncovers a centuries old secret that could destroy the town, but also reveals the darkness of Graysin’s family’s past—a darkness that changes her life forever. And some secrets just can’t be forgiven. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a New Adult paranormal romance in the Havenwood Falls series of New Adult and Adult fantasy novellas featuring a variety of supernatural creatures. The series is a collaborative effort by multiple authors. Each book is generally a stand-alone, so you can read them in any order, although some authors will be writing sequels to their own stories. Please be aware when you choose your next read. We do recommend that you read Forget You Not first as an introduction to the town and its eccentricities.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; First Semester sparked something different inside me. Now it’s time to find out whether Semester Two will transform that spark into something good…or bad. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I, Brianne Marie Harlow, never imagined I'd befriend the Notorious Four, let alone enjoy the holidays with them. And now that I’ve gotten to learn a little bit about each of them and how they see the world, I want to creep out of my innocent shell and explore things that never crossed my mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; Like dating, for example. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s a new year and a new semester, and I'm finally beginning to feel comfortable with my newfound levels of confidence. I'm learning new things at school, and the guys are teaching me life lessons, helping me become less naive — but without the judgment anyone else would have shown me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, not all is well outside of my little circle. The rumors and lies continue to grow, and it turns out they’re a lot more painful when they come from the person you once considered your best friend. Not all hope is lost, but with the shadow people making another appearance and putting someone dear to me at risk, I’ll have to toughen up and recruit the guys to track the culprit down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My goals for this semester are simple enough: pass our physical exams, identify the people who are after my gift, and if I'm lucky, snag another kiss from one of the guys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; Or maybe even all four of them. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Thrust into a new shifter world without enough time to adjust, Amara made one hasty mistake that could cost her mates their position in the tribe or break their happy family apart forever. But those struggles are eclipsed when demonic wolves threaten to take everything from Amara's family. She must fight to heal the rift she caused before it's too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Karma takes too long. I'd rather beat the shit out of you right now." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a dagger in her boot and blades in her bra, Briar, a powerful shifter, arrives in Rouen with one goal: find and kill Dominic, the man responsible for the destruction of her entire family and wolf pack. When she discovers he is an Alpha surrounded by muscle-ripped shifters and equally as strong witches, she knows the only way she will get close enough to kill him is if she joins his dangerous and shady pack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But infiltrating them proves more challenging than she expects, especially when her new roommates turn out to be supernaturals with their own powers and secrets. She can't tell if the centuries-old, nosey vampire and fashion-sensitive witch are working with her or against her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether they are friends or enemies doesn't change things. Briar has a job to do. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to quench her thirst for revenge, even if it means destroying her own soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this new urban fantasy series, Steele and Mason introduce readers to a dark and exciting world full of shifters, vampires, and witches. If you like Charlaine Harris, Patricia Briggs, Shayne Silvers or K.F. Breene, you will LOVE this new series! Scroll up and grab this gritty urban fantasy TODAY! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Intended for adult readers due to violence and language, but it is funny as hell. Oh, and this is not an RH **</description>

  <description>She thinks she’s a normal college Senior. He knows she’s anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ariya Adams has no idea she’s descended from blood so powerful and rare that her life is infinitely more precious than any ordinary woman’s—especially to James Rymer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James enters her life and stirs up feelings she can’t explain. He becomes a part of her world almost overnight, but Ariya senses he’s hiding something, and she’s determined to figure out what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When “normal” becomes a thing of the past and fantasy enters Ariya’s reality, she’s soon faced with dangerous revelations, the least of which is that everyone she loves has been keeping secrets from her. With a paranormal evil she’s only beginning to comprehend threatening her and her friends, Ariya will have to choose between duty and love. Through it all, she’ll learn to never underestimate the power of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the series fans are calling “captivating,” “page-turning” and “not your typical vampire story.”</description>

  <description>The Romanian and Serbian Canis lupus rest in an uneasy peace. One of their own, Sally Miklos, the young and powerful gypsy healer, aids Perizada in her quest to defeat Volcan, a long forgotten nightmare returned to our world. These two packs watch as their brothers across the world, wolves from Spain, Ireland, and America, join their own forces in the battle against the evil dark fae. At the same time, the packs hope against hope that their presence might reveal a mate bond between a pack member and one of the five recently discovered gypsy healers. &lt;br /&gt; While Jacque and Jen miss Sally, their longtime best friend, they have bided their time dealing with their own domestic issues. Jacque and Fane are anticipating the birth of their first child and Jen and Decebel face the challenges of caring for an infant. Both girls are eagerly awaiting Sally’s return, and have Perizada’s word that she will be back in time for the birth of Jacque’s baby. &lt;br /&gt; Vasile and Alina, the Alpha pair of the Romanian pack, are enjoying this time of peace. But Vasile did not become the most powerful Alpha in centuries by being a fool. He has lived long enough to know that there is always another battle on the horizon. As long as evil exists in this world, his race must step forward and stand in the gap, shielding those who cannot protect themselves. But the battle he is anticipating is bigger than he could have ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; As Perizada has recently discovered, creatures of the night that have for so long remained hidden from the human realm, have slithered from their underground lairs and begun preying on the young and innocent. The high fae has declared war, and she expects Vasile and his wolves to be the ones to carry out the attack. The Alpha is more than happy to oblige. But with his first grandchild on the way, and the gift of five vulnerable healers coming under the wolves’ protection, he understands that he must be very careful not to place any of them in harm’s way. &lt;br /&gt; Such is the job of the Alpha, protector, and provider. He and those he leads must stand as sentinels and warriors to safeguard those they love, and the humans who know nothing of the supernatural world. It will be their job to destroy the creatures that threaten to expose them all. And if they fail, the world as they know it, both human and supernatural, will never be the same.</description>

  <description>We've watched the Romanian Grey Wolves find their true mates, fight against evil and reunite with the other Canis lupis in the world. Now we will see just how the most powerful Alpha in their history met his match with the woman who became his mate, and helped him become the man he needed to be in order to lead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every life leaves behind a legacy. Every story has a beginning and an end. The Alpha of the Romania Grey Wolves knows this better than most. He also knows it’s the things that transpire to create that legacy and the experiences, triumphs and failures that happen in the middle of the story that matter. His story began a century ago and now a tragedy has led him to his rightful place as Alpha of the Eastern Romania pack. Before he led hundreds, he had to learn to lead a few. Before he sacrificed for all, he had to be willing to sacrifice for any. Before he could be the man destined to save his race he had to be willing to serve them. In order to be raised up he had to first be torn down. There was only one who could do this and live, only one who could light his way when the darkness closed in; his mate, his Luna. This is the building of their legacy, the middle of their story. Their triumphs, their failures, and their tragedy’s that would one day make them strong enough to restore a race torn apart by greed, envy, and fear.</description>

  <description>One sister born of pain. &lt;br /&gt;One sister born of blood. &lt;br /&gt;One sister born of death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three sisters bound, &lt;br /&gt;Wiccan and nightwalker. &lt;br /&gt;Three sisters found, &lt;br /&gt;To join an empire. &lt;br /&gt;A prophecy of three, &lt;br /&gt;So let it be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ebony’s life varied from minor inconvenience to total disaster. She could never catch a break. From a young age, she had been sent to live with many foster families, each one rejecting her after a short amount of time, none of them wanting to take on her unusual health issues. &lt;br /&gt;She couldn't blame them—she didn't know what the hell was wrong with her, either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, living day to day, struggling to buy the medicine she needs and with no home to call her own, Ebony battles for the hope that she won’t always be so alone. However, just when Ebony thinks her life couldn’t possibly get any worse, it does, and the darkness calls to her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet salvation arrives in the unlikely form of two beautiful, mysterious women and a man willing to fight to be her saviour. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a new world is suddenly and unexpectedly thrust upon her, Ebony, whether she’s ready or not, is about to find out who she really is and exactly what she’s made of.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Know what’s worse than being forced to marry your depraved, sadistic alpha? &lt;br /&gt;Hiding his corpse.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after storms and seismic disasters ravaged the world, only one major forest remains intact in the United States, and my werewolf pack is responsible for keeping Heartland Forest for the wolves. Jacob Knight may have been a terrible alpha, but he kept the fae, vampires, and man-eating trolls from taking over Heartland. Day by day, they close in on us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years, I’ve gotten away with murder, and it hasn’t been easy. I live a lie, and it’s eating me up inside. It’s a price I must pay to keep my secrets buried and my pack safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing stays buried for long in Heartland Forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jacob’s three alpha brothers ride their motorcycles into town, claiming they want to rent a room in the apartment building I manage, I know they’re here for more than low rent and creaky pipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Do I have what it takes to take on three dirty alphas?&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Magical realms, Celtic warriors, and faerie glamour: Percy Jackson meets The Mortal Instruments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“An appealing blend of awkward teen and powerful Fae. I love the passion, mystery and adventure the heroine experiences.” ★★★★★&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Do you trust me Meghan?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His voice was soft, almost pleading. I swallowed and tried hard to discern his expression in the dark. The paltry amount of light reaching this far into the small cavern glinted off his eyes, giving him the appearance of a demon trying to tempt me into doing something evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Yes,” I answered, my own voice a mere whisper, “I trust you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Good.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gave my hand a quick squeeze, and then I was pulled forward into the icy abyss that loomed before us . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago, Meghan Elam learned that she was Faelorehn, a being of the Otherworld. Immortal. Now she must juggle her life in the mortal world with the one she has started to build in the Otherworld. However, keeping her identity secret from her friends and family while trying to avoid a wrathful Celtic goddess is no easy task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of the intriguing Cade MacRoich, Meghan will learn that not only does she come from a place full of magic and wonder but that she, too, is far more powerful than she ever thought possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Give in to the Glamour…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Ryann Carroll has just run into the guy who saved her life ten years ago. You might think she'd be happy to see him again. Not exactly. She's a bit underdressed (as in skinny-dipping) and he's not supposed to exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her father's affair, all Ryann wants is to escape the family implosion fallout and find a little peace. She also wouldn't mind a first date that didn't suck, but she's determined not to end up like her mom: vulnerable, betrayed, destroyed. Ryann's recently moved back to her childhood home in rural Mississippi, the same place where ten years earlier she became lost in the woods overnight and nearly died. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's still irresistibly drawn to those woods. There she encounters the boy who kept her from freezing to death that long ago winter night and was nowhere to be seen when rescuers arrived. He's still mysterious, but now all grown-up and gorgeous, too. And the more she's with him, the greater the threat he poses to Ryann's strict policy-- never want someone more than he wants you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seventeen-year-old Lad knows the law of his people all too well: Don't get careless and Don't get caught.&lt;/b&gt; It's allowed his race to live undetected in this world for thousands of years, mentioned only in flawed and fading folklore…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lad's never been able to forget about Ryann since that night ten years ago. When he sees her again, his fascination re-ignites and becomes a growing desire that tempts him to break all the rules. He's not even supposed to talk to a human, much less fall in love with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the timing is atrocious. The Assemblage is coming, the rift between the Light and Dark is widening, and mysterious celebrity fan pods are becoming more and more widespread and influential. Lad may have to trade his own chance at happiness to keep the humans, especially Ryann, blissfully unaware and safe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A secret society. Vampires. Supernaturals. And love. It’s my world, and I have to save it, but not from the monsters. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Abigail Rose’s life was as predictable as the tides rising and falling, until Wes Hunter returned to Sandpoint. Then, the impossible became possible, the predictable became unpredictable, and those monsters became more than friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wes would do anything to keep Abigail safe, and Abigail would leave everything behind to save everyone she loves. A suspenseful romance, blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

Training to be their human guardian was the only way they could let me in. Except, it's also the most dangerous. Now, we all have enemies--even me. Together, we must fight to keep the bond between us, or lose the most precious gift I've ever received. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chosen By Darkness is the first novel in the Ravana Clan Vampires Series. It includes Books 1-5 in the Chosen By Darkness: Ravana Clan Vampire Serial.</description>

  <description>A Paranormal Romance Anthology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book 1 – Blood’s Fury &lt;br /&gt;by C.M. Owens &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The deadliest things in life are often the most beautiful… seconds before they strike. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her immortal destiny quickly approaching, Alyssa Coldwell wants to play human while she still has a chance. Unfortunately, she chooses the wrong town to escape her true world. &lt;br /&gt;Beautiful masks are worn by the enemies she doesn’t know, and no one can ever be trusted—and Pine Shore is full of beautiful masks. The ones who are the most deceptive in appearance are usually the deadliest, but their camouflage can fool the eyes. &lt;br /&gt;Kane Ice is nothing more than deliciously forbidden, but she can’t help herself from falling. She knows it can’t last, because he’s human and she only has a limited amount of time left before she’s something else entirely, but that doesn’t stop her from giving him all she can while she can. &lt;br /&gt;But surviving until her change isn’t as easy as she thought it would be, and now she has accidentally pulled her beautiful human into a deadly game of cat and mouse that she doesn’t want to play. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blood’s Fury is book one of the bestselling trilogy, 'Deadly Beauties'. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Due to sexual content and use of language, this trilogy is not recommended to anyone under the age of 17. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BOOK 2 – Eternal Vows &lt;br /&gt;by Chrissy Peebles &lt;br /&gt;Genre: Paranormal romance and fantasy adventure &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Original Book Trailer: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/n_w-eZwPJbA" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://youtu.be/n_w-eZwPJbA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New Book Trailer: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/JJzoHW0xVMI" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://youtu.be/JJzoHW0xVMI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;Never marry a stranger... even if he is a drop-dead gorgeous immortal king. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never pretend to be a princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And most importantly... never slip on an ancient wedding ring you know nothing about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sarah Larker returns to a cave where her sister disappeared ten years earlier. She walks through a portal and is mistaken for a runaway princess on the run by a dangerous immortal king in medieval times. Her plan is bold as well as daring-become this princess, wed the king, and slip on an ancient wedding ring that will unlock the portal back home. Then find her sister and run as fast as she can out of Dodge. But taking on the identity of Princess Gloria comes along with dangerous consequences; and slipping on the ruby ring comes with an even higher price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BOOK 3 –Awakened&lt;br /&gt;by: Brenda K. Davies &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Professionally edited by KMS Freelance Editing and rereleased 1/16/13 &lt;br /&gt;Cover art by &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.EbookLaunch.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.EbookLaunch.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Traumatized by her past, and struggling to move on from it, Sera has spent the past three years of college hiding herself from the world and content to stay that way. A chance encounter with Liam shatters her sheltered world, leaving her stunned and shaken by the strange feelings and emotions he arises in her, feelings she never thought she would experience and that frighten her in their intensity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 – Finding Forever&lt;br /&gt;by Melisa Hamling &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the splinters of glass, I see his face, the one who has this hold on me, on my soul and I know he holds the key to something I have yet to learn. Be careful what you wish for, you may just get it. Morgan Masters is about to find out that what you wish for doesn’t come in a perfect little package. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 – Rae of Hope&lt;br /&gt;by W.J. May &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen year-old Rae Kerrigan never really knew her family's history.</description>

  <description>A deathbed promise &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Arlyn’s quest is simple: Find her father and let him know her mother is dead. After all, Arlyn had promised her mother she’d go. The problem? Her father's people are myths and legends, and he doesn't even live on Earth. But despite a long journey through the mysterious mists of the Veil, finding him turns out to be the easy part. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A dream long-buried &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After five hundred years, Kai has given up on finding his soulbonded. So when he stumbles across Arlyn after returning from his latest mission and recognizes her as his mate, Kai starts their bond in haste. But he never could have imagined that his bonded is his best friend’s newfound daughter. Whoops. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A hidden conspiracy sparked to life &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though the sight of Kai makes Arlyn’s heart pound, she isn’t sure she can forgive him for starting their bond without her permission. But her love life is the least of her problems. Her father is an elf lord, and his sudden acknowledgment of a half-human heir reignites the same conspiracy that took him away from her mother in the first place. Now Arlyn and her family must face iron wielding assassins, bigotry, and her newly awakened magical abilities if they hope to come through in one piece. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Arlyn thought she would return to Earth after meeting her father. Now she must fight to save the family she never knew she wanted. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Grace Dawes is enjoying a boring, anonymous life in the aftermath of a tumultuous childhood until a call from her estranged parents takes her back to her hometown. When the visit gets derailed by a menacing intruder in her parents’ home and Grace’s life is put on the line, she comes face to face with a man she believed existed only in her dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathan Black has spent fifteen years trying to get over the only woman his heart has ever truly desired. The ambitious young shifter rules himself, his wolf, and his pack with total control. But when Grace crashes unexpectedly back into town and falls into mortal danger, he and his family are the only ones she can turn to for help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plunged into a universe of magic, Grace must choose whether or not to abandon her carefully structured life to fulfill an extraordinary destiny she has never been prepared for. Lathan must grapple with the rigid composure holding him back from becoming the wolf he is meant to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can they give up control long enough to explore the promise of love?</description>

  <description>When the Hunger strikes, Rafe Blackstone has no control over it or his beast.

  <description>“I’ve accepted being a monster. Now I need to decide if I will follow fate or kick its arse.” &lt;br /&gt;Trinity meets the underbelly of the supernatural world so she and her friends can learn to better protect themselves. As she explores her abilities further she discovers someone lurking in her mind, making her crave what they want— blood. It seems that an enemy survived and her head fills with his plight to not only feed on every living human, but to take her and all those she cares about, out of the picture. Hunger grips her soul as she fights to avoid being seduced by his cravings, while her dark side pleads to be let out. Trying to tame her beast, she pushes herself to exhaustion while training. It’s all she can do as she waits for the pending battle that is already in motion. &lt;br /&gt;Her friend Carra is no help, so she looks for guidance in Carra’s journal, only to discover that something big is coming. Something that will forever change her life. A sacrifice that will grip her to the core and cause her to question her entire existence. &lt;br /&gt;Will she become strong enough to save herself, all the Monsters and Humanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21015612-bloodgifted" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00FLYG1QM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s a girl to do when she learns she’s the key to breaking a centuries-old family curse? Become dangerously intimate with a jaw-dropping vision of male hotness hiding a secret agenda of his own. &lt;br /&gt;Nothing could be simpler. &lt;br /&gt;Or is it? &lt;br /&gt;When primary school teacher, Laura Dantonville, learns of her family's dark ancestral legacy, she’s propelled into a secret underworld ruled by magic, mystery and murder, and stalked by vampire clans who would do anything to possess her. For her protection, she’s assigned a guardian not knowing that part of her role in ending the ancient curse that has plagued her family for centuries, involves having a child with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she has one day to make a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only five years left of servitude to his sire, Alec Munro reluctantly accepts to act as Laura’s guardian or risk remaining in slavery forever. But can he maintain a platonic relationship between them when something far more intimate is required to end his sire’s family curse? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, Laura must decide to either accept Alec or allow her vampire-hating detective boyfriend to end the legacy his way – by eliminating the undead side of her family.&lt;br /&gt;After all, they’re not human are they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being unable to age is just the beginning.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three brothers. Three Secrets. One hope to save the shifters of Seattle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former SEAL Jaxson River would give his life for his brothers and his pack, but if he doesn’t claim a mate soon, he’ll be forced to step down as their alpha. There’s only one problem: Jaxson’s dark secret would kill any mate he claimed. With someone kidnapping shifters off the street—and only Jaxson and his brothers, Jace and Jared, to stop them—now is not the time for his secret to come out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curvy Olivia Lilyfield is a half-witch orphan with a dark secret of her own. She wants to atone for it by doing good in the world, so when she finds a wolf being tortured in an alley, she doesn’t hesitate to help… even though wolves and witches mix like matches and TNT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia’s dangerous magic means she can’t let anyone get too close — but Jaxson can’t keep his hands off her, and his kisses are more than she can resist.

  <description>SET YOUR NIGHTS ABLAZE WITH THE FIRST BOOK IN THE FLAMES OF VAMPIRE PASSION SERIES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London Beckley (aka Lindy Beck):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Human life is short. A flicker of time, and then it’s over. Live it while you can... With me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were the outrageous words Zane said to me the night I attended the erotic convention to try to network and sell some books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had left my husband to pursue my life on my own terms rather than put up with one more word of derision. Once I arrived at the adult convention, I was startled to find someone already at my table, Zane, claiming to be my assistant for the night. As the event progressed, amidst his antics of reading excerpts to chittering ladies, and flashing what I thought were fake fangs, he made his intentions towards me crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little did I know how drastically my life was about to change with Zane’s entrance into it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane took me from my colorless world, and immersed me into his vibrancy.&lt;br /&gt;Soon, he was inside me in every way possible.&lt;br /&gt;My conflicted mind.&lt;br /&gt;My hidden walls protecting me.&lt;br /&gt;My damaged heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate and undying intensity between us was both an awakening of my true self and an overwhelming rush ripping me apart. I wasn’t sure if I would survive the ways he made me feel in my body, heart and soul, much less the salacious, climax-inducing visions he could send directly into my psyche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a night of interrupted intimacy, and another of heated exchanges between Zane and my mother, I threw away my inclination for sanity, and accepted his invitation to take a walk on the wild side with him for the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life had served me enough bitterness in the day. For some reason, it had decided to reflect its loving moonlight, and I wasn’t asking any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I wondered if he would survive my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forever is a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you’re as old as I am, and you find the person you want to be with, you go for it, and don’t look back. I discovered London through reading her books, recognized my heart’s counterpart, and looked her up to interact with her on social media. Once she announced the convention she planned to attend, I decided that was the time to go get her, and forbade my friend Jen as well as London’s other vampire fans from going. I needed London’s full attention on me, and knew how to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London is sex all bottled up and I’ve got the corkscrew to pop her open. But more than that, she’s funny, kind, tenderhearted yet damaged in ways I long to fix. The woman sets my dead blood on fire. To Hell with anyone or anything that gets in my way, whether it be a former love interest who dares to threaten her, or anyone else who tries to separate us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our passion is a flame that will not be extinguished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zane, Flames of Vampire Passion Series, Book One, contains steaming, wickedly hot scenes of vivid intimacy, laugh out loud humor and depth of heartfelt connection between Zane and London of real emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can their passion for each other survive a jilted lover, and heart-stopping intimacy? Even more worrisome, can it survive London’s domineering mother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This work is fiction and meant for an adult audience.&lt;br /&gt;M/F, language, violence, stand alone, HEA, paranormal, vampires</description>

  <description>Necromancer Kris Chase's purpose is simple. Blindly raise the dead for the primary elite, self necro-governed group, the Center. The problem is, she couldn't care less about what the Center expects from her. Instead, she is more content with snuffing out the life-force from every vile creature she can get her hands on; the same monsters her brethren indiscriminately create… for the right price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the life of someone dear to her is threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the stakes raised insurmountably, she finds herself bound by desperation to create the very darkness she always fought against being consumed by, going against everything she has ever believed in.</description>

  <description>In the treacherous City of Temple where supernaturals and humans intertwine, only the most cunning will survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaming up with a handsome shifter named Ephrem, the banished Princess Lilliana must find her stolen Ardent talisman before a sinister enemy uses it against both rival wolf pack strongholds. Thrown onto a path neither of them expected, they stumble across a third cell of supernatural shifters lurking in the city’s Outlands where tensions mount. These new strangers want nothing more than to disrupt the two royal strongholds, the ArcKnights and the MarkTiers, and reignite a long-forgotten feud from decades past. .</description>

  <description>Picking up right where Drako’s Return left off, Victoria and Claude are still at odds. Claude still wants Vic to be his, and Vic still claims her love to Robert. With the promise of destroying everyone and everything Vic loves dearly, she must decide her fate, as well as the rest of the kingdom’s fate. &lt;br /&gt;A battle leaves many dead or dying. In order to save lives and bring the dead back to life, they will have to be turned or given the antidote. &lt;br /&gt;With a plan in play to combine the Hecatian blood with the cure, will it save them? Or is it too late? &lt;br /&gt;The plan for a New Race! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Successful New York politician, Cameron Maddox, is on track to be the United States’ first shifter president. With that goal in sight, he has little time for distractions. Fortunately for Greta Larrson, owner of The Beaten Path bakery, Cameron doesn’t ignore his intense response to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greta’s immediately drawn to the powerful politician, but how can a weak-blooded shifter compete with the women he’s used to? Her dreams of success in the Big Apple are sidetracked when she realizes Cameron is her intended mate. Unused to the treacherous world of politics, Greta must decide if she’s willing to risk everything to be with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day soon, Cameron will unify the humans and shifters of the country, but for now he must convince his intended mate to be his First Lady and join him on his path to the White House. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Features spanking, a BBW, and a sexy shifter who is ready to take on the world...after claiming his mate.***</description>

  <description>“I don’t trust anyone.” &lt;br /&gt;Leaving her job and only home, sassy, independent Analise is determined to do whatever it takes to convince the Vampire Lord Devin Fallinsworth to help locate her missing friend Beth. What was not part of the plan, however, was her most unwelcome attraction to an irresistibly desirable, arrogant and dominating playboy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well, I’ll just have to remedy that now, won’t I?” &lt;br /&gt;With a rogue vampire still on the loose, Damian DiStephano, Regent Vampire Lord of the East, has his hands full trying to keep the fallout to a minimum. The last complication he needs is for his fiery Moira, his Fated, to finally walk into his life at a time when everything is in utter chaos, putting her directly into the crosshairs of a centuries old war. But now that he has her, he’ll be damned if he’ll let her go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He had the power to destroy her permanently... &lt;br /&gt;Analise is equally drawn to and infuriated by the most gorgeous man she’s ever laid eyes on. And how can she bear Damian’s touch, when the touch of anyone before him repulsed her? With the inability to let others in, she simply needs to stick to the plan, use Damian to locate her friend and return home, heart unscathed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even the best-laid plans can go awry.</description>

  <description>“It’s best if we just keep this casual, Dev.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To feisty, relationship phobic Kate Martin’s utter surprise, she isn’t automatically dismissed as a crackpot when she finally plucks up courage to walk into a police station, revealing what she’s seen in her dreams. But instead of making a simple statement and returning to her nice, quiet life, she finds herself the center of attention from both a psychotic vampire and the ‘investigative specialist’ who would die in order to protect her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You’re anything but casual, Kate. I want you and I always get what I want.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young women are disappearing across the country and Devon, Regent Vampire Lord of the Midwest, knows his centuries old archenemy has finally resurfaced. A break in his fruitless search is provided by the discovery of a woman who can not only see the missing in her dreams, but who ends up being his Moira, his Destiny. And she couldn’t have stepped into his world at a more inopportune time, for she is now the prime target for his nemesis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protecting her heart would prove to be her biggest challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devon may be the sexiest, most sinfully erotic man she’s ever met, and he stirs passion in her like no one else before, but he’s an entanglement Kate does not want or need. While it becomes impossible to deny their mutual desire, once the case is solved and the missing women are found, Kate fully intends to return to her boring life, alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that’s what she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Contains graphic sexual content and foul language. Appropriate only for readers 18+.</description>

  <description>Bringing her into their world, was not part of the plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Samantha (aka Sam) finds herself falling in love with not one, but two men she's been having a no-strings ménage relationship with, she decides splitting up is the right thing to do. Jordan and Alex refuse to commit, but Sam needs more stability in her life, especially when she finds out she is about to take on a whole lot more responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan and Alex grew up together in a small town of jaguar shifters, where being a half-blood was looked down upon, even by their own fathers. Once they became adults, they left their community and joined a secret military operation call the Alpha Division, a team of shifters keeping the peace with any means necessary, and their next mission comes close to home. Both men feel they have too many secrets for commitment, but at the same time cannot stand the thought of losing Sam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jordan and Alex's past comes back to haunt them, a possible traitor on the team threatens the woman they love and a future they have never dreamt. Once secrets are revealed, can the three of them forget the past and forgive the lies or will fear drive them further apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Warning* This book contains content not suitable for readers under the age of 18; including adult sexual content (M/F/M), violence, and adult language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ACE of ASIN:B00CCYPUWU &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18718526.Shifted_Temptations" title="Shifted Temptations" rel="nofollow"&gt;Shifted Temptations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I Heart Shifters Book One &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie Reynolds runs a nail salon that caters to shifters of all varieties. The proverbial shift hits the fan when billionaire mogul Jackson Lawrence walks in the door and offers Ellie two million dollars to sell her shop. Ellie has no intention of selling out, especially to someone who plans to bulldoze her shop to the ground and replace it with a fast food joint. Their battle of wit and will is brought to a sudden halt when Jackson’s enemies appear, throwing them into a fight for their lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson believed he’d left violence behind when he resigned his position with the Blood Wolves, a secret shifter military group, but someone wants his company’s cyber invention and will stop at nothing to get it. He didn’t mean to drag Ellie into his mess, but he’s willing to do anything to protect her and the firewall his friend created...anything except fight his attraction to the outspoken redhead he’s suddenly responsible for. Jackson soon learns Ellie is hotter than he first gave her credit for...like dragon hot...and life is about to get a whole lot more interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes shift happens when you least expect it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader Note: contains BBW heroines, billionaires, humor, werewolves, dragon shifter, and paranormal erotic romance elements</description>

  <description>Mixed breed vampire shifter, Gabe Moncrieff is fighting for his life...and vengeance. He's made a name for himself in the Cage, an arena where only the strongest survives. He's in the midst of training for the fight of his life when Rain Pettis appears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Elemental - a supernatural being descended from Zeus himself - Rain holds the key to Gabe’s future in the Cage, but she needs his help to break away from the overwhelming influence of her brothers. Gabe’s the only shifter capable of standing up to them and agrees to give her what she needs – freedom - if she’ll help him train for the next Cage match. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Rain learns a secret that tests her loyalty to her brothers, she has a decision to make. Does she give it all for love? Or will she allow Gabe to risk his life within the Cage?</description>

  <description>Smut-Shorties: A great on-the-go short to satisfy your craving for smut! *Please be aware that this is an Erotica SHORT* &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Captain of the city guard, Isla Meyers, has no need for a man, nor is she tempted by the jumped-up youngsters at court who think she'll be bowled over by their inept attempts at seduction. Content in her job protecting the Mistress of the City, she's all but ignored her feminine needs in favour of duty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is, until a diplomatic envoy arrives from a rival city. Pack alpha Nick Trevais is unlike any alpha she's ever met. Drop-dead gorgeous, but soft-spoken, he has a ruthless streak a mile wide and she quickly realises that once he decides he wants something. He gets it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Including her... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Please be aware that this is an Erotica SHORT*</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: This is an Alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B00WQ4P94K.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There Are No Coincidences….&lt;br /&gt;Given a fairy tale life by the clan of dragon shifters that rescued her as a little girl, Emma Sinclair long ago accepted she might never solve the mystery of her heritage. Of course, that was before she could feel the traitor’s pain, before she knew he was slipping away. And before the unthinkable happened… he called to her in the language of his kin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Universe Does Not Make Mistakes…&lt;br /&gt;Captured by his brothers. Imprisoned in a cave. Bound in silver chains. Andrew knew his days were numbered. He accepted his fate. Knew he was getting what he deserved. Hallucinations of his long dead parents were his only solace in the debris of a wasted life. Then the scent of salt, sun and fresh air entered his prison. The fragrance stirred visions of expressive brown eyes, a smile that rivaled the sun and a voice that was a balm to his tattered soul. He clung to the memory of her. She became his lifeline…his only hope of survival…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fate Will Not Be Denied…&lt;br /&gt;One doomed dragon shifter. One very special woman. One destiny no one could have predicted. Will they save dragon kin or destroy it?</description>

  <description>Passions flare when the cold moon rises… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly: a normal college girl, who knows what she wants—to survive her final exams, and find someone to share her life with. Studying with Jacob is becoming too hot to handle; she’s falling for him, but he’s going too fast… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob: a not-so-typical frat guy, who hides a secret—he’s a werewolf. Whenever the moon is high, he’s driven to shed his human form and satisfy his powerful desires. He craves Kelly, but she’s pushing him away… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallout: Jacob can smell Kelly’s arousal, but she insists she doesn’t want sex. A wolf can only take so much before his natural instincts win out. When the tension between them explodes, Jacob has no choice but to walk… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnapped! Kelly is abducted by evil scientists who’ve mistaken her for a female werecat and, despite their differences, Jacob has to try and find her. But it’s a race against time and the lunar tides. The scientists have taken Kelly to their lab and turned her into a shapeshifter for real. The full moon is rising, and soon neither Kelly nor Jacob will be able to control their inner beasts. Who knows what the consequences will be when they are consumed by unquenchable animal lust…</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling author Tiffany King&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes the complete Saving Angels Series:&lt;br /&gt;Meant to Be (book 1)&lt;br /&gt;Forgotten Souls (book 2)&lt;br /&gt;The Ascended (book 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included is the short story prequel of The Saving Angels Series:&lt;br /&gt;The Dark One&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meant to Be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krista Miller feels like she has lived her entire life in a glass box with her every emotion on display. She can't help feeling like a defect as her sensitivities have made her socially inept and without any real friends; the one exception being the boy that visits her each night in her dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krista's emotions are put to the test when a move to California triggers a devastating change to her fantasy world. The nightly comfort that the boy provides has now become a recurring nightmare as he is taken from her by an unseen force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to appear normal, Krista enrolls in a new school and finds it to be nothing like she thought. Her new life is sent spiraling out of control from a strange connection with a boy, Mark, who claims to know all her secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Krista begins to explore the emotions that Mark evokes in her, secrets about their mysterious past and their predestined purpose threatens to separate them just when they have found each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgotten Souls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any chance Krista Miller had at a normal teenage life is now gone. Less than a year ago she lived under the radar, avoiding any relationships that would send her emotional sensitivities out of control. Little did she know that her life was destined for something more. Something that will test her very soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After facing certain death at the hands of the man responsible for their mysterious past, Krista and her friends learn the truth behind their origins and the purpose for their newly discovered abilities. Now, they must band together to fulfill their inherited, sacred duty. As Guides and Protectors, they must save Mankind's Forgotten Souls before they are lost forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ascended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ascended is the final installment of The Saving Angels Trilogy. With Krista's life in turmoil, she is now struggling with the responsibilities that have been passed down to her. With the help of Haniel and her friends, Krista risks everything, including her soul, to march into the den of the Dark Angel. Their only chance for survival is for Krista to find the courage to accept the new role that fate has bestowed upon her, even if it means losing her loved ones forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>Gina Moretti is determined to escape her rural home of Clinton, Indiana, a place where wolves have met, married, and mated for generations. As the only daughter of the alpha, she’s lived her entire life under her father’s rule. No way is she ready to find a mate until she’s experienced more of the world. Against her family’s wishes, she goes to Boston where her scientist cousin, Dominic, has offered to give her a place to stay. She stumbles, quite literally, into her cousin’s gorgeous boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Mason, a Southern boy turned self-made millionaire, rose above his poverty stricken childhood and now enjoys a life of luxury in Boston. To honor his murdered sister, he hires her lab partner to continue their research. His employee, Dominic Moretti, is on the brink of creating a method to combat the scent of a wolf when his country cousin breezes in. Luke knows in an instant that Gina is his mate. The only problem is…she doesn’t even realize he’s a wolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Luke and Dominic get closer to medical trials, an unknown enemy becomes determined to stop them…at any cost. Can Luke discover his foe in time to protect his research…and his mate? And what will happen when Gina finds out he’s not quite as human as he’s led her to believe?</description>

  <description> Captive - A New Life Series  
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;To what lengths would you go to break away from a life filled with pain and suffering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tori Farrell has lived a dangerous life. When you grow up with a Motorcycle Gang of Mercenaries and Drug Lords like the Dragons, a normal life is more like a fairytale. For years, she accepted her dark reality, a world consisting of drugs, sex, violence and murder. In the end, she learned the most valuable lesson: survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of being ruled by the Dragons, Tori uses her skills of seduction and assassination to free herself from the grasp of the people who vowed they would never let her go. Taken in by the FBI, she fears not everything is what it seems, and soon finds herself lost in a web of lies and deceit. She thought getting away from the Dragons would put her on a path to a new and better life, but now she must face the cold hard truth” there is always a price to be paid.&lt;/p&gt; ˃˃˃ Excerpt &lt;p&gt;"Quietly, he explained to her that he was going to arrange for another group to kill the Dragons and send her to live with someone who would take care of her. Not understanding, she asked why she would have to go with someone else. If the Dragons were dead, why couldn't she just go with him? He refused to explain, and simply said, "You are going to have a different life, baby girl. A life I cannot give you. You must be strong and willing to do whatever it takes to make this happen. Promise me you will do this...."&lt;/p&gt; ˃˃˃ Book 1 of 7 in A New Life Series &lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series that chronicles the life of a young woman who is raised by a group of men who work as freelance mercenaries in the dark world of drug trafficking and murder for hire. They acquired the young woman at a very young age, as she has no memory of life before them. The book opens as she has broken free and moves through a series of current events and flashbacks that explain the beginning of her story. It is very dark with an unfinished feel, because in the end, the past is not the real story - the real story is what happens from here.&lt;/p&gt; ˃˃˃ WARNING: GRAPHIC SCENES &lt;p&gt;This book is intended for readers 18+ and contains scenes that may cause distress to some readers: Domestic Abuse, Kidnapping, Rape and Substance Abuse are described in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When Georgia "Peaches" Kent wakes up in a morgue, it's no wonder her first thought is that she's a vampire, but after a late night run in with a black cat named Bane, she's less and less sure she's a vampire and more on the side of Bane in thinking that she's a mystery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peaches is dead, she's sure of that. What she's not sure of is what she is. But that's alright because a cat has offered to help her discover what she is. Except Bane isn't a cat at all, but a very attractive Egyptian vampire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they're on a mission to discover what Peaches is, which leads them into the heart of a vamp-goth club. But then Peaches goes and opens her big mouth, tension skyrockets, and marriage to the sexy Egyptian vamp is the only way out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Peaches and Bane on this fun, fast paced adventure as they try to discover what she is, and hope they don't get killed in the process.</description>

  <description>* * * WARNING: Sizzling Hot Adult Content! This novella is intended for persons 18+ years of age * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mara Aphrodisios Montgomery was born a bear. I don’t mean she was born bitchy or anything like that. Literally. She was born a bear cub who can shift into human form. She’s a member of an ancient, but dying race of Greek Immortals called Weres. Mara is a werebear. She met and fell in love with a Celtic Shifter, Logan Montgomery, but there are many among the so-called Immortal races who don’t believe Immortals should mate outside of their own pantheon. Hitler has nothing on some of these guys when it comes to fighting for racial purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mara’s love affair and subsequent mating to Logan Montgomery opens the door to horrific grief, pain and suffering for Mara. She is brutally victimized and separated from her family for over a decade. But unseen forces are working to reunite the lovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Events beyond their control also push Mara and Logan to the forefront of an ancient struggle that is coming to a head. Soon they are neck deep in the newly formed Beast Realm. The Beast Realm is a loose affiliation of dual natured magical immortals who populate this world and various magical realms. Due to ancient feuds and prejudices the creators of various shifter races have decided to form this new affiliation to offer protection for the offspring of their children who are of mixed heritage. Treachery, intrigue, bloodshed and deceit rule the day as warring factions strive to control the formation of this new realm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will love everlasting ultimately triumph?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it will. Eventually. You know how much I adore HEA ;-)</description>

  <description>The men living out here in the forest are all gorgeous. Muscled, bearded, always shirtless... But they're also kind of strange. For one thing, they're not fazed at all when a pack of bears shows up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once I understand why the bears don't scare them, they won't let me go home. It's not so bad, though. Even if one of the werebears wants me dead, another thinks I might be his mate! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where Bear Dance is a 140-page paranormal romance novella. Due to some sexual content between a gruff, sexy werebear and a virgin, fertile BBW, it is intended for mature audiences only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This novella stands alone, but is also the first in a trilogy. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Deidra Montfort is a small town gal whose life has been shattered by tragedy. Her children and husband are dead and Dee is recovering from massive injuries that should have left her dead as well. Part of Dee knows she could have prevented the tragedies... somehow… &lt;br /&gt;Strange dreams and flashes of images of a life with a gorgeous, sexy warrior god leave Dee feeling confused and guilt ridden as she struggles to cope with the loss of her family and the devastating damage done to her own body. As she struggles with the urge to just give up she turns her attention to helping out an old friend who runs a backwoods biker bar and helping runaway teenage girls make a new start for themselves. &lt;br /&gt; Dee doesn't know that a vampire watches her from the fringes of her life. He is not stalking her but protecting her because she is his beloved mate. The vampire has been searching for his long lost mate who was cursed for saving his life almost six hundred years ago. &lt;br /&gt; Lucian Michaels is an Immortal Spell Weaver turned vampire who watches Deirdra from the fringes of her life. He’s been doing this or something like it for nearly six hundred years. An ancient curse has robbed her of all knowledge of who she is and her true destiny. She doesn’t remember that her name is Morna Glynn Michaels, Spell Weaver of the First Order, and Airendell Warrior of the first Order. She doesn’t remember that she is Lucian’s one true mate and has been for nearly seven hundred years. So Lucian waits and watches hoping she regains her memories and her powers so that she can reclaim her mate, her destiny and overcome the curse that ruined their lives. &lt;br /&gt; Lucian knows they face overwhelming odds as they set out overcome the evil forces that still seek to destroy them and their clan of magical Immortals who dedicate their lives to protecting mankind from other less altruistic Immortals. However, he doesn’t know of the painful changes his beloved will have to endure, the blood thirsty creatures, jealous rages and treachery from their own family members. They must overcome all of these challenges in order to be able to reclaim their true destiny. &lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Lots of racy love scenes and exciting action scenes unfold as Deirdra discovers the truth about herself and the vampire who watches over her. If you like ancient magic, vampires, epic battles and intrigue this is the story for you. This is installment one of the Airendell Chronicles. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Just beyond human perception, divinity and evil bear witness to both good and bad events in the mortal world. Transcendental law demands the separation of these dark forces and they are forbidden to communicate with one another. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sarenah is a devoted and strong Warrior Angel who, while obediently watching over a human incident, meets an evil presence she is inexplicably drawn to. She knows he is a demon and is well aware of the rules, but something about him causes her allegiance to waver and the strength of a warrior angel is no match to the pull of love … or is it lust? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Draco is her opposite, a Warrior Demon and highly regarded in Hell. He, too, feels the pull toward Sarenah and desires her without any clue as to why. He mistakes her true identity because of her appearance—dark hair and black wings—and unbeknownst to him at the time, he falls for an Angel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During their brief meeting they share a passionate kiss and, the instant they connect, everything changes. Heaven and Hell will stop at nothing to keep them apart, which raises more questions than the two have answers for. Draco is thrown into prison and Sarenah undertakes a relentless search for him which leads her to a realm she doesn't belong. With the protection of the light about to cease, her heart and mind repeat one word incessantly, one she cannot ignore … Draco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will the truth about their mysterious pasts be revealed in time for her to rescue him? Or will outside powers intervene and destroy her in the process?</description>

  <description>The Black Diamond Desert held the secrets to the Elements; a long lived race of families that had control of fire, ice, wind or lightning. When disaster strikes, everything changes for the only two survivors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thought it was over…&lt;br /&gt;Five hundred years ago, Aurora lost everything…including Lucas, the love of her life, when he refused to let go of the past. After centuries of clashes with him, the peace she’s found in the small town of Summer Gate is shattered when Lucas finds her again. Now, she’ll need her control of fire to protect not just herself but also her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s going to show her it’s only just begun…&lt;br /&gt;Lucas walked away from Aurora when she gave up on their quest for justice. Realizing he gave up the most important thing in his life, he went in search of her. Now, almost two centuries after their last fight, he’s tracked her down. With Aurora furious and fighting hard, Lucas will need every ounce of his ice powers to get what he’s after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s here…&lt;br /&gt;The battle brewing for five centuries is here. Before it’s over someone will be ruthlessly attacked, another gravely injured and more than one person will disappear. Enemies Aurora didn’t know existed will emerge from the shadows. It will take all of her Elemental training, and powers she’s kept hidden, to make it through alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I love Torin St. James...&lt;br /&gt;I need his strength…&lt;br /&gt;But someone from his past wants me dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raine Cooper is certain of two things: her love for Torin St. James and her destiny to be a powerful seeress. But when she starts having premonitions, they are unclear and disturbing. Worse, they involve Torin. With her mother gone, her father dying, and her best friend in Hel, she is not sure who to talk to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the visions become more personal and she foresees her future with Torin threatened by someone from his past, Raine becomes desperate for answers. Just her luck two new students arrive at her school and they seem to have answers. When with them, her powers are enhanced and her visions become clear. There is only one problem: Torin forbids Raine to see the two girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can their love survive without trust?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nothing can stop Raine Cooper when she wants something...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raine finally knows that her gorgeous neighbor, Torin St. James, is a legend straight out of Norse mythology, and that her feelings for him are strong. Torin is crazy about Raine too, breaking the one rule he lives by: Never fall for a mortal. The problem is he no longer remembers her, his memories erased by Norns—Norse destiny deities—to punish her for defying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So Raine comes up with a plan...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will make Torin forget his one rule a second time and fall in love with her all over again. &lt;br /&gt;But she quickly learns that well-laid plans do not work when dealing with deities and supernatural beings. Desperate, Raine makes choices that could not only tear her and Torin further apart, but lead to the destruction of everything and everyone she loves</description>

Living by his sword, he wanders the land of mortals, embittered and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naomi works in secret, illuminating manuscripts for the Knights of St. John. Gideon is drawn to her beauty and fascinated by her innocence. She stirs the shattered remnants of his nobility, intensifying the conflict already raging within him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gideon is unlike anyone Naomi has ever encountered before. His passionate kisses and intoxicating caresses leave her restless and wanting. Still, she senses the bleak loneliness he tries so hard to deny. Responding to his seduction with tenderness, she is determined to help him rediscover the beauty in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battle lines are drawn. Gideon must seek redemption or Fall. Naomi must lead her Rebel Angel back into the light before the forces of darkness destroy them both.</description>

  <description>Lauren Covington's family maintains a grand facade that belies the life they live behind closed doors. Alex Covington, Lauren's father, keeps a tight rein on his family through dominance, abuse, and obsessive control. Consequently, Lauren doesn't believe she could ever trust a man, much less fall in love with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lauren meets Jesse Ryder, her carefully constructed protective wall shatters. She falls hopelessly and completely in love. It's only fitting that Jesse is a private detective who had once worked for her father, had defied him, and was now the subject of Alex Covington's wrath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst devastating loss, betrayal, and her father's destructive pursuit of Jesse, Lauren finds the trust and love she had always longed for.</description>

  <description>A knight. A witch. A Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Grace, a twenty first century heroine, is accidently transported through a time portal into the clutches of an impoverished medieval knight with one eye on her ransom, we are treated to a brilliant evocation of medieval England which heaves with corruption and intrigue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remote and beautiful wilderness of ancient Northumberland rings out with the sound of clashing swords, the hiss of arrows, thundering hooves and the chink of coin bags changing hands in shady deals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is all there: a spirited and sensual romance, an action-packed adventure story, hidden treasure, revengeful and devious barons and corpulent and corrupt clergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beset on all sides by danger and deception, with only their wits and a small band of loyal followers to assist them, Grace and Miles of Wildewood find their lives inexplicably entwined as they battle for justice, honour and love.</description>

  <description>"For every light there is a dark." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Harley Finn, life had never been easy. She overcame a tragic upbringing, a childhood filled with pain. But her &lt;br /&gt;trials were only just beginning. A random hook-up changes her life forever. At first Levi Bonham seems like the ideal, &lt;br /&gt;no-strings-attached kind of guy, but Harley soon realizes that he is as dangerous as he is enticing. She finds herself &lt;br /&gt;plunged into a world plagued by creatures that prey on human suffering and misery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still reeling from tragedy, Harley has to learn to adjust to her new, not-quite-human life and all that comes with it. A &lt;br /&gt;confusing and complicated love life. Enemies—both new and old. And above all else, she must confront her own &lt;br /&gt;demons to save herself and those she loves most. Her desire for revenge propels her into a centuries-old war waged in &lt;br /&gt;shadows. Harley must choose to put aside her vendetta and risk her own humanity if there is to be any hope for &lt;br /&gt;mankind.</description>

  <description>“There is more at stake in Aedan’s war than any of you realize.”&lt;br /&gt;Vivienne Drake is lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’d let every one of her walls down, finally allowing others into her guarded circle, and all it brought her was pain and devastation. Now, out of fear and desperation, she’s turning to the one being she believes will be truthful with her; the only being that’s dared to give her anything resembling an honest answer--Linux, The Cruciatum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Daemonium is dangerous and mysterious, and offering Vivienne things that she’s been begging for. He offers her a chance at discovering what lies just beyond her reach. Though his motives remain far from clear, there is something within him that Vivienne is drawn to. And she wants nothing more than to believe in him, to believe in the things he tells her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they uncover details of Aedan’s plans, and discover what he intends to use his daughter for. Vivienne learns that she carries within her a destructive darkness, that if she allows, will consume her, and destroy the goodness she contains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting an endless battle against lies and deception, Vivienne must find the strength within herself to remain on a virtuous path. She’ll be forced to overcome pain and obstacles in order to discover the truth of just how deep the deceit runs within The Guild. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she remain above the darkness for the sake of Humanity and herself, or will she allow it to devour her light and destroy her soul?</description>

  <description>When Katarina “Kat” Montague steps into the Dragon’s Lair, a notorious New Orleans Goth club, she has only one intention – to find the true story of what happened to the girls who have recently gone missing. As an aspiring journalist, Kat knows that this could be the big break she has been waiting for. But what Kat doesn’t know is that the Dragon’s Lair is not your ordinary Goth club, it is a club where vampires hide their true identity in Goth clothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alec Ventru knows all too well how dangerous the vampires in the Dragon’s Lair really are. He knows, because he too is a vampire. And he has been bound by his maker to protect Kat. For Kat is no ordinary human. For years, Alec has fought his feelings for Kat while he watched over her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been sworn to protect her from his kind…even if that includes protecting her from himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to stay close to her, Alec agrees to help her find out what happened to the missing girls. But when rogue vampire, Damien, attempts to form a blood bond with Kat, a bond that will rob her of her free will, Alec has no choice but to take her to his estate on the outskirts of New Orleans. As the blood bond strengthens making her physically ill, Alec knows there is only one way he can break it even if he has to betray his maker to do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Damien will not be stopped. And when he comes to claim Kat, Alec will be in for the fight of his life.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Julia is finally living the good life. She's traded a hard cot in a Memphis orphanage for her very own room in a perfect little house, on a perfect little street, with a perfect set of parents who picked her to be their daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Julia is hiding a secret - and one fall night, she returns home from a friend's house to find that her secret has found her. Her 'forever home' is ashes. Her parents are dead. And, in the sky above the flames, a winged creature hunts her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nephilim King, Samyaza, has taken everything from Cayne. After struggling in the darkness for years to piece together his shattered life, Cayne is finally ready to confront his past and avenge the loss of everything he loved. He tracks Samyaza to a Memphis warehouse, where he winds up flat on his back, in the healing hands of a beautiful, dark-haired girl he doesn't need to know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to either of them, they are already bound. Cayne's past holds the answers to Julia's future. But what will pose the greatest threat to her? The bounty placed on her head by the leaders of two Celestial realms, or giving her heart to a man who is bound, by birth, to break it?</description>

  <description>In his own words, 15 year old Jake is a “huge pussy.” He flinches. Always. He's too timid to make a move on Beth, the buxom girl of his dreams, and too busy getting face-slammed into lockers by bullies to do much else. He seeks the guidance of the biggest badass he knows, his cousin Nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick is a professional burglar and makes Jake his apprentice. They stalk suburban neighborhoods night after night, ransacking houses for jewelry and sweet valuables. Nick teaches Jake the finer points of breaking and entering along with his dark philosophy - that there is no right or wrong in the world, just a series of events that happen without meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, adopting Nick's callous worldview helps Jake get over his fears and confront his tormentors, but he also unleashes an aggression in himself he never thought possible. And as he learns more about his cousin, he realizes that Nick's crimes go way beyond burglary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, Jake must face not only the monster in his cousin but also the one in his own heart.</description>

Riley is a pure gentleman who can easily leave the past where it belongs, behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people believe in fate where others deem it a coincidence.

  <description>Alpha’s word is Law. That is the creed Malcom lived and breathed until the day his Alpha decided to only take everything from him. Stripped form him was the love of his life and the pack he was born into. Hunted down liked a rabid animal to be taken down he is deemed enemy of the people he once called family but he refuses to allow his former Alpha the joy of turning him into a killer of his own kind. &lt;br /&gt;Vincent, his former Alpha, has lost all sense of reality. He only lives now to exact revenge on those he thinks have betrayed him and Malcom is at the top of that list. Once an advocate of saving their race he is now the one destroying it. He wants nothing more than Malcom’s head on a platter for as far as Vincent is concerned all of his troubles can be laid at Malcom’s feet. &lt;br /&gt;After calling in a favor from an unlikely ally, Malcom is called upon to take down his former Alpha. Vincent is so far gone that he is now sending children out to be slaughtered. Will Malcom be able to bring himself to help a people who have turned their backs on him?</description>

When his past follows him to Chicago he must protect someone that reminds him of all the painful memories he's tried so hard to forget. But when every touch from her sets his heart and body on fire--he finds it hard to maintain his aloof façade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Ellis has secrets of her own. An encounter with the handsome stranger who frequents her coffee shop reveals a vampire with baggage. Even though it might be more than she bargained for, she can't resist the one person who understands her.

The long-standing feud between the faeries that run the Chicago Crew and a lethal toxin puts Holly and other fledgling vampires in danger. Can they stop a vampire-fae war that’s been brewing for nearly a century? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Ever After – Book 3: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The half-demon unleashed a force that can tear them apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the night, Daeveena, a half-fey, half-demon walked out of the Hellfire Club, she left a tide of destruction, but everyone figured that was the end of it. No one imagined that she would steal something so valuable. Can Arie discover who is harboring her before he loses everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a special BONUS readers get Winter Promises - Book 1.5: An Ever After Christmas Story that takes place between book one and book two!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Cried Wolf - Book 1:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful what you wish for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A potion gone wrong... &lt;br /&gt;Mia Brooks is a reluctant witch, with powers that she tries to hold in check. But when her magic gets mixed up, supernatural forces are unleashed and suddenly she’s being pursued by werewolves—that she didn’t even realize existed… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden emotions...&lt;br /&gt;Ethan Parker, Mia’s brother’s best friend, is home from deployment for the holidays. Mia’s not only hiding from werewolves, she’s trying to keep her feelings for Ethan secret; it would be a disaster if he knew she’s been nursing a long-time crush… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power of love...&lt;br /&gt;Things take a terrifying turn when Mia and Ethan are attacked by a werewolf. Ethan is amazed when Mia reveals her paranormal prowess as she tries to shield them from danger. But can she really protect them from the darkness that lurks? And how can he tell her that, for ages, he’s been denying what he really wants? Mia...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cold Moon Rising - Book 2:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passions flare when the cold moon rises… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly: a normal college girl, who knows what she wants—to survive her final exams, and find someone to share her life with. Studying with Jacob is becoming too hot to handle; she’s falling for him, but he’s going too fast… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacob: a not-so-typical frat guy, who hides a secret—he’s a werewolf. Whenever the moon is high, he’s driven to shed his human form and satisfy his powerful desires. He craves Kelly, but she’s pushing him away… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallout: Jacob can smell Kelly’s arousal, but she insists she doesn’t want sex. A wolf can only take so much before his natural instincts win out. When the tension between them explodes, Jacob has no choice but to walk… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kidnapped! Kelly is abducted by evil scientists who’ve mistaken her for a female werecat and, despite their differences, Jacob has to try and find her. But it’s a race against time and the lunar tides. The scientists have taken Kelly to their lab and turned her into a shapeshifter for real. The full moon is rising, and soon neither Kelly nor Jacob will be able to control their inner beasts. Who knows what the consequences will be when they are consumed by unquenchable animal lust…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wolf Who Played With Fire - Book 3:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some magic can’t be unspun… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meddling in magic… &lt;br /&gt;If Mia Brooks could turn back time, it would be to when she used her fledgling magic to craft a potion for an injured werewolf. It nearly killed the Pack Alpha, and now the lives of her witch mentor, Jessa, and her soldier boyfriend, Ethan Parker, have been changed forever. Jessa is in hospital after a vicious werewolf attack. And, Ethan, having being bitten, is becoming a werewolf himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wolf at the door… &lt;br /&gt;Mia can’t turn back time, but she can try to make things right with the two people she cares about most. She’s keeping Jessa’s shop, Eternally Magick, open, and she’s there for Ethan as his inner wolf grows. But, by the next full moon, his transformation will be complete. Can she really be the mate of a half-man-half-wolf, living within the law of the Pack? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under his spell… &lt;br /&gt;Struggling to contain his new lupine senses, Ethan goes missing on active duty. When Mia realizes her werewolf lover has been abducted, she knows must harness every magic power she possesses to get him safely back…</description>

  <description>The prophecy says she’ll reject him… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trager was only a wolfling when he was given a devastating foretelling by the pack elders, and tossed from his family home in the Ozark Mountains. A wolf who can’t secure a mate will only endanger the pack. Destined to be denied by his mate, he’s been on his own ever since, surviving, waiting... hunting her. Now that he’s found her, he has a plan. A threat from a rival pack will have him returning home in hopes of saving the very people who cast him out. But he can’t go alone. He’ll have to convince the woman who doesn’t want him, to help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His wolf will make her an offer she can’t refuse… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s been a year since she lost the love of her life in a tragic motorcycle accident, and Kerrigan is finally ready to move on. Especially since she was never the love of his. A roughened biker who’s hot enough to stop her breath is the very last thing she’s looking for. But apparently he’s been looking for her, and even with her unwanted extra pounds, he looks at her like she sets his world on fire. To be accepted, wanted, as she is, is her deepest secret desire. But is it worth it to risk her heart again with someone who could so easily crush it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***Contains adult language and explicit sex scenes. Intended for mature audiences only.</description>

  <description>WARNING 18+: This book is erotic paranormal romance and contains material that may be considered offensive to some readers, which includes graphic language, explicit sex, and adult situations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*NOTE This book is the first book in the Eternally Yours Series, but is complete and can be read as a stand-alone book. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SYNOPSIS: Dr. Leila Reynolds is working her shift at Southside Medical Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, when she meets a mysterious man, Lance Steel. Although Leila is a married woman, she is enticed by this bold Renaissance man. Lance seduces her, surprising her with the most erotic weekend of her life … with a vampire. She convinces herself that it was just an affair, but she can’t get Lance—or the time they shared—out of her mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As owner of the Caprice Casino and the exclusive Club Moroii, Lance has more money and heartbreaking good looks than any one man deserves. He soon introduces her to an underground world that she never knew existed, fraught with sex, booze, blood … and danger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Leila’s life crumbles around her, Lance is there to pick up the pieces … but her connection with him has a price. Can Leila leave the past behind and become eternally his, allowing her heart—as well as her body—to be touched by a vampire? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Portia Mullins had always lived the life of a normal teenager, up until her sixteenth birthday. She is then informed by her grandma that she is actually a witch who is a descendant of a long line of witches and warlocks. After overcoming her disbelief she finds that being a member of the coven comes with one great perk in the form of the school's handsome bad boy, Vance Mangum. Vance and Portia have an immediate connection as a budding romance begins, only to be threatened by turbulent skies on the horizon as Vance's checkered past rears its ugly head to haunt them. Portia is forced to use her untried powers in defense of everything she loves in a desperate attempt to hold on to the one thing that really matters in her life.</description>

  <description>A new town holds promise for Cynthia Palmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia Palmer has felt lonely since moving to town, until she meets Daphne Shore. Daphne has taken her under her wing and introduced her to the members of the Steel Riders MC. New friends are great, but when Hank Park returns from a road trip, she can't wait to make his acquaintance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank Park is a tough nut to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few men carry themselves with purpose like Hank Park. With a lifetime of stories hiding within his eyes, he can be hard to read. But when he returns home to the Steel Riders and meets Cynthia, she can see exactly whats on his mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A death in the family puts love on the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Steel Riders MC are a close-knit family, but even families have bad blood at times. Hank's return is exciting for new girl Cynthia, but not so for Daphne's boyfriend, Derrick Unger. When he is found dead shortly after Hank's homecoming, the MC can only assume that difficulties between the two have resurfaced. Cynthia must decide if seeing the best in Hank is only clouding her from seeing the truth.</description>

  <description>Paranormal Dating Agency Book 1 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Talia Barca needs a date. Badly. She uses the services of the Paranormal Dating Agency hoping for a decent guy to take to a family wedding. A wedding her ex-husband has wormed his way into as a guest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Connor and Theron want Tally to complete their Alpha triad. She's sexy, curvy and funny. But she's human. And they're not sure she'll go for a relationship with two men at the same time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As if deciding to give two men a shot wasn’t difficult enough, Tally will also need to deal with a threat from the pack. She'll either prove she's strong enough to be an Alpha mate or find herself at the mercy of a vicious opponent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reader Warning: This book contains lots of scorching sex (including a threesome so hot it will make your ereader sizzle), adult language (hanky panky with no dirty talk is no fun), and violence. If this is not the kind of stuff you like to read, skip this book. However, if you like dirty, raunchy sex with some sarcasm and two hot men on one curvy girl, then this is right up your alley. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>Dammit, just how many toes was she going to have to stomp on before people realized she was a Delicate Freakn' Flower?&lt;p&gt;Naomi doesn't want to follow tradition and settle down with a violence-loving, chest thumping shapeshifter. She grew up in a household with five, testosterone laden brothers, where none of the dishes matched, the ugly-as-sin furniture could withstand any catastrophe, and where crazy glue was bought by the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fate - with a snicker - makes her meet not one, but two mates, Naomi digs her heels in and refuses to do what her wolf - and her body - demand. No way is she voluntarily allowing herself to get hitched to a pair of dumbass - totally hot and muscled - lacrosse players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Ethan, the towering Kodiak bear, and Javier, the sexy, tanned jaguar convince this she-wolf that life with them won't be all chaos? And can this Delicate Freakn' Flower unbend her prejudices enough to recognize she needs a pair of men who can handle her thorns - and her passion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning:&lt;/i&gt; This is an erotic paranormal romance, heavy on the romance, that contains sexual situations involving multiple partners (MFM). It is meant for open minded adults only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Before the Evolution there was TorBane: technology that infused human DNA with cybernetic matter. It had the ability to grow new organs and limbs, to heal the world. Until it evolved out of control and spread like the common cold. The machine took over, the soul vanished, and the Bane were born. The Bane won't stop until every last person has been infected. With less than two percent of the human population left, mankind is on the brink of extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve knows the stories of the Evolution, the time before she wandered into the colony of Eden, unable to recall anything but her name. But she doesn't need memories to know this world is her reality. This is a world that is quickly losing its humanity, one Bane at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting to keep one of the last remaining human colonies alive, Eve finds herself torn between her dedication to the colony, and the discovery of love. There is Avian and West – one a soldier, one a keeper of secrets. And in the end, Eve will make a choice that will change the future of mankind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bane is The Terminator meets The Walking Dead with a heart-twisting romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published as Eden, due to reader demand it has been revamped and rereleased as The Bane: book one in The Eden Trilogy.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;an alternate cover edition can be found &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25500042-act-of-mercy" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paranormal Security and Intelligence Operative Duke Marlow has a new mission: find, interrogate and possibly eliminate the target—Mercy Deluca. He knows looks can be deceiving, but it’s hard to believe the beautifully quirky woman running around in a superhero t-shirt is a viable threat. The sexy little biomedical engineer quickly proves she is more than he bargained for and Intel has it all wrong—she’s not the enemy. Far from it. Intel also forgot to mention one vital piece of information—she’s Duke’s mate. This immortal alpha werewolf doesn’t take kindly to her being in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mercy accepted a position within The Corporation she thought it was to help cure disease and to make a difference for mankind. She had no idea what her new career path truly entailed—monsters masquerading under the guise of scientific research. Unable to stomach the atrocities she’s uncovered, she reaches out through what she hopes is the proper channels, asking for help. Mercy gets more than she bargains for when a team of paranormal hotties shows up on her doorstep ready to take down The Corporation. One in particular seems to be able to get under skin, both aggravating her and exciting her in ways she can’t explain.</description>

  <description>Sibyl Blackthorne isn't afraid of anything--except maybe being sold into marriage to a man she doesn't love. A man she's never even met. A man who, by reputation, is one of Scotland's cruelest lairds in over a century. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what choice does she have, with her father dead and her uncle now married to his brother's widow, putting him in charge of not only the Blackthorne fortune, but Sibyl's future as well? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then her betrothed turns out to actually be far worse than his reputation, so headstrong Sibyl decides life as a peasant, or even death, would be preferable to a future with such a despicable man, and makes plans to run away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On an organized hunt for wolves--or, as the Scots call them, wulvers--Sybil escapes her fiancé's clutches, only to find she's run into something far more untamed and dangerous in the middle of the woods. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a big, brawny, long-haired man, who only speaks to her in Gaelic and calls himself Raife, simply picks her up and carries her off with him into the Scottish wild, Sibyl knows she's in trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he takes her to a place no human has ever been, she knows she's gone over the edge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when he, at last, marks her as his own, she discovers that only one wild heart can claim another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note To Readers: This is the extended version with over 10K words of new material and a BONUS epilogue and preview of the SEQUEL.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Paranormal Bird Shifter Romance &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a place where realms combine and portals open passages to the unknown, a prophecy speaks of fertility being restored to his people through the taking of King Kabril’s mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The prophecy neglects to mention she lacks something vital to his kind—wings. Kabril, King of the Buteos Regalis has no interest in taking a human mate. His kind believes humans are dirty, vile creatures who rely on machines to lift them into the air. The last place he wants to go in search of his mate is Earth, but he’s left no choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never did he expect to find love on a planet with one moon, people who lack wings and a stubborn vixen who makes his heart soar. When he does, he fears the truth about who and what he truly is will steal it away. Little does he know his enemies fully intend on doing the taking.</description>

  <description>ASIN B00O96HLCQ has been moved to the latest kindle edition as per guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is life after death, unfortunately for them, it's the same one...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett Perkins was a soldier until the Project killed him. Now he's finding that life after death isn't so hot. With the Project base destroyed, he and his team have been tasked with running down and destroying a group of rogue Bloods. Unfortunately the vampires always seem to be one step ahead. Then they start kidnapping women...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Julia Collier is despised and reviled in the small town of Greenwood. His stories have painted her as everything from an air-headed gold-digger to a nymphomaniac serial killer. She can't even shop in the local store without suffering abuse from her fellow townsfolk, and that's before the late night calls or her ex's bully-boys following her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her home is broken into, Julia assumes it's her husband making good on his threats to 'deal with her for good'. She never dreams that it will lead a descent into another, terrifying world. One inhabited by werewolves, vampires... and zombies. Or that zombies could be so damn hot. Especially one certain example who makes her heart pound and all her common sense disappear over the horizon. After all, what woman in her right mind would fall for the undead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless the undead aren't dead at all, but something more than human, from a world she'll need all her wits and new abilities to survive the battle between the undead... and the dead.</description>

  <description>With Sasha as the proclaimed Mage of high ranking power, she can't just slip under the carpet to a peaceful existance. Instead, she must present herself to the Council, a group of white mages who reside over the magical community, governing Stefan's people. There she must prove she has what it takes to be the mage of Stefan's clan, not something easily done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stefan, too, has been noticed by the large faction of rulers. An alpha leader with a firm hold over his people, he has outgrown in his position, and it shows. Ties to a human mage with a vast well of power, though, has made him a target. Sasha is sought after, and those who want to harness her power will take her by force if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Dominicous' and Toa's help, Sasha and Stefan must face the trials coming up. Proving themselves is the easy part. Getting out with their lives becomes the challenge.</description>

  <description>Savannah Dupree is a freshman studying at Boston University on a full scholarship. But academic excellence is only one of her gifts. Savannah possesses something even more remarkable than her quick mind and insatiable curiosity for learning. With a simple touch, she can see an object’s past—a skill that puts her life in danger, when her studies bring her into contact with a centuries-old English sword and the terrible secret hidden within the blade’s history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all his three hundred years of living as one of the Breed, vampire warrior Gideon never dreamed he’d see the blade again that spilled his young brothers’ lives ages ago in London. Ever since the boys’ deaths, Gideon’s been on a personal quest to rid the world of Rogue vampires, but now he can’t help wondering if the brutal slaying was something more sinister—an act perpetrated by an unknown enemy. An enemy who is apparently living in hiding somewhere in Boston. There’s one certain way to prove Gideon’s suspicion, but it will mean using innocent, gifted Savannah to help uncover the full truth—a truth that will shatter everything she knows about herself and the world around her. And with danger closing in from all sides, the passion that ignites between Gideon and Savannah will tempt them to risk their hearts and lives for a love that might just last an eternity….</description>

  <description>Warning: For Mature Adult Audiences. Contains language, violence, and actions some may deem offensive. MF&lt;br /&gt;In book one of My Beloved: Channing Addams can’t believe his luck when he literally collides into his mate in the most unlikely of places. But his happiness doesn't last long when his beast demands they join with their mate, leaving Channing to use all his power to stifle the beast within to not frighten the woman meant to be their mate—their human mate.&lt;br /&gt;Rochelle, with the knowledge of having the worst taste in men, finds it difficult to trust what is placed directly in her path—a man interested in every aspect of her life along with sharing his with her.&lt;br /&gt;As the two are getting to know each, the unthinkable happens, and Rochelle soon learns that not all is how it seems when people start turning into monsters before her very eyes, leaving her running for her life—literally.&lt;br /&gt;Channing wonders how much more the love of his life is going to take of his crazy world before she gives up on the two of them. But as time goes by, he finds his mate has an inner core of strength and resolve. One that just might come in handy as they face the evil within Channing's own family.&lt;br /&gt;Can Rochelle accept the beast within the man she has fallen for or will she run, leaving him to fight his own battles?</description>

Even for a wolf, she is wicked fast and almost impossible to track. Then she meets Gareth, her new Guardian. Gareth is ruggedly handsome, unfailingly stubborn, and seems determined to sniff Beth out, no matter where she runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a disastrous night of passion with Gareth, Beth has no choice but to put herself forward for mating. Although, it's not just Gareth that has his eye on this female. Donovan, a wolf from a neighboring pack , has his own reasons for wanting this she-wolf, and when Beth makes the wrong choice, she finds out exactly what happens when you're "thrown to the wolves".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets are revealed and choices are made. Will love conquer all, or destroy everything Beth has ever known?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00PKV90B4.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should walk away, they know their love is forbidden, they know their deep connection could destroy both their worlds. No! Good and evil should never collide.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But fate has other ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lustful encounter will lead to the greatest love to ever exist in their immortal worlds. An Angel and a Demon, two halves of the same coin drawn together by an unstoppable force, their fate intertwined by design but held worlds apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With pleasure will come pain, with happiness will come grief. Two missing pieces finally together creates an ecstasy that will rock the ground they walk on. But as their love becomes stronger their worlds will start to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can their sinful love truly conquer all? Will they catch the scent that lingers and find the ties that bind even the deadliest of enemies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lines will blur and hearts will shatter. In a battle of good versus evil not everything is always black and white, for even in heaven, shades of grey hide in the shadows.</description>

  <description>Three lovers who stalk and kill the immortals that drift through South Florida (tourists are a moveable feast, after all) are living a simple life of leisure- until one of them is nearly killed by woman who is a new kind of lethal.&lt;br /&gt;When Ring Hardigan isn’t making sandwiches for, and with, his two partners, Waleska and Risa (they’re cool like that), he’s got a busy schedule doing the dirty work of sending immortals to the ever after. Wally and Risa provide linguistics, logistics, and finding the right place for him and his knife- together, they’re a well-oiled machine, and they’ve settled into a rhythm that bodes ill for the Undying. Warlocks, vampires, succubae and the odd ghoul have all fallen to their teamwork. Life is tough, but they soldier on killing the undead, liberating their worldly goods for charity, and generally achieving very little.&lt;br /&gt;-Until Ring wakes up after nearly dying at the hands of a woman who may or may not be the daughter of Satan. Ring’s a tough character, for a boat bum (killing immortals sort of rubs off on you that way), but twelve days of comatose healing are enough to bring out the ugly side of his temper. When a letter arrives asking for their help finding a large collection of stolen heirloom jewelry, they form an uneasy friendship with the last Baron of a family hiding in a primal European forest.&lt;br /&gt;Cazimir, the Baron, has two skills: Jeweler and preserver of the last herd of forest bulls. It’s an odd occupation, but then, Ring, Risa and Wally aren’t your everyday career folks, and Cazimir’s lodge might be sitting on something that looks a lot like hell, which, according to a 2400 year old succubus hooker named Delphine, is currently on the market to the strongest immortal. The Baron’s impassioned plea to find the jewelry comes with some conditions- he doesn’t want the collection back as much as he does the thief, Elizabeth, who happens to be his daughter- and the woman who nearly sent Ring to his grave.&lt;br /&gt;In a tapestry of lies, it’s up to Ring, Wally and Risa to find out what is evil, who is human, and exactly who really wants to reign over hell.</description>

  <description>Relinquish Control has just opened its doors in Seattle, and already we are not shy for customers. Relinquish Control is an exclusive escort service catering to the most distinguished customers, from business magnates to foreign royalty. This proven and well-established international business offers an elite selection of women who are ready and willing to attend to your every need with no questions asked. Confidentiality is our special obligation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jewell Weston is homeless and desperate at age twenty-four. Two years ago, she quit her job to care for her ailing mother and her young brother; the medical bills incurred because of the cancer that killed her mother two months ago took everything the family had, and the state then took away her brother, now age ten. The only way for her to get the boy back is by finding a job and securing a home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she’s approached by a woman in cashmere and pearls who tells her she can change her life, and is handed a card with the business name Relinquish Control on it, she thinks she has nothing to lose by calling the phone number. Maybe this will be the answer to her prayers, a way to save her little brother from the nightmarish foster home he’s been placed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake Knight, known to the world as cold and without a heart, is given an exclusive membership to Relinquish Control by his devilish younger brother, who thinks it would be amusing to make his staid brother squirm. Little does this brother realize that Blake does indeed have unusual desires that Relinquish Control can cater to perfectly. What started as a joke turns out to be just what Blake needs. Though the world sees this man as deliberate and emotionless, it’s nothing but a façade. What lies underneath would shock all those who know him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he and his two brothers were six, eight and ten, they were tied up and forced to watch while their parents were murdered. The image has been burned into their minds, though they’ve tried to forget, leaving each of them guarded and unwilling to give their trust to anyone other than each other. No one is allowed to have their hearts. The brothers would never think of letting down their guard with anyone else, certainly not with a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Blake and Jewell’s journey and see if they can find a happily ever after…</description>

  <description>In the wake of ridding their territory of a menace, Sasha has only one pressing duty left: find more human magic workers. And while it is undoubtedly important on some grand scale, the task is, in itself, surprisingly uneventful. That is, until a strange predator takes an interest in her and Charles on their trek home one evening. In the space of twenty-four hours Sasha's life goes from mundane to being stalked and threatened. A new shifter has moved into town, and if the whispered rumors are to be believed, something even more sinister is lurking behind, watching and waiting for the right moment to spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that isn't the only element that turns Sasha's life upside down. She has one hell of a secret that will change her and Stefan's life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is one of two books requested by, and written for, the fans.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Bestselling &amp;amp; award-winning erotic paranormal romance. Full length vampire &amp;amp; shifter romance novels, each with their own happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KADE'S DARK EMBRACE (Book 1)&lt;br /&gt;After a series of girls are ritualistically murdered on the cold streets of Philadelphia, seasoned detective, Sydney Willows, is forced to work with sexy, alpha vampire, Kade Issacson. As he attempts to protect her from a murderer, Kade grows concerned that the beautiful, but very human detective, could easily end up dead should she tangle with supernatural forces that are beyond her control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The investigation leads them into a dark and dangerous world, deep in the heart of New Orleans, where together, they search for the perpetrators of the Voodoo killings. Sydney soon becomes the target of the killer and ends up fighting for her life and love in the Big Easy. Will she eventually give into the intoxicating desire she feels for Kade if she makes it out alive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUCA'S MAGIC EMBRACE (Book 2)&lt;br /&gt;Sexy vampire, Luca Macquarie doesn’t do love; especially not with humans. Yet, ever since he rescued Samantha Irving, he can’t deny the enigmatic attraction he’s developed for the alluring mortal woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Big Easy, they embark on a spellbinding journey, searching for a mystical amulet that promises to release her obligation from an ancient, lethal vampire who’s been threatening her life. With cryptic clues and clandestine allies, will Luca and Samantha destroy the dangerous amulet before others acquire it, setting forth a chain of catastrophic consequences? And will Luca give into his erotic desire for the witch who magically captures heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRISTAN'S LYCEUM WOLVES (Book 3) *RONE Award Winner 2014*&lt;br /&gt;Charismatic and powerful Lyceum Wolves’ Alpha, Tristan Livingston, is out for revenge after a devastating attack on his pack.

She’s reluctantly agrees to help the sexy Alpha in his quest to identify suspects; ones who’d kill her on the spot if they knew she existed. As Kalli places herself in the hands of the dominant wolf, she soon finds she wants nothing more than to submit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tristan, committed to ruling his pack as a lone wolf, is drawn to the mysterious and enticing woman, who seems more than human, but not quite supernatural. After living a lifetime alone, will he succumb to the visceral need to claim her? And will he prevail against the menacing enemy who threatens to destroy Lyceum Wolves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOGAN'S ACADIAN WOLVES (Book 4) *IRC Nominated Best Book of 2014 for Paranormal &amp;amp; Erotic Romance*&lt;br /&gt;Deep in the heart of New Orleans, Acadian Wolves’ Alpha, Logan Reynaud, rescues a beautiful woman in the dead of night. Intrigued by the mysterious human, the commanding Alpha is determined to elicit all of her secrets, including her deepest fantasies. Driven by responsibility and honor, Logan must protect both his pack and the woman who’s captivated his attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Wynter Ryan, a leading virologist, is fascinated with her charismatic protector. As the chemistry ignites between her and the dominant Alpha, she relinquishes her ties to the past, embracing ecstasy and submission within his arms and intrepidly acquiescing to her own adventurous instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion and mystery on the bayou stirs Logan’s wolf, yet Wynter’s a distraction he can’t afford when his priority is to lead his new pack. Will Logan surrender to the uncontrollable need to claim Wynter as his mate? And will he be able to keep her alive, finding the killer who threatens the Acadian Wolves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The books in this box set contain several erotic love scenes, including m/f/m menage, and are intended for adult readers only.*</description>

  <description>The smell of rain vastly approaches as we are lying on the ground in a sea of flowers. They surround our bodies while the fresh Spring wind caresses our skin with its soft, gentle touch. Combined as one, we stare into each other’s eyes as we bask in the pleasure of our love and OUR land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Land of the Fae has flourished bringing a new beginning and a new court, the Fall Court. Five years have passed since then along with the dreaded day that Meliantha, Summer Court Princess and one of the powerful Four, was betrayed and broken-hearted by the sexy and alluring Winter Prince, Kalen. Spurned by the man she loves, Meliantha has turned and fallen into the arms of the fierce and handsome warrior, Finn, who understands she can never love him, but wants more than anything to mend her broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;The Winter Solstice Ball is approaching, meaning Meliantha will have to face the Winter Prince and make it out of there with her heart intact. But what does she do when Prince Kalen acts as if nothing ever happened and seems more in love with her than ever before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark sorcerer has planned his twisted game of lies and deceit well, and has enjoyed making himself a player without anyone’s knowledge. The game is almost over and the players are exactly where they are needed to be. Will Meliantha figure out his twisted game and save all the players? Or will the dark sorcerer once again obtain the power of the Four and take everything away from her…..even her one true love?</description>

  <description>Arianna Grace is about to turn seventeen and her life has been very complicated lately. She is the leader of four clans of night humans: dearg-dul, baku, tengu, and lycan. While the four clans seem to get along better with each other, there is internal conflict on both sides of her family, not to mention the three boys vying for her attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Lucan is making a chase for the power to lead the baku clans and is playing his cards by using his nephew Andrew to lure Arianna into a trap. Unfortunately for Lucan, Andrew has his own plans. He has spent the last year waiting for Arianna to see him as more than a friend, and he now finds it necessary to make a move for her affection, despite his uncle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dearg-dul estate, Arianna discovers that the ambitious Lord Seeger has been laying his own strategies for power and is slowly poisoning her. After getting away with her grandfather's murder, he is setting his sights on her. Luckily for Arianna, her team is on to all of the plans and is making some plans of their own. Will it be enough to keep Arianna safe? Several people close to Arianna have been keeping secrets. If Arianna is to take power and control of the night, she will need to know the truth. Will someone finally tell her what it truly means to become the legend everyone is waiting for, before it is too late to turn back?</description>

  <description>Arianna has gathered the outside clans to decide her fate in marriage. A tournament will be held, and she is the prize, whether she wants to be or not. The only thing she can do is watch men fight over her, or is that all she can do? Thanks to her team’s well-made plans Arianna has other strategies in place, and hopefully one just might get her freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the men gather and she learns more about the night human world, there are new allies to keep close and more enemies to keep even closer. Some even hold more secrets to her legend and possibly the actual reason to her existence. Now Arianna must decide what to do with the fate she has been dealt. Time has come to step out of the shadows of the men who protect her, and into her own power. The time is now for Arianna to take control, and fight for the destiny she wants to live.</description>

  <description>Book 6 in the Dragon Guard series. The books can be read as stand-alone stories, but it is advisable to read them in order to get the most enjoyment from the series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There Are No Coincidences... &lt;br /&gt;The last bachelor in a Force of elite Dragon Guardsmen, Aaron O'Brien decided long ago that single was the only way to be. Mates and children and happily ever after were for his brethren. He alone has accepted the responsibility of stopping the traitor and restoring peace to his clan. Unfortunately, Fate didn't get the message. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Universe Does Not Make Mistakes... &lt;br /&gt;Intelligent, determined, and levelheaded, Dr. Charlene Gallagher has always found comfort in logic and reason. When the inexplicable jumps up and smacks her in the face, will Charlie cling to her old beliefs or let go and find answers in the one man that clouds her judgment and ignites her passion? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fate Will Not Be Denied… &lt;br /&gt;Nobody said it was going to be easy. The fight will be real. It will take compromise and a love created by the Universe. Only Charlie can take the leap of faith, and only for her dragon... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book contains explicit sexual material and violence. It is only suited for mature readers 18 years of age and older.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Tessa McCaide has come a long way since her abrupt entrance into the world of werewolves, but she still has just as far to go before she’s comfortable with turning full wolf. In the meantime, she’s avoiding the topic of shifting to four legs any way she can. Thankfully her mate, Dastien Laurent, is quite the distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she finds her best friend, Meredith, getting sick in the bathroom, Tessa knows something’s majorly wrong. Meredith was cursed years ago, and the dark magic kept her wolf dormant—only now the wolf is awake, and that same spell is killing her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa has no intention of sitting around while Meredith wastes away. Even if it means playing with magic she doesn’t understand, she’ll do anything to save Meredith’s life. Including bargaining with the local coven of witches and its crazed leader, whose only goal is getting Tessa to join the witchy ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Tessa save her friend without losing herself?</description>

  <description>Book Two of The Ancients Series &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jessica St. Marks has come to grips with being the stuff of legends. She is destined to be the leader of her kind, the werewolves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While she dreams of uniting the two breeds of werewolves, the Ancients and the Lesser, she must first put a stop to the tyrannical rule of the current werewolf king, Antoine De’Lune. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jessica must come into her full power in order to take her rightful place as the white wolf ruler. She cannot do that without first accepting a mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A choice must be made between Evan, the wolf whose claim she has already accepted once; and his brother, Mikael, whom she was forced to get to know. One will help her embrace her destiny, while the other is fated to destroy her.</description>

  <description>Jonas isn't the kind of guy to submit to the expectations of others, even when his life is on the line. So when he wakes up in the cell of a dungeon with torture devices hanging on the wall, he can only think one thing: this should be fun. What he didn't expect, however, is the beautiful but broken female pitting herself against his resolve. For once, the pain of his past is shallow in comparison to another, and he wants nothing more than to extinguish her pain. When Sasha realizes one of her own has been taken, the gloves come off. Using her ever-expanding resources of both human and non-human magic workers, she sets out to battle the most advanced, most experienced magic worker in the world. Regardless of being completely outmatched, Sasha and Stefan rush to Jonas' aid.</description>

  <description>I am Arkadia Castner. I am beautiful. I am popular. I am also the most messed-up witch you will ever meet. I can’t make water boil, or make the wind blow; I can’t even light a match without the aid of a flint. My 18th birthday is in six months, and if I don’t pass the Paranormal Safety Exams (PSEs) by then, I will be banished to the Isle of Shadows for eternity, never to be seen again – it will be as though I never existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself at the halfway house under the supervision and guidance of Den Mother and telepathic empath, Eloise Mayflower. The halfway house is the last chance for troubled paranormal teens like me to pass our PSEs and avoid banishment. Eloise knows everything I think and feel, and is supposed to be helping me, but I still can’t do basic spells a six-year-old can do. I hate it here, but I have no choice. This is my last chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had all but given up hope, when in walks Bohdan Drak. Tall, dark, and so damn sexy it hurts to look at him – even his muscles had muscles. He is a dragon shifter and wears the mark of having passed his PSEs. When our souls meet, we realize we have found our soul mates and perfect matches. My dying hope has found life again, and I finally have a reason to look forward to a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought everything would be fine, but darkness and despair creep into my future. I have been framed for a murder, and everyone believes I am guilty. The paranormal council now watches my every move. Can I trust Bohdan and true love? I fear my destiny is to be banished forever …</description>

  <description>15 year old Anastasia Adams has spent her entire life on run. She and her mother have never spent more than 18 months in any one location, often times leaving with just the clothes on their backs. Despite the havoc that this is wreaking on Ana's social and academic life, her mother offers no explanation as to why it is they're constantly moving, or even what it is they're running from. But that all changes one night in the woods of Pelion, SC--the night the terror catches up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearing her mother dead, and having barely escaped with her own life, Ana is whisked away to world of privilege and tradition. It's a fairytale come to life. The poor girl used to living out of a suitcase is now a resident of one of the most exclusive addresses in the world. The people there adore her and she catches the eye of a young guardian who sees her as a refreshing change to the girls he's grown up with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only they could find her mother. If only she knew the consequences of being born a "conjurer." If only she knew who that green eyed stranger was, the stranger who'll tell her about a past too romantic, and too tragic to be real. In the end, she'll have to choose between the boy who has captured her heart and the stranger she can feel down in her soul, assuring at least one of them an almost certain death.</description>

  <description>When duty forces a shaman to stop a vampire from her revenge, love doesn’t just burn... it bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two hundred years, Niki DeVeraux has been tracking the monster who murdered her family and made her a vampire. She finally catches up to him in a small Arizona town, only to face more than she bargained for. Amid an imperious vampire King, a shaky truce between the local clan and shifter pack, and a too-sexy sheriff who makes her remember she’s still a woman, Niki’s single-minded purpose is threatened for the first time since her turning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between his duties as Keeper of the peace for the Magic Council and heir to his tribe’s shamanistic magic, Sheriff Shane Spencer’s job is to protect humanity and stop the friction between the local Arcaine races before it turns into an all out blood war. To make matters worse, there’s an irresistible rouge vampire in town enflaming his senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When wolves start turning up dead, the tension between the paranormal races grows and suspicion falls on Niki. Shane knows she’s not to blame, and it has nothing to do with the primal urges she stirs within him. Working together, they must find a way to stop the hostilities from going over the edge. Trouble is, the desires raging between Niki and Shane might prove more dangerous than the surrounding threats.</description>

  <description>Domenico Moretti used to have it all. He was prince to one of the most powerful and wealthiest Lyccan packs in the world, a warrior who made his opponents tremble in fear, a gorgeous billionaire every woman desired. Only when his wife disappeared did Domenico realize that none of it mattered if he did not have Misty's love and trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misty Wall used to be a wimp, a starry-eyed fool who thought she was about to live happily ever after with the werewolf she loved. She used to think Domenico Moretti loved her back...until his lies publicly shamed her with the revelation that she was never his mate and was only ever his pawn for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the threat of war looms closer, the alliance between non-human races is put to the test and forces the estranged couple to face each other again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prove that his princess means more to him than anything else, Domenico makes the greatest sacrifice, laying his pride on the line and turning his back on his destiny. Domenico had hoped for a second chance, but heartbreak may all that awaits him when Misty seals her allegiance to the Faeries...by promising to wed another man.</description>

  <description>This book no longer in print/digital print. Re-release in 2017. See author profile for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman robbed of her very life and everything she holds dear...&lt;br /&gt; A rather gentle and soft hearted soul, Ava is content in her quiet little life. She has a good job and two friends that she loves dearly. She never suspected that it could all be taken from her in one fluttering heartbeat. Victim of a devious plot, Ava finds herself in the middle of a living nightmare. Taken captive by a monster, she awakes forever changed. Her life will never be the same again. Afraid of becoming a monster herself, she will have to learn to adapt to this brutal new world she has been thrust into. She will have to find the strength to embrace what she has become and to face her fears if she hopes to save herself and the beast who once saved her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who's path has been chosen by fate...&lt;br /&gt; Sent by his pack to help the vampires with a rogue uprising, Teagan agrees to help them track the rogue leader. As the future alpha of his Lykan pack, his responsibilities are clear... that is until he rescues a fallen angel from a rogue vampire out for power and revenge. He knows he can never have her, but her unmistakable pull is hard to resist, as is the beast that resides within him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They will have to put their fears aside if they hope to survive what lies ahead. What would you sacrifice to save the person you love? Will the beast ultimately destroy the woman he would give his very life to protect? Sometimes we are forced to find strength we never knew we had in order to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ “What are you?” the angel asked him in wonder.&lt;br /&gt;Teagan hesitated a moment before responding. “I am Lykan.” He answered her with a voice gone rough from the beast within. It was always hard to speak in his beast form. He was shocked that this little slip of a girl had dared to touch him. He had expected her to scream and run in terror from him when she opened her eyes. Instead, she had boldly moved closer and seemed to be savoring the heat of his skin. The muscles on his chest flexed in response to her gentle touch, and he resisted the urge to lean into her wandering hand.&lt;br /&gt; Looking down at the small hand on his chest, he growled, “What are you?” He breathed deeply of her scent, trying to figure it out. She smelled like a vampire but also of human and soft female and something else… Teagan tensed. She also had a male vampire’s scent all over her. Could it be Salvatore’s scent? Was she some sort of new rogue hybrid? Gods, he hoped not. He didn’t want to destroy her. &lt;br /&gt; The look of wonder on her face disappeared as a look of utter despair filled her eyes. She struggled to find the words to answer his question. “I… I… don’t know what I am.” &lt;br /&gt; Tears began to slide down her cheeks. She leaned her forehead into his chest, softly crying. Looking down at her in confusion, he instinctively wrapped his arm around her, holding her to his chest. Clenching his fist, he resisted moving his hand to rub the soft skin of her back in comfort.&lt;br /&gt; “I… I’m a monster.” Her soft voice came to him in a quiet, shame-filled whisper. “Like him… he… he did this to me. He infected me. Please… I can’t be a monster. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I think… you have to kill me.”&lt;br /&gt; Teagan held his breath and froze, his beast growling in protest at her words. His instincts were telling him to protect, not destroy. He didn’t know what she was, but he sensed an innocence about her. He knew she was no monster.&lt;br /&gt; “Please. I don’t think I can take any more. He’s coming back for me. There’s no time. You have to do it now.” The little female lifted her tear-streaked face to look into his eyes. “Please, I would rather die than be a monster like Salvatore or, worse, a slave to him for eternity. This is why you came here, isn’t it? Please… end this… kill me.”</description>

  <description>Sinclair Jeffries thought she knew what she was getting into when her zany, gay friend, Jesse Eddington, talked her into portraying his girlfriend during his parent's anniversary party on Huntington Beach. That is, until she met Reed, Jesse's sexy as hell older brother, and ends up getting much more than what she'd bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Eddington assumed his future was settled until he met Sinclair, his brother's so-called "girlfriend," but the raw, sexual tension between them is hard to ignore. As he watches their ruse from the sidelines, he finds himself wanting to uncover more than just their amusing little facade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Due to sexual content and heavy subject matter, this book is recommended for ages 18+.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nothing can stop Raine Cooper when she wants something…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raine finally knows that her gorgeous neighbor, Torin St. James, is a legend straight out of Norse mythology, and that her feelings for him are strong. Torin is crazy about Raine too, breaking the one rule he lives by: Never fall for a mortal. The problem is he no longer remembers her, his memories erased by Norns—Norse destiny deities—to punish her for defying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So Raine comes up with a plan...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will make Torin forget his one rule a second time and fall in love with her all over again. &lt;br /&gt;But she quickly learns that well-laid plans do not work when dealing with deities and supernatural beings. Desperate, Raine makes choices that could not only tear her and Torin further apart, but lead to the destruction of everything and everyone she loves.</description>

  <description>A person can have many soul mates in a lifetime but, each person has only one twin soul in each life. This belief taught to me by my grandmother is one that has always filled me with wonder. As a young child, she often sat next to me in front of the fire blazing brightly in our tipi and spoke of the legend of the twin souls. The legend is as old as creation itself.&lt;br /&gt;It is said that as the creator was making human beings he was surrounded by souls to place in them. The creator decided to take a single soul and split it in half creating twin souls. He then took the two twin souls and touched them together as light as a butterfly’s kiss. The twin souls were then separated and placed respectively into man and woman.&lt;br /&gt;The creator lightly touched them together so that when they meet one day, they will recognize the other’s soul as their twin. This is because they have already met at the beginning of creation and will immediately feel as if they have known each other forever.&lt;br /&gt;I am “Sumanitu taka kici mani wiya” which means she who walks with the wolf and live with my elderly grandmother, Shetawahki, who is a revered elder and medicine woman of the Lakota Sioux Nation and part of the Roaming Wolf Sioux Tribe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a historical paranormal romance set in the west during in the time the white settlers came and the Indian Nation people roamed freely. There are two separate stories. In the first book you will meet half white and half Indian Juliana Dodge orphaned as a twenty year old maiden who lives on the fort and is ridiculed when everyone finds out about her half breed status. She meets the handsome Blackfoot warrior, Cheveyo and things take off from there but, life is not easy for them and they have many challenges to overcome. Is their vow to be together strong enough to stand against the white soldiers? Will their love endure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In book 2 you meet She Who Walks with Wolves, the Sioux Chief's daughter who is destined to be with Shadow Hawk, the Blackfoot Chief Cheveyo's son. They find out they are Twin Souls. But, will their love be strong enough to stand through what is to come? Will her supernatural blessing from the Great Spirit truly be a blessing or a curse in her life?&lt;br /&gt;As one reader put it, "There are so many twists and turns that you don't see coming and they keep you reading until the very end. I had to read it all in one sitting."</description>

  <description>Mission: Scent a Mate &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan Alvarez knew that a promise to her best friend involved staking out the local wolf pack's scenting ceremony and recording the graphic details, but she was the writer and the only one with the balls to finish the task. No one would know that four human women had sneaked proof of their rituals, or at least, that was the plan until Aric Wolfe showed up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mission: Stake a Claim &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aric Wolfe knew his baby sister was up to something, and expected her best friend, Jordan, to be in on the chaos. He finally had an opportunity to lay claim to a mate that had been under his nose for years. Jordan's scent called to both the man and the animal, and he was done fighting the call of the beast. It was time to mark his mate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mission: Survive an Alpha &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a good intention creates a problem for the Wolfe family, Jordan finds herself being stalked by a woman intent on claiming Aric as her own. Battle lines will be drawn, love will be put to the test, and Aric will have to fight Jordan's strong personality to keep her alive. Two alpha hearts seeking control will either find the balance or risk losing their love forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mature reader warning: Adult content including but not limited to: Violence and raw sexual language and actions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***INCLUDES: Bonus short (A Hero Scarred) from Milly writing as April Angel***</description>

  <description>Bad boy professional Motocross rider, Jesse Morrison, knows how to leave an impression. Except lately, it has mostly been bad impressions. Frustrated and wounded, he surrounds himself with women, booze and drugs. After getting kicked out of his brother's house, he relocates to California for the summer to crash at his uncle's place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Santa Monica, Jesse meets the one woman who can lead him back on the right path, beautiful twenty-two year old, Niki Milani. Only one problem; she is not interested. Niki has her own demons to fight. A past that left her emotionally abandoned by her own blood, her father. She keeps her heart guarded and finds it difficult to trust a man again. Especially not a bad boy player who is more messed up than she. However, Jesse never backs down from a challenge. Armed with a sizzling attraction, he is determined to prove to Niki that there is more to him than what appears on the surface. That he is the one who can heal her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Jesse and Niki is a New Adult Romance that will leave you breathless.&lt;br /&gt;*This book contains adult situations and explicit content. 17+*</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753320-bloodpledge" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloodpledge continues Alec and Laura’s story from Bloodgifted. Having undergone the Ritual and induction into the vampire community, Laura— the prophesised Child of Light and Darkness and last of the Ingenii—takes her place as Alec’s consort and First Lady of the Brethren. But resentment and anger grow at Alec’s privileged position as daywalker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among a powerful few, alliances are made and conspiracies formed, threatening a war that could destroy them all and endanger every human on Earth—creatures who would do anything to prevent the curse from ending. Now Alec and Laura must invoke the Pledge, an ancient ceremony that enforces Brethren loyalty to the Principate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Laura’s ex-boyfriend, Detective Inspector Matt Sommers, turns up with a threat that could expose Alec, the battle for their world and their lives begins.</description>

  <description>When times are darkest, some vampires desire more than blood …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;England, 1465. Mortal men clash in the War of the Roses for the English crown, while vampire warriors’ move undetected among their ranks, savoring the flow of blood that battlefields provide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampire prince, Severian Pearce, fears the revelation of the immortal clans to humankind should King Henry fall from power. While in pursuit of Henry’s enemies, Severian comes to the aid of Meridian Neville, a human woman he craves—and not for the scent of her blood … Meridian is torn between honoring her father’s dying wish and her unexplainable yearning for Lord Severian. But as Severian and Meridian work together to protect a relic hunted by mortals and immortals alike, the red veil descends over them. This all-consuming attraction can drive immortals to the brink of madness. Will the existence of this powerful bond between a human and a vampire be enough to unite the immortal clans or is the red veil a scourge set on destroying any chance they might have of happiness?</description>

  <description>Arianna Grace liked her boring, Midwestern, teenage life where she ignored the many unanswered questions of her childhood. Why were her parents dead? Why did she not have family? Where was she raised until she was five? When someone offers to explain it all, Arianna thinks she’s just getting answers. Instead, she is thrown into a world of night humans who drink blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Arianna's sixteenth birthday, her world is thrown upside down when she changes into a vampire. Night humans, or demons, as some call them, live in normal society. Learning all of the new rules of a world she didn’t know existed might be hard enough, but it's further complicated by two former-friends that now want to help her take her role as the successor to her grandfather. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a war going on between the night humans. Sides have been taken and lines are not crossed. Four main clans of night humans are struggling for control of the night. Divided into two sides, clans Baku and Tengu have been at war for centuries with the clans Dearg-dul and Lycan. That is, until Arianna Grace finds out the truth; she’s the bridge of peace between the two sides. But not everyone wants peace. With the night humans divided, Arianna is now a pawn in the war between them. She must choose a side—her mother’s family or her father’s—and for once in her life, decide her own fate.</description>

  <description>When female wolf shifter Taryn Warner first encounters Trey Coleman, an alpha male wolf shifter with a dangerous reputation, she’s determined to resist his charms. After all, Trey—who was only fourteen when he defeated his own father in a duel, winning the right to be alpha of his pack—can’t have anything to offer the talented healer besides trouble, or so she thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taryn finds herself drawn in by Trey’s forceful demeanor and arctic-blue eyes, and she eventually agrees to enter an uneasy alliance with him. If the two succeed in convincing their respective packs that they’ve chosen each other as mates, Trey will win valuable political allies, while Taryn will escape an odious arranged mating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are a lot of potential pitfalls to this plan—including the very real possibility that the wolf shifters, overwhelmed by their growing attraction to each other, will be unable to maintain the clear heads needed to pull off the deception.</description>

  <description>Nita Islas wants to find love. She's tired of the superficial relationships and is ready to give true romance a try. She uses the Paranormal Dating Agency and hopes they can help her where all others have failed. What she didn't expect was to find her date flat on his back in nothing more than a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ky Stone has been in love with curvy and funny Nita since they were in High School. When she moved away, she took his heart with her. Then one day Ky wakes up to find her leaning over him. He's sure he's died and gone to heaven.

  <description>As Director of the Supernatural Enforcement Bureau, powerful Vampire Ronan, thought he had seen it all...until he discovers that Dragons actually exist. Can he help the Dragon being hunted on his patch? He certainly has the means at his disposal...if they can find it first...before the dark magic-wielding Witches and their Vampire cohorts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After seeing the magnificent beast with his own eyes he can't turn from the task, even if he wanted to. Especially as his Sire, Josef, gives him a direct command to find the Dragon and keep it safe. No matter the cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With rogue Vampires and Witches on its trail, it's only a matter of time before they capture it. That's not something Ronan will allow...not on his watch! He will do whatever it takes to find and save the Dragon, using every powerful being at his disposal, including the dark and dangerous Creed.</description>

  <description>Book #2 in The MacKenzie Brothers Quartet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat Randolph is the best cat burglar in the world. But when a job goes wrong and she’s shot, it’s Doctor Thomas MacKenzie that comes to her rescue. Unfortunately, it’s a lot harder to keep secrets when you’re risking the life of someone you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas MacKenzie knows Cat is keeping secrets, but getting her to trust him with them is a slow and steady process. But time isn’t on his side. Convincing Cat to stay in Surrender, Montana is harder than he could have imagined. He just has to make sure that their lovemaking is more addictive than the adrenaline rush she craves.</description>

  <description>Riley MacKenzie is one of the world’s leading experts on Egyptian artifacts. But when Maggie Lawrence walks into his life with a priceless stolen artifact and bad guys on her trail, he has no choice but to whisk her away to the safety of Surrender, Montana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Lawrence takes one look at Riley MacKenzie and sees everything she’s ever craved and always avoided when it comes to men: Adventure. And she knows it’s only a matter of time before she falls prey to his seduction, especially since she’s trapped with him during one of the worst snowstorms Montana has seen in years. But when the enemy finds them, Maggie’s confronted with a past that could destroy her love for Riley forever.</description>

  <description>As the Apocalypse looms in the horizon, two immortal lovers recount their long lives and how they caused the End of Days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben is a half-demon who hungers for Ellie’s soul, but commits a crime against the universe when he shares his immortality with her after she is stricken with the plague. Hunted for breaking the Basic Rule, Ben, together with Ellie, must escape from the Guardian, a powerful demon enforcer who will stop at nothing to cast them both into Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Renaissance Italy to 1800’s America to the Eve of September 11, 2001 to the End of Days, the two immortal lovers struggle to stay together as they stay one step ahead of eternal damnation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A love story set during the Apocalypse, Soul Mates examines whether love, like immortality, can really last forever.</description>

  <description>City of Tears Cyndi Friberg "Ontarian Chronicles, Book Three." Commander Lyrik cet Barrel must determine if the genetically engineered, cybernetically enhanced woman is too dangerous to live. His immediate and passionate attraction to the subject of his study isn't making his assignment any easier. She might be the biggest threat Ontariese has ever faced or an invaluable ally in the conflict awaiting them. Saebin is battling for control over the neuro-stimulators and munitions implants that have changed her into a ruthless assassin. She has never known kindness and doesn't trust the virile male she encounters as she awakens from stasis. He stirs desires she doesn't understand and longings she can't ignore. He insists she's been rescued, not captured by an enemy. But Saebin has never known anything but captivity. "Note: This book was previously published elsewhere under the same title and has been re-edited for Cerridwen Press. "</description>

  <description>Spin-off of the Fallen Star Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Gemma Lucas and my life is good. Alex and I eliminated the star, along with Stephan and the Death Walkers. Finally I can relax and focus on freeing my father from the Room of Forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that’s what I thought. But things are never this easy.&lt;br /&gt;Just when I’ve put the past behind me, Lost Souls cross over into the Real World. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Alex disappears without a trace. As I desperately search for him, I discover secrets I wish I could forget—secrets Alex has been keeping for me. And I’m not sure what to do. Or who I can trust.</description>

  <description>A continuation of the "War of Gods" saga ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the single-most powerful vampire on the planet, Xander is the ultimate bored predator with too much time on his hands. He manipulates the minds of immortals for fun and bullies around the Gods, while guarding the secret source of his power, a crystal that can wipe out the planet. But beneath the surface, he’s a shrewd creature who learned the brutal lesson of why there must be a balance between good and evil. An unwilling protector of the playthings known as humans, he knows when and where to use his power – and never to let anyone close enough to betray him. It’s easy to do, since he has the power to read the minds of everyone around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for one: Jessi, an innocent looking woman with an unusual talent who shows up unexpectedly in his life. Her sudden appearance is too convenient to be coincidence or chance. Xander determines quickly that she was sent by someone, but he can’t read her mind to discover why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessi’s secret – and Xander’s – have the power to forever change the human world. Intrigued by a new sort of challenge, Xander won’t know how much danger he’s in, until he’s placed his fate in the hands of a woman whose betrayal will cost either his heart or his life.</description>

  <description>Will Caylee’s salvation come from the solitude of the cold, dark grave or from the the sinful delights of surrendering her body and soul to the seduction of a wickedly sexy, dark and dangerous powerful immortal?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the beginning of time, Haden’s kind has to stop the deadliest forces of darkness from destroying mankind. He has never feared defeat until now. He would sacrifice anyting, even his life to protect Caylee. But despite possessing the dragon’s fierce nature and power, there’s little hope he’ll save her from a lust-crazed vampire that a rogue demon is aiding. Instead of completing the ancient ritual that’ll give his eternal breath to her and bind their souls together for eternity, will Haden be forced to kill Caylee to prevent her from suffering a never-ending thirst for blood?</description>

  <description>Broke, nerdy, and self-confessed wimp Misty Wall leads a ho-hum life as a Grammar Nazi intern, which of course earns her feelings of hate-at-first-sight from her colleagues at Ze Morgue, a.ka. Moretti Inc.'s Administration Department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misty has always wished for something exciting to spice up her boring-with-a-capital-B existence, but she never thought it would come in the form of a gorgeous six-foot-plus billionaire. The world knows him as Domenico Moretti, the ruthless, cunning, and aloof CEO of Moretti, Inc, a.k.a. her boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gifts of (mis)fortune come in threes, they say, and it’s certainly the case with Misty, whose life is turned upside-down by Domenico Moretti’s three shocking revelations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, he’s a werewolf (who’s also a prince).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, he wants her in his bed – him, the guy who actually had to file a TRO against an obsessive supermodel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And three, he has a proposition she never – and she means never – ever sees coming.</description>

  <description>SOMETHING WICKED (Book #4 in the Vampire’s Witch Saga) was inspired by actual events and their resulting, recurring nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyla Jane Judge has committed herself to her immortal life and her soon-to-be-immortal lover, but her past continues to haunt her.&lt;br /&gt;If they were meant to be, why is she still drawn to a lover from her previous life? And he to her? What did she die for if not to start anew? Might it really be her fate to spend eternity with him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complicating matters, her dearest friend’s life hangs in the balance of this uncertainty, and Skyla turns to a trio of witches for help. Through their mastery of sorcery, they guide the hand of fate and allow Skyla’s restless soul room to explore and evolve. Of course, with that door open, the unexpected just might walk through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In SOMETHING WICKED, Skyla struggles to be true to those closest to her. But can she be true to herself at the same time? Or will fate force her to make a heartbreaking choice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOMETHING WICKED is Book #4 of The Vampire’s Witch Saga, following Book #1 (THE DEN), Book #2 (IN THE BLOOD), and Book #3 (THE SEVENTH DAY). Book #5 in the series is forthcoming soon.</description>

  <description>When the one thing you live for is taken from you, do you let it go or do you fall?&lt;br /&gt;Jade, like any other student at Brushwood High, awaits the start of the school year with a certain measure of dread. Worse, she is being threatened by a voice that only she can hear—a voice that lurks at the edges of her awareness, haunting her and warning her of something unknown. She has always been able to count on her two best friends, Claire and Nate, but can she confide in them now? About this? Would they even believe her?&lt;br /&gt;Life takes a turn for the better when she meets Avan, a darkly handsome new student who, somehow, seems to drown out the voice and make her feel at ease.&lt;br /&gt;But Jade soon comes to realize that good things don’t last forever. When everything spirals out of control, she is shattered by something she never saw coming. Dazed and despairing, she must now overcome tragedy and embrace her true existence and a new but dangerous love. Will she be able to save herself and those she loves, before it’s too late? Or will she let the surrounding darkness consume her?</description>

  <description>Welcome to Charlotte’s world of unusual powers, wonderful friendship, new love and shocking betrayal . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Rollins is an elemental, but she doesn't know it yet. Now, with the help of her old friend Cale and her new friend Keller, she will fight against an evil whose only goal is to consume her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Kobo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no such thing as a mage. There is certainly no such thing as a vampire, pixie, werewolf, or fallen angel. And they certainly do not all attend a college together called Paranormal Public University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minute Charlotte Rollins is a normal girl about to go to a normal college. She is at once excited and nervous, getting ready to start this new phase in her life. The next minute she is a freshman not at a normal college, but at Paranormal Public University, a school where paranormals of all kinds must co-exist. Charlotte must learn magic, that is, if she could actually do magic, which unlike every other mage at Public she can’t seem to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her transition to this new and wonderful world is difficult. On top of trying to learn magic, make new friends, and confront forbidden love, the archenemy of the paranormals, the demons, are getting stronger. They are looking for something. It turns out that Charlotte might just hold the key to finding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Charlotte get a handle on her powers in time to save the school she loves? Can she fulfill a destiny the paranormals scarcely dared to hope for? Or will she be too late?</description>
