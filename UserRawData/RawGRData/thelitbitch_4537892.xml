  <description>Nestled in the mountain shadows of Alabama lies the little town of Wicklow. It is here that Anna Kate has returned to bury her beloved Granny Zee, owner of the Blackbird Café.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a quick trip to close the café and settle her grandmother’s estate, but despite her best intentions to avoid forming ties or even getting to know her father’s side of the family, Anna Kate finds herself inexplicably drawn to the quirky Southern town her mother ran away from so many years ago, and the mysterious blackbird pie everybody can’t stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the truth about her past slowly becomes clear, Anna Kate will need to decide if this lone blackbird will finally be able to take her broken wings and fly.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and “one of the great storytellers of our time” (&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Book Review&lt;/i&gt;) turns from the glamour of the royal courts to tell the story of an ordinary woman, Alinor, who cannot bear to conform to the life that lies before her.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midsummer’s Eve, 1648, England is in the grip of a civil war between renegade king and rebellious parliament. The struggle reaches every corner of the kingdom, even the remote tidelands —the marshy landscape of the south coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alinor, a descendant of wisewomen, trapped in poverty and superstition, waits in the graveyard under the full moon for a ghost who will declare her free from her abusive husband. Instead, she meets James, a young man on the run, and shows him the secret ways across the treacherous marsh, not knowing that she is leading disaster into the heart of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspected of possessing dark secrets in superstitious times, Alinor’s ambition and determination mark her out from her neighbors. This is the time of witch mania, and Alinor, a woman without a husband, skilled with herbs, suddenly enriched, arouses envy in her rivals and fear among the villagers, who are ready to take lethal action into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is dangerous for a woman to be different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;(Runtime: 15 hours, 29 minutes)&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A cold case adds an extra chill to the holiday season as bestselling author Anne Perry whisks readers to an English country house for a Christmas of secrets, soul-searching, and forgiveness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As beautiful as it may be, their friends' country home is not where Lady Vespasia wishes to spend Christmas with her new husband, Victor Narraway. She'd rather pass a relaxing holiday at home with him--especially because Victor, former head of the London Special Branch, seems to be hiding some undercover dealings with the other guests who have gathered in the spacious home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tensions grow among the couples, the young and beautiful Iris Watson-Watt becomes the center of several men's focus. Unbeknownst to Vespasia, Iris carries a message for Victor that may help unmask a British traitor. As Victor plots his moves, he is reminded of a similar case from twenty years before, when a young Frenchwoman also carried a clandestine message--one that resulted in her murder, still unsolved to this day. Victor has always been tormented by his failure to protect her--and now, with all eyes on Iris, Victor must act fast before history repeats itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the joy of Christmas at risk of being forgotten and Vespasia feeling alone on this holiday meant to be shared with loved ones, Victor must ultimately learn to forgive himself.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Amateur sleuth Sloan Krause delves into the murderous political world in another delightful mystery from popular cozy writer Ellie Alexander. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the dead season in Leavenworth, Washington. The throngs of Oktoberfest crowds have headed home, and the charming Bavarian streets are quiet and calm—momentarily. Villagers use the reprieve to drink in the crisp fall mountain air and prepare for the upcoming winter light festival. Soon the German-inspired shops and restaurants will be aglow with thousands of twinkling lights. Visitors will return to the northern Cascades to drink warm mulled cider and peruse the holiday markets. Brewer, Sloan Krause and her partner in crime Garrett Strong are using the slowdown to stock up on a new line of their signature craft beers at Nitro. They’re experimenting with a hoppy holiday pine and a chocolate hazelnut stout. The small brewery is alive with delicious scents and bubbling batches of brew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sloan is in her element. She loves the creativity and lowkey atmosphere at Nitro. Only that is soon threatened by the incumbent city councilmember Kristopher Cooper. Kristopher is running for re-election on a platform of making Leavenworth dry. Everyone in beertopia is fuming. Leavenworth’s economy relies on keeping the kegs flowing. Kristopher wants to banish beer, a policy that might just bankrupt the entire village. However, Kristopher turns up dead days before election night. Sloan quickly realizes that his murder isn’t the work of a stranger. Friends, family, and every other business owner had a motive to kill him, including none other than April Ablin, Leavenworth’s self-described ambassador of all things German. Sloan finds herself defending April and trying to sleuth out a killer amongst a group of familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Can there be any greater challenge to London’s Ambitious Mamas than an unmarried duke?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers, April 1813&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all accounts, &lt;b&gt;Simon Basset&lt;/b&gt; is on the verge of proposing to his best friend’s sister, the lovely—and almost-on-the-shelf—&lt;b&gt;Daphne Bridgerton&lt;/b&gt;. But the two of them know the truth—it’s all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it’s hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it’s his devilish smile, certainly it’s the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her… but somehow Daphne is falling for the dashing duke… for real! And now she must do the impossible and convince the handsome rogue that their clever little scheme deserves a slight alteration, and that nothing makes quite as much sense as falling in love…</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Kristy Cambron concludes the Lost Castle novels with this sweeping tale of art and secrets long buried in England.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be a one-week job: survey an art find, collect a hefty fee, and use that to settle historian Kiera Foley’s life back into balance. But from the moment she sets foot in the East Suffolk countryside, the mysteries surrounding the old English manor and the enigmatic art thief who’s employed her stir more questions than answers. Then, Kiera finds the existence of a portrait captivating enough to upend all of her expectations. This one could be a twin—a painting so close in composition to a known masterpiece, it may be rendered priceless if it truly captured the likeness of a young Queen named Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in three time periods—the rapid change of Victorian England, the tumultuous skies over England’s eastern shores in WWII, and modern day—&lt;em&gt;The Painted Castle&lt;/em&gt; unfolds a legacy of faith, family, and stories that are generations in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;The latest installment in the Bakeshop Mysteries: Christmas comes to Ashland, OR—but all Jules wants is to catcher a killer. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torte, Ashland’s favorite bakeshop is decking the halls and brewing up cups of holiday cheer. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is dark for the season, but spirits are high as twinkle lights illuminate Main Street and snow falls softly on rooftops. Torte is bustling with activity. Jules and her team are rolling out dozens of Christmas tree cutouts and dusting them with sparkling green sugar. Helen’s signature Antoinettes, a delectable almond cookie filled with raspberry preserves and slathered with chocolate buttercream, are an instant hit. As are Andy’s peppermint bark mochas and eggnog shooters. While carolers serenade shoppers in the plaza, Jules packages up festive boxes of holiday sweets. She feels a bit like Santa Claus as she delivers glistening Christmas stolens, dainty tea cakes, and mincemeat pies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To cap off the merry season, Jules and Helen host their annual staff party at the historic Winchester Inn’s Dickens Feast. The six-course dinner is a beloved tradition, complete with Yorkshire pudding and a Christmas goose. Santa, Mrs. Claus, and even a cheerless Ebenezer Scrooge delight dinner guests with jokes, friendly banter, and surprise gifts. As snow piles up outside the hot buttered rum and mulled wine keep everyone toasty inside. However, just as the dessert course is about to be served the power goes out. When the glow of warm light returns, the merriment evaporates. One of the guests is sprawled out in front of the twenty-foot Christmas tree. Suddenly Jules finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation. Her only wish this Christmas is to catch a killer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Maine, 1846. Gideon Stone is desperate to escape the ghosts that haunt him in Massachusetts after his wife's death, so he moves to Pale Harbor, Maine, where there is a vacancy for a new minister. Gideon and his late wife had always dreamed of building their own church, and Pale Harbor is the perfect opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not all is as it seems in the sleepy town of Pale Harbor. Strange, unsettling things have been happening, and the townspeople know that only one person can be responsible: Sophronia Carver, a widow who lives with a spinster maid in the decaying Castle Carver on the edge of town. Sophronia is a recluse, rumored to be a witch who killed her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gideon meets her, he knows the charming, beautiful woman cannot be guilty of anything. Together, Gideon and Sophronia realize that the mysterious events have one thing in common: they all contain an element from the wildly popular stories of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe. And when the events escalate to murder, Gideon and Sophronia must find the real killer, before it's too late for them both.</description>

  <description>In this follow-up to The Tattooist of Auschwitz, the author tells the story, based on a true one, of a woman who survives Auschwitz, only to find herself locked away again. Cilka Klein is 18 years old when Auschwitz-Birkenau is liberated by Soviet soldiers. But Cilka is one of the many women who is sentenced to a labor camp on charges of having helped the Nazis--with no consideration of the circumstances Cilka and women like her found themselves in as they struggled to survive. Once at the Vorkuta gulag in Sibera, where she is to serve her 15-year sentence, Cilka uses her wits, charm, and beauty to survive.</description>

  <description>One of Publishers Weekly's Most Anticipated Fall Releases &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stunning debut for author Evie Dunmore and her Oxford suffragists in which a fiercely independent vicar's daughter takes on a powerful duke in a fiery love story that threatens to upend the British social order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;England, 1879. Annabelle Archer, the brilliant but destitute daughter of a country vicar, has earned herself a place among the first cohort of female students at the renowned University of Oxford. In return for her scholarship, she must support the rising women's suffrage movement. Her charge: recruit men of influence to champion their cause. Her target: Sebastian Devereux, the cold and calculating Duke of Montgomery who steers Britain's politics at the Queen's command. Her challenge: not to give in to the powerful attraction she can't deny for the man who opposes everything she stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian is appalled to find a suffragist squad has infiltrated his ducal home, but the real threat is his impossible feelings for green-eyed beauty Annabelle. He is looking for a wife of equal standing to secure the legacy he has worked so hard to rebuild, not an outspoken commoner who could never be his duchess. But he wouldn't be the greatest strategist of the Kingdom if he couldn't claim this alluring bluestocking without the promise of a ring...or could he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Locked in a battle with rising passion and a will matching her own, Annabelle will learn just what it takes to topple a duke....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Charlotte Holmes, Lady Sherlock, is back solving new cases in the Victorian-set mystery series from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Hollow of Fear&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As "Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective," Charlotte Holmes has solved murders and found missing individuals. But she has never stolen a priceless artwork—or rather, made away with the secrets hidden behind a much-coveted canvas.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But Mrs. Watson is desperate to help her old friend recover those secrets and Charlotte finds herself involved in a fever-paced scheme to infiltrate a glamorous Yuletide ball where the painting is one handshake away from being sold and the secrets a bare breath from exposure.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Her dear friend Lord Ingram, her sister Livia, Livia's admirer Stephen Marbleton—everyone pitches in to help and everyone has a grand time. But nothing about this adventure is what it seems and disaster is biding time on the grounds of a glittering French chateau, waiting only for Charlotte to make a single mistake...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second novel in a bewitching series "brimming with charm and charisma" that will make "fans of &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt; rejoice!" (&lt;i&gt;Woman's World Magazine&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Paula Brackston’s &lt;i&gt;The Little Shop of Found Things&lt;/i&gt; was called “a page-turner that will no doubt leave readers eager for future series installments” (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;). Now, Brackston returns to the Found Things series with its sequel, &lt;i&gt;Secrets of the Chocolate House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her adventures in the seventeenth century, Xanthe does her best to settle back into the rhythm of life in Marlborough. She tells herself she must forget about Samuel and leave him in the past where he belongs. With the help of her new friends, she does her best to move on, focusing instead on the success of her and Flora’s antique shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are still things waiting to be found, still injustices needing to be put right, still voices whispering to Xanthe from long ago about secrets wanting to be shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking for new stock for the shop, Xanthe hears the song of a copper chocolate pot. Soon after, she has an upsetting vision of Samuel in great danger, compelling her to make another journey to the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time she'll meet her most dangerous adversary. This time her ability to travel to the past will be tested. This time she will discover her true destiny. Will that destiny allow her to return home? And will she be able to save Samuel when his own fate seems to be sealed?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set in Depression-era America, a breathtaking story of five extraordinary women and their remarkable journey through the mountains of Kentucky and beyond, from the author of &lt;i&gt;Me Before You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader, and soon Alice's greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who's never asked a man's permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens to them--and to the men they love--becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, &lt;i&gt;The Giver of Stars&lt;/i&gt; is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic--a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming Christmas story filled with the magic and miracles of the holiday season by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling author, Nancy Naigle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, Liz Westmoreland dreamed of taking over her grandparents inn located in the small mountain town of Antler Creek only for it to be sold before she ever got the chance. While browsing the internet, she stumbles upon a listing for what looks to be the picturesque inn and it’s set to go to auction. Liz places a bid, and by a miracle, wins the auction. But when she gets there she finds the property in significant disrepair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Matt Hardy narrowly lost the inn and property that butted his land, he just hoped it wasn't another city slicker coming to make matters worse after the previous owners gutted the place for an art gallery. But the minute he recognized the sweet, freckle-faced girl from his childhood and heard her plans to reopen the inn, he jumps at the chance to help his childhood crush restore a place where he made so many fond memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While working on repairs, Liz and Matt discover her grandmother’s collection of angels in one of the cabins. When the angels start mysteriously showing up all over the inn, she begins to look at them as reassurance—that restoring the inn is what she's meant to do. But when an accident leaves Liz feeling like she made a mistake, will Matt—and the residents of Antler Creek—be able to show Liz that she's found a home? And possibly true love as well?</description>

  <description>Jack Torrance’s new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he’ll have plenty of time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote . . . and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the spirit of his wildly popular &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; pieces and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Love Poems for Married People&lt;/i&gt;, Thurber-prize winner John Kenney presents a hilarious new collection of poetry for people with children.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the same brilliant wit and hilarious realism that made &lt;i&gt;Love Poems for Married People&lt;/i&gt; such a hit, John Kenney is back with a brand new collection of poems, this time taking on the greatest "joy" in life: children. Kenney covers it all, from newborns, toddlers, and sleep deprivation, to the terrible twos, terrible tweens, and terrible teens. A parent's love is unconditional, but sometimes that button can't help but be pushed. Between back to school shopping, summer vacations that never end, the awkwardness of puberty, the inevitable post-college moving back in, and more, a parent's job is never done, whether they like it or not.</description>

  <description>10 hours, 27 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Came Home&lt;/em&gt; comes a historical novel inspired by true events, and the extraordinary female lighthouse keepers of the past two hundred years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;They call me a heroine, but I am not deserving of such accolades. I am just an ordinary young woman who did her duty.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1838: Northumberland, England. Longstone Lighthouse on the Farne Islands has been Grace Darling’s home for all of her twenty-two years. When she and her father rescue shipwreck survivors in a furious storm, Grace becomes celebrated throughout England, the subject of poems, ballads, and plays. But far more precious than her unsought fame is the friendship that develops between Grace and a visiting artist. Just as George Emmerson captures Grace with his brushes, she in turn captures his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1938: Newport, Rhode Island. Nineteen-years-old and pregnant, Matilda Emmerson has been sent away from Ireland in disgrace. She is to stay with Harriet, a reclusive relative and assistant lighthouse keeper, until her baby is born. A discarded, half-finished portrait opens a window into Matilda’s family history. As a deadly hurricane approaches, two women, living a century apart, will be linked forever by their instinctive acts of courage and love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sweet holiday love story about the magic of synchronicity and fate set at a quaint Vermont inn during the week after Christmas. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma can't believe her luck when she finds an open pawn shop on Christmas Eve in Manhattan. She's there to sell the beautiful bracelet her ex-boyfriend gave her when a familiar looking watch catches her eye. It's the same engraved watch she gave her college boyfriend, Fletcher, years ago. On a whim, she trades for the watch and wonders at the timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practical Emma thinks it's just a coincidence, but her best friend Bronwyn believes it's the magic of synchronicity that caused Emma to find the watch. Fletcher was the one that got away, and somehow Emma never quite moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bronwyn finds out that Fletcher is in snowy Vermont at a romantic inn for the week, she can't help but give synchronicity a push. She signs Emma up to help the inn keeper as the children's activity coordinator. Emma agrees that a week filled with quaint shops and maple syrup would do her good... and maybe Fate really does have a Christmas gift in store for her. That is until she sees Fletcher with his daughter and fianc�e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, the fairytale trip seems doomed to fail... much like the innkeeper's dwindling cashflow. It will take a miracle to save her heart and the inn. And that just might be what Fate has in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHRISTMAS IN VERMONT is a delightful and charming love story about the magic of second chances during the most festive time of year.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;From the two-time Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter behind the groundbreaking album &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Exile in Guyville&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; comes a haunting memoir in stories in the tradition of Patti Smith's &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;M Train&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Liz Phair was just starting out in the Wicker Park, Chicago, music scene in the early 1990s, she mostly encountered a**holes--mostly men, who didn't respect her and were determined not to see her fail, exactly, because they didn't care enough about her to wish failure on her--they just wanted her to get out of their space, to &lt;i&gt;disappear&lt;/i&gt;. "Girly Sound" was the name of the cassettes she used to pass around in those days, and in 1993 those songs became the landmark album &lt;i&gt;Exile in Guyville&lt;/i&gt;, which turned Phair, at twenty-five, into a foul-mouthed feminist icon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, like a Gen X Patti Smith, Liz Phair tells the story of her life and career in a memoir about the moments that have haunted her most. Horror is in the eye of the beholder. For Phair, horror is what stays with you--the often unrecognized, universal experiences of daily pain, shame, and fear that make up our common humanity. In Phair's case it means the dangers of falling for "the perfect guy," and the disaster that awaits her; the memory of a stranger passed out on a bathroom floor amid a crowd of girls, forcing her to consider our responsibilities to one another, and the gnawing regret of being a bystander; and the profound sense of emptiness she experienced on the set of her first celebrity photoshoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Horror Stories &lt;/i&gt;reads like the confessions of a friend, a book that gathers up all of our isolated shames, bringing us together in our shared imperfection, our uncertainty and our cowardice, smashing the stigma of not being in control. But most importantly, &lt;i&gt;Horror Stories&lt;/i&gt; is a memoir that asks questions of how we feel about the things that have happened to us, how we cope with regret and culpability, and how we break the spell of those things, leeching them of their power over us. This memoir is an immersive experience, taking readers inside the most intimate moments of Phair's life. Her fearless prose, wit, and uncompromising honesty transform those deeply personal moments into tales about each and every one of us--that will appeal to both the serious fan and the serious reader.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Told from the present-day perspective of a British antiques dealer who specializes in helping families sell the contents of estates, the acclaimed author of the Governess series transports us to World War II London through forgotten treasures in this entrancing, heartbreaking novel, reminiscent of Martha Hall Kelly's &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cara Hargraves, burying herself in the past is easier than confronting the present, which is why working with a gruff but brilliant antiques dealer is the perfect salvation. While clearing out an estate, she pries open an old tin that holds the relics of a lost relationship; among the treasures, a World War II-era diary and a photograph of a young woman in uniform--the same one Cara's grandmother wore during the war. Eager to find the author of the hauntingly beautiful, unfinished diary, Cara embarks on a journey to untangle the affair, and just maybe uncover her grandmother's deeply guarded secrets, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1941, nineteen-year-old Louise Keene's life had been decided for her--she'll wait at home in her Cornish village until the wealthy son of her mother's best friend returns from war to ask for her hand. But when Louise unexpectedly meets Flight Lieutenant Paul Bolton, a dashing RAF pilot stationed at a local base, everything changes. But their whirlwind romance is cut short when Paul's unit is deployed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for a larger life, Louise defies her parents and joins the women's branch of the British Army in the anti-aircraft gun unit. As bombs fall on London, she relishes in her growing friendships with the gunner girls and knowing she and Paul will be together when the war is over. But when a bundle of her letters to Paul are returned unanswered, she learns that wartime romance can have a much darker side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; by Kristin Hannah, these remarkable women reveal the power within, no matter the generation, as they search for love, freedom, and the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Hearts are lighter and wishes burn a little brighter at Christmas…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Hamilton has been lost. Trapped in a tangle of postpartum depression and grief after the death of her beloved parents, she couldn’t quite see the way back to her husband and their two beautiful kids…until a car accident stole away her memories and changed her life. And when she finally remembered the sound of little Cassie’s laugh, the baby powder smell of Bridger and the feel of her husband’s hand in hers, Elizabeth worried that they’d moved on without her. That she’d missed too much. That perhaps she wasn’t the right mother for her kids or wife for Luke, no matter how much she loved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, seven years later, Luke finds her in a nearby town and brings Elizabeth back home to the family she loves, just in time for Christmas. And being reunited with Luke and her children is better than anything Elizabeth could have imagined. As they all trim the tree and bake cookies, making new holiday memories, Elizabeth and Luke are drawn ever closer. Can the hurt of the past seven years be healed over the course of one Christmas season and bring the Hamiltons the gift of a new beginning?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Six bestselling and award-winning authors bring to life a breathtaking epic novel illuminating the hopes, desires, and destinies of princesses and peasants, harlots and wives, fanatics and philosophers—six unforgettable women whose paths cross during one of the most tumultuous and transformative events in history: the French Revolution.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ribbons of Scarlet &lt;i&gt;is a timely story of the power of women to start a revolution—and change the world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late eighteenth-century France, women do not have a place in politics. But as the tide of revolution rises, women from gilded salons to the streets of Paris decide otherwise—upending a world order that has long oppressed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue-blooded Sophie de Grouchy believes in democracy, education, and equal rights for women, and marries the only man in Paris who agrees. Emboldened to fight the injustices of King Louis XVI, Sophie aims to prove that an educated populace can govern itself--but one of her students, fruit-seller Louise Audu, is hungrier for bread and vengeance than learning. When the Bastille falls and Louise leads a women’s march to Versailles, the monarchy is forced to bend, but not without a fight. The king’s pious sister Princess Elisabeth takes a stand to defend her brother, spirit her family to safety, and restore the old order, even at the risk of her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when fanatics use the newspapers to twist the revolution’s ideals into a new tyranny, even the women who toppled the monarchy are threatened by the guillotine. Putting her faith in the pen, brilliant political wife Manon Roland tries to write a way out of France’s blood-soaked Reign of Terror while pike-bearing Pauline Leon and steely Charlotte Corday embrace violence as the only way to save the nation. With justice corrupted by revenge, all the women must make impossible choices to survive--unless unlikely heroine and courtesan’s daughter Emilie de Sainte-Amaranthe can sway the man who controls France’s fate: the fearsome Robespierre.</description>

  <description>It should have been just a mid-life fling. A guilty indiscretion that Neve Connolly could have weathered. An escape from twenty years of routine marriage to her overworked husband, and from her increasingly distant children. But when Neve pays a morning-after visit to her lover, Saul, and finds him brutally murdered, their pied-à-terre still heady with her perfume, all the lies she has so painstakingly stitched together threaten to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scrubbing clean every trace of her existence from Saul’s life—and death—Neve believes she can return to normal, shaken but intact. But she can’t get out of her head the one tormenting question: what was she forgetting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An investigation into the slaying could provide the answer. It’s brought Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Hitching, and Neve’s worst fears, to her door. But with every new lie, every new misdirection to save herself, Neve descends further into the darkness of her betrayal—and into more danger than she ever imagined. Because Hitching isn’t the only one watching Neve. So is a determined killer who’s about to make the next terrifying move in a deadly affair….</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A tumultuous and often hilarious first novel about one year of insanity at the Ivy-like Devon University, a blissful bubble of elite students and the adults at their mercy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eph Russell is an English professor up for tenure. He may look and sound privileged, but Eph is right out of gun-rack, Bible-thumping rural Alabama. His beloved Devon, though, has become a place of warring tribes, and there are landmines waiting for Eph that he is unequipped to see. The cultural rules are changing fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lulu Harris is an entitled freshman—er, firstyear—from Manhattan. Her singular ambition is to be a prominent socialite – an “It Girl.” While most would kill for a place at Devon, to her college is a dreary impediment. She is pleasantly surprised to find some people she can tolerate in the Fellingham Society, a group of self-professed campus monarchists. When things become socially difficult, Lulu is forced to re-channel her ambition in a most unexpected way – as a militant feminist. In the process, she and Eph will find their fates at odds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the mix is Red Wheeler, who is in his seventh year at Devon, and is carefully managing his credits to stay longer. As the alpha dog atop Devon’s progressive hierarchy, Red is the most “woke” guy on campus. But when his position is threatened, he must take measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All paths collide in a riotous climax. Campusland is a timely and gleeful skewering of the modern American campus and its tribal culture.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Spanning several decades in seventeenth century Great Britain and America, this &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;“impressive piece of work, rich in historical detail and human insight” (&lt;i&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;) is an unforgettable love story exploring the power of nature versus man and man versus woman. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am an engineer and a measured man of the world. I prefer to weigh everything in the balance, to calculate and to plan. Yet my own heart is going faster than I can now count.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 1649, Jan Brunt arrives in Great Britain from the Netherlands to work on draining and developing an expanse of marshy wetlands known as the Great Level. It is here in this wild country that he meets Eliza, a local woman whose love overturns his ordered vision. Determined to help her strive beyond her situation, Jan is heedless of her devotion to her home and way of life. When she uses the education Jan has given her to sabotage his work, Eliza is brutally punished, and Jan flees to the New World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the American colonies, profiteers on Manatus Eyland are hungry for viable land to develop, and Jan’s skills as an engineer are highly prized. His prosperous new life is rattled, however, on a spring morning when a boy delivers a note that prompts him to remember the Great Level, and confront all that was lost there. Eliza has made it to the New World and is once again using the education Jan gave her to bend the landscape—this time to find her own place of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A “story of passion, possession, and a painful education in love” (Sarah Dunant, author of &lt;i&gt;In the Name of the Family&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Call Upon the Water &lt;/i&gt;is an adventure, an unusual and intelligent love story, and a powerful comment on the relationship between humans and the environment. “Richly involving…rousing and heroic” (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;), this unforgettable historical novel is perfect for fans of Hilary Mantel, Geraldine Brooks, and Philippa Gregory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *Note: This book was published in the UK under the title &lt;i&gt;The Great Level.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>To save her family from financial ruin, Miss Poppy Garrison accepts an unusual proposition to participate in the New York social season in exchange for her grandmother settling a family loan that has unexpectedly come due. Ill-equipped to handle the intricacies of mingling within the New York Four Hundred, Poppy becomes embroiled in one hilarious fiasco after another, doomed to suffer a grand societal failure instead of being deemed the diamond of the first water her grandmother longs for her to become. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reginald Blackburn, second son of a duke, has been forced to travel to America to help his cousin, Charles Wynn, Earl of Lonsdale, find an American heiress to wed in order to shore up his family estate that is in desperate need of funds. Reginald himself has no interest in finding an heiress to marry, but when Poppy's grandmother asks him to give etiquette lessons to Poppy, he swiftly discovers he may be in for much more than he bargained for.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What happens when your worst fear comes true?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her only daughter has just gone away to college, and Maggie O'Farrell knows she's turning into one of those helicopter parents she used to mock. Worrying constantly, texting more than she should, even occasionally dropping by the campus "just to say hi." But Maggie can't shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen to Emma. And then, just as Maggie starts to relax, her daughter disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clues are disturbing. An empty dorm room where Emma was supposedly living. A mysterious boy described as Future Husband in her phone. Dormmates who seem more sinister than friendly. As Maggie combs over the campus looking for signs of her daughter, she learns more about Emma's life than she ever thought possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Simmons delivers another gripping novel in &lt;em&gt;Where She Went&lt;/em&gt;, an unforgettable story of letting go and the secrets that surface when the person keeping them is gone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Murder on Millionaires' Row&lt;/i&gt;, Erin Lindsey's &lt;i&gt;A Golden Grave&lt;/i&gt; follows Rose Gallagher as she tracks a killer with shocking abilities through Gilded Age Manhattan. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Gallagher always dreamed of finding adventure, so her new life as a freshly-minted Pinkerton agent ought to be everything she ever wanted. Only a few months ago, she was just another poor Irish housemaid from Five Points; now, she’s learning to shoot a gun and dance the waltz and throw a grown man over her shoulder. Better still, she’s been recruited to the special branch, an elite unit dedicated to cases of a paranormal nature, and that means spending her days alongside the dashing Thomas Wiltshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being a Pinkerton isn’t quite what Rose imagined, and not everyone welcomes her into the fold. Meanwhile, her old friends aren’t sure what to make of the new Rose, and even Thomas seems to be having second thoughts about his junior partner. So when a chilling new case arrives on Rose’s doorstep, she jumps at the chance to prove herself – only to realize that the stakes are higher than she could have imagined. Six delegates have been murdered at a local political convention, and the police have no idea who–or what–is responsible. One thing seems clear: The killer’s next target is a candidate for New York City mayor, one Theodore Roosevelt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that something supernatural is afoot, Rose and Thomas must track down the murderer before Roosevelt is taken out of the race–permanently. But this killer is unlike any they’ve faced before, and hunting him down will take them from brownstones to ballrooms to Bowery saloons. Not quite comfortable anywhere, Rose must come to terms with her own changed place in society–and the fact that some would do anything to see her gone from it entirely.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mina Scarletti returns in her most thrilling mystery yet! Perfect for fans of Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie and Antonia Hodgson… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A peaceful country retreat has become the scene of relentless terror… &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
    Sussex, 1872 
&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mina Scarletti&lt;/b&gt; is invited to ancient Hollow House to investigate reports of ghostly occurrences. &lt;br /&gt;The current occupants – newlyweds Mr Honeyacre and his wife, Kitty – have been plagued by unexplained noises and strange visions since moving into the property. &lt;br /&gt;And now most of their servants refuse to stay at the house after dark for fear of encountering the ghostly presence of ‘the woman in white’. &lt;br /&gt;A determined sceptic, Mina’s main concern is for Kitty, whose health appears to be dramatically sinking under the strain of all that is going on. &lt;br /&gt;With the help of her trusted adviser, Dr Hamid, and her lively friend, Nell, Mina must get to the heart of the mystery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Have the maids merely been frightening themselves with tales of the macabre? Is there a rational explanation for what is being reported?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Or will Mina be forced to admit to the presence of a ghost in Hollow House?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;THE GHOST OF HOLLOW HOUSE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; is the fourth cosy mystery in Linda Stratmann’s intriguing historical series, the Mina Scarletti investigations, a traditional British detective series with a feisty woman sleuth set in Victorian Brighton.</description>

  <description>England, 1919. In Anna Lee Huber’s latest mystery, former Secret Service agent Verity Kent is finding that life after wartime offers its own share of danger . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Great War may be over, but for many, there are still obstacles on the home front. Reconciling with her estranged husband makes Verity sympathetic to her friend Ada’s marital difficulties. Bourgeois-bred Ada, recently married to the Marquess of Rockham, is overwhelmed trying to navigate the ways of the aristocracy. And when Lord Rockham is discovered shot through the heart with a bullet from Ada’s revolver, Verity fears her friend has made a fatal blunder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While striving to prove Ada’s innocence, Verity is called upon for another favor. The sister of a former Secret Service colleague has been killed in what authorities believe was a home invasion gone wrong. The victim’s war work—censoring letters sent by soldiers from the front—exposed her to sensitive, disturbing material. Verity begins to suspect these two unlikely cases may be linked. But as the connections deepen, the consequences—not just for Verity, but for Britain—grow more menacing than she could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The historical adult debut novel by # 1&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Kate, &lt;i&gt; The Orphan's Song&lt;/i&gt; is a sweeping love story about family and music--and the secrets each hold--that follows the intertwined fates of two Venetian orphans. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A tangled knot of betrayal and love, lies and redemption. Marvelous." --Fiona Davis, author of &lt;i&gt;The Address&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A song brought them together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A secret will tear them apart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venice, 1736. When fate brings Violetta and Mino together on the roof of the Hospital of the Incurables, they form a connection that will change their lives forever. Both are orphans at the Incurables, dreaming of escape. But when the resident Maestro notices Violetta's voice, she is selected for the Incurables' world famous &lt;i&gt;coro&lt;/i&gt;, and must sign an oath never to sing beyond its church doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a declaration of love ends in heartbreak, Mino flees the Incurables in search of his family. Known as the "city of masks," Venice is full of secrets, and Mino is certain one will lead to his long-lost mother. Without him, the walls close in on Violetta and she begins a dangerous and forbidden nightlife, hoping her voice can secure her freedom. But neither finds what they are looking for, until a haunting memory Violetta has suppressed since childhood leads them to a shocking confrontation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant with the glamour and beauty of Venice at its zenith, &lt;i&gt;The Orphan's Song&lt;/i&gt; takes us on a breathtaking journey of passion, heartbreak, and betrayal before it crescendos to an unforgettable ending, a celebration of the enduring nature and transformative power of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors Karen White, Beatriz Williams, and Lauren Willig present a masterful collaboration—a rich, multigenerational novel of love and loss that spans half a century....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1945: When the critically wounded Captain Cooper Ravenal is brought to a private hospital on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, young Dr. Kate Schuyler is drawn into a complex mystery that connects three generations of women in her family to a single extraordinary room in a Gilded Age mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the woman in Captain Ravenel's portrait miniature who looks so much like Kate?  And why is she wearing the ruby pendant handed down to Kate by her mother?  In their pursuit of answers, they find themselves drawn into the turbulent stories of Gilded Age Olive Van Alen, driven from riches to rags, who hired out as a servant in the very house her father designed, and Jazz Age Lucy Young, who came from Brooklyn to Manhattan in pursuit of the father she had never known.  But are Kate and Cooper ready for the secrets that will be revealed in the Forgotten Room? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Forgotten Room&lt;/i&gt;, set in alternating time periods, is a sumptuous feast of a novel brought to vivid life by three brilliant storytellers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young widow restores a dilapidated mansion with the assistance of a charming, eccentric genius, only to find the house is full of dangerous secrets in this effervescent Gilded Age debut novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1875, and Alva Webster has perfected her stiff upper lip after three years of being pilloried in the presses of two continents over fleeing her abusive husband. Now his sudden death allows her to return to New York to make a fresh start, restoring Liefdehuis, a dilapidated Hyde Park mansion, and hopefully her reputation at the same time. However, fresh starts aren't as easy as they seem, as Alva discovers when stories of a haunting at Liefdehuis begin to reach her. But Alva doesn't believe in ghosts. So when the eccentric and brilliant professor, Samuel Moore, appears and informs her that he can get to the bottom of the mystery that surrounds Liefdehuis, she turns him down flat. She doesn't need any more complications in her life―especially not a handsome, convention-flouting, scandal-raising one like Sam. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, though Alva is loath to admit it, Sam, a pioneer in electric lighting and a member of the nationally-adored Moore family of scientists, is the only one who can help. Together, the two delve into the tragic secrets wreathing Alva's new home while Sam attempts to unlock Alva's history―and her heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set during the Gilded Age in New York City, &lt;i&gt;The Widow of Rose House&lt;/i&gt; is a gorgeous debut by Diana Biller, with a darkly Victorian Gothic flair and an intrepid and resilient American heroine guaranteed to delight readers.</description>

She and her brother train there to compete for places, and find themselves joining a mission while still candidates.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;She Needed a Husband...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been three years since Laura Hayes’s father died, leaving her and her invalid brother to subsist on the income from the family’s failing perfume business. But time is swiftly running out. What she needs is a husband, and fast. A noble gentleman who can rescue them all from penury. When a mysterious stranger arrives in the village, he seems a perfect candidate. But Alex Archer is no hero. In fact, he just might be the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;He Wanted a Fortune...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex has no tolerance for sentiment. He’s returned to England for one reason only: to find a wealthy wife. A country-bred heiress in Surrey seems the perfect target. But somewhere between the village railway station and the manor house his mercenary plan begins to unravel. And it’s all the fault of Laura Hayes—a lady as unsuitable as she is enchanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beaches of Margate to the lavender fields of Provence, a grudging friendship slowly blossoms into something more. But when scandal threatens, can a man who has spent his entire life playing the villain, finally become a hero? Or will the lure of easy riches once again outweigh the demands of his heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A WORLD-WEARY RAKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of unbridled debauchery, Tristan Sinclair, Viscount St. Ashton has hit proverbial rock bottom. Seeking to escape his melancholy, he takes refuge at one of Victorian society’s most notorious house parties. As the Christmas season approaches, he prepares to settle in for a month of heavy drinking…until an unexpected encounter changes his plans—and threatens his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A PRIM VICAR'S DAUGHTER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentine March is not the drab little spinster she appears to be. When her new job as a lady’s companion lands her smack in the middle of Yorkshire with England’s most infamous rake, she resolves to keep her head down and her eyes fixed firmly on her future—a future which most definitely does not include a sinfully handsome viscount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A MATCH MADE IN SCANDAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friendship is impossible. An affair out of the question. But when one reckless act binds them together, will two star-crossed souls discover there’s more to each other than meets the eye? Or will revelations from the past end their fragile romance before it begins?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Maybe you don't know your neighbors as well as you thought you did . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is a very difficult letter to write. I hope you will not hate us too much. . . My son broke into your home recently while you were out." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quiet, leafy suburb in upstate New York, a teenager has been sneaking into houses--and into the owners' computers as well--learning their secrets, and maybe sharing some of them, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is he, and what might he have uncovered? After two anonymous letters are received, whispers start to circulate, and suspicion mounts. And when a woman down the street is found murdered, the tension reaches the breaking point. Who killed her? Who knows more than they're telling? And how far will all these very nice people go to protect their own secrets? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this neighborhood, it's not just the husbands and wives who play games. Here, everyone in the family has something to hide . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; You never really know what people are capable of. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 International Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Editor’s Choice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A lush, evocative Gothic.” —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Book Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;This terrifically exciting novel will jolt, thrill, and bewitch readers.” —&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Obsession is an art.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this “sharp, scary, gorgeously evocative tale of love, art, and obsession” (Paula Hawkins, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;), a beautiful young woman aspires to be an artist, while a man’s dark obsession may destroy her world forever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1850s London, the Great Exhibition is being erected in Hyde Park and, among the crowd watching the dazzling spectacle, two people meet by happenstance. For Iris, an arrestingly attractive aspiring artist, it is a brief and forgettable moment but for Silas, a curiosity collector enchanted by all things strange and beautiful, the meeting marks a new beginning.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Iris is asked to model for Pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint. Suddenly, her world begins to expand beyond her wildest dreams—but she has no idea that evil is waiting in the shadows. Silas has only thought of one thing since that chance meeting, and his obsession is darkening by the day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A page-turning psychological thriller” (Essie Fox, author of &lt;i&gt;The Somnambulist&lt;/i&gt;) that will haunt you long after you finish it, &lt;i&gt;The Doll Factory&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Alienist&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Drood&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Historian&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;He Needed Peace…&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solicitor Tom Finchley has spent his life using his devious intellect to solve the problems of others. As for his own problems, they’re nothing that a bit of calculated vengeance can’t remedy. But that’s all over now. He’s finally ready to put the past behind him and settle down to a quiet, uncomplicated life. If only he could find an equally uncomplicated woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;She Wanted Adventure…&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former lady’s companion Jenny Holloway has just been given a modest independence. Now, all she wants is a bit of adventure. A chance to see the world and experience life far outside the restrictive limits of Victorian England. If she can discover the fate of the missing Earl of Castleton while she’s at it, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the gaslit streets of London to the lush tea gardens of colonial India, Jenny and Tom embark on an epic quest—and an equally epic romance. But even at the farthest edges of the British Empire, the past has a way of catching up with you…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Jennifer Ryan’s bold new novel, Evangeline Austen returns to her family’s sprawling Napa Valley ranch, determined to rebuild her life and expose the shocking truth about the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’s not the naïve girl she used to be… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After serving time for a crime she didn’t commit, Evangeline returns home to a cold welcome. Her mother blames her for her father’s death, and her brothers want her out of their way. When Evangeline learns she’s solely responsible for their failing ranch—putting her family’s future squarely on her shoulders—she’ll have to find a creative way to save their home before they lose it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’ll have her reckoning...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her only ally: the cop who sent her away. Chris Chambers is positive she went to prison to protect someone else. He strikes a deal: help him track down the real criminals in exchange for clearing her name. But the closer Evangeline and Chris get to exposing the truth—and to each other—the deeper Evangeline is drawn into a dangerous sting that could finally bring her justice…or put her dreams on hold permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’ll fight for the life she always wanted…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone’s lives moved on while Evangeline’s stood still. Now she has a chance to rebuild her family ranch, her life, and expose the people who put her away, so she can become the woman she was always meant to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>10 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A disturbing and shocking debut novel of psychological suspense about a recently widowed mother, her young son, and the lengths she'll go to in order to keep him safe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tess Clarke wakes up in the hospital the day after her son Jamie's eighth birthday, she's sure of these things: She's been stabbed, her son is missing, her brother-in-law and her grief counselor are involved. But no one is listening to her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her husband, Mark, died suddenly in a terrible accident a few months earlier, the only thing keeping Tess together is Jamie. As they struggle to make sense of their new life without Mark, they find joy in brief moments of normalcy like walking to school and watching television together. Life is hard without Mark, but Tess has Jamie, and that's what matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there in the hospital, confused and surrounded by people who won't listen, Tess’s world falls apart. To save her son, she must piece together what happened between Mark's death and Jamie's birthday, but the truth might just be too much for her to bear.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;England, 1859. When ex-army captain Justin Thornhill places an advertisement for a wife, the mysterious lady who arrives on his doorstep isn't quite what he was expecting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She Wanted Sanctuary…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helena Reynolds will do anything to escape her life in London, even if that means traveling to a remote cliffside estate on the North Devon coast and marrying a complete stranger. But Greyfriar’s Abbey isn't the sort of refuge she imagined. And ex-army captain Justin Thornhill—though he may be tall, dark, and devastatingly handsome—is anything but a romantic hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Needed Redemption…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin has spent the last two decades making his fortune, settling scores, and suffering a prolonged period of torture in an Indian prison. Now, he needs someone to smooth the way for him with the villagers. Someone to manage his household—and warm his bed on occasion. What he needs, in short, is a wife and a matrimonial advertisement seems the perfect way to acquire one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their marriage was meant to be a business arrangement and nothing more. A dispassionate union free from the entanglements of love and affection. But when Helena’s past threatens, will Justin’s burgeoning feelings for his new bride compel him to come to her rescue? Or will dark secrets of his own force him to let her go?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In 1920s New York, the price of a woman’s independence can be exorbitant—even fatal.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1924 Manhattan, women’s suffrage is old news. For sophisticated booklover Julia Kydd, life’s too short for politics. With her cropped hair and penchant for independent living, Julia wants only to launch her own new private press. But as a woman, Julia must fight for what’s hers—including the inheritance her estranged half brother, Philip, has challenged, putting her aspirations in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her friend’s sister, Naomi Rankin, dies suddenly of an apparent suicide, Julia is shocked at the wealthy family’s indifference toward the ardent suffragist’s death. Naomi chose poverty and hardship over a submissive marriage and a husband’s control of her money. Now, her death suggests the struggle was more than she could bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia, however, is skeptical. Doubtful of her suspicions, Philip proposes a glib wager: if Julia can prove Naomi was in fact murdered, he’ll drop his claims to her wealth. Julia soon discovers Naomi’s life was as turbulent and enigmatic as her death. And as she gets closer to the truth, Julia sees there’s much more at stake than her inheritance…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars<br /><br />I decided to read this book based purely on the cover art. The cover art suggests a fun historical mystery with a quirky and fashionable lady detective. Plus it was the first in a new series and I couldn’t help but get excited to be one of the first people to read Julia Kydd!...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A short, irresistible, and bittersweet coming-of-age story in the vein of "Stranger Things" and "Stand by Me" about a group of misfit kids who spend an unforgettable summer investigating local ghost stories and urban legends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in 1980s Niagara Falls--a seedy but magical, slightly haunted place--Jake Baker spends most of his time with his uncle Calvin, a kind but eccentric enthusiast of occult artifacts and conspiracy theories. The summer Jake turns twelve, he befriends a pair of siblings new to town, and so Calvin decides to initiate them all into the "Saturday Night Ghost Club." But as the summer goes on, what begins as a seemingly lighthearted project may ultimately uncover more than any of its members had imagined. With the alternating warmth and sadness of the best coming-of-age stories, &lt;i&gt;The Saturday Night Ghost Club&lt;/i&gt; examines the haunting mutability of memory and storytelling, as well as the experiences that form the people we become.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There's nothing like being told that in three months you'll be dead to make you think about what you really want in life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Cole has just been told that she has a terminal blood disorder and has just three months to live--ninety days to say goodbye to friends and family, and to put her affairs in order. Ninety days to come to terms with a diagnosis that is unfair, unexpected, and completely unpronounceable. Focusing on the positives (she won't have to go on in a world without Bowie or Maya Angelou; she won't get Alzheimer's or Parkinson's like her parents, or have teeth that flop out at the mere mention of the word apple), Jennifer realizes she only has one real regret: the relationships she's lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than running off to complete a frantic bucket list, Jennifer chooses to stay put and write a letter to the three most significant people in her life, to say the things she wished she'd said before but never dared: her overbearing, selfish sister, her jelly-spined, cheating ex-husband, and her charming, unreliable ex-boyfriend--and finally tell them the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Jennifer feels cleansed by her catharsis. Liberated, even. Her ex-boyfriend rushes to her side and she even starts to build bridges with her sister Isabelle (that is, once Isabelle's confirmed that Jennifer's condition isn't genetic). But once you start telling the truth, it's hard to stop. And as Jennifer soon discovers, the truth isn't always as straightforward as it seems, and death has a way of surprising you....</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An Uncommon Beauty...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden away in rural Devonshire, Phyllida Satterthwaite has always been considered more odd than beautiful. But in London, her oddity has made her a sensation. Far worse, it's caught the eye of the sinister Duke of Moreland--a notorious art collector obsessed with acquiring one-of-a-kind treasures. To escape the duke's clutches, she's going to need a little help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Unlikely Hero...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Arthur Heywood's days of heroism are long past. Grievously injured in the Peninsular War, he can no longer walk unaided, let alone shoot a pistol. What use can he possibly be to a damsel in distress? He has nothing left to offer except his good name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a marriage of convenience save Philly from the vengeful duke? Or will life with Arthur put her--and her heart--in more danger than ever?</description>

  <description>There is a stranger outside Caroline's house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her spectacular new beach house, built for hosting expensive parties and vacationing with the family she thought she'd have. But her husband is lying to her and everything in her life is upside down, so when the stranger, Aiden, shows up as a bartender at the same party where Caroline and her husband have a very public fight, it doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her marriage collapses around her and the lavish lifestyle she's built for herself starts to crumble, Caroline turns to Aiden for comfort...and revenge. After a brief and desperate fling that means nothing to Caroline and everything to him, Aiden's obsession with Caroline, her family, and her house grows more and more disturbing. And when Caroline's husband goes missing, her life descends into a nightmare that leaves her accused of her own husband's murder.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Set during Reconstruction-era New Orleans, and with an extraordinary and unforgettable heroine at its heart, &lt;/i&gt;The Undertaker's Assistant&lt;i&gt; is a powerful story of human resilience--and of the unlikely bonds that hold fast even in our darkest moments.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The dead can't hurt you. Only the living can." &lt;/i&gt;Effie Jones, a former slave who escaped to the Union side as a child, knows the truth of her words. Taken in by an army surgeon and his wife during the War, she learned to read and write, to tolerate the sight of blood and broken bodies--and to forget what is too painful to bear. Now a young freedwoman, she has returned south to New Orleans and earns her living as an embalmer, her steady hand and skillful incisions compensating for her white employer's shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tall and serious, Effie keeps her distance from the other girls in her boarding house, holding tight to the satisfaction she finds in her work. But despite her reticence, two encounters--with a charismatic state legislator named Samson Greene, and a beautiful young Creole, Adeline--introduce her to new worlds of protests and activism, of soirees and social ambition. Effie decides to seek out the past she has blocked from her memory and try to trace her kin. As her hopes are tested by betrayal, and New Orleans grapples with violence and growing racial turmoil, Effie faces loss and heartache, but also a chance to finally find her place . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A hidden story of human triumph, &lt;em&gt;Crescendo &lt;/em&gt;takes you on the rare journey of a musical prodigy who changed an entire community forever.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than eighty years ago, a musical prodigy with a brilliant mind was born into a poor, uneducated, and abusive family in rural South Georgia. At three years of age, Fred Allen could play Mozart sonatas on the piano without missing a note. But in spite of his obvious talent, Fred’s parents discouraged him from expressing his creativity and intelligence, even going so far as locking him away from the old piano in their home. Forced to fend for himself through his adolescent years, Fred knew that if he was ever to make something of himself, he would need to find a way to rise above his broken background. With incredible effort, and a few miracles along the way, Fred managed to do just that, eventually earning acceptance into The Julliard School in New York City. While simultaneously attending Juilliard, Union Theological Seminary, and Columbia University, he also began directing a local church choir, where he caught the attention of the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the musical revolution of the 1960s, Fred earned numerous Grammy nominations and built a growing reputation within the industry. But just as his new career was beginning to take off, Fred was faced with an impossible decision. His wife announced that she no longer wanted to raise their daughter in New York City and was heading home to the South. Fred had come so far from the pain and brokenness of his past, he couldn’t imagine giving up everything just to return to his childhood home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying not to think about what could have been, Fred took a job as a high school music teacher in his hometown of Thomasville, Georgia, a community of only 30,000 people. Far from the executive suites of RCA and the allure of Broadway, Fred never could have imagined that his new role would not only transform his life but also change an entire community forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of the “thrilling” (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;A Talent for Murder &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;A Different Kind of Evil &lt;/i&gt;returns with another stylish mystery starring the Queen of Crime Agatha Christie &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;as she travels to the excavation of the ancient city of Ur, where she must solve a crime with motives that may be as old as civilization itself. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh from solving the gruesome murder of a British agent in the Canary Islands, mystery writer Agatha Christie receives a letter from a family who believe their late daughter met with foul play. Before Gertrude Bell overdosed on sleeping medication, she was a prominent archaeologist, recovering ancient treasures in the Middle East. Found near her body was a letter claiming that Bell was being followed and to complicate things further, Bell was competing with another archeologist, Mrs. Woolley, for the rights to artifacts of immense value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christie travels to far-off Persia, where she meets the enigmatic Mrs. Woolley as she is working on a big and potentially valuable discovery. Temperamental but brilliant, Mrs. Woolley quickly charms Christie but when she does not hide her disdain for the recently deceased Miss Bell, Christie doesn’t know whether to trust her—or if Bell’s killer is just clever enough to hide in plain sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Wilson’s signature “strong characters, shrewd plotting and a skillful blending of fact and fiction” (&lt;i&gt;Shelf Awareness&lt;/i&gt;, starred review on &lt;i&gt;A Talent for Murder&lt;/i&gt;), this is a thrilling adventure set amidst the cursed ruins of an ancient land.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Hamish DeLuca and Regina "Reggie" Van Buren have a new case--and this one brings the war in Europe dangerously close to home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to make a life for herself, Regina "Reggie" Van Buren bid goodbye to fine china and the man her parents expected her to marry and escaped to Boston. What she never expected to discover was that an unknown talent for sleuthing would develop into a business partnership with the handsome, yet shy, Hamish DeLuca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their latest case arrives when Errol Parker, the leading base stealer in the Boston farm leagues, hires Hamish and Reggie to investigate what the Boston police shove off as a series of harmless pranks. Errol believes these are hate crimes linked to the outbreak of war in Europe, and he's afraid for his life. Hamish and Reggie quickly find themselves in the midst of an escalating series of crimes that seem to link Boston to Hamish's hometown of Toronto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an act of violence hits too close to home, Hamish is driven to a decision that may sever him from Reggie forever . . . even more than her engagement to wealthy architect Vaughan Vanderlaan.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Amazon Charts and Wall Street Journal bestselling author of the Everything series comes a new novel of love, lies, and deceit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifestyle journalist Ella Skye remembers every celebrity she interviewed, every politician she charmed between the sheets, and every socialite who eyed her with envy. The chance meeting with her husband, Damien; their rapid free fall into love; and their low-key, intimate wedding are all locked in her memory. But what she can’t remember is the tragic car accident that ripped her unborn child from her. Ella can’t even recall being pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find the memories of a lost pregnancy that’s left her husband devastated and their home empty, Ella begins delving into her past when she’s assigned an exclusive story about Nathan Donovan, a retired celebrity adventurer who seems to know more about her than she does him. To unravel the mystery of her selective memory loss, Ella follows Nathan from the snowcapped Sierra Nevada to the frozen slopes of southeast Alaska. There she discovers the people she trusts most aren’t the only ones keeping secrets from her—she’s hiding them from herself. Ella quickly learns that some truths are best left forgotten.</description>

  <description>After four months of unemployment, former book editor Clara Montgomery is still stuck sleeping on her little brother’s ugly couch in Queens. Determined to keep her minuscule savings account intact, she takes a job clearing out abandoned storage units, but is in no way prepared for stumbling upon dead snakes or trying to identify exactly where the perpetual stench of beets is emanating from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Clara comes across a unit that was once owned by an escort service, she finds the brothel “résumé” of a younger Caspian Tiddleswich… an astonishingly famous British actor. Her best friend thinks she should sell the gossip to a tabloid to fund her way off the couch from hell, but Clara instead manages to track down Caspian’s contact info, intending to reassure him that her lips are sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Caspian misinterprets Clara’s attempt at altruism and shows up on her doorstep, accusing her of blackmail. When the paparazzi capture a photo of them together, Caspian’s PR team sees an opportunity to promote his latest film—and if Clara wants to atone for her “crimes,” she’ll have to play along. Pretending to be Caspian’s girlfriend seems like it will be a tolerable, if somewhat daunting, penance… until their fake romance becomes something more than either of them expected.</description>

  <description>With the atmospheric storytelling of Kate Morton and Lisa Wingate, Karen Kelly weaves a shattering debut about two intertwined families and the secrets that they buried during the gilded, glory days of Bethlehem, PA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman arrives at the grand ancestral home of her husband’s family, hoping to fortify her cracking marriage. But what she finds is not what she expected: tragedy haunts the hallways, whispering of heartache and a past she never knew existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the true titans of the steel-boom era, Bethlehem is a story of temptation and regret, a story of secrets and the cost of keeping them, a story of forgiveness. It is the story of two complex women—thrown together in the name of family—who, in coming to understand each other, come finally to understand themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She was the greatest nemesis of d'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers--but Milady de Winter was so much more than just a villain in their swashbuckling adventures.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've gone by many names though you know me as Milady de Winter: Villainess, seductress, a secondary player in &lt;i&gt;The Three Musketeers&lt;/i&gt; story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we all know history was written by men, and they so often get things wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So before you cast judgment, let me tell you of how a girl from the countryside became the most feared woman in all of Europe. A target for antipathy, a name whispered in fear or loathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't need you to like me. I just need to be free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's finally time I tell my own story. The truth isn't tidy or convenient, but it's certainly more interesting.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;How far will some go to safeguard a secret? In the latest novel in Dianne Freeman’s witty and delightful historical mystery series, the adventurous Countess Harleigh finds out . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Though American by birth, Frances Wynn, the now-widowed Countess of Harleigh, has adapted admirably to the quirks and traditions of the British aristocracy. On August twelfth each year, otherwise known as the Glorious Twelfth, most members of the upper class retire to their country estates for grouse-shooting season. Frances has little interest in hunting—for birds &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; a second husband—and is expecting to spend a quiet few months in London with her almost-engaged sister, Lily, until the throng returns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Instead, she’s immersed in a shocking mystery when a friend, Mary Archer, is found murdered. Frances had hoped Mary might make a suitable bride for her cousin, Charles, but their courtship recently fizzled out. Unfortunately, this puts Charles in the spotlight—along with dozens of others. It seems Mary had countless notes hidden in her home, detailing the private indiscretions of society’s elite. Frances can hardly believe that the genteel and genial Mary was a blackmailer, yet why else would she horde such juicy tidbits?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Aided by her gallant friend and neighbor, George Hazelton, Frances begins assisting the police in this highly sensitive case, learning more about her peers than she ever wished to know. Too many suspects may be worse than none at all—but even more worrying is that the number of victims is increasing too. And unless Frances takes care, she’ll soon find herself among them . . .</description>

  <description>Summertime is the best time to lose yourself in the romance of Honeymoon Harbor…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he lands in the emergency room after collapsing at the funeral of a colleague and friend, Wall Street hotshot Gabriel Mannion initially rejects the diagnosis of an anxiety attack. But when warned that if he doesn’t change his adrenaline-fueled, workaholic lifestyle he could end up like his friend, Gabe reluctantly returns to his hometown of Honeymoon Harbor to regroup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he adjusts to the sight of mountains instead of skyscrapers, Gabe discovers advantages to this small Pacific Northwest town he once couldn’t wait to escape. But it’s irresistible librarian Chelsea Prescott who, along with the two foster children she’s taken under her wing, makes slowing down seem like the best prescription ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of their summer romance, Gabe gets a taste of the life he might have had if he’d taken a different path. But with his return to New York City looming on the horizon, he’ll have to choose between the success he’s worked tirelessly for and a ready-made family who offers a very different, richly rewarding future…if he’ll only take the risk.</description>

Her first assignment takes her to northern Alberta, where she falls in love with her mentor, the daring and brilliant Tate. After they’re separated from each other on another assignment, Marian is shattered to learn of Tate’s tragic death.

But as Marian relives her relationship with Tate and circles ever closer to the truth, evil stalks her every move.…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thrilling Victorian gothic horror tale about a young seamstress who claims her needle and thread have the power to kill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothea Truelove is young, wealthy, and beautiful. Ruth Butterham is young, poor, and awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dorothea's charitable work brings her to Oakgate Prison, she is delighted by the chance to explore her fascination with phrenology and test her hypothesis that the shape of a person's skull can cast a light on their darkest crimes. But when she meets one of the prisoners, the teenaged seamstress Ruth, she is faced with another strange idea: that it is possible to kill with a needle and thread--because Ruth attributes her crimes to a supernatural power inherent in her stitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story Ruth has to tell of her deadly creations--of bitterness and betrayal, of death and dresses--will shake Dorothea's belief in rationality, and the power of redemption. Can Ruth be trusted? Is she mad, or a murderer? &lt;i&gt;The Poison Thread &lt;/i&gt;is a spine-tingling, sinister read about the evil that lurks behind the facade of innocence.</description>

But he’s built a life for himself aboard a human space station. He’s even begun to understand the complex nuances of human courting rituals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Hastion is finally flirting back! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MURDER &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that Tristol’s beloved space station is unexpectedly contacted by the galoi – a xenophobic species with five genders, purple skin, and serious attitude. They need the help of a human detective because there’s a murderer aboard their spaceship. Murder is so rare, the galoi don’t even have a word for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tristol knows this because he is galoi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROMANCE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means that he and Detective Hastion are on the case… together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delicate Sensibilities? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains men who love other men in graphic detail, regardless of gender, biology, or skin color... and lots of emotively sexy tentacle hair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best selling author Gail Carriger (writing as G.L. Carriger) brings you a light-hearted romantic cozy mystery featuring an adorable lavender alien and his human crush.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Star D'Aplièse is at a crossroads in her life after the sudden death of her beloved father - the elusive billionaire, named Pa Salt by his six daughters, all adopted by him from the four corners of the world. He has left each of them a clue to their true heritage, but Star - the most enigmatic of the sisters - is hesitant to step out of the safety of the close relationship she shares with her sister CeCe. In desperation, she decides to follow the first clue she has been left, which leads her to an antiquarian bookshop in London, and the start of a whole new world . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hundred years earlier, headstrong and independent Flora MacNichol vows she will never marry. She is happy and secure in her home in the Lake District, living close to her idol, Beatrix Potter, when machinations outside her control lead her to London, and the home of one of Edwardian society's most notorious players, Alice Keppel. Flora is pulled between passionate love and duty to her family, but finds herself a pawn in a game - the rules of which are only known to others - until a meeting with a mysterious gentleman unveils the answers that Flora has been searching for her whole life . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Star learns more of Flora's incredible journey, she too goes on a voyage of discovery, finally stepping out of the shadow of her sister and opening herself up to the possibility of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transporting readers from the majestic mountains and lakes of Cumbria, to the glorious 'Garden of England' in Kent, &lt;i&gt;The Shadow Sister&lt;/i&gt; is the third spellbinding story in the Seven zsisters series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Patti Callahan Henry returns to the Lowcountry setting of &lt;i&gt;The Bookshop at Water's End &lt;/i&gt;with a novel of one woman's homecoming--and the family memories that have shaped her life...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her wedding day ten years ago, Lena Donohue experienced a betrayal so painful that she fled the small town of Watersend, South Carolina, and reinvented herself in New York City. Though now a freelance travel writer, the one place she rarely goes is home--until she learns of her dad's failing health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to Watersend means seeing the sister she has avoided for a decade and the brother who runs their family's Irish pub--and who has borne the burden of his sisters' rift. As Alzheimer's slowly steals their father's memories, the siblings rush to preserve his life in stories and in photographs. His past will bring Lena's own childhood into focus, including the special bond they shared--one that she never felt with her late mother--and make her realize that you can't run away from family or the place where your heart truly belongs...</description>

  <description>Montauk, Long Island, 1938.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple town on the brink of a glamorous future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A marriage drifting apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A life on the edge of &lt;i&gt;what is&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;what could be...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An epic and cinematic novel by debut author Nicola Harrison, Montauk captures the glamour and extravagance of a summer by the sea with the story of a woman torn between the life she chose and the life she desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Montauk, Long Island, 1938. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For three months, this humble fishing village will serve as the playground for New York City’s wealthy elite. Beatrice Bordeaux was looking forward to a summer of reigniting the passion between her and her husband, Harry. Instead, tasked with furthering his investment interest in Montauk as a resort destination, she learns she’ll be spending twelve weeks sequestered with the high society wives at The Montauk Manor—a two-hundred room seaside hotel—while Harry pursues other interests in the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College educated, but raised a modest country girl in Pennsylvania, Bea has never felt fully comfortable among these privileged women, whose days are devoted not to their children but to leisure activities and charities that seemingly benefit no one but themselves. She longs to be a mother herself, as well as a loving wife, but after five years of marriage she remains childless while Harry is increasingly remote and distracted. Despite lavish parties at the Manor and the Yacht Club, Bea is lost and lonely and befriends the manor’s laundress whose work ethic and family life stir memories of who she once was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she drifts further from the society women and their preoccupations and closer toward Montauk’s natural beauty and community spirit, Bea finds herself drawn to a man nothing like her husband –stoic, plain spoken and enigmatic. Inspiring a strength and courage she had almost forgotten, his presence forces her to face a haunting tragedy of her past and question her future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to embrace moments of happiness, no matter how fleeting, she soon discovers that such moments may be all she has, when fates conspire to tear her world apart…</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;In London, 1946, the two women who recently started The Right Sort Marriage Bureau find their new livelihood endangered when one client is arrested for the murder of another.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a London slowly recovering from the ravages of World War II, two very different women join forces to launch a business venture in the heart of Mayfair—The Right Sort Marriage Bureau. Miss Iris Sparks, avuncular and unmarried, and Mrs. Gwendolyn Bainbridge, practical and widowed with a young son, are determined to achieve some independence and do some good in a rapidly changing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the promising start to their marriage bureau is threatened when their newest client, Tillie La Salle, is found murdered and the man arrested for the crime is one Dickie Trower, the prospective husband they matched her with. While the police are convinced they have their man, Miss Sparks and Mrs. Bainbridge are not. To clear Trower’s name—and to rescue their fledging operation’s reputation—Sparks and Bainbridge decide to investigate on their own, using the skills and contacts they’ve each acquired through life and their individual adventures during the recent war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this charming, compelling mystery, Allison Montclair blends meticulous research with two brilliantly imagined main characters into the first in a wonderful new series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But as Rosie begins to search for her sister, her greatest fears come to the surface. Could Laura be more of a danger than the stranger she meets, or is the night before her last night alive? Told in dual timelines--the night before and the day after--The Night Before is a riveting thriller about family loyalty, obsession, and what happens when the desire for love spins out of control" --</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the critically acclaimed and USA Today bestselling author Charles Finch comes THE VANISHING MAN, the second in a prequel trilogy to his Charles Lenox Victorian series, in which &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;the theft of an antique painting sends Detective Lenox on a hunt for a criminal mastermind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;London, 1853. The Duke of Dorset, one of England's most famous noblemen, calls upon young Charles Lenox for help. A minor painting has been stolen from his private study. It's not particularly valuable in itself, but it's a peculiar thing to steal, leaving Lenox uneasy. After a vicious attack upon the Duke confirms the young investigator's anxieties, he must unravel the mystery of this painting, reaching back through the centuries to reveal one of the country's best-kept secrets&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;and discovering, in the process, a small, forgettable object of almost infinite value.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friends We Keep&lt;/i&gt; is the heartwarming and unforgettable new novel from Jane Green, New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Sunshine Sisters&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Beach House.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evvie, Maggie, and Topher have known one another since college. Their friendship was something they swore would last forever. Now years have passed, the friends have drifted apart, and they never found the lives they wanted--the lives they dreamed of when they were young and everything seemed possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evvie starved herself to become a supermodel but derailed her career by sleeping with a married man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie married Ben, the boy she fell in love with in college, never imagining the heartbreak his drinking would cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topher became a successful actor, but the shame of a childhood secret shut him off from real intimacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By their thirtieth reunion, these old friends have lost touch with one another and with the people they dreamed of becoming. Together again, they have a second chance at happiness . . . until a dark secret is revealed that changes everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Friends We Keep &lt;/i&gt;is about how despite disappointments we've had or mistakes we've made, it's never too late to find a place to call home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Genevieve Graham comes a sweeping new historical novel of love, tragedy, and redemption set during the height of the Klondike Gold Rush.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1897, the discovery of gold in the desolate reaches of the Yukon has the world abuzz with excitement, and thousands of prospectors swarm to the north seeking riches the likes of which have never been seen before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Liza Peterson and her family, the gold rush is a chance for them to make a fortune by moving their general store business from Vancouver to Dawson City, the only established town in the Yukon. For Constable Ben Turner, a recent recruit of the North-West Mounted Police, upholding the law in a place overrun with guns, liquor, prostitutes, and thieves is an opportunity to escape a dark past and become the man of integrity he has always wanted to be. But the long, difficult journey over icy mountain passes and whitewater rapids is much more treacherous than Liza or Ben imagined, and neither is completely prepared for the forbidding north.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Liza’s family nears the mountain’s peak, a catastrophe strikes with fatal consequences, and not even the NWMP can help. Alone and desperate, Liza finally reaches Dawson City, only to find herself in a different kind of peril. Meanwhile, Ben, wracked with guilt over the accident on the trail, sees the chance to make things right. But just as love begins to grow, new dangers arise, threatening to separate the couple forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by history as rich as the Klondike’s gold, &lt;i&gt;At the Mountain’s Edge&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of romance and adventure about two people who must let go of the past not only to be together, but also to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The captivating first mystery in the Ancestry Detective series, in which Texas genealogist Lucy Lancaster deals with murders in both the past and present. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;According to her friends, Lucy Lancaster, Austin, Texas genealogist, has never been drunk. Tipsy, sure, but drunk? No way. So when she arrives back at her office from a three-martini lunch three sheets to the wind, it's a momentous occassion. Even more momentous is what she's announced on live television while blotto: Texas senator Caleb Applewhite might be responsible for the murder of Seth Halloran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Lucy is a genealogist, so the murder in question would have taken place in 1849. But the descendents of the two families, Daniel Applewhite and Pearce Halloran are, are in the midst of a competitive race for the US Senate, and this news does nothing to calm tensions. Lucy is determined to either prove or disprove Caleb Applewhite as the murderer, but when her curiosity puts her at the scene of another murder—this time, in the present-day—she realizes that the branches of some family trees are too gnarled and twisted to unwind.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A dangerous element discovered by Bianca Goddard's father falls into the wrong hands . . . leading to a chain of murders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spring 1544&lt;/i&gt; Now that she is with child, Bianca is more determined than ever to distance herself from her unstable father. Desperate to win back the favor of King Henry VIII, disgraced alchemist Albern Goddard plans to reveal a powerful new element he's discovered--one with deadly potential. But when the substance is stolen, he implores his daughter to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after, a woman's body is found behind the Dim Dragon Inn, an eerie green vapor rising from her mouth. Bianca has reason to suspect her own mother may be involved in the theft and the murder.

  <description>From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker&lt;/em&gt;, an enthralling historical saga that recreates the danger, romance, and sacrifice of an era and brings to life one courageous, passionate American--Mildred Fish Harnack--and her circle of women friends who waged a clandestine battle against Hitler in Nazi Berlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Wisconsin graduate student Mildred Fish marries brilliant German economist Arvid Harnack, she accompanies him to his German homeland, where a promising future awaits. In the thriving intellectual culture of 1930s Berlin, the newlyweds create a rich new life filled with love, friendships, and rewarding work--but the rise of a malevolent new political faction inexorably changes their fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party wield violence and lies to seize power, Mildred, Arvid, and their friends resolve to resist. Mildred gathers intelligence for her American contacts, including Martha Dodd, the vivacious and very modern daughter of the US ambassador. Her German friends, aspiring author Greta Kuckoff and literature student Sara Weiss, risk their lives to collect information from journalists, military officers, and officials within the highest levels of the Nazi regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Mildred's network stealthily fights to bring down the Third Reich from within. But when Nazi radio operatives detect an errant Russian signal, the Harnack resistance cell is exposed, with fatal consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by actual events, &lt;em&gt;Resistance Women&lt;/em&gt; is an enthralling, unforgettable story of ordinary people determined to resist the rise of evil, sacrificing their own lives and liberty to fight injustice and defend the oppressed.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The first book in a major new series from the #1 internationally bestselling author &lt;b&gt;Lucinda Riley&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maia D’Apliese and her five sisters gather together at their childhood home, “Atlantis”—a fabulous, secluded castle situated on the shores of Lake Geneva—having been told that their beloved father, who adopted them all as babies, has died. Each of them is handed a tantalizing clue to her true heritage—a clue which takes Maia across the world to a crumbling mansion in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Once there, she begins to put together the pieces of her story and its beginnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighty years earlier in Rio’s Belle Epoque of the 1920s, Izabela Bonifacio’s father has aspirations for his daughter to marry into the aristocracy. Meanwhile, architect Heitor da Silva Costa is devising plans for an enormous statue, to be called Christ the Redeemer, and will soon travel to Paris to find the right sculptor to complete his vision. Izabela—passionate and longing to see the world—convinces her father to allow her to accompany him and his family to Europe before she is married. There, at Paul Landowski’s studio and in the heady, vibrant cafes of Montparnasse, she meets ambitious young sculptor Laurent Brouilly, and knows at once that her life will never be the same again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In this sweeping, epic tale of love and loss—the first in a unique, spellbinding series of seven novels—&lt;b&gt;Lucinda Riley&lt;/b&gt; showcases her storytelling talent like never before.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A beautiful, stunningly ambitious novel set in Singapore about a woman who survived the Japanese occupation and a man who thought he had lost everything. For fans of Min Jin Lee's Pachinko and Georgia Hunter’s We Were the Lucky Ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Singapore, 1942. As Japanese troops sweep down Malaysia and into Singapore, a village is ransacked, leaving only two survivors and one tiny child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a neighbouring village, seventeen-year-old Wang Di is bundled into the back of a troop carrier and shipped off to a Japanese military brothel where she is forced into sexual slavery. After sixty years of silence, what she saw and experienced there still haunts her present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the year 2000, twelve-year-old Kevin is determined to find out the truth – wherever it might lead – after his grandmother makes a surprising confession on her deathbed, one she never meant Kevin to hear, setting in motion a chain of events he could never have foreseen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together two timelines and two very big secrets, this stunning debut opens a window on a little-known period of history, revealing the strength and bravery shown by numerous women in the face of terrible cruelty. A profoundly moving novel, it is based partly on the author's great-grandfather’s experiences.</description>

  <description>Award-winning author Sonali Dev launches a new series about the Rajes, an immigrant Indian family descended from royalty, who have built their lives in San Francisco—a compelling, heartwarming romance between two strangers from completely different worlds, and a poignant exploration of cultural assimilation, identity, and the meaning of the word home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only in a family like the Rajes could San Francisco’s most acclaimed neurosurgeon be considered the black sheep. Dr. Trisha Raje has developed groundbreaking technology and won the respect of her peers and the life-long gratitude of her patients. Still, her large, close-knit family—descended from old Indian nobility—has certain rules to uphold. Trusting outsiders is frowned upon. Disloyalty of any kind is unacceptable. Trisha never intended to jeopardize her brother’s political aspirations, yet her long-ago actions inadvertently did just that. At last she has a chance to turn that around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up-and-coming chef DJ Caine has known people like Trisha before—people who judge his background and find it lacking, who put pedigree above character. He may need the lucrative, career-making job the Rajes offer, but he has little time for Trisha, especially when he learns that she’s the arrogant surgeon who wants to perform an untested procedure on his sister, Emma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the two continually clash, their assumptions shatter like spun sugar on one of DJ’s stunning desserts.  Drawn to DJ’s steadiness, humor, and passion—as well as his extraordinary food—Trisha begins to reexamine her view of the world, while challenging his beliefs about the nature of family. But there’s a past to be reckoned with before they can hope to savor a future bursting with delicious possibility.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A captivating novel based on the story of the extraordinary real-life American woman who secretly worked for the French Resistance during World War II--while playing hostess to the invading Germans at the iconic Hotel Ritz in Paris--from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Aviator's Wife&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Swans of Fifth Avenue&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In March 1940, the Nazis sweep Paris and immediately take up residence in one of the city's most iconic sites: The Hotel Ritz. There, under a roof legendary for its unprecedented luxury and for its fabled residents--including Coco Chanel, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Cole Porter, Hemingway, Balanchine, Doris Duke, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and now Hermann Göering--the Nazis rule over a paralyzed city. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But two residents of the Ritz refuse to be defeated: its director, Claude Auzello, and his beautiful American actress wife, Blanche. They not only oversee the smooth workings of the hotel, but both Blanche and Claude throw themselves fearlessly into the dangerous and clandestine workings of the French Resistance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a true-to-life novel of a courageous woman and her husband who put their marriage--and ultimately their lives--in jeopardy to fight for freedom. Intimate, fearless, and moving, it spins a brilliantly and unforgettably vivid human portrait at a time of unimaginable crisis and sacrifice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For fans of Charles Todd and Deanna Raybourn comes Christine Trent’s second Florence Nightingale mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cholera has broken out in London, but Florence Nightingale has bigger problems when people begin dying of a far more intentional cause—murder.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The London summer of 1854 is drawing to a close when a deadly outbreak of cholera grips the city. Florence Nightingale is back on the scene marshaling her nurses to help treat countless suffering patients at Middlesex Hospital as the disease tears through the Soho slums. But beyond the dangers of the disease, something even more evil is seeping through the ailing streets of London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins with an attack on the carriage of Florence’s friend, Elizabeth Herbert, wife to Secretary at War Sidney Herbert. Florence survives, but her coachman does not. Within hours, Sidney’s valet stumbles into the hospital, mutters a few cryptic words about the attack, and promptly dies from cholera. Frantic that an assassin is stalking his wife, Sidney enlists Florence’s help, who accepts but has little to go on save for the valet’s last words and a curious set of dice in his jacket pocket. Soon, the suspects are piling up faster than cholera victims, as there seems to be no end to the number of people who bear a grudge against the Herbert household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Florence is in a race against time—not only to save the victims of a lethal disease, but to foil a murderer with a disturbingly sinister goal—in &lt;i&gt;A Murderous Malady&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and Queen of the Beach Reads delivers her next summer blockbuster.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drue Campbell's life and career have recently been derailed. The only thing she has left is the house her mother left her: a ramshackle beach bungalow with a missing roof in the once-sleepy town of Sunset Beach, which is rapidly becoming a hot spot for the rich and well-heeled, who are none too pleased about the shabby eyesore in their perfect neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Drue's larger-than-life father unexpectedly turns up at her mother's funeral and offers her a job at his law firm, Drue doesn't know whether to be grateful or resentful that he has suddenly reappeared. She grudgingly accepts the job sifting through cold callers and shysters looking to get rich quick. But when her attention is caught by a suspicious murder case, Drue finds herself entangled in a decades-old mystery - one that may have dire consequences for Drue and the people she loves.</description>

  <description>Overworked and underappreciated, single mom Amy Byler needs a break. So when the guilt-ridden husband who abandoned her shows up and offers to take care of their kids for the summer, she accepts his offer and escapes rural Pennsylvania for New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually grounded and mild mannered, Amy finally lets her hair down in the city that never sleeps. She discovers a life filled with culture, sophistication, and—with a little encouragement from her friends—a few blind dates. When one man in particular makes quick work of Amy’s heart, she risks losing herself completely in the unexpected escape, and as the summer comes to an end, Amy realizes too late that she must make an impossible decision: stay in this exciting new chapter of her life, or return to the life she left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before she can choose, a crisis forces the two worlds together, and Amy must stare down a future where she could lose both sides of herself, and every dream she’s ever nurtured, in the beat of a heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From internationally bestselling author and “rising star of Southern fiction” (Mary Alice Monroe, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author) Kristy Woodson Harvey comes the third novel in her Peachtree Bluff series, in which a secret threatens the tight-knit bond between a trio of sisters and their mother.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the man of her dreams back in her life and all three of her daughters happy, Ansley Murphy should be content. But she can’t help but feel like it’s all a little too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, youngest daughter and actress Emerson, who is recently engaged and has just landed the role of a lifetime, seemingly has the world by the tail. Only, something she can’t quite put her finger on is worrying her—and it has nothing to do with her recent health scare.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When two new women arrive in Peachtree Bluff—one who has the potential to wreck Ansley’s happiness and one who could tear Emerson’s world apart—everything is put in perspective. And after secrets that were never meant to be told come to light, the powerful bond between the Murphy sisters and their mother comes crumbling down, testing their devotion to each other and forcing them to evaluate the meaning of family.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unforgettable novel from an award-winning author about an ambitious young agent's daring fight to protect blacklisted writers in McCarthy-era Hollywood and her passionate relationship with an African American journalist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outraged by her grandfather's illicit affair with Empire Pictures' latest femme fatale, Roxanne Granville forsakes her position as Hollywood royalty and rejects the man who raised her, determined to strike out on her own. Backed by little more than the stubborn grit she inherited from her beloved grandmother, Roxanne sets up shop as a low-budget film agent for budding screenwriters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an old friend, exiled from Hollywood and Empire Pictures by her grandfather for being a Communist sympathizer, begs for her help, Roxanne decides to right the wrongs committed by her family. It's what her grandmother would have wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Roxanne finds herself at the helm of a lucrative business, having landed her secret clients a handful of major studio deals through willing frontmen. Her newfound freedom leads her to a passionate relationship with an African American journalist and jazz aficionado. But Hollywood is ruthless when it senses a scandal. How long will it take before all of Roxanne's success comes crumbling down?</description>

  <description>USA TODAY bestselling author Sarah Morgan returns with this heartwarming novel about the power of friendship, love and what happens when an ending is just the beginning…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Grace has planned the surprise of a lifetime for her husband—a romantic getaway to Paris. But she never expected he’d have a surprise of his own: he wants a divorce. Reeling from the shock but refusing to be broken, a devastated Grace makes the bold decision to go to Paris alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey, a young woman from London, has left behind a heartache of her own when she arrives in Paris. A job in a bookshop is her ticket to freedom, but with no money and no knowledge of the French language, suddenly a summer spent wandering the cobbled streets alone seems much more likely…until she meets Grace, and everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace can’t believe how daring Audrey is. Audrey can’t believe how cautious newly single Grace is. Living in neighboring apartments above the bookshop, this unlikely pair offer each other just what they’ve both been missing. They came to Paris to find themselves, but finding this unbreakable friendship might be the best thing that’s ever happened to them…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Royalty has its privileges, even when you’re thirty-fourth in line to the throne, as Lady Georgiana Rannoch discovers on the glamorous—and dangerous—French Riviera… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Why should my clueless brother, Binky, and his decidedly disagreeable wife, Fig, be the only ones to enjoy the fun and sun of the French Riviera? Thankfully, Her Majesty the Queen has once again come to my rescue. She is sending me off to Nice with a secret assignment—recover her priceless, stolen snuff box from the disreputable Sir Toby Groper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her Majesty’s trust is an honor, but an even greater honor is bestowed upon me in Nice—none other than Coco Chanel herself asks me to model her latest fashion. Unfortunately, things go disastrously wrong on the catwalk and before I can snatch the snuff box, someone’s life is snuffed out in a very dastardly way. With a murderer on the loose—and my dearest Darcy seen in the company of another woman—how’s a girl to find any time to go to the casino?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eerie, old Scottish manor in the middle of nowhere that’s now hers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ailsa Calder has inherited half of a house. The other half belongs to a man who disappeared without a trace twenty-seven years ago—her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving London behind to settle the inheritance from her mother’s estate, Ailsa returns to her childhood home, nestled amongst the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, joined by the half-sister who’s almost a stranger to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ailsa can’t escape the claustrophobic feeling that the house itself is watching her—as if her past hungers to consume her. She also can’t ignore how the neighbourhood animals refuse to set one foot within the gates of the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first nighttime intruder shows up, Ailsa fears that the manor’s careless rugged beauty could cost her everything.</description>

  <description>Freddy Carlton knows she should be focusing on her lines for The Austen Playbook, a live-action TV event where viewers choose the outcome of each scene, but her concentration’s been blown. The palatial estate housing the endeavor is now run by the rude (brilliant) critic who’s consistently slammed her performances of late. James “Griff” Ford-Griffin has a penchant for sarcasm, a majestic nose and all the sensitivity of a sledgehammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can’t take her eyes off him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griff can hardly focus with a contagious joy fairy flitting about near him, especially when Freddy looks at him like that. His only concern right now should be on shutting down his younger brother’s well-intentioned (disastrous) schemes—or at the very least on the production (not this one) that might save his family home from the banks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead all he can think of is soft skin and vibrant curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he’s reluctantly dragged into her quest to rediscover her passion for the stage and Freddy is drawn into his research on a legendary theater star, the adage about appearances being deceiving proves abundantly true. It’s the unlikely start of something enormous…but a single revelation about the past could derail it all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A chilling ghost story with a twist: the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Winter People&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; returns to the woods of Vermont to tell the story of a husband and wife who don't simply move into a haunted house, they start building one from scratch, without knowing it, until it's too late . . . &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate abandon the comforts of suburbia and their teaching jobs to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project: building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this charming property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. As Helen starts carefully sourcing decorative building materials for her home--wooden beams, mantles, historic bricks--she starts to unearth, and literally conjure, the tragic lives of Hattie's descendants, three generations of "Breckenridge women," each of whom died amidst suspicion, and who seem to still be seeking something precious and elusive in the present day.</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr delivers a poignant and powerful story about how one woman’s best intentions lead to the worst of situations and how the power of love helps her to heal and ultimately triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the outside looking in, Lauren Delaney has a life to envy—a successful career, a solid marriage to a prominent surgeon and two beautiful daughters who are off to good colleges. But on her twenty-fourth wedding anniversary Lauren makes a decision that will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren won’t pretend things are perfect anymore. She defies the controlling husband who has privately mistreated her throughout their marriage and files for divorce. And as she starts her new life, she meets a kindred spirit—a man who is also struggling with the decision to end his unhappy marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lauren’s husband wants his “perfect” life back and his actions are shocking. Facing an uncertain future, Lauren discovers an inner strength she didn’t know she had as she fights for the love and happiness she deserves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/i&gt;’s “Books Coming Out This Summer That You Need to Seriously Read” * One of &lt;i&gt;Bustle&lt;/i&gt;’s “New Romance Novels to Make Your Spring Reading Even Dreamier Than You Imagined” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A charming romantic comedy about three sisters who are struggling to keep the family wedding planning business afloat—all the while trying to write their own happily-ever-afters in the process. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All’s fair in love and business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The de la Rosa family and their wedding planning business have been creating happily ever afters in the Washington, DC area for years, making even the most difficult bride’s day a fairytale. But when their parents announce their retirement, the sisters—Marisol, Janelyn, and Pearl—are determined to take over the business themselves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the sisters quickly discover that the wedding business isn’t all rings and roses. There are brides whose moods can change at the drop of a hat; grooms who want to control every part of the process; and couples who argue until their big day. As emotions run high, the de la Rosa sisters quickly realize one thing: even when disaster strikes—whether it’s a wardrobe malfunction or a snowmageddon in the middle of a spring wedding—they’ll always have each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of the witty and engaging novels of Amy E. Reichert and Susan Mallery, &lt;i&gt;The Key to Happily Ever After&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh romantic comedy that celebrates the crucial and profound power of sisterhood.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A once-beloved hotel and a fountain whose water suddenly can restore lost memories. But is it a miracle, or are there strings attached?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tuscany Hotel was once a haven for young artists. A place full of inspiration and a work of art in and of itself, the hotel was built by Robert Gandy for his wife, Magdalena: a woman of beauty beyond description who was orphaned as an infant in Florence and grew up without the ability to remember. A tragedy caused the hotel to close its doors, however, and it has been years since the fountain in the courtyard ran with water and inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitto Gandy, Robert’s son, returns from the horrors of World War II to a wife who fears him, a son who is too young to remember him, and a father whose memory of him is fading. As Vitto faces the memories that torture his heart and mind, his father runs off in the night to seek solace in the last place he was happy: the Tuscany Hotel. Instead of finding ruins, he discovers that the water in the fountain has begun to run again. And as he drinks it, his memory returns.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with Alzheimer’s patients hoping for restored memories rather than artists longing for inspiration, the hotel is once again a source of life and art. But nothing is truly as good as it seems, and the mysterious gift of the hotel comes with a price that each must determine they’re willing to pay. Bursting with beauty, art, and inspiration, Midnight at the Tuscany Hotel is a story of parent and child, husband and wife, and the joy and pain of what it means to be alive.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling author &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheila Roberts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for a seaside escape to the beaches of Moonlight Harbor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste Jones has plans for a perfect summer with her boyfriend (and hopefully soon-to-be fiancé)—until he dumps her to be with the woman he’s had on the side for months. Heartbroken and furious, Celeste resolves to move on. When the going gets tough, the tough…okay, the not-so-tough go to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as school lets out for the summer, she waves goodbye to her first-graders, packs up her bikini and heads for Moonlight Harbor, where she knows her big sister, Jenna, will receive her with open arms. Jenna could probably use some help at the Driftwood Inn, and Celeste is happy to do chores around the place in exchange for a relaxing summer escape. She just needs something—or some&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;—to distract her from her troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding The One can be tricky, and Jenna is determined to make sure Celeste gets it right this time around. Not that Jenna’s an expert. She’s still trying to sort out her own love life. But if both sisters listen to their hearts, eventually they’re bound to discover that life—and love—is good at the beach.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In 1960s Florida, a young Cuban exile will risk her life--and heart--to take back her country in this exhilarating historical novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;Next Year in Havana&lt;/i&gt;, a Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beautiful. Daring. Deadly. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cuban Revolution took everything from sugar heiress Beatriz Perez--her family, her people, her country. Recruited by the CIA to infiltrate Fidel Castro's inner circle and pulled into the dangerous world of espionage, Beatriz is consumed by her quest for revenge and her desire to reclaim the life she lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Cold War swells like a hurricane over the shores of the Florida Strait, Beatriz is caught between the clash of Cuban American politics and the perils of a forbidden affair with a powerful man driven by ambitions of his own. When the ever-changing tides of history threaten everything she has fought for, she must make a choice between her past and future--but the wrong move could cost Beatriz everything--not just the island she loves, but also the man who has stolen her heart...</description>

  <description>The New York Times bestselling historical novelist delivers her biggest, boldest, and most ambitious novel yet—a sweeping, dramatic Victorian epic of lost love, lies, jealousy, and rebellion set in colonial Barbados.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1854. From Bristol to Barbados...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Dawson has always been the poor cousin in a prosperous merchant clan—merely a vicar’s daughter, and a reform-minded vicar’s daughter, at that. Everyone knows that the family’s lucrative shipping business will go to her cousin, Adam, one day. But when her grandfather dies, Emily receives an unexpected inheiritance: Peverills, a sugar plantation in Barbados—a plantation her grandfather never told anyone he owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emily accompanies her cousin and his new wife to Barbados, she finds Peverills a burnt-out shell, reduced to ruins in 1816, when a rising of enslaved people sent the island up in flames. Rumors swirl around the derelict plantation; people whisper of ghosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would her practical-minded grandfather leave her a property in ruins? Why are the neighboring plantation owners, the Davenants, so eager to acquire Peverills—so eager that they invite Emily and her cousins to stay with them indefinitely? Emily finds herself bewitched by the beauty of the island even as she’s drawn into the personalities and politics of forty years before: a tangled history of clandestine love, heartbreaking betrayal, and a bold bid for freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When family secrets begin to unravel and the harsh truth of history becomes more and more plain, Emily must challenge everything she thought she knew about her family, their legacy... and herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Written in Lauren Denton's signature Southern style, &lt;em&gt;Glory Road&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of three generations of women navigating the uncertain pathways of their hearts during a summer that promises to bring change--whether they're ready for it or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At thirty-eight, garden shop owner Jessie McBride thinks her chances for romance are years behind her and, after her failed marriage, she's fine with that. She lives contentedly with her fiery mother and her quiet, headstrong daughter. But the unexpected arrival of two men on Glory Road make her question if she's really happy with the status quo. Handsome, wealthy Sumner Tate asks her to arrange flowers for his daughter's wedding, and Jessie finds herself drawn to his continued attention. And Ben Bradley, her lingering what-could-have-been from high school days who's known her better than anyone and whom she hasn't seen in years, moves back to the red dirt road. Jessie finds her heart being pulled in directions she never expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Jessie's fourteen-year-old daughter, Evan, is approaching the start of high school and trying to navigate a new world of identity and emotions--particularly as they relate to the cute new guy who's moved in just down the road. At the same time, Jessie's mother, Gus, increasingly finds herself forgetful and faces a potentially frightening future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As all three women navigate the uncertain paths of their hearts and futures, one summer promises to bring change--whether they're ready for it or not.</description>

  <description>The atmospheric, compelling follow-up to the stunning debut A Death of No Importance, featuring series character, Jane Prescott.&lt;br /&gt;In 1912, as New York reels from the news of the Titanic disaster, ladies’ maid Jane Prescott travels to Long Island with the Benchley family. Their daughter Louise is to marry William Tyler, at his uncle and aunt’s mansion; the Tylers are a glamorous, storied couple, their past filled with travel and adventure. Now, Charles Tyler is known for putting down New York’s notorious Italian mafia, the Black Hand, and his wife Alva has settled into domestic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the city visitors adjust to the rhythms of the household and plan Louise’s upcoming wedding, Jane quickly befriends the Tyler children’s nanny, Sofia—a young Italian-American woman. However, one unusually sultry spring night, Jane is woken by a scream from the nursery—and rushes in to find Sofia murdered, and the carefully locked window flung open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tylers believe that this is an attempted kidnapping of their baby gone wrong—a warning from the criminal underworld to Charles Tyler. But Jane is asked to help with the investigation by her friend, journalist Michael Behan, who knows that she is uniquely placed to see what other tensions may simmer just below the surface in this wealthy, secretive household. Was Sofia’s murder fall-out from the social tensions rife in New York, or could it be a much more personal crime?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Before they became legendary writers, Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, and Anne Brontë were &lt;i&gt;detectors &lt;/i&gt;in this charming historical mystery...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yorkshire, 1845. A young wife and mother has gone missing from her home, leaving behind two small children and a large pool of blood. Just a few miles away, a humble parson's daughters--the Brontë sisters--learn of the crime. Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë are horrified and intrigued by the mysterious disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three creative, energetic, and resourceful women quickly realize that they have all the skills required to make for excellent "lady detectors." Not yet published novelists, they have well-honed imaginations and are expert readers. And, as Charlotte remarks, "detecting is reading between the lines--it's seeing what is not there."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they investigate, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne are confronted with a society that believes a woman's place is in the home, not scouring the countryside looking for clues. But nothing will stop the sisters from discovering what happened to the vanished bride, even as they find their own lives are in great peril...</description>

  <description>In 1942, Europe remains in the relentless grip of war. Just beyond the tents of the Russian refugee camp she calls home, a young woman speaks her wedding vows. It’s a decision that will alter her destiny…and it’s a lie that will remain buried until the next century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she was nine years old, Alina Dziak knew she would marry her best friend, Tomasz. Now fifteen and engaged, Alina is unconcerned by reports of Nazi soldiers at the Polish border, believing her neighbors that they pose no real threat, and dreams instead of the day Tomasz returns from college in Warsaw so they can be married. But little by little, injustice by brutal injustice, the Nazi occupation takes hold, and Alina’s tiny rural village, its families, are divided by fear and hate. Then, as the fabric of their lives is slowly picked apart, Tomasz disappears. Where Alina used to measure time between visits from her beloved, now she measures the spaces between hope and despair, waiting for word from Tomasz and avoiding the attentions of the soldiers who patrol her parents’ farm. But for now, even deafening silence is preferable to grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slipping between Nazi-occupied Poland and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative that weaves together two women’s stories into a tapestry of perseverance, loyalty, love and honor. The Things We Cannot Say is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced…and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The death of a fiendish nobleman strikes close to home as Sebastian St. Cyr is tasked with finding the killer to save his young cousin from persecution in this riveting new historical mystery from the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Why Kill the Innocent&lt;/i&gt;....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the handsome but dissolute young gentleman Lord Ashworth is found brutally murdered, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, is called in by Bow Street magistrate Sir Henry Lovejoy to help catch the killer. Just seven months before, Sebastian had suspected Ashworth of aiding one of his longtime friends and companions in the kidnapping and murder of a string of vulnerable street children. But Sebastian was never able to prove Ashworth's complicity. Nor was he able to prevent his troubled, headstrong young niece Stephanie from entering into a disastrous marriage with the dangerous nobleman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie has survived the difficult birth of twin sons. But Sebastian soon discovers that her marriage has quickly degenerated into a sham. Ashworth abandoned his pregnant bride at his father's Park Street mansion and has continued living an essentially bachelor existence. And mounting evidence--ranging from a small bloody handprint to a woman's silk stocking--suggests that Ashworth's killer was a woman. Sebastian is tasked with unraveling the shocking nest of secrets surrounding Ashworth's life to keep Stephanie from being punished for his death.</description>

  <description>After years of struggling as a writer in 1990s New York City, James Smale finally gets his big break when his novel sells to an editor at a major publishing house: Jackie Kennedy. Jackie, or Mrs. Onassis as she's known in the office, has fallen in love with James's candidly autobiographical novel, one that exposes his own dysfunctional family. But when the book's forthcoming publication threatens to unravel already fragile relationships, both within his family and with his partner, James finds that he can't bring himself to finish the manuscript.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her shrewd drive and intuition, Jackie pushes James to write an authentic ending, encouraging him to head home to confront the truth about his relationship with his mother. But when a long-held family secret is revealed, he realizes his editor may have had a larger plan that goes beyond the page...</description>

  <description>1930s London. Poor Lady Georgiana-thirty-fourth in line to the throne-has nothing to serve her Bavarian princess houseguest, even though the Queen of England has requested that she entertain her. Then there's the matter of the body in the bookshop and the princess's unwitting involvement with the Communist party. It's enough to drive a girl mad.</description>

  <description>From the New York Times bestselling authors of The Forgotten Room comes a captivating historical mystery, infused with romance, that links the lives of three women across a century—two deep in the past, one in the present—to the doomed passenger liner, RMS Lusitania.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2013&lt;br /&gt;Her finances are in dire straits and bestselling author Sarah Blake is struggling to find a big idea for her next book. Desperate, she breaks the one promise she made to her Alzheimer’s-stricken mother and opens an old chest that belonged to her great-grandfather, who died when the RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-Boat in 1915. What she discovers there could change history. Sarah embarks on an ambitious journey to England to enlist the help of John Langford, a recently disgraced Member of Parliament whose family archives might contain the only key to the long-ago catastrophe. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 1915&lt;br /&gt;Southern belle Caroline Telfair Hochstetter’s marriage is in crisis. Her formerly attentive industrialist husband, Gilbert, has become remote, pre-occupied with business . . . and something else that she can’t quite put a finger on. She’s hoping a trip to London in Lusitania’s lavish first-class accommodations will help them reconnect—but she can’t ignore the spark she feels for her old friend, Robert Langford, who turns out to be on the same voyage. Feeling restless and longing for a different existence, Caroline is determined to stop being a bystander, and take charge of her own life. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa Fairweather is traveling second-class on the Lusitania, returning home to Devon. Or at least, that’s her story. Tessa has never left the United States and her English accent is a hasty fake. She’s really Tennessee Schaff, the daughter of a roving con man, and she can steal and forge just about anything. But she’s had enough. Her partner has promised that if they can pull off this one last heist aboard the Lusitania, they’ll finally leave the game behind. Tess desperately wants to believe that, but Tess has the uneasy feeling there’s something about this job that isn’t as it seems. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Lusitania steams toward its fate, three women work against time to unravel a plot that will change the course of their own lives . . . and history itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mysterious child teaches two strangers how to love and trust again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the loss of her mother and her own battle with breast cancer, Joanna Teale returns to her graduate research on nesting birds in rural Illinois, determined to prove that her recent hardships have not broken her. She throws herself into her work from dusk to dawn, until her solitary routine is disrupted by the appearance of a mysterious child who shows up at her cabin barefoot and covered in bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl calls herself Ursa, and she claims to have been sent from the stars to witness five miracles. With concerns about the child’s home situation, Jo reluctantly agrees to let her stay—just until she learns more about Ursa’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo enlists the help of her reclusive neighbor, Gabriel Nash, to solve the mystery of the charming child. But the more time they spend together, the more questions they have. How does a young girl not only read but understand Shakespeare? Why do good things keep happening in her presence? And why aren’t Jo and Gabe checking the missing children’s website anymore?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the three have formed an incredible bond, they know difficult choices must be made. As the summer nears an end and Ursa gets closer to her fifth miracle, her dangerous past closes in. When it finally catches up to them, all of their painful secrets will be forced into the open, and their fates will be left to the stars.</description>

  <description>Elise Sontag is a typical Iowa fourteen-year-old in 1943--aware of the war but distanced from its reach. Then her father, a legal U.S. resident for nearly two decades, is suddenly arrested on suspicion of being a Nazi sympathizer. The family is sent to an internment camp in Texas, where, behind the armed guards and barbed wire, Elise feels stripped of everything beloved and familiar, including her own identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes the camp bearable is meeting fellow internee Mariko Inoue, a Japanese-American teen from Los Angeles, whose friendship empowers Elise to believe the life she knew before the war will again be hers. Together in the desert wilderness, Elise and Mariko hold tight the dream of being young American women with a future beyond the fences.</description>

  <description>Amateur sleuth Lana Lee returns for another charming cozy Noodle Shop Mystery in Vivien Chien's &lt;i&gt;Wonton Terror&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;The Asian community is kicking off summer with the return of its popular Cleveland Night Market festivities, and Lana Lee is excited to represent the Ho-Lee Noodle House booth with her favorite chef, Peter Huang. Lana is confident that the evening marks the beginning of a great season to come. Not only is she looking forward to the warm temperatures, but her birthday is only weeks away, her handsome boyfriend, Detective Adam Trudeau, is planning a romantic get-away. Life couldn't be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before she can get too accustomed to the idea of a carefree summer, an explosion involving a nearby food truck, Wonton on Wheels, kills one of the proprietors and injures several others in the nearby vicinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the authorities discover that this was no accident, the family members of the dead man become the number-one suspects in a front-page murder story. Lana and her best friend, Megan Riley, fall back into detective mode. But as they uncover family secrets of abuse and angry costumers, Lana's own family drama raises its head. Will Lana be able to juggle everything the universe is throwing at her, or has she jumped from the frying pan to the fire?</description>

  <description>A coming-of-age tale for the young and naïve 17-year-old Catherine Morland, &lt;em&gt;Northanger Abbey&lt;/em&gt; takes a decidedly comical look at themes of class, family, love and literature. Reveling in the sensationalist - and extremely popular - Gothic fiction of her day, the story follows Catherine out of Bath to the lofty manor of the Tilneys, where her overactive imagination gets to work constructing an absurd and melodramatic explanation for the death of Mrs Tilney, which threatens to jeopardize her newly forged friendships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Audible Originals production of &lt;em&gt;Northanger Abbey&lt;/em&gt; stars Emma Thompson (Academy Award, Golden Globe, Emmy and BAFTA winner, &lt;em&gt;Love Actually&lt;/em&gt;, Harry Potter, &lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensibility&lt;/em&gt;), Lily Cole (&lt;em&gt;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Huntsman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;St. Trinian's&lt;/em&gt;), Douglas Booth (&lt;em&gt;Noah&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Riot Club&lt;/em&gt;), Jeremy Irvine (&lt;em&gt;Warhorse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Railway Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Now Is Good&lt;/em&gt;), Eleanor Tomlinson (&lt;em&gt;Poldark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Illusionist&lt;/em&gt;, Alice in Wonderland) and Ella Purnell (&lt;em&gt;Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass 2&lt;/em&gt;), amongst others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public Domain (P)2017 Audible, Ltd</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;From Gill Paul, the author of &lt;em&gt;Another Woman’s Husband&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Secret Wife&lt;/em&gt;, comes a powerful new chapter in her Romanov saga… a gripping journey through the decades and across the continents, a novel of eternal love, devastating loss, and courage against all odds. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer 1918: Pretty, vivacious Grand Duchess Maria Romanova faces an uncertain future. The nineteen-year-old daughter of the fallen Tsar Nicholas II, she now lives with her family in suffocating isolation, a far cry from their once-glittering royal household. Her days are a combination of endless boredom and paralyzing fear; her only respite is a clandestine friendship with a few of the guards imprisoning the family—never realizing her innocent flirtations could mean the difference between life and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1973: When housewife Val Doyle hears her father’s end-of-life confession, “I didn’t want to kill her,” she’s stunned. So, she begins a search for the truth—about his words and her past. The clues she discovers are baffling—a jewel-encrusted box that won’t open and a camera with its film intact. What she finds out pulls Val into one of the world’s greatest mysteries—what really happened to the lost Romanov daughter? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I read one of Gill Paul’s novels last year and loved it. I was so excited to see that she was writing a novel about the Romanov family that was coming out in August. Rather than pick up one of her other novels, I decided to hold off and wait for this one to come out.<br /><br />The Romanov traged...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third in a tasty series, Murder Lo Mein by Vivien Chien is a delight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone agrees that the food at Ho-Lee Noodle House is delicious—unless it happens to be deadly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lana Lee’s stake in her family’s Chinese restaurant is higher than ever now that she’s been made manager. So when she enters Ho-Lee into Cleveland’s Best Noodle Contest, Lana makes it her business to win—at all costs. But when a local food critic receives a threatening note in a fortune cookie and is later found dead, face-down in a bowl of lo mein, all bets are off. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, along with her sweet-and-sour boyfriend Detective Adam Trudeau, Lana decides to take matters into her own hands and dig into the lives of everyone involved in the contest. But when she receives an ill-fated fortune, Lana realizes that in order to save the reputation of her restaurant, she needs to save herself first. .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this breathtakingly bold, intricately constructed novel set in 18th century Stockholm, a dying man searches among the city’s teeming streets, dark corners, and intriguing inhabitants to unmask a ruthless murderer—perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Perfume&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Alienist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1793. Four years after the storming of the Bastille in France and more than a year after the death of King Gustav III of Sweden, paranoia and whispered conspiracies are Stockholm’s daily bread. A promise of violence crackles in the air as ordinary citizens feel increasingly vulnerable to the whims of those in power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mickel Cardell, a crippled ex-solider and former night watchman, finds a mutilated body floating in the city’s malodorous lake, he feels compelled to give the unidentifiable man a proper burial. For Cecil Winge, a brilliant lawyer turned consulting detective to the Stockholm police, a body with no arms, legs, or eyes is a formidable puzzle and one last chance to set things right before he loses his battle to consumption. Together, Winge and Cardell scour Stockholm to discover the body’s identity, encountering the sordid underbelly of the city’s elite. Meanwhile, Kristofer Blix—the handsome son of a farmer—leaves rural life for the alluring charms of the capital and ambitions of becoming a doctor. His letters to his sister chronicle his wild good times and terrible misfortunes, which lead him down a treacherous path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another corner of the city, a young woman—Anna-Stina—is consigned to the workhouse after she upsets her parish priest. Her unlikely escape plan takes on new urgency when a sadistic guard marks her as his next victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the novel, these extraordinary characters cross paths and collide in shocking and unforgettable ways. Niklas Natt och Dag paints a deliciously dark portrait of late 18th century Stockholm, and the frightful yet fascinating reality lurking behind the powdered and painted veneer of the era.</description>

  <description>In the dying days of World War Two, Pavel Romasko and his Red Army colleagues pick their way through the carnage and detritus of a dying Berlin. Stumbling upon the smoking remains of a Nazi bunker, they find something inside that eclipses the horror of even the worst excesses in the city above them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the war ends, retribution begins. But some revenge cannot be taken at once. Some revenge takes years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it is, as post-war Europe tries desperately to drag itself back onto its feet, and soldiers attempt a return to normality, that retribution continues to ferment in the Gulags of the Soviet Union and beneath the surface of apparently ordinary lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is how, seventy years later, FBI agent Carla Romero and New York lawyer Gabriel Hall are enlisted to investigate a series of blood-chilling crimes that seem to have their roots in the distant past — even though the suffering they cause is all too present. And for one of them, the disappearance of young women is a particularly personal matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blameless Dead is an epic, compelling, edge-of-the-seat drama that sweeps the reader from twentieth century Europe to modern-day New York, taking in some of the most important events of modern history and exposing them in honest and unflinching terms. Part murder-mystery, part historical novel and shot through with adrenaline-pumping action, this novel superbly demonstrates that, while the hostilities may cease and the peace be signed, the horror that is war is never really over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: In the UK, this book is published under the title &lt;/i&gt;The Love Letter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this suspenseful and heart-pounding novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Lucinda Riley, an ambitious young journalist unravels a dangerous mystery that threatens to devastate the British monarchy. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keeping secrets is a dangerous game.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When Sir James Harrison, one the greatest actors of his generation, passes away at the age of ninety-five, he leaves behind not just a heartbroken family but also a secret so shocking, it could rock the English establishment to its core.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Joanna Haslam, an up-and-coming reporter, is assigned to cover the legendary actor’s funeral, attended by glitzy celebrities of every background. But Joanna stumbles on something dark beneath the glamour: the mention of a letter James Harrison has left behind—the contents of which many have been desperate to keep concealed for over seventy years. As she peels back the veil of lies that has shrouded the secret, she realizes that she’s close to uncovering something deadly serious—and the royal family may be implicated. Before long, someone is on her tracks, attempting to prevent her from discovering the truth. And they’ll stop at nothing to reach the letter before she does.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Full of salacious scandal, shocking twists, and captivating romance, and written in Lucinda Riley’s signature “vividly drawn and lushly atmospheric” (&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) prose, &lt;i&gt;The Royal Secret &lt;/i&gt;is “a full-throttle escapist adventure” (&lt;i&gt;Lancashire Evening Post&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Light We Lost&lt;/i&gt; comes a tender and moving new novel about a woman at a crossroads after the death of her father, and caught between the love of two men.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nina has always known who she's supposed to be. But is that who she truly is?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Gregory has always been a good daughter. Raised by her father, owner of New York City's glamorous Gregory Hotels, Nina was taught that family, reputation, and legacy are what matter most. And Tim--her devoted boyfriend and best friend since childhood--feels the same. But when Nina's father dies, he leaves behind a secret that shocks Nina to her core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her world falls apart, Nina begins to see the men in her life--her father, her boyfriend, and unexpectedly, her boss, Rafael--in a new light. Soon Nina finds herself caught between the world she loves, and a passion that could upend everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Than Words &lt;/i&gt;is a heartbreaking and romantic novel about grief, loss, love, and self-discovery, and how we choose which life we are meant to live.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wrexford and Sloane must unravel secrets within secrets—including a few that entangle their own hearts—when they reunite to solve a string of shocking murders that have horrified Regency London...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though Charlotte Sloane’s secret identity as the controversial satirical cartoonist A.J. Quill is safe with the Earl of Wrexford, she’s ill prepared for the rippling effects sharing the truth about her background has cast over their relationship. She thought a bit of space might improve the situation. But when her cousin is murdered and his twin brother is accused of the gruesome crime, Charlotte immediately turns to Wrexford for help in proving the young man’s innocence. Though she finds the brooding scientist just as enigmatic and intense as ever, their partnership is now marked by an unfamiliar tension that seems to complicate every encounter.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite this newfound complexity, Wrexford and Charlotte are determined to track down the real killer. Their investigation leads them on a dangerous chase through Mayfair’s glittering ballrooms and opulent drawing rooms, where gossip and rumors swirl to confuse the facts. Was her cousin murdered over a romantic rivalry . . . or staggering gambling debts? Or could the motive be far darker and involve the clandestine scientific society that claimed both brothers as members? The more Charlotte and Wrexford try to unknot the truth, the more tangled it becomes. But they must solve the case soon, before the killer’s madness seizes another victim...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and “remarkable reading phenomenon” (&lt;i&gt;Lancashire Post&lt;/i&gt;) Lucinda Riley, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Moon Sister&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; transports you to the grandeur of the remote Scottish Highlands and the gypsy caves of Granada, just as Spain descends into civil war, interweaving the stories of two women searching for their destinies, at the risk of potentially losing their chance at love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiggy D’Aplièse spends her days experiencing the raw beauty of the Scottish Highlands doing a job she loves at a deer sanctuary. But when the sanctuary is forced to close, she is offered a job as a wildlife consultant on the vast and isolated estate of the elusive and troubled laird, Charlie Kinnaird. She has no idea that the move will not only irrevocably alter her future, but also bring her face-to-face with her past.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the estate, she meets Chilly, a gypsy who fled from Spain seventy years before. He tells her that not only does she possess a sixth sense passed down from her ancestors, but it was foretold long ago that he would be the one to send her back home…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In 1912, in the poor gypsy community outside the city walls of Granada, Lucía Amaya-Albaycin is born. Destined to be the greatest flamenco dancer of her generation—and named La Candela, due to the inner flame that burns through her when she dances— Lucía is whisked away by her ambitious and talented guitarist father at the tender age of ten to dance in the flamenco bars of Barcelona. Her mother is devastated by the loss of her daughter and as civil war threatens in Spain, tragedy strikes the rest of her family. Now in Madrid, Lucía and her troupe of dancers are forced to flee for their lives, their journey taking them far across the water to South America and eventually, to North America and New York—Lucía’s long-held dream. But to pursue it, she must choose between her passion for her career and the man she adores.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Featuring Lucinda Riley’s “addictive storytelling with a moving, emotional heart” (Dinah Jeffries), &lt;i&gt;The Moon Sister &lt;/i&gt;follows these two women on their journey to discover their true futures—but at the risk of potentially losing the men they had hoped to build futures with.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the Pulitzer Prize finalist &lt;i&gt;Maud's Line&lt;/i&gt;, an epic novel that follows a web of complex family alliances and culture clashes in the Cherokee Nation during the aftermath of the Civil War, and the unforgettable woman at its center.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the early spring of 1875 in the Cherokee Nation West. A baby, a black hired hand, a bay horse, a gun, a gold stash, and a preacher have all gone missing. Cherokee America Singer, known as "Check," a wealthy farmer, mother of five boys, and soon-to-be widow, is not amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this epic of the American frontier, several plots intertwine around the heroic and resolute Check: her son is caught in a compromising position that results in murder; a neighbor disappears; another man is killed. The tension mounts and the violence escalates as Check's mixed race family, friends, and neighbors come together to protect their community--and painfully expel one of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cherokee America&lt;/i&gt; vividly, and often with humor, explores the bonds--of blood and place, of buried histories and half-told tales, of past grief and present injury--that connect a colorful, eclectic cast of characters, anchored by the clever, determined, and unforgettable Check.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From internationally bestselling author Cara Hunter, a riveting suspense novel about the shocking secrets revealed when a woman is discovered held captive behind a basement wall—and no one is who they appear to be&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you know what they’re hiding in the house next door?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman and child are found locked in a basement, barely alive, and unidentifiable: the woman can’t speak, there are no missing persons reports that match their profile, and the confused, elderly man who owns the house claims he has never seen them before. The inhabitants of the quiet street are in shock—how could this happen right under their noses? But Detective Inspector Adam Fawley knows nothing is impossible. And no one is as innocent as they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the police grow desperate for a lead, Fawley stumbles across a breakthrough, a link to a case he worked years before about another young woman and child gone missing, never solved. When he realizes the missing woman’s house is directly adjacent to the house in this case, he thinks he might have found the connection that could bring justice for both women. But there’s something not quite right about the little boy from the basement, and the truth will send shockwaves through the force that Fawley never could have anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply unsettling, heart-stopping mystery of long-buried secrets and the monsters who hide in plain sight, In the Dark is the second gripping novel featuring DI Adam Fawley.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A captivating novel of Renaissance Italy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; detailing the mysterious life of Bartolomeo Scappi, the legendary chef to several popes and author of one of the bestselling cookbooks of all time,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the nephew who sets out to discover his late uncle’s secrets—including the identity of the noblewoman Bartolomeo loved until he died.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bartolomeo Scappi dies in 1577, he leaves his vast estate—properties, money, and his position—to his nephew and apprentice Giovanni. He also gives Giovanni the keys to two strongboxes and strict instructions to burn their contents. Despite Scappi’s dire warning that the information concealed in those boxes could put Giovanni’s life and others at risk, Giovanni is compelled to learn his uncle’s secrets. He undertakes the arduous task of decoding Scappi’s journals and uncovers a history of deception, betrayal, and murder—all to protect an illicit love affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Giovanni pieces together the details of Scappi’s past, he must contend with two rivals who have joined forces—his brother Cesare and Scappi’s former protégé, Domenico Romoli, who will do anything to get his hands on the late chef’s recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With luscious prose that captures the full scale of the sumptuous feasts for which Scappi was known, &lt;i&gt;The Chef’s Secret &lt;/i&gt;serves up power&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;intrigue, and passion, bringing Renaissance Italy to life in a delectable fashion.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Colleen Coble delivers her signature blend of romance and suspense when Brenna Fleming flees to a cabin in Lavender Tides only to discover that everything she believed about herself has been a lie.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months after her wedding, Bailey Fleming discovers she wasn't really married to Kyle Bearcroft. He's already married to another woman and seems to be involved in a shadowy underworld. Kyle tries to pay her off by putting a cabin located in Lavender Tides, Washington, in her name. She doesn’t plan to accept his bribe but ends up fleeing there after her mother is found murdered and an attempt is made on her life too. Bailey was hoping for a quiet place to figure out who is after her, but she finds the cabin filled with secrets and even more danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI agent Joe Phoenix has been watching Cedar Cabin in hopes of bringing down a trafficking ring, one he believes has taken his younger sister. He doesn’t know what to make of Bailey’s sudden appearance. Is she part of the trafficking ring or someone he needs to protect? When the danger at Cedar Cabin increases, they have to join forces to save Bailey from the man who would do anything to keep a past murder buried, and to expose a trafficking ring that has enslaved young women, including Joe’s sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation is further complicated when Bailey discovers nothing in her life is as it seems—not even her own identity. Everything points back to an earthquake on the day she was born, but why? With lies coming at her from every direction, can she trust anyone, even Joe?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“The greatest works of poetry are the stories we tell about ourselves."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the renowned poet Fiona Skinner is asked about the inspiration behind her iconic work, &lt;i&gt;The Love Poem&lt;/i&gt;, she tells her audience a story about her family and a betrayal that reverberates through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins in a big yellow house, with a funeral, an iron poker, and a brief variation forever known as the Pause: a free and feral summer in a middle-class Connecticut town. Caught between the predictable life they once led and an uncertain future that stretches before them, the Skinner siblings—fierce Renee, sensitive Caroline, golden-boy Joe and watchful Fiona—emerge from the Pause staunchly loyal and deeply connected.  Two decades later, the siblings find themselves once again confronted with a family crisis that tests the strength of these bonds and forces them to question the life choices they’ve made and to ask what, exactly, they are willing to do for love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping yet intimate epic about one American family, &lt;i&gt;The Last Romantics&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable exploration of the ties that bind us together, the responsibilities we embrace and the duties we resent, and how we can lose—and sometimes rescue—the ones we love. A novel that pierces the heart and lingers in the mind, it is also a beautiful meditation on the power of stories—how they guide us through difficult times, help us understand the past, and point the way toward our future.</description>

  <description>The follow-up to Susan Gloss’s successful debut, &lt;i&gt;Vintage&lt;/i&gt;, is a charming mid-western story of artists, inspiration, and how to reinvent your life with purpose and flair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nell Parker has a PhD in Art History, a loving husband named Josh, and a Craftsman bungalow in the charming university town of Madison, WI. But in secret, Nell’s heart is still reeling from the tragic way in which they lost the one baby they managed to conceive. Rather than pausing to grieve, she pushes harder for testing and fertility treatments, hiding the high cost from her husband. Although he’s in the dark about their mounting debt, Josh urges Nell to apply for jobs, believing his wife needs something else to focus on other than a baby that may never be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a job turns out to be difficult for an art historian . . . until Nell sees the ad seeking a director for a new nonprofit called the Mansion Hill Artists' Colony. The colony is the brainchild of the late, unconventional society dame Betsy Barrett, who left behind her vast fortune and a killer collection of modern art to establish an artist-in-residency program to be run out of her lakeside mansion. The executor of Betsy's estate simply hands Nell a set of house keys and wishes her luck, leaving her to manage the mansion and the eccentric personalities of the artists who live there on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon one of the artists, a young metal sculptor named Odin, is keeping the other residents awake with his late-night welding projects. Nell is pretty sure that Annie, a dreadlocked granny known for her avant garde performance pieces, is dealing drugs out of the basement "studio." Meanwhile Paige, an art student from the university, takes up residence in the third-floor turret, experimenting with new printing and design techniques, as well as leading a string of bad boyfriends upstairs when she stumbles home late at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all the drama, Nell finds something akin to a family among the members of the creative community that she’s brought together. And when her attraction to Odin begins to heat up, Nell is forced to decide what will bring her greater joy—the creative, inspired world she's created, or the familiar but increasingly fragile one of her marriage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In turn-of-the century New York, a mobster rises—and his favorite sister struggles between loyalty and life itself. How far will she go when he commits murder?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After midnight, Thelma Lorber enters her brother Abie’s hangout under the Williamsburg Bridge, finding Jewish mobster Louis “Pretty” Amberg in a puddle of blood on the kitchen floor. She could flee. Instead, in the dark hours of that October 1935 night before the dawn of Murder, Inc., she remains beside the fierce, funny brother who has nurtured and protected her since childhood. There are many kinds of love a woman can feel for a man, but few compare to that of the baby sister for her older brother. For Thelma, a wild widow tethered to a young son, Abie is the center of her world. But that love is about to undo everything she holds dear…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flipping the familiar script of &lt;i&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Boardwalk Empire&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bittersweet Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt; explores the shattering impact of mob violence on the women expected to mop up the mess. Winding its way over decades, this haunting family saga plunges readers into a dangerous past—revealed through the perspective of a forgotten yet vibrant woman.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;November, 1941.&lt;/em&gt; She’s never even seen the ocean before, but Eva Cassidy has her reasons for making the crossing to Hawaii, and they run a lot deeper than escaping a harsh Michigan winter. Newly enlisted as an Army Corps nurse, Eva is stunned by the splendor she experiences aboard the steamship &lt;em&gt;SS Lurline&lt;/em&gt;; even more so by Lt. Clark Spencer, a man she is drawn to but who clearly has secrets of his own. But Eva’s past—and the future she’s trying to create—means that she’s not free to follow her heart. Clark is a navy intelligence officer, and he warns her that the United States won’t be able to hold off joining the war for long, but nothing can prepare them for the surprise attack that will change the world they know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Eva and her fellow nurses band together for the immense duty of keeping the American wounded alive. And the danger that finds Eva threatens everything she holds dear. Amid the chaos and heartbreak, Eva will have to decide whom to trust and how far she will go to protect those she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the vibrant tropical surroundings of the Pacific, &lt;em&gt;The Lieutenant’s Nurse&lt;/em&gt; is an evocative, emotional WWII story of love, friendship and the resilient spirit of the heroic nurses of Pearl Harbor.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;History takes on vivid life in the stunning first full-length installment of Tamera Alexander's new series, The Carnton Novels.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the night of November 30, 1864, a brutal battle in Franklin, Tennessee, all but decimates the Confederacy and nearly kills Captain Roland Ward Jones. A decorated Mississippi sharpshooter, Jones has a vision on the battlefield and, despite the severity of his wounds, believes his life will be spared. But a life without his leg, he can't abide. He compels Elizabeth "Lizzie" Clouston—governess to the McGavock family at the Carnton mansion—to intervene should the surgeon decide to amputate. True to her word, Lizzie speaks on his behalf and saves not only the captain's leg but also his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a fourteen-year-old soldier dies in Lizzie's arms that night, the boy's final words, whispered with urgency, demand that Lizzie deliver them to their intended recipient. But all she has is the boy's first name. And, as she soon discovers, there's no record of him ever having enlisted. How can she set out alone across a land so divided by war and hatred to honor her pledge? Even more, does she dare accept Captain Jones's offer to accompany her? As he coalesces at Carnton, romance has blossomed between him and Lizzie—a woman already betrothed to a man she does not love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the pages of history and the personal accounts of those who endured the Battle of Franklin, Tamera Alexander weaves the real-life love letters between Captain Roland Ward Jones and Elizabeth Clouston into a story of unlikely romance first kindled amid the shadows of war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sumptuously magical, brand new take on a tale as old as time—read the Beast's side of the story at long last.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am neither monster nor man—yet I am both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the Beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day I was cursed to this wretched existence was the day I was saved—although it did not feel so at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My redemption sprung from contemptible roots; I am not proud of what I did the day her father happened upon my crumbling, isolated chateau. But if loneliness breeds desperation then I was desperate indeed, and I did what I felt I must. My shameful behaviour was unjustly rewarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Isabeau. She opened my eyes, my mind and my heart; she taught me how to be human again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I might lose her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lose yourself in this gorgeously rich and magical retelling of &lt;i&gt;The Beauty and the Beast&lt;/i&gt; that finally lays bare the beast's heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Tuscan Child &lt;/i&gt;comes a beautiful and heart-rending novel of a woman’s love and sacrifice during the First World War.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Great War continues to take its toll, headstrong twenty-one-year-old Emily Bryce is determined to contribute to the war effort. She is convinced by a cheeky and handsome Australian pilot that she can do more, and it is not long before she falls in love with him and accepts his proposal of marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he is sent back to the front, Emily volunteers as a “land girl,” tending to the neglected grounds of a large Devonshire estate. It’s here that Emily discovers the long-forgotten journals of a medicine woman who devoted her life to her herbal garden. The journals inspire Emily, and in the wake of devastating news, they are her saving grace. Emily’s lover has not only died a hero but has left her terrified—and with child. Since no one knows that Emily was never married, she adopts the charade of a war widow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Emily learns more about the volatile power of healing with herbs, the found journals will bring her to the brink of disaster, but may open a path to her destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the runaway bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Orphan’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; comes a remarkable story of friendship and courage centered around three women and a ring of female spies during World War II.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1946, Manhattan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Healey is rebuilding her life after losing her husband during the war. One morning while passing through Grand Central Terminal on her way to work, she finds an abandoned suitcase tucked beneath a bench. Unable to resist her own curiosity, Grace opens the suitcase, where she discovers a dozen photographs—each of a different woman. In a moment of impulse, Grace takes the photographs and quickly leaves the station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace soon learns that the suitcase belonged to a woman named Eleanor Trigg, leader of a ring of female secret agents who were deployed out of London during the war. Twelve of these women were sent to Occupied Europe as couriers and radio operators to aid the resistance, but they never returned home, their fates a mystery. Setting out to learn the truth behind the women in the photographs, Grace finds herself drawn to a young mother turned agent named Marie, whose daring mission overseas reveals a remarkable story of friendship, valor and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vividly rendered and inspired by true events, New York Times bestselling author Pam Jenoff shines a light on the incredible heroics of the brave women of the war, and weaves a mesmerizing tale of courage, sisterhood and the great strength of women to survive in the hardest of circumstances</description>

  <description>A dazzling novel of two sisters and their emotional journey through love, loyalty, and heartbreak&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Chinese-American sisters--Miranda, the older, responsible one, always her younger sister's protector; Lucia, the headstrong, unpredictable one, whose impulses are huge and, often, life changing. When Lucia starts hearing voices, it is Miranda who must find a way to reach her sister. Lucia impetuously plows ahead, but the bitter constant is that she is, in fact, mentally ill. Lucia lives life on a grand scale, until, inevitably, she crashes to earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miranda leaves her own self-contained life in Switzerland to rescue her sister again--but only Lucia can decide whether she wants to be saved. The bonds of sisterly devotion stretch across oceans--but what does it take to break them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everything Here Is Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is, at its heart, an immigrant story, and a young woman's quest to find fulfillment and a life unconstrained by her illness. But it's also an unforgettable, gut-wrenching story of the sacrifices we make to truly love someone--and when loyalty to one's self must prevail over all.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;British intelligence operative and hardened assassin, Max McLean, battles a nightmarish enemy in this stunning debut thriller from an award winning war correspondent. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to killing terrorists British intelligence has always had one man they could rely on, Max McLean. As an assassin, he's never missed, but Max has made one miscalculation and now he has to pay the price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His handlers send him to Sierra Leone on a seemingly one-way mission. What he finds is a horror from beyond his nightmares. Rebel forces are loose in the jungle and someone or something is slaughtering innocent villagers. It's his job to root out the monster behind these abominations, but he soon discovers that London may consider him the most disposable piece in this operation.</description>

  <description>An intimate portrait of the close friendship and powerful creative partnership between two of Hollywood’s earliest female superstars: Frances Marion and Mary Pickford. An enchanting new novel from the New York Times bestselling author of The Swans of Fifth Avenue and The Aviator’s Wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood, 1914. Frances Marion, a young writer desperate for a break, meets “America’s Sweetheart,” Mary Pickford, already making a name for herself both on and off the screen with her golden curls and lively spirit. Together, these two women will take the movie business by storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Pickford becomes known as the “Queen of the Movies”—the first actor to have her name on a movie marquee, and the first to become a truly international celebrity. Mary and her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, were America’s first Royal Couple, living in a home more famous that Buckingham Palace. Mary won the first Academy Award for Best Actress in a Talkie and was the first to put her hand and footprints in Grauman’s theater sidewalk. Her annual salary in 1919 was $625,000—at a time when women’s salaries peaked at $10 a week. Frances Marion is widely considered one of the most important female screenwriters of the 20th century, and was the first writer to win multiple Academy Awards. The close personal friendship between the two stars was closely linked to their professional collaboration and success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a novel about power: the power of women during the exhilarating early years of Hollywood, and the power of forgiveness. It’s also about the imbalance of power, then and now, and the sacrifices and compromises women must make in order to succeed. And at its heart, it’s a novel about the power of female friendship.</description>

  <description>Before Meghan and Harry, another American ‘princess’ captured the hand of an English aristocrat.  Now, Karen Harper tells the tale of Consuelo Vanderbilt, her “The Wedding of the Century” to the Duke of Marlborough, and her quest to find meaning behind “the glitter and the gold.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cold November day in 1895, a carriage approaches St Thomas Episcopal Church on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. Massive crowds surge forward, awaiting their glimpse of heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt. Just 18, the beautiful bride has not only arrived late, but in tears, yet her marriage to the aloof Duke of Marlborough proceeds. Bullied into the wedding by her indomitable mother, Alva, Consuelo loves another. But a deal was made, trading some of the vast Vanderbilt wealth for a title and prestige, and Consuelo, bred to obey, realizes she must make the best of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Blenheim Palace, Consuelo is confronted with an overwhelming list of duties, including producing an “heir and a spare,” but her relationship with the duke quickly disintegrates. Consuelo finds an inner strength, charming everyone from debutantes to diplomats including Winston Churchill, as she fights for women’s suffrage. And when she takes a scandalous leap, can she hope to attain love at last…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the dawning of the opulent Gilded Age, to the battles of the Second World War, &lt;em&gt;American Duchess&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting tale of one woman’s quest to attain independence—at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Based on his wildly popular &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; piece, Thurber Prize-winner John Kenney presents a hilarious collection of love poems for, well, married people. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of brilliant wit, dynamic energy, and a heavy dose of reality, &lt;i&gt;Love Poems for Married People&lt;/i&gt; takes the poetic form, turns it upside down and leaves it in the dishwasher to dry. Inspired by one of the most shared &lt;i&gt;New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;pieces of all time, this collection captures the reality of life once the spark of a relationship has settled--and hilariously so. With brand new pieces that cover all areas of married life, from parental gripes to dwindling sex lives, Kenney's wry observations and sharp humor remind us exactly what it's like to spend the rest of your life with the person you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was almost feeling fondness for you&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; As you gave me a shoulder massage at the sink--&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; What a small, lovely surprise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; And then you grabbed my boobs and made a "wha-wha" noise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; In an instant, I felt disgust and sadness and regret.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Seraphine Mayes and her twin brother Danny were born in the middle of summer at their family’s estate on the Norfolk coast. Within hours of their birth, their mother threw herself from the cliffs, the au pair fled, and the village thrilled with whispers of dark cloaks, changelings, and the aloof couple who drew a young nanny into their inner circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now an adult, Seraphine mourns the recent death of her father. While going through his belongings, she uncovers a family photograph that raises dangerous questions. It was taken on the day the twins were born, and in the photo, their mother, surrounded by her husband and her young son, is beautifully dressed, smiling serenely, and holding just one baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the child and what really happened that day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person knows the truth, if only Seraphine can find her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Sullivan’s Crossing, #1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr has created a place where good people, powerful emotions, great humor and a healthy dose of common sense are the key ingredients to a happy life. Sullivan’s Crossing brings out the best in people. It’s a place you’ll want to visit again and again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Leigh Culver loves practicing medicine in Timberlake, Colorado. It is a much-needed change of pace from her stressful life in Chicago. The only drawback is she misses her aunt Helen, the woman who raised her. But it’s time that Leigh has her independence, and she hopes the beauty of the Colorado wilderness will entice her aunt to visit often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen Culver is an independent woman who lovingly raised her sister’s orphaned child. Now, with Leigh grown, it’s time for her to live life for herself. The retired teacher has become a successful mystery writer who loves to travel and intends to never experience winter again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Helen visits Leigh, she is surprised to find her niece still needs her, especially when it comes to sorting out her love life. But the biggest surprise comes when Leigh takes Helen out to Sullivan’s Crossing and Helen finds herself falling for the place and one special person. Helen and Leigh will each have to decide if they can open themselves up to love neither expected to find and seize the opportunity to live their best lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A love story about what happens after you meet, or rather, &lt;i&gt;don't &lt;/i&gt;meet the one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurie is pretty sure love at first sight doesn't exist anywhere but the movies. But then, through a misted-up bus window one snowy December day, she sees a man who she knows instantly is the one. Their eyes meet, there's a moment of pure magic...and then her bus drives away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain they're fated to find each other again, Laurie spends a year scanning every bus stop and cafe in London for him. But she doesn't find him, not when it matters anyway. Instead they "reunite" at a Christmas party, when her best friend Sarah giddily introduces her new boyfriend to Laurie. It's Jack, the man from the bus. It would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows for Laurie, Sarah and Jack is ten years of friendship, heartbreak, missed opportunities, roads not taken, and destinies reconsidered. &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; is a joyous, heartwarming and immensely moving love story to escape into and a reminder that fate takes inexplicable turns along the route to happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Life is sweet once you step into Torte, everybody's favorite small-town bakeshop. But what happens when it becomes the scene of a crime?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat is on for pastry chef, family business operator, and unlikely sleuth Jules Capshaw. Just when she thought she could enjoy some time away from the kitchen, Jules manages to discover a skull during a picnic by the lake. As if unearthing remains that may be connected to a missing-persons case from the 1960s isn't enough on her plate, Jules must contend with the unsolved matter of her own marriage while her estranged husband Carlos sails the open seas, awaiting a verdict. Then there's Jules's bitter landlord Edgar, who is intent on making a sweet deal on a vacant lot down the block from Torte--until he turns up dead. If only Jules could find a recipe that would let her bake her cake and eat it, too...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A suspenseful historical YA debut inspired by the true story of an all-female bomber unit in Russia during World War II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World War II has erupted in Valka’s homeland of Russia, and Valka is determined to help the effort. She’s a pilot—and a good one—so she eagerly joins an all-female bomber regiment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flying has always meant freedom and exhilaration for Valka, but dropping bombs on German targets is something else entirely. The raids are dangerous, but as Valka watches her fellow pilots putting everything on the line in the face of treachery, she learns the true meaning of bravery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the war intensifies, though, and those around her fall, Valka must decide how much she is willing to risk to defend the skies she once called home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the true story of a famous all-female Russian bomber regiment, Gwen C. Katz weaves a tale of strength and sacrifice, of learning to fight for yourself, and of the perils of a world at war.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 19 hrs 3 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African-American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed &lt;i&gt;Carpool Karaoke&lt;/i&gt;, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, &lt;i&gt;Becoming&lt;/i&gt; is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;London, 1969. With the Swinging Sixties under way, Detectives Arthur Bryant and John May find themselves caught in the middle of a good, old-fashioned manor house murder mystery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to believe, but even positively ancient sleuths like Bryant and May of the Peculiar Crimes Unit were young once . . . or at least younger. Flashback to London 1969: mods and dolly birds, sunburst minidresses--but how long would the party last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After accidentally sinking a barge painted like the Yellow Submarine, Bryant and May are relegated to babysitting one Monty Hatton-Jones, the star prosecution witness in the trial of a disreputable developer whose prefabs are prone to collapse. The job for the demoted detectives? Keep the whistle-blower safe for one weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The task proves unexpectedly challenging when their unruly charge insists on attending a party at the vast estate Tavistock Hall. With falling stone gryphons, secret passageways, rumors of a mythical beast, and an all-too-real dismembered corpse, the bedeviled policemen soon find themselves with "a proper country house murder" on their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped for the weekend, Bryant and May must sort the victims from the suspects, including a hippie heir, a blond nightclub singer, and Monty himself--and &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; is quite who he or she seems to be.</description>

  <description>West Hall, Vermont, has always been a town of strange disappearances and old legends. The most mysterious is that of Sara Harrison Shea, who, in 1908, was found dead in the field behind her house just months after the tragic death of her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in present day, nineteen-year-old Ruthie lives in Sara's farmhouse with her mother, Alice, and her younger sister. Alice has always insisted that they live off the grid, a decision that has weighty consequences when Ruthie wakes up one morning to find that Alice has vanished. In her search for clues, she is startled to find a copy of Sara Harrison Shea's diary hidden beneath the floorboards of her mother's bedroom. As Ruthie gets sucked into the historical mystery, she discovers that she's not the only person looking for someone that they've lost. But she may be the only one who can stop history from repeating itself.</description>

  <description>With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally bestselling author George R. R. Martin, this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice &amp;amp; Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros.</description>

  <description>In eighteenth century London, porcelain is the most seductive of commodities; fortunes are made and lost upon it. Kings do battle with knights and knaves for possession of the finest pieces and the secrets of their manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Genevieve Planché, an English-born descendant of Huguenot refugees, porcelain holds far less allure; she wants to be an artist, a painter of international repute, but nobody takes the idea of a female artist seriously in London. If only she could reach Venice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Genevieve meets the charming Sir Gabriel Courtenay, he offers her an opportunity she can’t refuse; if she learns the secrets of porcelain, he will send her to Venice. But in particular, she must learn the secrets of the colour blue… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ensuing events take Genevieve deep into England’s emerging industrial heartlands, where not only does she learn about porcelain, but also about the art of industrial espionage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the heart and spirit of her Huguenot ancestors, Genevieve faces her challenges head on, but how much is she willing to suffer in pursuit and protection of the colour blue?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A PROUD BEAUTY &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Society beauty Sylvia Stafford is far too pragmatic to pine. When the tragic death of her gamester father leaves her destitute and alone, she finds work as a governess in a merchant's household in Cheapside. Isolated from the fashionable acquaintance of her youth, she resigns herself to lonely spinsterhood until a mysterious visitor convinces her to temporarily return to her former life--and her former love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SCARRED BEAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colonel Sebastian Conrad is no longer the dashing cavalry officer Sylvia once fell in love with. Badly scarred during the Sepoy Rebellion, he has withdrawn to his estate in rural Hertfordshire where he lives in near complete seclusion. Brooding and tormented, he cares nothing for the earldom he has inherited--and even less for the faithless beauty who rejected him three years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SECOND CHANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week together in the remote Victorian countryside is the last thing either of them ever wanted. But when fate intervenes to reunite them, will a beastly earl and an impoverished beauty finally find their happily-ever-after? Or are some fairy-tale endings simply not meant to be?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A Dutiful Daughter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Appersett is quite willing to marry outside of her class to ensure the survival of her family. But the darkly handsome Mr. Edward Sharpe is no run of the mill London merchant. He's grim and silent. A man of little emotion--or perhaps no emotion at all. After two months of courtship, she's ready to put an end to things. After all, even a dutiful daughter has her limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Taciturn Tradesman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ned has come a long way since his days working as a draper's assistant. He's wealthy, ambitious, and eager to take a wife. But the courtship advice issued in &lt;i&gt;The Gentlemen's Book of Etiquette&lt;/i&gt; isn't all it's cracked up to be. Though he's followed it to the letter, Miss Appersett still doesn't wish to see him again. Frustrated and hurt, he's more than happy to oblige her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Christmas Courtship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Severing ties with her former beau isn't as straightforward as Sophie envisioned. Her parents are outraged. And then there's Charles Darwin, Prince Albert, and that dratted gaslight. What's a girl to do except invite Mr. Sharpe to the annual Christmas party at Appersett House and give him one more chance to win her? But this time there'll be no false formality. This time they'll get to know each other for who they really are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the instant #1 New York Times bestselling author of the “eerie and fascinating” (USA TODAY) The Thirteenth Tale comes a “swift and entrancing, profound and beautiful” (Madeline Miller, internationally bestselling author of Circe) novel about how we explain the world to ourselves, ourselves to others, and the meaning of our lives in a universe that remains impenetrably mysterious.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a dark midwinter’s night in an ancient inn on the river Thames, an extraordinary event takes place. The regulars are telling stories to while away the dark hours, when the door bursts open on a grievously wounded stranger. In his arms is the lifeless body of a small child. Hours later, the girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life. Is it a miracle? Is it magic? Or can science provide an explanation? These questions have many answers, some of them quite dark indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who dwell on the river bank apply all their ingenuity to solving the puzzle of the girl who died and lived again, yet as the days pass the mystery only deepens. The child herself is mute and unable to answer the essential questions: Who is she? Where did she come from? And to whom does she belong? But answers proliferate nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three families are keen to claim her. A wealthy young mother knows the girl is her kidnapped daughter, missing for two years. A farming family reeling from the discovery of their son’s secret liaison stand ready to welcome their granddaughter. The parson’s housekeeper, humble and isolated, sees in the child the image of her younger sister. But the return of a lost child is not without complications and no matter how heartbreaking the past losses, no matter how precious the child herself, this girl cannot be everyone’s. Each family has mysteries of its own, and many secrets must be revealed before the girl’s identity can be known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once Upon a River&lt;/i&gt; is a glorious tapestry of a book that combines folklore and science, magic and myth. Suspenseful, romantic, and richly atmospheric, this is “a beguiling tale, full of twists and turns like the river at its heart, and just as rich and intriguing” (M.L. Stedman, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Light Between Oceans&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Solving crime isn’t only for the living.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;In turn-of-the century New York City, the police have an off-the-books spiritual go-to when it comes to solving puzzling corporeal crimes . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Her name is Eve Whitby, gifted medium and spearhead of The Ghost Precinct. When most women are traveling in a gilded society that promises only well-appointed marriage, the confident nineteen-year-old Eve navigates a social circle that carries a different kind of chill. Working with the diligent but skeptical Lieutenant Horowitz, as well as a group of fellow psychics and wayward ghosts, Eve holds her own against detractors and threats to solve New York’s most disturbing crimes as only a medium of her ability can.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But as accustomed as Eve is to ghastly crimes and all matters of the uncanny, even she is unsettled by her department’s latest mystery. Her ghostly conduits are starting to disappear one by one as though snatched away by some evil force determined to upset the balance between two realms, and most important—destroy the Ghost Precinct forever. Now Eve must brave the darkness to find the vanished souls. She has no choice. It’s her job to make sure no one is ever left for dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Falling in love with Daisy was easy for Jack. But finding the courage to tell her becomes problematic when his secret feelings lead to even bigger complications.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years of counseling sessions with Daisy Pendleton, Pastor Jack McReady has earned a permanent spot in her life as a spiritual leader—and nothing more. Jack would never risk losing her trust by exposing the depths of his heart, but he’s hopelessly in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daisy loves her southern small-town life and her job at her family-run flower shop, but she doesn’t have the thing she longs for most: someone to share it with. Her recent foray into online dating has been a disaster—until she meets TJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack could kill his friend Noah for using his initials and some indistinct photos to set up a profile on the dating app Daisy is using. But when he’s finally afforded the opportunity to show her a different side of himself, he’s sucked into the plan before he has time for second thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online, Daisy shares some of her greatest fears with TJ, but in person, Jack and Daisy are spending more time together. When a devastating family secret surfaces, Daisy knows that only her trusted friend and counselor can bring her comfort. Jack wants nothing more than to be both men for Daisy, but revealing his secret will prove to be the ultimate test of Daisy’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A new series about a young woman whose connection to antiques takes her on a magical adventure, reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Witch's Daughter&lt;/i&gt; Paula Brackston returns to her trademark blend of magic and romance to launch a new series guaranteed to enchant her audience even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xanthe and her mother Flora leave London behind for a fresh start, taking over an antique shop in the historic town of Marlborough. Xanthe has always had an affinity with some of the antiques she finds. When she touches them, she can sense something of the past they come from and the stories they hold. So when she has an intense connection to a beautiful silver chatelaine she has to know more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s while she’s examining the chatelaine that she’s transported back to the seventeenth century. And shortly after, she's confronted by a ghost who reveals that this is where the antique has its origins. The ghost tasks Xanthe with putting right the injustice in its story to save an innocent girl’s life, or else it’ll cost her Flora’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Xanthe fights to save her amid the turbulent days of 1605, she meets architect Samuel Appleby. He may be the person who can help her succeed. He may also be the reason she can’t bring herself to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its rich historical detail, strong mother-daughter relationship, and picturesque English village, &lt;i&gt;The Little Shop of Found Things&lt;/i&gt; is poised to be a strong start to this new series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;November 1936. Mayor La Guardia's political future buckles under a missing persons case in New York City. Simultaneously, Lane unravels devastating secrets in the outskirts of Detroit. As two crimes converge, judging friends from enemies can be a dangerous game . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally summoning courage to face the past, Lane Sanders breaks away from her busy job at City Hall to confront childhood nightmares in Rochester, Michigan. An unknown assailant left Lane with scattered memories after viciously murdering her parents. However, one memory of a dazzling solid gold pawn piece remains--and with it lies a startling connection between the midwestern tragedy and a current mystery haunting the Big Apple . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, fears climb in Manhattan after the disappearance of a respected banker and family friend threatens the crippled financial industry and the pristine reputation of Lane's virtuous boss, Mayor Fiorello "Fio" La Guardia. Fio's fight to restore order leads him into more trouble as he meets a familiar foe intent on ending his mayoral term--and his life . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guided by overseas telegrams from the man she loves and painful memories, only Lane can silence old ghosts and derail present-day schemes. But when the investigation awakens a darker side of her own nature, will she and New York City's most prominent movers and shakers still forge ahead into a prosperous new age . . . or is history doomed to repeat itself?</description>

  <description>Seeking peace and safety after a hard childhood, Leah marries Judah, a strong and gentle man, and for the first time in her life Leah believes she can rest easily. But the land is ruled by Antiochus IV, descended from one of Alexander the Great's generals, and when he issues a decree that all Jews are to conform to Syrian laws upon pain of death, devout Jews risk everything to follow the law of Moses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judah's father resists the decree, igniting a war that will cost him his life. But before dying, he commands his son to pick up his sword and continue the fight--or bear responsibility for the obliteration of the land of Judah. Leah, who wants nothing but peace, struggles with her husband's decision--what kind of God would destroy the peace she has sought for so long? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The miraculous story of the courageous Maccabees is told through the eyes of Judah's wife, who learns that love requires courage . . . and sacrifice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Can a gentle giant with a trampled heart show a man who’s been running all his life that sometimes there are monsters worth running towards? &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A werewolf walks into a bar. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tank is working as a bouncer when he notices something odd about the new sexy-as-sin bartender. He’s odorless, he’s amazingly popular with shifters, and he’s terrified. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;A man without a smell. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isaac is trying to escape his past. He hides in San Francisco because everyone knows that there are no werewolves in the Bay Area. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Until one walks into his bar. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Tank figure out Isaac’s secrets in time to save him? And can Isaac forgive Tank for being a wolf in time to learn how to love? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best selling author Gail Carriger (writing as G.L. Carriger) brings you the next in her charming gay werewolves series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The San Andreas Shifter books stand alone and do not have to be read in any particular order. But if you're a stickler this book is preceded by Bryan &amp;amp; Max's story, &lt;i&gt;The Sumage Solution&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delicate Sensibilities? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book contains M/M sexy times, mild themes of dominance and submission, and horrible puns. If you get offended easily, then you probably will. San Andreas Shifter stories contain bad language, dirty deeds, and outright admiration for the San Francisco Bay Area. Not the faint of heart/mouth/tongue. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In Cathy Lamb's gripping and thought-provoking novel, a woman whose memory is shattered must piece together her husband's secrets--and reevaluate her life, love, and relationships . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Natalie Shelton thinks back to how things were before the car accident, she remembers a great marriage. She and her husband, Zack, seem as strong and dependable together as the houses he builds. They live in Portland, Oregon, and Natalie is co-owner of a successful accounting firm. They're happy, she's almost sure of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet as Natalie lies trapped in a coma, unable to communicate though aware of everything around her, she realizes that her husband is hiding something. Zack has always been reticent about his past, which she attributed to an unhappy childhood. Now the strange calls he's receiving, the apologies when he thinks she can't hear him, and her fragmented memories from the morning of the accident suggest a deeper secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she finally awakens, Natalie is determined to find out the truth. Sorting through clues as her brain heals, she realizes she has a rare opportunity--to reexamine the life she's made and the man she's made it with. But as answers come to light, she faces surprising, heartrending decisions, as well as a danger that could upend her world once again, as Zack's past finally catches up with them . . .</description>

  <description>Ascending to the throne was only the beginning... Now Margaret George, the author of The Confessions of Young Nero, weaves a web of politics and passion, as ancient Rome's most infamous emperor cements his place in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the beautiful and cunning Poppaea at his side, Nero Augustus commands the Roman empire, ushering in an unprecedented era of artistic and cultural splendor. Although he has yet to produce an heir, his power is unquestioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the tenth year of his reign, a terrifying prophecy comes to pass and a fire engulfs Rome, reducing entire swaths of the city to rubble. Rumors of Nero's complicity in the blaze start to sow unrest among the populace--and the politicians... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For better or worse, Nero knows that his fate is now tied to Rome's--and he vows to rebuild it as a city that will stun the world. But there are those who find his rampant quest for glory dangerous. Throughout the empire, false friends and spies conspire against him, not understanding what drives him to undertake the impossible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nero will either survive and be the first in his family to escape the web of betrayals that is the Roman court, or be ensnared and remembered as the last radiance of the greatest dynasty the world had ever known.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing Blue Hendricks needs six months into his uneasy reentry into civilian life is trouble in the form of his old friend's kid sister, all grown up and smack in the middle of a dangerous murder investigation. But he didn't become a SEAL to turn his back on the hard stuff, and he can't bring himself to ignore Everly's call for help--no matter how much he knows he's not fit to be around the soft, vibrant woman she's become. Not after the things he's done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everly Campbell is desperate. When her roommate is murdered and the body vanishes, Everly fears she might be next. With no one to believe her, Everly runs to a remote Alaskan town to find a man she only vaguely remembers and his crew of ex-military brothers who could be her only hope. Blue wants to keep things all business but Everly isn't a little girl anymore and the commanding former SEAL is more temptation than she can resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the men on Everly's trail draw closer, Blue will do anything to protect the woman he's starting to think of as his...</description>

  <description>Inspired by Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca, a spellbindingly suspenseful novel set in the moneyed world of the Hamptons, about secrets that refuse to remain buried and consequences that can’t be escaped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a whirlwind romance, a young woman returns to the opulent, secluded Long Island mansion of her new fiancé Max Winter—a wealthy politician and recent widower—and a life of luxury she’s never known. But all is not as it appears at the Asherley estate. The house is steeped in the memory of Max’s beautiful first wife Rebekah, who haunts the young woman’s imagination and feeds her uncertainties, while his very alive teenage daughter Dani makes her life a living hell. She soon realizes there is no clear place for her in this twisted little family: Max and Dani circle each other like cats, a dynamic that both repels and fascinates her, and he harbors political ambitions with which he will allow no woman—alive or dead—to interfere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the soon-to-be second Mrs. Winter grows more in love with Max, and more afraid of Dani, she is drawn deeper into the family’s dark secrets—the kind of secrets that could kill her, too. The Winters is a riveting story about what happens when a family’s ghosts resurface and threaten to upend everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Erin Lindsey takes readers on a chase through Gilded Age Manhattan, filled with wonderful historical details, ghosts, romance, and Pinkerton detectives in Murder on Millionaires' Row, a delightfully charming debut mystery. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Gallagher might dream of bigger things, but she’s content enough with her life as a housemaid. After all, it’s not every girl from Five Points who gets to spend her days in a posh Fifth Avenue brownstone, even if only to sweep its floors. But all that changes on the day her boss, Mr. Thomas Wiltshire, disappears. Rose is certain Mr. Wiltshire is in trouble, but the police treat his disappearance as nothing more than the whims of a rich young man behaving badly. Meanwhile, the friend who reported him missing is suspiciously unhelpful. With nowhere left to turn, Rose takes it upon herself to find her handsome young employer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The investigation takes her from the marble palaces of Fifth Avenue to the sordid streets of Five Points. When a ghostly apparition accosts her on the street, Rose begins to realize that the world around her isn’t at all as it seems―and her place in it is about to change forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lose yourself in the magic, charm and romance of Christmas in the Pacific Northwest as imagined in JoAnn Ross’s heartwarming Honeymoon Harbor series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, Jolene Harper is forever indebted to the mother who encouraged her to fly—all the way to sunny LA and a world away from Honeymoon Harbor. Although Jolene vowed never to look back, returning home isn’t even a question when her mom faces a cancer scare. Which means running into Aiden Mannion all over town, the first boy she ever loved—and lost—and whom she can barely look in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiden’s black-sheep reputation may have diminished when he joined the marines, but everything he’s endured since has left him haunted. Back in Honeymoon Harbor to heal, he’s talked into the interim role of police chief, and the irony isn’t lost on the locals, least of all Aiden. But seeing Jolene after all these years is the unexpected breath of fresh air he’s been missing. He’s never forgotten her through all his tours, but he’s not sure anymore that he’s the man she deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the secret they left between them all those years ago, snow is starting to fall on their picturesque little town, making anything seem possible…maybe even a second chance at first love.</description>

  <description>A sweeping novel from renowned author Stephanie Marie Thornton...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice may be the president's daughter, but she's nobody's darling. As bold as her signature color Alice Blue, the gum-chewing, cigarette-smoking, poker-playing First Daughter discovers that the only way for a woman to stand out in Washington is to make waves--oceans of them. With the canny sophistication of the savviest politician on the Hill, Alice uses her celebrity to her advantage, testing the limits of her power and the seductive thrill of political entanglements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Washington, DC is rife with heartaches and betrayals, and when Alice falls hard for a smooth-talking congressman it will take everything this rebel has to emerge triumphant and claim her place as an American icon. As Alice soldiers through the devastation of two world wars and brazens out a cutting feud with her famous Roosevelt cousins, it's no wonder everyone in the capital refers to her as the Other Washington Monument--and Alice intends to outlast them all.</description>

  <description>Miss Eleanor Sheffield is a talented evaluator of antiquities, trained to know the difference between a genuine artifact and a fraud. But with her father’s passing and her uncle’s decline into dementia, the family business is at risk. In the Victorian era, unmarried Eleanor cannot run Sheffield Brothers alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The death of a longtime client, Baron Lydney, offers an unexpected complication when Eleanor is appointed the temporary trustee of the baron’s legendary collection. She must choose whether to donate the priceless treasures to a museum or allow them to pass to the baron’s only living son, Harry—the man who broke Eleanor’s heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor distrusts the baron’s motives and her own ability to be unbiased regarding Harry’s future. Harry claims to still love her and Eleanor yearns to believe him, but his mysterious comments and actions fuel her doubts. When she learns an Italian beauty accompanied him on his return to England, her lingering hope for a future with Harry dims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the threat of debtor’s prison closing in, Eleanor knows that donating the baron’s collection would win her favor among potential clients, saving Sheffield Brothers. But the more time she spends with Harry, the more her faith in him grows. Might Harry be worthy of his inheritance, and her heart, after all? As pressures mount and time runs out, Eleanor must decide whom she can trust—who in her life is false or true, brass or gold—and what is meant to be treasured.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nancy Naigle, Dear Santa is a heartwarming Christmas story about finding your passion for life and love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela Carson wants nothing more than to be the third-generation to run her family’s holiday store, Heart of Christmas, successfully. They’ve weathered over sixty tourist seasons, major hurricanes, and urban sprawl, in their old decommissioned lighthouse. But the national chain that set up shop in their small North Carolina town of Pleasant Sands may be more than Heart of Christmas can survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Encouraged by her niece to ask Santa for help, Angela gives in and lets the words fly in a way that, if Santa were real, would no doubt land her on the naughty list. What’s the harm when it’s just a computer-generated response?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geoff Paisley has been at his mother’s side running the mega-chain Christmas Galore for the last ten years. When his mother falls ill, Geoff promises to answer the town’s Dear Santa letters in her stead. Soon he realizes the woman he’s been corresponding with on Dear Santa is Angela. How could the woman that grates his every last nerve in person have intrigued him so deeply through those letters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Geoff reveals that he’s her Dear Santa, will Angela be able to set aside their very public feud to embrace the magic of the holiday and possibly find true love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sweeping family saga and love story that offers a vivid and unique portrayal of life in war-torn 1941 Bucharest and life behind the Iron Curtain during the Soviet Union occupation—perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Lilac Girls &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Sarah’s Key&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a freezing night in January 1941, a little Jewish girl is found on the steps of an apartment building in Bucharest. With Romania recently allied with the Nazis, the Jewish population is in grave danger, undergoing increasingly violent persecution. The girl is placed in an orphanage and eventually adopted by a wealthy childless couple who name her Natalia. As she assimilates into her new life, she all but forgets the parents who were forced to leave her behind. They are even further from her mind when Romania falls under Soviet occupation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, as Natalia comes of age in a bleak and hopeless world, traces of her identity pierce the surface of her everyday life, leading gradually to a discovery that will change her destiny. She has a secret crush on Victor, an intense young man who as an impoverished student befriended her family long ago. Years later, when Natalia is in her early twenties and working at a warehouse packing fruit, she and Victor, now an important official in the Communist regime, cross paths again. This time they are fatefully drawn into a passionate affair despite the obstacles swirling around them and Victor’s dark secrets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Natalia is suddenly offered a one-time chance at freedom, Victor is determined to help her escape, even if it means losing her. Natalia must make an agonizing decision: remain in Bucharest with her beloved adoptive parents and the man she has come to love, or seize the chance to finally live life on her own terms, and to confront the painful enigma of her past.</description>

  <description>Toby is a happy-go-lucky charmer who’s dodged a scrape at work and is celebrating with friends when the night takes a turn that will change his life – he surprises two burglars who beat him and leave him for dead. Struggling to recover from his injuries, beginning to understand that he might never be the same man again, he takes refuge at his family’s ancestral home to care for his dying uncle Hugo. Then a skull is found in the trunk of an elm tree in the garden – and as detectives close in, Toby is forced to face the possibility that his past may not be what he has always believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spellbinding standalone from one of the best suspense writers working today, &lt;i&gt;The Witch Elm&lt;/i&gt; asks what we become, and what we’re capable of, when we no longer know who we are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For centuries, the mysterious dark-robed figure has roamed the globe, searching for those whose complicity and cowardice have fed into the rapids of history’s darkest waters—and now, in Sarah Perry’s breathtaking follow-up to &lt;i&gt;The Essex Serpent&lt;/i&gt;, it is heading in our direction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been years since Helen Franklin left England. In Prague, working as a translator, she has found a home of sorts—or, at least, refuge. That changes when her friend Karel discovers a mysterious letter in the library, a strange confession and a curious warning that speaks of Melmoth the Witness, a dark legend found in obscure fairy tales and antique village lore. As such superstition has it, Melmoth travels through the ages, dooming those she persuades to join her to a damnation of timeless, itinerant solitude. To Helen it all seems the stuff of unenlightened fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, unaware, as she wanders the cobblestone streets Helen is being watched. And then Karel disappears. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A &lt;i&gt;Washington Post &lt;/i&gt; and Amazon Charts bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl emerges from the woods, starved, ill, and alone…and collapses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzanne Blakemore hurtles along the Blue Ridge Parkway, away from her overscheduled and completely normal life, and encounters the girl. As Suzanne rushes her to the hospital, she never imagines how the encounter will change her—a change she both fears and desperately needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzanne has the perfect house, a successful husband, and a thriving family. But beneath the veneer of an ideal life, her daughter is rebelling, her son is withdrawing, her husband is oblivious to it all, and Suzanne is increasingly unsure of her place in the world. After her discovery of the ethereal sixteen-year-old who has never experienced civilization, Suzanne is compelled to invite Iris into her family’s life and all its apparent privileges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Iris has an independence, a love of solitude, and a discomfort with materialism that contrasts with everything the Blakemores stand for—qualities that awaken in Suzanne first a fascination, then a longing. Now Suzanne can’t help but wonder: Is she destined to save Iris, or is Iris the one who will save her?</description>

  <description>An old friend calls Catherine Lockhart and Liam Taggart to his famous Italian restaurant to enlist their help. His aunt is being evicted from her home in the Tuscan hills by a powerful corporation claiming they own the deeds, even though she can produce her own set of deeds to her land. Catherine and Liam’s only clue is a bound handwritten manuscript, entirely in German, and hidden in its pages is a story long-forgotten…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ada Baumgarten was born in Berlin in 1918, at the end of the Great War. The daughter of an accomplished first-chair violinist in the prestigious Berlin Philharmonic, she herself was a violin prodigy, Ada’s life was full of the rich culture of Berlin’s interwar society. She formed a deep attachment to her childhood friend Kurt, but they were torn apart by the growing unrest as her Jewish family came under suspicion. As the tides of history turned, it was her extraordinary talent that would carry her through an unraveling society turned to war, and make her a target even as it saved her, allowing her to move to Bologna―though Italy was not the haven her family had hoped, and further heartache awaited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What became of Ada? How is she connected to the conflicting land deeds of a small Italian villa? As they dig through the layers of lies, corruption, and human evil, Catherine and Liam uncover an unfinished story of heart, redemption, and hope―the ending of which is yet to be written.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Mists of Avalon meets Philippa Gregory in the first book of an exciting historical trilogy that reveals the untold story of Languoreth—a powerful and, until now, tragically forgotten queen of sixth-century Scotland—twin sister of the man who inspired the legendary character of Merlin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intelligent, passionate, rebellious, and brave, Languoreth is the unforgettable heroine of The Lost Queen, a tale of conflicted loves and survival set against the cinematic backdrop of ancient Scotland, a magical land of myths and superstition inspired by the beauty of the natural world. One of the most powerful early medieval queens in British history, Languoreth ruled at a time of enormous disruption and bloodshed, when the burgeoning forces of Christianity threatened to obliterate the ancient pagan beliefs and change her way of life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with her twin brother Lailoken, a warrior and druid known to history as Merlin, Languoreth is catapulted into a world of danger and violence. When a war brings the hero Emrys Pendragon, to their door, Languoreth collides with the handsome warrior Maelgwn. Their passionate connection is forged by enchantment, but Languoreth is promised in marriage to Rhydderch, son of the High King who is sympathetic to the followers of Christianity. As Rhydderch's wife, Languoreth must assume her duty to fight for the preservation of the Old Way, her kingdom, and all she holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lost Queen brings this remarkable woman to life—rescuing her from obscurity, and reaffirming her place at the center of the most enduring legends of all time.</description>

  <description>For Napoleon's stepdaughter, nothing is simple -- especially love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, 1798. Hortense de Beauharnais is engrossed in her studies at a boarding school for aristocratic girls, most of whom suffered tragic losses during the tumultuous days of the French Revolution. She loves to play and compose music, read and paint, and daydream about Christophe, her brother's dashing fellow officer. But Hortense is not an ordinary girl. Her beautiful, charming mother, Josephine, has married Napoleon Bonaparte, soon to become the most powerful man in France, but viewed by Hortense as a coarse, unworthy successor to her elegant father, who was guillotined during the Terror. &lt;br /&gt; Where will Hortense's future lie?&lt;br /&gt; Inspired by Hortense's real-life autobiography with charming glimpses of teen life long ago, this is the story of a girl chosen by fate to play a role she didn't choose.</description>

  <description>In this twisty psychological thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of The Girl Before, an actress plays both sides of a murder investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One out-of-work British actress pays the rent on her New York City apartment the only way she can: as a decoy for a firm of divorce lawyers, hired to entrap straying husbands. When the cops begin investigating one of her targets for murdering his wife--and potentially others--they ask her to lure the suspect into a confession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the actress pretending to be someone she isn't, differentiating the decoy from the prey becomes impossible--and deadly.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Amateur sleuth Sloan Krause returns in another delightful cozy—this time investigating a movie star who's murdered not long after arriving in Leavenworth, WA to film his latest project.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other festival compares to Oktoberfest in Leavenworth, Washington. The whole town is buzzing with excitement over this year’s activities and eagerly awaiting Nitro’s latest offering Cherrywizen, made with locally sourced cherries. But local brewmaster Sloan Krause is tapped out. Between trying to manage the pub, her pending divorce with Mac, and her mounting feelings for Garrett, she’s fermenting in internal turmoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To complicate matters, dreamy movie star Mitchell Morgan and his production crew have arrived in the village to film during the authentic Bavarian brewfest. Mitchell has his eye on Sloan and a taste for Nitro’s Cherrywizen. Sloan escapes his advances for good when she finds Mitchell slumped over the bar. Is this a case of one pint too many, or has Mitchell been murdered by microbrew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A charming new series . . . fascinating and fun.”—Kate Carlisle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A ‘hopping’ good cozy mystery.” —Meg Macy&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In a most improbable friendship, she found love. In a world where women were silenced, she found her voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Patti Callahan comes an exquisite novel of Joy Davidman, the woman C. S. Lewis called “my whole world.” When poet and writer Joy Davidman began writing letters to C. S. Lewis—known as Jack—she was looking for spiritual answers, not love. Love, after all, wasn’t holding together her crumbling marriage. Everything about New Yorker Joy seemed ill-matched for an Oxford don and the beloved writer of Narnia, yet their minds bonded over their letters. Embarking on the adventure of her life, Joy traveled from America to England and back again, facing heartbreak and poverty, discovering friendship and faith, and against all odds, finding a love that even the threat of death couldn’t destroy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this masterful exploration of one of the greatest love stories of modern times, we meet a brilliant writer, a fiercely independent mother, and a passionate woman who changed the life of this respected author and inspired books that still enchant us and change us. Joy lived at a time when women weren’t meant to have a voice—and yet her love for Jack gave them both voices they didn’t know they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a fascinating historical novel and a glimpse into a writer’s life, &lt;em&gt;Becoming Mrs. Lewis&lt;/em&gt; is above all a love story—a love of literature and ideas and a love between a husband and wife that, in the end, was not impossible at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A delicious love story about a bridal designer showing her new collection in the Alps during the magical week of Christmas where hijinx of the heart ensue.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the day after Christmas, and Felicity Grant is at a gorgeous ski chalet in St. Moritz for the biggest fashion show of her career. Felicity is a rising star on the bridal design scene, and this is her best collection yet. But when her boyfriend gives her a spa day instead of a diamond ring for Christmas, she has to face the possibility that she may never walk down the aisle in one of her own stunning designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there's Nell, the top model headlining Felicity's show. Nell is planning her dream wedding to her wonderful fiance with one catch: her divorced parents can't stand each other and threaten to no-show if the other is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that Felicity's race against the clock to create a special gown for a prestigious bridal salon, and what both girls need is a Christmas miracle. What better place to find one than in the Swiss Alps with its dark forests and sparkling vistas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Felicity it's hard to recognize a miracle even when it's right in front of her, and for Nell one miracle might not be enough to fix the past. Can dreams really come true or is that the stuff of Swiss fairytales?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Christmas at the Chalet&lt;/i&gt; is full of romance, gorgeous gowns, and the stunning scenery of the Swiss Alps. It's about love and forgiveness, and creating one's own miracles during the most festive time of year.</description>

  <description>When The Alienist was first published in 1994, it was a major phenomenon, spending six months on the New York Times bestseller list, receiving critical acclaim, and selling millions of copies. This modern classic continues to be a touchstone of historical suspense fiction for readers everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1896. The city is New York. Newspaper reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned by his friend Dr. Laszlo Kreizler—a psychologist, or “alienist”—to view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy abandoned on the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge. From there the two embark on a revolutionary effort in criminology: creating a psychological profile of the perpetrator based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who will kill again before their hunt is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-paced and riveting, infused with historical detail, The Alienist conjures up Gilded Age New York, with its tenements and mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. It is an age in which questioning society’s belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and fatal consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma Grace Townsend.&lt;/b&gt; Five years old. Gray eyes. Brown hair. &lt;b&gt;Missing since June.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Townsend is lonely. Living with her cruel mother and clueless father, Emma retreats into her own world of quiet and solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sarah Walker.&lt;/b&gt; Successful entrepreneur. Broken-hearted. Abandoned by her mother. &lt;b&gt;Kidnapper.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah has never seen a girl so precious as the gray-eyed child in a crowded airport terminal--and when a second-chance encounter with Emma presents itself, Sarah takes her, far away from home. But if it's to rescue a little girl from her damaging mother, is kidnapping wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy Townsend.&lt;/b&gt; Unhappy wife. Unfit mother. &lt;b&gt;Unsure she wants her daughter back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy's life is a string of disappointments, but her biggest issue is her inability to connect with her daughter. And now she's gone without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sarah and Emma avoid the nationwide hunt, they form an unshakeable bond. But her real mother is at home, waiting for her to return--and the longer the search for Emma continues, Amy is forced to question if she really wants her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emotionally powerful&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;wire-taut&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Not Her Daughter &lt;/i&gt;raises the question of what it means to be a mother--and how far someone will go to keep a child safe.</description>

My name is Dr Harry F. Cook. I know this is going to sound strange, but I've recently been given absolute proof of God's existence - and I've been advised there is a writer, a respected journalist called Ross Hunter, who could help me to get taken seriously."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would it take to prove the existence of God? And what would be the consequences?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The false faith of a billionaire evangelist, the life's work of a famous atheist, and the credibility of each of the world's major religions are all under threat. If Ross Hunter can survive long enough to present the evidence...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this thrilling true-crime procedural, the creator of Sherlock Holmes uses his unparalleled detective skills to exonerate a German Jew wrongly convicted of murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;USA Today's &lt;/i&gt;"Five new books you won't want to miss!" &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Gripping . . . The book works on two levels, much like a good Holmes case."--&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the scores of biographies of Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the most famous detective in the world, there is no recent book that tells this remarkable story--in which Conan Doyle becomes a real-life detective on an actual murder case. In &lt;i&gt;Conan Doyle for the Defense, &lt;/i&gt; Margalit Fox takes us step by step inside Conan Doyle's investigative process and illuminates a murder mystery that is also a morality play for our time--a story of ethnic, religious, and anti-immigrant bias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1908, a wealthy woman was brutally murdered in her Glasgow home. The police found a convenient suspect in Oscar Slater--an immigrant Jewish cardsharp--who, despite his obvious innocence, was tried, convicted, and consigned to life at hard labor in a brutal Scottish prison. Conan Doyle, already world famous as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was outraged by this injustice and became obsessed with the case. Using the methods of his most famous character, he scoured trial transcripts, newspaper accounts, and eyewitness statements, meticulously noting myriad holes, inconsistencies, and outright fabrications by police and prosecutors. Finally, in 1927, his work won Slater's freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margalit Fox, a celebrated longtime writer for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times, &lt;/i&gt; has "a nose for interesting facts, the ability to construct a taut narrative arc, and a Dickens-level gift for concisely conveying personality" (Kathryn Schulz, &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt;). In C&lt;i&gt;onan Doyle for the Defense, &lt;/i&gt; she immerses readers in the science of Edwardian crime detection and illuminates a watershed moment in the history of forensics, when reflexive prejudice began to be replaced by reason and the scientific method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Conan Doyle for the Defense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Splendid . . . The ingredients are too good to pass up: a famous detective novelist actually playing detective, a man serving time for a murder he did not commit, and a criminal justice system slowly, and reluctantly, reckoning with the advent of forensic science."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Sarah Weinman, &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; The New Republic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Entertaining."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s giving her children a season of wonder…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dani Capelli seized a chance to start over in a small town with her daughters. Now, facing her first Christmas in Haven Point, she wonders if leaving New York was a mistake. Dani loves working alongside veterinarian Dr. Morales, but her two children aren’t adjusting to small-town life. And then there’s Dr. Morales’s son, Ruben—Dani’s next-door neighbor. Gorgeous, muscled and dependable, the deputy sheriff is everything she secretly craves and can’t bear to risk loving…and losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruben never pictured himself falling for a big-city woman like Dani. But beneath her prickly facade, she’s caring and softhearted and she needs all the love and protection he can give. When Dani’s teenage daughter starts acting out, Ruben draws on family traditions to show the girls just how magical a Haven Point Christmas can be. But can he convince Dani that she’s found a home for the holidays—and forever—in his arms?</description>

  <description>November 1831. After fleeing London in infamy more than two years prior, Lady Kiera Darby’s return to the city is anything but mundane, though not for the reasons she expected. A gang of body snatchers is arrested on suspicion of imitating the notorious misdeeds of Edinburgh criminals, Burke and Hare—killing people from the streets and selling their bodies to medical schools. Then Kiera’s past—a past she thought she’d finally made peace with—rises up to haunt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of London is horrified by the evidence that “burkers” are, indeed, at work in their city. The terrified populace hovers on a knife’s edge, ready to take their enmity out on any likely suspect. And when Kiera receives a letter of blackmail, threatening to divulge details about her late anatomist husband’s involvement with the body snatchers and wrongfully implicate her, she begins to apprehend just how precarious her situation is. Not only for herself, but also her new husband and investigative partner, Sebastian Gage, and their unborn child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the young scion of a noble family has been found murdered a block from his home, and the man’s family wants Kiera and Gage to investigate. Is it a failed attempt by the London burkers, having left the body behind, or the crime of someone much closer to home? Someone who stalks the privileged, using the uproar over the burkers to cover his own dark deeds? &lt;br /&gt;~ via USA Today's blog&lt;br /&gt; Joyce Lamb at Happily*Ever*After&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Lee Huber is the Daphne Award-winning author of the national bestselling Lady Darby Mysteries and the Verity Kent Mysteries. She is a summa cum laude graduate of Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, where she majored in music and minored in psychology.

When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life, free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus’s deeply-held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities for change, Time’s Convert will delight fans of the All Souls trilogy and all readers of magic, the supernatural, and romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Marrying forbidden love, devoted friendship, and the supernatural with Palombo's signature passion for music, storytelling, and heartbreaking choices, &lt;i&gt;The Spellbook of Katrina Van Tassel&lt;/i&gt; enchants with a concoction of love, longing, and loss plucked from the bones of one of our most enduring and haunting legends." - Erin Lindsay McCabe, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;I Shall Be Near to You&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ichabod Crane arrives in the spooky little village of Sleepy Hollow as the new schoolmaster, Katrina Van Tassel is instantly drawn to him. Through their shared love of books and music, they form a friendship that quickly develops into romance. Ichabod knows that as an itinerant schoolteacher of little social standing, he has nothing to offer the wealthy Katrina – unlike her childhood friend-turned-enemy, Brom Van Brunt, who is the suitor Katrina’s father favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when romance gives way to passion, Ichabod and Katrina embark on a secret love affair, sneaking away into the woods after dark to be together – all while praying they do not catch sight of Sleepy Hollow’s legendary Headless Horseman. That is, until All Hallows’s Eve, when Ichabod suddenly disappears, leaving Katrina alone and in a perilous position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlisting the help of her friend – and rumored witch – Charlotte Jansen, Katrina seeks the truth of Ichabod Crane’s disappearance, investigating the forest around Sleepy Hollow using unconventional – often magical – means. What they find forces Katrina to question everything she once knew, and to wonder if the Headless Horseman is perhaps more than just a story after all. In Alyssa Palombo's &lt;i&gt;The Spellbook of Katrina Van Tassel &lt;/i&gt;nothing is as it seems, and love is a thing even death won't erase.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;From Christy and Carol award-winning author Carrie Stuart Parks comes the thrilling tale of an artist who uncovers one of World War II’s most dangerous secrets—a secret that desperate men will do anything to keep hidden . . . or steal.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her twin sister was murdered, Murphy Anderson changed her name and appearance and moved to Kodiak to avoid the press and publicity. But when local authorities discover she’s an artist and request her help in drawing a dying man’s memories, she unintentionally ends up in the limelight again—and may be back in the killer’s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memory that Murphy was asked to draw was from an Alaskan hunter who discovered five bodies on remote Ruuwaq Island ten years ago, but has only shared the information with the police now that he’s dying of cancer. When they go to the island to investigate, no skeletons remain but there is evidence that the bodies may have been deliberately destroyed. But the big discovery is of a World War II Quonset hut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one by one the people who were at the hut die, Murphy knows there is something much deeper at stake. What happened there during WWII? And who is willing to kill to keep those secrets buried?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And she works hard to keep it all together. Too hard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no room for mistakes in her life. Even taking home a little boy whose parents forgot to pick him up at the pool can put a crimp in Cecilia's carefully planned schedule. Especially when she arrives at the address she was given&lt;br /&gt;and finds an empty, abandoned house...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing for Cecilia to do but to take the boy home with her, never realizing that soon his quiet presence and knowing eyes will trigger unwelcome memories from her past--and unravel her meticulously crafted life...</description>

  <description>Two hearts. Twice as vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manhattan, 1850. Born out of wedlock to a wealthy socialite and a nameless immigrant, Cora Lee can mingle with the rich just as easily as she can slip unnoticed into the slums and graveyards of the city. As the only female resurrectionist in New York, she’s carved out a niche procuring bodies afflicted with the strangest of anomalies. Anatomists will pay exorbitant sums for such specimens—dissecting and displaying them for the eager public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cora’s specialty is not only profitable, it’s a means to keep a finger on the pulse of those searching for her. She’s the girl born with two hearts—a legend among grave robbers and anatomists—sought after as an endangered prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a series of murders unfolds closer and closer to Cora, she can no longer trust those she holds dear, including the young medical student she’s fallen for. Because someone has no intention of waiting for Cora to die a natural death.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are invited to attend the wedding of the century&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophie Duval of Grasse, France is a pragmatic young woman and highly respected parfumeur, whom many of the rich and famous of the Riviera have entrusted with the job of creating the perfect scent for them. As the Cannes Film Festival kicks off its ninth year, Sophie prepares to spend the tourist season on the Riviera where the wealthy will grace her shop with their presence, carrying their heavy purses along with them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, her summer plans change after one last, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; familiar customer slips inside her Cannes boutique. With her blond hair tucked beneath a silk headscarf, the fine nose and large black sunglasses, the porcelain complexion, it’s impossible to not recognize her. It’s America’s darling, Grace Kelly. Miss Kelly, however, hasn’t come in for perfume, but to escape a photographer, hot on her trail. Just as Sophie hides Miss Kelly away in the back of the boutique, the photographer runs into the shop, camera tucked against his chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling British press photographer, James Henderson, has arrived in Cannes to work the illustrious Film Festival. But in a twist of fate, he spots Grace Kelly strolling casually through a secluded arcade of shops. Seeing an opportunity to get the shot nobody else will have, James follows Miss Kelly into a small perfume boutique. But Grace Kelly is nowhere to be found and the shop owner won’t give anything away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of a brief and fractious exchange, Sophie can’t forget about the handsome photographer, James can’t forget the lovely parfumeur, and Grace Kelly can’t forget about Sophie’s kindness. From that moment on, the fates of Sophie, James, and a Hollywood icon are linked together in a story that will span three decades, tragedy, and love. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A rich, spellbinding new novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Lake House&lt;/i&gt;—the story of a love affair and a mysterious murder that cast their shadow across generations, set in England from the 1860's until the present day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My real name, no one remembers.&lt;br /&gt; The truth about that summer, no one else knows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the summer of 1862, a group of young artists led by the passionate and talented Edward Radcliffe descends upon Birchwood Manor on the banks of the Upper Thames. Their plan: to spend a secluded summer month in a haze of inspiration and creativity. But by the time their stay is over, one woman has been shot dead while another has disappeared; a priceless heirloom is missing; and Edward Radcliffe’s life is in ruins.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over one hundred and fifty years later, Elodie Winslow, a young archivist in London, uncovers a leather satchel containing two seemingly unrelated items: a sepia photograph of an arresting-looking woman in Victorian clothing, and an artist’s sketchbook containing the drawing of a twin-gabled house on the bend of a river.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why does Birchwood Manor feel so familiar to Elodie? And who is the beautiful woman in the photograph? Will she ever give up her secrets?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Told by multiple voices across time, &lt;i&gt;The Clockmaker’s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a story of murder, mystery, and thievery, of art, love and loss. And flowing through its pages like a river, is the voice of a woman who stands outside time, whose name has been forgotten by history, but who has watched it all unfold: Birdie Bell, the clockmaker’s daughter&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>
