  <description>Lavish, romantic and magical, The Sky Weaver is a new standalone story set in the world of The Last Namsara - one that fans of Leigh Bardugo, Holly Black and Laini Taylor will flock to. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of one world, there always lies another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safire, a soldier, knows her role in this world is to serve the King of Firgaard-helping to maintain the peace in her oft-troubled nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eris, a deadly pirate, has no such conviction. Known as The Death Dancer for her ability to evade even the most determined of pursuers, she possesses a superhuman ability to move between worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one can roam from dimension to dimension, can one ever be home? Can love and loyalty truly exist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Safire and Eris-sworn enemies-find themselves on a common mission: to find Asha, the last Namsara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the port city of Darmoor to the fabled faraway Sky Isles, their search and their stories become threaded ever more tightly together as they discover the uncertain fate they're hurtling towards may just be a shared one. In this world, and the next.</description>

  <description>In the beginning, there was the Namsara: the child of sky and spirit, who carried love and laughter wherever he went. But where there is light, there must be dark—and so there was also the Iskari. The child of blood and moonlight. The destroyer. The death bringer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the legends that Asha, daughter of the king of Firgaard, has grown up hearing in hushed whispers, drawn to the forbidden figures of the past. But it isn’t until she becomes the fiercest, most feared dragon slayer in the land that she takes on the role of the next Iskari—a lonely destiny that leaves her feeling more like a weapon than a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asha conquers each dragon and brings its head to the king, but no kill can free her from the shackles that await at home: her betrothal to the cruel commandant, a man who holds the truth about her nature in his palm. When she’s offered the chance to gain her freedom in exchange for the life of the most powerful dragon in Firgaard, she finds that there may be more truth to the ancient stories than she ever could have expected. With the help of a secret friend—a slave boy from her betrothed’s household—Asha must shed the layers of her Iskari bondage and open her heart to love, light, and a truth that has been kept from her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;X marks the spot for murder…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the seaside town of Temple Regis, seagulls are wheeling overhead and the holidays are getting close. And then the body of political candidate Odile Clifford is discovered on the balcony of the lighthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fearless &lt;em&gt;Riviera Express&lt;/em&gt; reporter Judy Dimont goes in search of the killer – but who is it? And where will they strike next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Judy’s position as chief reporter is under threat when her editor takes on hot-shot journalist David Renishaw, whose work is just too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is busier than ever for Devon's most famous detective. Can Judy solve the mystery – and protect her position as Temple Regis’s best reporter – before the murderer strikes again?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Kim and Leon live on a farm in Suffolk, England. Kim is a schoolboy and Leon is his pet donkey. A rainy day encounter leads them on an adventure far away in Africa. Along the way there are dangers, and fears about who can be trusted. There is also the threatening presence of a slave ship, looming in the bay. Barnaby Allen was a teacher of English and history. In this historical fantasy he beautifully combines suspense with an immersion in history. This book comes with tasks of writing, acting and drawing. This is a simplified version of the original book. It suits especially ESL pupils. Happy reading!</description>

  <description>When a lone soldier, Cole, arrives with news of Lachlan Agatta's death, all hope seems lost for Catarina. Her father was the world's leading geneticist, and humanity's best hope of beating a devastating virus. Then, hidden beneath Cole's genehacked enhancements she finds a message of hope: Lachlan created a vaccine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only she can find and decrypt it, if she can unravel the clues he left for her. The closer she gets, the more she finds herself at risk from Cartaxus, a shadowy organization with a stranglehold on the world's genetic tech. But it's too late to turn back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three billion lives at stake, two people who can save them, and one final secret that Cat must unlock. A secret that will change everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most cruel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, there's a ninth girl. And instead of paper, she's made of &lt;i&gt;fire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this lush fantasy, Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most oppressed class in Ikhara. She lives in a remote village with her father, where the decade-old trauma of watching her mother snatched by royal guards still haunts her. Now, the guards are back, and this time it's Lei they're after--the girl whose golden eyes have piqued the king's interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over weeks of training in the opulent but stifling palace, Lei and eight other girls learn the skills and charm that befit being a king's consort. But Lei isn't content to watch her fate consume her. Instead, she does the unthinkable--she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens the very foundation of Ikhara, and Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide just how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presented by James Patterson, Natasha Ngan's lyrical, searing, visceral fantasy, &lt;i&gt;Girls of Paper and Fire&lt;/i&gt;, will remind us how precious freedom is--and the price we must pay to achieve it.</description>

  <description>The electric second book in the Heart of Thorns trilogy explores the effects of power in a dark magical kingdom—and the fierce courage it takes to claim your body as your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Rose is back from the dead. Her memories are hazy, her body numb—but she won’t stop searching. Her only hope to save the boy she loves and the sister who destroyed her is to find the mother she can never forgive. Pilar is on a hunt of her own. Betrayed by her mother, and plagued by a painful secret, she’s determined to seek out the only person who can exact revenge. All goes according to plan… until she collides with Prince Quin, the boy whose sister she killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mia, Pilar, and Quin forge dangerous new alliances, they are bewitched by the snow kingdom’s promise of freedom and opportunity. But with the winter solstice drawing near, they must confront the truth beneath the glimmering ice, as lines between friend, foe, and lover vanish like snowflakes on a flame.</description>

  <description>The Art of Sherlock Holmes-USA Edition 1 is truly unique. While there have been literally hundreds of Holmes pastiches written (even a few of mine), before our first volume, The Art of Sherlock Homes-West Palm Beach, there had never been a volume where Holmes short stories were interpreted by such accomplished artists. In this first USA edition, thirteen world-class artists who live and create in the United States have each had a story assigned to them - specifically dependent on the particular talent of each artist. Whether the interpretations be from the forms of surrealist, contemporary, realist, digital, minimalist, symbolism, or an amalgam of various forms, each piece of art created is unique, hypnotic, mesmerizing and unforgettable. Each created specifically to express the essence of each incredible Holmes story. The thirteen stories herein range from the impossibly baffling (except for Holmes) to the humorous, paranormal, or simply intellectually intricate. You're presented with murder, theft, treason, betrayal, love, loss and greed. All the ingredients to make delicious Holmes meals of mystery. But please remember, art is in the eye of the beholder. So we hope you'll appreciate each creation for what it is: an inimitable interpretation of a truly unique Holmes story. And for those of you who get lost in abstract art, our abstract artists have provided an explanation of what their art means in relation to the story they've interpreted.</description>

  <description>A town gripped by fear. A woman accused of murder. Who can save Pale Harbour from itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1846. Desperate to escape the ghosts of his past, Gabriel Stone takes a position as a minister in the remote Pale Harbour, but not all is as it seems in the sleepy town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as Gabriel steps foot in town, he can’t escape the rumours about the mysterious Sophy Carver, a young widow who lives in the eerie Castle Carver: whispers that she killed her husband, mutterings that she might even be a witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as strange, unsettling events escalate into murder, Gabriel finds himself falling under Sophy’s spell. As clues start to point to Sophy as the next victim, Gabriel realises he must find answers before anyone else turns up dead.</description>

  <description>A friendship. A murder. A life that will never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1955, the location picturesque Devon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a house by the River Dart, schoolgirl Josephine Kennedy posts invitations to her twelfth birthday party – a party that never takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrific violence is committed that night in the family home, leaving all of its occupants dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a disturbing real-life crime, this compelling story explores Josephine’s fate through the prism of friends and family - the victims and survivors who unwittingly influenced the events that led up to the tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josephine’s best friend, Susan, is haunted by the secrets of the birthday house. Can she ever find a way of making peace with the past?</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Introducing &lt;i&gt;The Time Police&lt;/i&gt;, the brand-new series by&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;international bestselling author,&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; Jodi Taylor - an &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;irresistible&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; spinoff from&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; the much-loved &lt;i&gt;Chronicles of St Mary's &lt;/i&gt;series. Perfect reading for fans of &lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt;, Ben Aaronovitch and Jasper Fforde. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some time in the future, the secret of time-travel became available to all. Chaos ensued as people sought to take advantage. Because there will always be nutters who want to change history...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the Time Police were formed. Internationally sanctioned thugs whose task it was to keep the timeline straight by any and all means possible. And they succeeded. The Time Wars are over. The Time Police won. But who will win the peace?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doing Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; follows three hapless new Time Police recruits - Jane, Luke and Matthew - as they try to navigate their first year on the beat. It's all going to be fine. Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Drawing on myth and fairy tales found across Europe - from Croatia to Sweden, Ireland to Russia - Sharon Blackie brings to life women's remarkable ability to transform themselves in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances. These stories are about coming to terms with our animal natures, exploring the ways in which we might renegotiate our fractured relationship with the natural world, and uncovering the wildness - and wilderness - within. Beautifully illustrated by Helen Nicholson, Foxfire, Wolfskin and Other Stories of Shapeshifting Women is her first collection of short stories. All are either reimaginings of older tales, or contain characters, beings and motifs which appear in older tales.</description>

  <description>In the heart of Venice, a woman is sacrificed to a forgotten god, sparking a mystery lost for thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Penelope Bryne is ridiculed by the academic community for her quest to find the remnants of Atlantis, but when an ancient and mysterious script is found at a murder site, she flies to Venice determined to help the police before the killer strikes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope has spent her entire life trying to ignore the unexplainable and magical history of Atlantis, but when she meets the enigmatic Alexis Donato, everything she believes will be challenged. Little does she know, Alexis has spent the last three years doing his best to sabotage Penelope’s career so doesn’t learn the truth—Atlantis had seven magicians who survived, and who he has a duty to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Alexis draws her into the darkly, seductive world of magic and history, Penelope will have to use her heart as well as her head if she is to find the answers she seeks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new MOSE system due to come online, and Carnivale exploding around them, Penelope and Alexis will have to work together to stop the killer and prevent dark magic from pulling Venice into the sea.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Have you ever seen something you can’t explain? Did it vanish as fast as it appeared?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perhaps that thing you saw was lurking in the shadows, and you caught a glimpse of it before it went back into hiding.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s a good chance, of course, that the thing you saw simply emerged from your imagination.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or maybe, just maybe, it didn’t…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sapphire Smyth is no stranger to rejection. When she was only a baby, her father abandoned her after her mother died. Since then, Sapphire has never felt like she belonged anywhere, or with anyone. To make things worse, her foster carers have now turned their back on her - on her eighteenth birthday. After living with them throughout her childhood, Sapphire has to find a new home. Is it any wonder she finds it hard to trust people? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by the people she called family, Sapphire is alone and searching for some meaning in her life. Except that meaning has already come looking for her. When she discovers mysterious creatures lurking in the shadows, Sapphire soon realises that her fate is unlike anything she had ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Shadows that come alive, a hidden world, and a mystery that grips you from the first page. R.J. Furness has created a world that is both magical and tangible. Part One of Sapphire Smyth &amp;amp; The Shadow Five will leave you satisfyingly breathless and in desperate need of a fox, a silver bangle and the next instalment." PJ King - author of 'The Divinity Laws' series.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Packed with mysterious magic, friendship, and adventure, Sapphire's story will delight those with an imagination that often runs away with them." L.L. McNeil - author of the 'World Of Linaria' series.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Sapphire Smyth &amp;amp; The Shadow Five" is a six-part, serialised young adult fantasy story!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;+SCROLL UP &amp;amp; GRAB YOUR COPY NOW+&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In the Blue, the world’s last city, all is not well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia is stuck within its walls. She serves the nobility from a distance until she meets Lucas, a boy who believes in fairytales that Julia’s world can’t accommodate. The Blue is her prison, not her castle, and she’d escape into the trees if she didn’t know that contamination and death awaited humanity outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone in the Blue is human, and not everyone can be contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the city’s boundaries, in the wild forests of the Red, Cameron has precious little humanity left to lose. As he searches for a lost queen, he finds an enemy rising that he thought long dead. An enemy that the humans have forgotten how to fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way or another, the walls of the Blue are coming down. The only question is what side you’ll be on when they do.</description>

  <description>Can a trip away lead you home?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bad break-up, eternal optimist Evie Miller has moved to the small village of Willowbrook to finally pursue her dream of opening a craft shop. Unfortunately, with money worries and an ex-boyfriend determined to track her down, her fresh start isn't going entirely to plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Hartwood is also looking to escape his past. Haunted by the loss of his wife, he's determined not to get close to anyone again - and the last thing he wants is to be celebrating this December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to avoid the festivities, Evie and Jake arrange to escape Christmas together as friends in Provence. But will the magic of the season change things between them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what happens if one of them starts to feel something more?</description>

  <description>From the creator of the hit webcomic &lt;i&gt;My Life As a Background Slytherin&lt;/i&gt; comes a hilarious graphic novel pastiche of classic Romantic literature led by a trio of queer misfits—and several angry vampires.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in early nineteenth-century Britain, &lt;i&gt;Bloodlust &amp;amp; Bonnets&lt;/i&gt; follows Lucy, an unworldly debutante who desires a life of passion and intrigue—qualities which earn her the attention of Lady Violet Travesty, the leader of a local vampire cult. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But before Lucy can embark on her new life of vampiric debauchery, she finds herself unexpectedly thrown together with the flamboyant poet Lord Byron (“from books!”) and a mysterious bounty-hunter named Sham. The unlikely trio lie, flirt, fight, and manipulate each other as they make their way across Britain, disrupting society balls, slaying vampires, and making every effort not to betray their feelings to each other as their personal and romantic lives become increasingly entangled.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both witty and slapstick, elegant and gory, Emily McGovern’s debut graphic novel pays tribute to and pokes fun at beloved romance tropes, delivering a joyous, action-packed world of friendship and adventure.</description>

  <description>More than a century has passed since Liliath crept into the empty sarcophagus of Saint Marguerite, fleeing the Fall of Ystara. But she emerges from her magical sleep still beautiful, looking no more than nineteen, and once again renews her single-minded quest to be united with her lover, Palleniel, the archangel of Ystara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A seemingly impossible quest, but Liliath is one of the greatest practitioners of angelic magic to have ever lived, summoning angels and forcing them to do her bidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liliath knew that most of the inhabitants of Ystara died from the Ash Blood plague or were transformed into beastlings, and she herself led the survivors who fled into neighboring Sarance. Now she learns that angels shun the Ystaran’s descendants. If they are touched by angelic magic, their blood will turn to ash. They are known as Refusers, and can only live the most lowly lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Liliath cares nothing for the descendants of her people, save how they can serve her. It is four young Sarancians who hold her interest: Simeon, a studious doctor-in-training; Henri, a dedicated fortune hunter; Agnez, an adventurous musketeer cadet; and Dorotea, an icon-maker and scholar of angelic magic. They are the key to her quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four feel a strange kinship from the moment they meet, but do not know why, or suspect their importance. All become pawns in Liliath’s grand scheme to fulfill her destiny and be united with the love of her life. No matter the cost to everyone else. . .</description>

  <description>Accused of murder, Alejandra flees her home, escaping to the southern edge of Spain, where she faces a life of poverty and destitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seduced by the power of the rich and the anonymity that waits across the water in Tangier, Ale makes a bid for a new start. But it will come at a cost: a life of deception. Because Ale's new friends want to know what she is running from, they want to know who she is and whether they can trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifty years later, a young American writer wanders the streets of Tangier, searching for inspiration. When he stumbles across a trace of Ale's life, he finds himself tangled in a story of scandal, love and danger that has not yet reached its end.</description>

  <description>It's been seven years since Holly Kennedy's husband died – six since she read his final letter, urging Holly to find the courage to forge a new life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s proud of all the ways in which she has grown and evolved. But when a group inspired by Gerry's letters, calling themselves the PS, I Love You Club, approaches Holly asking for help, she finds herself drawn back into a world that she worked so hard to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reluctantly, Holly begins a relationship with the club, even as their friendship threatens to destroy the peace she believes she has achieved. As each of these people calls upon Holly to help them leave something meaningful behind for their loved ones, Holly will embark on a remarkable journey – one that will challenge her to ask whether embracing the future means betraying the past, and what it means to love someone forever…</description>

Meanwhile bandits roam the countryside, burning the villages and kidnapping its daughters. Setting out to defeat the raiders, the Prince and his trusted companion come across a young man riding a magnificent horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Sasha, a priest with a warrior's training, recognises this 'boy' as his younger sister, thought to be dead or a witch by her village. But when Vasya proves herself in battle, riding with remarkable skill and inexplicable power, Sasha realises he must keep her secret as she may be the only way to save the city from threats both human and fantastical...</description>

  <description>Winter lasts most of the year at the edge of the Russian wilderness, and in the long nights, Vasilisa and her siblings love to gather by the fire to listen to their nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, Vasya loves the story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon. Wise Russians fear him, for he claims unwary souls, and they honor the spirits that protect their homes from evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Vasya’s widowed father brings home a new wife from Moscow. Fiercely devout, Vasya’s stepmother forbids her family from honoring their household spirits, but Vasya fears what this may bring. And indeed, misfortune begins to stalk the village. As its defenses weaken and evil from the forest creeps nearer, Vasilisa must call upon dangerous gifts she has long concealed.</description>

  <description>Reluctantly, Sherlock Holmes agrees to assist Inspector Lestrade who is being hounded by an obnoxious nobleman whose jewel-encrusted dagger has gone missing. However, what Holmes initially believes to be a simple theft turns out instead to be his first encounter with a master criminal, who is as ruthless as he is brilliant, and whom Watson dubs “The Merchant of Menace.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Holmes finds himself matching wits with a man who will steal anything – if the price is right. Moreover, this thief will go to any lengths, including blackmail and murder, to achieve his desired goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Holmes comes to understand his adversary, he also begins to realize he can only react to the Merchant because he has no idea where this criminal mastermind will strike next. All Holmes knows for certain is the Merchant seems to specialize in priceless, one-of-a-kind articles. Will that be enough information for the Great Detective to outwit his foe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the British Museum to the Louvre to Blenheim Palace, Holmes finds himself in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. Set against the backdrop of early Edwardian England, the Great Detective and his Boswell encounter an array of luminaries from the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough to a young Winston Churchill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of Conan Doyle’s immortal detective, the game is always afoot. However, this time around Holmes must try to bring to justice a villain who might well be the next Napoleon of Crime.</description>

  <description>A candid, visceral, and incredibly entertaining account of what it’s like to live in one of the most extreme man-made environments in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a world without natural light, where you can barely stand up straight for fear of knocking your head, where you have no idea of where in the world you are or what time of day it is, where you sleep in a coffin-sized bunk and sometimes eat a full roast for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now imagine sharing that world with 140 other sweaty bodies, crammed into a 430ft x 33ft steel tube, 300ft underwater, for up to 90 days at a time, with no possibility of escape. And to top it off, a sizeable chunk of your living space is taken up by the most formidably destructive nuclear weapons history has ever known. This is the world of the submariner. This is life under pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a restless and adventurous 18-year-old, Richard Humphreys joined the submarine service in 1985 and went on to serve aboard the nuclear deterrent for five years at the end of the Cold War. Nothing could have prepared him for life beneath the waves. Aside from the claustrophobia and disorientation, there were the prolonged periods of boredom, the constant dread of discovery by the Soviets, and the smorgasbord of rank odours that only a group of poorly-washed and flatulent submariners can unleash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even in this most pressurised of environments, the consolations were unique: where else could you sit peacefully for hours listening to whale song, or…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on first-hand experience, Under Pressure is the candid, visceral and incredibly entertaining account of what it’s like to live, work, sleep, eat – and stay sane – in one of the most extreme man-made environments on the planet.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5/5, rounded up to 4<br /><br />Review to come!<br /><br />It was a great read, but a little too repetitive at times, which is why it was 3.5 instead of four, but still, so fascinating!<br /><br />Thank you to the publisher for an ARC in exchange for my honest opinion!]]>

  <description>Where once new ideas and beliefs were accepted, now the country’s military dictator, the Shogun, is shutting his country down to any outside influences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Joaquim Martinez, who left Portugal to make Hizen Province, Japan, his home, has been tending quietly to the lives of his villagers, but everything is about to be thrown into turmoil, as the Shogun has outlawed Martinez’s beliefs. Those who won’t recant or accept banishment, face a death sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the threat of a massacre looming, and the Shogun’s samurai closing in, Father Martinez must decide, if he is willing to risk everything, to save those he has sworn to protect.</description>

  <description>***The first book in a new fantasy series from best-selling author Jennifer Anne Davis.*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reid has spent her whole life pretending to be a man so she can inherit her father’s estate, but when a chance encounter threatens to expose her lie, she is forced to risk everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the kingdom of Marsden, women are subservient to men and land can only pass from father to son. So when Reid Ellington is born, the fifth daughter to one of the wealthiest landholders in the kingdom, it’s announced that Reid is a boy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eighteen years later, Reid struggles to conceal the fact she’s actually a young woman. Every day, her secret becomes harder to keep. When one of Marsden’s princes sees her sparring with a sword, she is forced to accept his offer and lead her father’s soldiers to the border. Along the way, she discovers a covert organization within the army known as the Knights of the Realm. If Reid wants to save her family from being arrested for treason and robbed of their inheritance, she will have to join the Knights and become a weapon for the crown. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To protect her family, Reid must fight like a man. To do that, she’ll need the courage of a woman. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jeff is dying. Haunted by memories and grappling with the shame of his desires, he runs away to remote Scotland with a piece of experimental tech that allows him to enter the mind of someone in the past. Instructed to only use it three times, Jeff – self-indulgent, isolated and deteriorating – ignores this advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1860s, Leonora lives a contented life in the Scottish Highlands, surrounded by nature, her hands and mind kept busy. Contemplating her future and the social conventions that bind her, a secret romantic friendship with the local laird is interrupted when her father sends her to stay with her aunt in Edinburgh – an intimidating, sooty city; the place where her mother perished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Leonora’s ability to embrace her new life is shadowed by a dark presence that begins to lurk behind her eyes, and strange visions that bear no resemblance to anything she has ever seen or known…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Superior Spectre is a highly accomplished debut novel about our capacity for curiosity, and our dangerous entitlement to it, and reminds us the scariest ghosts aren’t those that go bump in the night, but those that are born and create a place for themselves in the human soul.</description>

  <description>In a quiet corner of Edinburgh, Cat Thomas is going through hell.&lt;br /&gt;She’s tried everything. He respects nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your neighbour was making your life hell ... &lt;br /&gt;Would you call upon the devil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat Thomas, a brilliant fraud investigator, has just relocated from Florida to a dreamy flat in historic Edinburgh. Everything seems perfect. Everything seems serene. Except for the unbelievably noisy wannabe rockstar upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Cat’s blissful new life is in ruins. Desperate, she's willing to try anything. When all else fails, she makes an appeal ... to Satan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And suddenly everything is eerily quiet. But her nightmare has only just begun ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Anthony O'Neill is the most ingenious and versatile writer I know. Every novel he writes is an individual gem that sparkles with its own particular brilliance. Wherever the magic carpet of his imagination takes him next, I definitely want to be along for the ride.' &lt;br /&gt;– ROBERT J. HARRIS Bestselling author of The Thirty-One Kings</description>

  <description>The start of a fierce fantasy duology about three maidens who are chosen for their land's greatest honor...and one girl determined to save her sister from the grave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the walled city-state of Alu, Kammani wants nothing more than to become the accomplished healer her father used to be before her family was cast out of their privileged life in shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alu's ruler falls deathly ill, Kammani’s beautiful little sister, Nanaea, is chosen as one of three sacred maidens to join him in the afterlife. It’s an honor. A tradition. And Nanaea believes it is her chance to live an even grander life than the one that was stolen from her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kammani sees the selection for what it really is—a death sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to save her sister, Kammani schemes her way into the palace to heal the ruler. There she discovers more danger lurking in the sand-stone corridors than she could have ever imagined and that her own life—and heart—are at stake. But Kammani will stop at nothing to dig up the palace’s buried secrets even if it means sacrificing everything…including herself.</description>

  <description>Seattle, Washington. Larkin Bennett has always known her place, whether it’s surrounded by her loving family in the lush greenery of the Pacific Northwest, or riding on a dusty convoy in Afghanistan. But all that changed the day tragedy struck her unit and took away everything she held dear. Soon after, Larkin discovers an unexpected treasure: the diary of Emily Wilson, a young woman who disguised herself as a man to fight for the Union in the Civil War. As Larkin struggles to heal, she finds herself drawn deep into Emily’s life and the secrets she kept. Indiana, 1861. The only thing more dangerous to Emily Wilson than a rebel soldier is her own comrades in the Union. But in the minds of her fellow soldiers, if it dresses like a man, swears like a man, and shoots like a man, it must be a man. As the war marches on and takes its terrible toll, Emily begins to question everything she has been told about the freedom she is supposed to be fighting for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two female spies. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A banned masterpiece. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A book that changed history.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;________________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A BANNED MASTERPIECE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1956. A celebrated Russian author is writing a book, &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt;, which could spark dissent in the Soviet Union. The Soviets, afraid of its subversive power, ban it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the rest of the world it’s fast becoming a sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TWO FEMALE SPIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CIA plans to use the book to tip the Cold War in its favour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their agents are not the usual spies, however. Two typists – the charming, experienced Sally and the talented novice Irina – are charged with the mission of a lifetime: to smuggle &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt; back into Russia by any means necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A BOOK THAT CHANGED HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not be easy. There are people willing to die for this book – and agents willing to kill for it. But they cannot fail - as this book has the power to change history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;________________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sold in twenty-five countries and poised to become a global literary sensation, Lara Prescott's dazzling first novel about the women in the CIA's typing pool and the fate of Boris Pasternak's banned masterpiece is a sweeping page turner and the most hotly anticipated debut of the year.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;________________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'What a fantastic novel &lt;i&gt;The Secrets We Kept&lt;/i&gt; is. Thrilling, seductive and thoroughly compelling - Lara has created something really special. And it’s made me want to re-read &lt;i&gt;Doctor Zhivago&lt;/i&gt;! I absolutely loved it!' &lt;/b&gt;SARAH WINMAN, author of &lt;i&gt;TIN MAN&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Triumphant ... This debut shines as spy story, publication thriller and historical romance with a twist.' &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;PUBLISHERS WEEKLY&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Set in the 1950s against the backdrop of Grace Kelly’s whirlwind romance and glamourous wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco, New York Times bestselling author Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb take the reader on an evocative sun-drenched journey along the Côte d’Azur in this page-turning novel of passion, fate, and second-chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie stars and paparazzi flock to Cannes for the glamorous film festival, but Grace Kelly, the biggest star of all, wants only to escape from the flash-bulbs. When struggling perfumer Sophie Duval shelters Miss Kelly in her boutique, fending off a persistent British press photographer, James Henderson, a bond is forged between the two women and sets in motion a chain of events that stretches across thirty years of friendship, love, and tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Henderson cannot forget his brief encounter with Sophie Duval. Despite his guilt at being away from his daughter, he takes an assignment to cover the wedding of the century, sailing with Grace Kelly’s wedding party on the SS Constitution from New York. In Monaco, as wedding fever soars and passions and tempers escalate, James and Sophie—like Princess Grace—must ultimately decide what they are prepared to give up for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a beloved family dog is stolen, her owner sets out on a life-changing journey through the ruins of our world to bring her back in this fiercely compelling tale of survival, courage, and hope. Perfect for readers of Station Eleven and The Girl With All the Gifts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My name's Griz. My childhood wasn't like yours. I've never had friends, and in my whole life I've not met enough people to play a game of football.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My parents told me how crowded the world used to be, but we were never lonely on our remote island. We had each other, and our dogs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the thief came.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There may be no law left except what you make of it. But if you steal my dog, you can at least expect me to come after you.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because if we aren't loyal to the things we love, what's the point?</description>

This is an epic journey and the future is so atmospheric that you imagine you are there with Griz and the findings and explorations are enthralling to read. I highly recommend this bo...]]>

  <description>Three journeys. One road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;England, 1348. A gentlewoman is fleeing an odious arranged marriage, a Scottish proctor is returning home to Avignon and a handsome young ploughman in search of adventure is on his way to volunteer with a company of archers. All come together on the road to Calais.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming in their direction from across the Channel is the Black Death, the plague that will wipe out half of the population of Northern Europe. As the journey unfolds, overshadowed by the archers' past misdeeds and clerical warnings of the imminent end of the world, the wayfarers must confront the nature of their loves and desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tremendous feat of language and empathy, it summons a medieval world that is at once uncannily plausible, utterly alien and eerily reflective of our own. James Meek's extraordinary &lt;i&gt;To Calais, In Ordinary Time&lt;/i&gt; is a novel about love, class, faith, loss, gender and desire—set against one of the biggest cataclysms of human history.</description>

  <description>After a messy divorce, Ed Blake is trying to forget the past by spending the summer driving around Europe in his silver Porsche. He gets no further than a small town on the river Elbe when he is arrested for a crime he did not commit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although in what is now a united Germany, this is the former Communist East, once ruled by the feared secret police, the Stasi. This is Stasiland. The past has not gone away, Germany's political tectonic plates are shifting, maybe heading for the sort of chaos last seen in the 1930s. Ed finds himself pulled into a whirlpool of violence as right-wing extremism starts to shake the foundations of Europe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a novel about here and now. What happened to Ed Blake could happen to you.</description>

  <description>Sometimes spaceships disappear with everyone on board – the Lost Ships. But sometimes they come back, strangely altered, derelict, and rumoured to be full of horrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opal is on a mission. She’s been seeking something her whole life. Something she is willing to die for. And she thinks it might be on a Lost Ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opal has stolen Clarissa, an experimental AI-controlled spaceship, from the military. Together they have tracked down a Lost Ship, in a lonely nebula far from colonised space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lost Ship is falling into the gravity well of a neutron star, and will soon be truly lost … forever. Legends say the ships harbour death, but there’s no time for indecision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opal gears up to board it. She’s just one woman, entering an alien and lethal environment. But perhaps with the aid of Clarissa’s intelligence – and an armoured spacesuit – Opal may stand a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she face her demons and survive?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Annie Sullivan, author of A Touch of Gold, comes Tiger Queen, a sweeping YA fantasy adventure that tells the story of a fierce desert princess battling to save her kingdom. Fans of Rebel of the Sands and Meagan Spooner will devour this retelling of Frank Stockton’s famous short story, “The Lady, or the Tiger?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the mythical desert kingdom of Achra, an ancient law forces sixteen-year-old Princess Kateri to fight in the arena to prove her right to rule. For Kateri, winning also means fulfilling a promise to her late mother that she would protect her people, who are struggling through windstorms and drought. The situation is worsened by the gang of Desert Boys that frequently raids the city wells, forcing the king to ration what little water is left. The punishment for stealing water is a choice between two doors: behind one lies freedom, and behind the other is a tiger.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Kateri’s final opponent is announced, she knows she cannot win. In desperation, she turns to the desert and the one person she never thought she’d side with. What Kateri discovers twists her world—and her heart—upside down. Her future is now behind two doors—only she’s not sure which holds the key to keeping her kingdom and which releases the tiger.</description>

  <description>Forgiveness is not Gabriel D’Ange’s strong suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A self-appointed soldier of God with a penchant for ruthlessly punishing his enemies, he vanished after Anne Lawrence stabbed him with his own dagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smart thing would be to let him go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Anne’s life isn’t just lonely without Gabriel. It’s insufferably boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to heal the rift between them, she goes in search of her tempestuous former lover, black parasol in hand and daeva magic crackling at her fingertips. But Gabriel has his own plans afoot and Anne finds herself drawn into one of his tangled webs, much against her better judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel’s nemesis has reappeared in Brussels, a vile slaver who’s plundering the Congo Free State with the blessing of King Leopold. Gabriel might be willing to give Anne a second chance, but not until Jorin Bekker’s head is lying at his feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in London, the quasi-reformed necromancer Balthazar sets his sights on the same quarry. He holds a very personal grudge against Bekker — and killing him might be the only way to keep Gabriel D’Ange from Balthazar’s own throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the hunters collide at a lavish gala thrown by the king, Anne learns just how far she’ll go to save the man she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The Necromancer’s Bride is the sequel to A Bad Breed, which should be read first.</description>

  <description>Captain Shea Lara is the current leader of The Veiled Duchess. The most feared pirate ship in all of Neried. And now, after completing her former mentor's final score, she's retiring. Everything seems to be coming to an end... Until a mysterious stranger drags her back into the fold with an offer for a score she can't refuse. All she has to do is kidnap the crowned princess of the northern Queendom, Princess Joana &lt;br /&gt; of Arethusa. The prize is just within reach. But sparks fly as the two women collide. And an obscured threat that could upturn Shea's entire world storms on the horizon. She'll face it alone unless she can allow herself the support she needs from old and new allies alike. Something's coming and Shea is at the center of it.</description>

  <description>‘Gripping’ &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Her actions could make history – but at what price?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1399: Constance of York, Lady Despenser, proves herself more than a mere observer in the devious intrigues of her magnificently dysfunctional family, The House of York.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by power-hungry men, including her aggressively self-centred husband Thomas and ruthless siblings Edward and Richard, Constance places herself at the heart of two treasonous plots against King Henry IV.  Will it be possible for this Plantagenet family to safeguard its own political power by restoring either King Richard II to the throne, or the precarious Mortimer claimant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the execution of these conspiracies will place them all in jeopardy, Constance is not deterred, even when the cost of her ambition threatens to overwhelm her.  Even when it endangers her new-found happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With treason, tragedy, heartbreak and betrayal, this is the story of a woman ahead of her time, fighting for herself and what she believes to be right in a world of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving voice to the forgotten women of history, this is the next brilliant historical novel from &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Anne O’Brien.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;A Tapestry of Treason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A wonderful novel . . . a rich, gripping, enchanting read. Anne’s vivid writing took me straight to the year 1400 and kept me wonderfully lost there throughout’ Joanna Courtney&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Anne O’Brien&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘O’Brien cleverly intertwines the personal and political in this enjoyable, gripping tale’ &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘O’Brien is a terrific storyteller’ &lt;em&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A gripping story of love, heartache and political intrigue’ &lt;em&gt;Woman Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Packed with drama, danger, romance and history … the perfect reading choice for the long winter nights’ &lt;em&gt;The Press Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A gripping historical drama’ &lt;em&gt;Bella&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>1660, England. War is at an end, yet for Christopher Morgan his personal conflict rages on. Haunted by the tragic death of his wife, Christopher is desperate to escape the pain her memory brings, although looking into the eyes of his young son, Abel, he cannot help but be reminded of what he has lost. Over time, father and son develop a strong bond until they are callously torn apart when Abel is snatched by smugglers and sold overseas. From the shores of Constantinople to the coast of Jamaica, time and tide keep them apart. Christopher will sail across oceans to find Abel, never losing faith that one day they will be reunited, and, as the years pass, Abel will learn that fortune favours the brave.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed author and managing director of &lt;em&gt;The Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;, James MacManus, creates a compelling historical novel that brings to life an unbelievable but true love story set during the Second World War. In 1942, Cork-born Kay Summersby’s life is changed forever when she is tasked with driving General Eisenhower on his fact-finding visit to wartime London. Despite Eisenhower’s marriage to Mamie, the pair takes an immediate liking to one another and he gifts Kay a rare wartime luxury: a box of chocolates. So begins a tumultuous relationship that against all military regulation sees Kay travelling with Eisenhower on missions to far flung places before the final assault on Nazi Germany. She becomes known as “Ike’s shadow” and in letters Mamie bemoans his new obsession with ‘Ireland’. That does not stop him from using his influence to grant Kay US citizenship and rank in the US army, drawing her closer when he returns to America. When the US authorities discover Eisenhower’s plans to divorce from his wife they threaten the fragile but passionate affair and Kay is forced to take desperate measures to hold onto the man she loves…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He doesn’t get overly flowery in details and yet he gives great descriptions.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One kingdom. One crown. One family.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Maybe it’s time the great House of Rey came to an end. After all, what are we now? Just a house of rage and sorrow.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Esmae once wanted nothing more than to help her golden brother win the crown of Kali but that dream died with her best friend. Alexi broke her heart, and she vowed to destroy him for it. And with her sentient warship &lt;i&gt;Titania&lt;/i&gt; beside her, how can she possibly fail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As gods, beasts, and kingdoms choose sides, Alexi seeks out a weapon more devastating than even &lt;i&gt;Titania&lt;/i&gt;. Past lives threaten the present. Old enemies claim their due. And Esmae cannot outrun the ghosts and the questions that haunt her. What really happened to her father? What was the third boon her mother asked of Amba? For in the shadows, lurking in wait, are secrets that will swallow her whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The House of Rey is at war. And the entire galaxy will bleed before the end.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Famed for its natural beauty and rich history, Sardinia in 1968 is notorious, too, for the bandits who kidnap wealthy landowners for ransom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famed for its natural beauty and rich history, Sardinia in 1968 is notorious, too, for the bandits who kidnap wealthy landowners for ransom. Eleven-year-old Alba Fresu’s brother, and her father, Bruno, are abducted by criminals who mistake Bruno for a rich man. After a grueling journey through the countryside, the two are eventually released—but the experience leaves Alba shaken and unable to readjust to normal life, or to give voice to her inner turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanying her mother to cleaning jobs, Alba visits the villa of an eccentric Signora and touches the keys of a piano for the first time. The instrument’s spell is immediate. During secret lessons, forbidden by her mother, Alba is at last able to express emotions too powerful for words alone. Ignoring her parents’ insistence that she work in the family’s car dealership and marry a local boy, Alba accepts a scholarship to the Rome conservatoire. There she immerses herself in a vibrant world of art and a passionate affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her path will lead her to a crossroads, and Alba will have to decide how to reconcile her talent with her longing for love and family, and convey the music of her heart …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Praise for Sara Alexander:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Will leave readers riveted until the explosive conclusion’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘This enchanting novel is a delightful read, perfectly suited for a warm beach with a cold beverage. Readers who enjoy Adriana Trigiani’s historical Italian family sagas will adore Alexander’s debut.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Readers of Adam Silvera (They Both Die at the End) and Elizabeth Acevedo (The Poet X) will pull out the tissues for this tender, quirky story of one seventeen-year-old boy's journey through first love and first heartbreak, guided by his personal hero, Oscar Wilde.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words have always been more than enough for Ken Z, but when he meets Ran at the mall food court, everything changes. Beautiful, mysterious Ran opens the door to a number of firsts for Ken: first kiss, first love. But as quickly as he enters Ken's life, Ran disappears, and Ken Z is left wondering: Why love at all, if this is where it leads?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letting it end there would be tragic. So, with the help of his best friends, the comfort of his haikus and lists, and even strange, surreal appearances by his hero, Oscar Wilde, Ken will find that love is worth more than the price of heartbreak.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From one of Mexico’s foremost authors comes an adventure story of a boy who goes to live with his kooky, book-obsessed uncle in a library where books have a supernatural power all their own. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juan is looking forward to spending the summer having adventures with his best friend when he gets terrible news: not only are his parents separating, but he has to go live with his strange uncle Tito, who lives in a rambling home with three cats and about one million books. Shy and wary, Juan starts to explore Tito’s library, which is unlike any Juan has ever seen: the books are arranged in strange sections like "Motors That Make No Noise,” "Cheeses That Stink But Taste Delicious,” and "How to Govern Without Being President," and some of them seem to change location each time you look for them. In fact, Tito tells him that a book finds a reader when it’s needed, and not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Tito lets his nephew in on a secret: Juan is a Princeps Reader, to whom books respond in a very special way, and Tito needs his help finding a special volume called The Wild Book, which has never allowed itself to be read. Juan is joined in the quest by his little sister and the pretty girl who works at the pharmacy across the street, and together they battle the nefarious Pirate Book, which steals words out of existing stories. Over the summer, with the help of his new friends, Juan learns all sorts of secrets about world classics from &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;The Metamorphosis&lt;/i&gt;, and overcomes his fear of change and the unfamiliar.</description>

I had not read this before but for me, it was reminiscent of The Magician’s Nephew; in the way that it was a boy discovering more than he thought possible and for the simple fact...</a>]]>

  <description>Meet Malek Khalil. In his mid-40s, Malek is a brilliant reporter with decades of experience in the field. If there has been a war, natural disaster or political crisis, Malek has been there and will be there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the years of conflict reporting have taken their toll and Malek is slowly unravelling. His colleagues, Neeka and Justin, have noticed a change in him. Neeka should know, she has been his producer for decades and knows him better than he knows himself. Justin the cameraman has shot his material for just as long. Together they make a formidable team. But they are only as strong as each other - and Malek is fast going down the rabbit hole. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Born a Muslim but an atheist to his core, Malek undertakes a voyage that takes him around the world and back in time to ancient Babylon as he finds himself arguing with a God in whom he doesn't believe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The novel takes place throughout Middle East, South Asia and London where the backdrop of war, religion, political skullduggery and love play out to take the reader on a journey through some of the most dangerous parts of modern culture and the ancient world.</description>

  <description>Earth scientists and their families stationed on the remote planet of Fosaan were promised a tropical vacation-like experience. But Fosaan, devastated from an apocalyptic event nearly three-hundred years ago, is full of lethal predators and dangerous terrain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthers are forbidden to go beyond the safety zone of their settlement and must not engage the small population of reclusive Fosaanians, descendants of the survivors. Sixteen-year-old Quinn Neen plans to do both of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Quinn discovers a beautiful Fosaanian girl named Mira stealing food from his family’s living unit, he soon learns Earth’s government may not be telling the whole truth about Fosaan and the cause of the past disaster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some who to restore the planet to its former glory by any means necessary. Quinn finds himself caught between his loyalty to his own people and what is right for Mira and her people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he can decide what to do, the scientists are taken captive, stranding the young Earthers on Fosaan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn must go from renegade to leader and convince Mira to become an ally in a fight against an enemy whose very existence threatens their lives and the future of those both on Fosaan and at home.</description>

Quinn was a sixteen-year-old who loved science and when faced with a pretty girl who just appears in his house, Mira, he’s a bit taken with her.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A touching, timeless novel--perfect for fans of Lisa Graff and Lauren Wolk--about a girl who discovers that the ocean is holding secrets she never could have imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Summer loves the ocean. The smell, the immensity, the feeling she gets when she dives beneath the surface. She has lived in Barnes Bluff Bay since she was two years old, when Lindy found her on the beach. It's been the two of them ever since. But now, ten years later, Summer feels uncertainty about her place with Lindy and starts to wonder about where she came from. One night, Summer goes for a swim and gets caught in a riptide, swallowing mouthfuls of seawater. And that night, she dreams of a girl. A girl her age living in the same town, but not in the same time. Summer's not persuaded that this girl is real, but something about her feels familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer dreams again and again about this girl, Tink, and becomes convinced that she is connected to her past. As she sees Tink struggle with her sister growing away from her and her friends starting to pair off, Summer must come to terms with her own evolving home life and discover how the bonds that make us family can help heal the wounds of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Melissa Sarno, the author of &lt;i&gt;Just Under the Clouds&lt;/i&gt;, comes a new story of discovery, family, and finding where you belong.</description>

  <description>When Dorothy Dizon meets the mysterious Adrian Rosario and his alluring knowledge of Filipino history, her life takes an unchartered detour. Adrian knows Dorothy's true calling is connected to the hidden history of the Philippines, but can't reveal any of it until she is conscious of it herself. He keeps his true identity hidden, regardless of how close she gets to the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Adrian doesn't realize is how much Dorothy affects his body and soul. And the more he underestimates her influence, the more danger they're in from enemies of the secret society he swears to protect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a race against time, they experience an emotional journey that tests their belief in each other, hoping their choices ultimately protects the people they love, unknowingly leading to a new enlightenment for them both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enlightenment, Book One of The Bathala Series, explores the history of the Philippines through the first-person perspectives of Filipino American protagonists who teeter dangerously between friendship and love.</description>

  <description>just. Becca, tossed out of university and just let go from her dead-end job, is certain she knows who the victim is. But no one will believe her, and she can hardly even trust herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay, recently widowed and coming to terms with life on her own, suddenly finds herself forced to get involved. For years she and her husband fostered difficult children – including Becca, whom trouble follows like a stray puppy. And now Becca seems to be in the worst trouble of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Jared and Becca meet. Becca, strong-minded and fiercely independent, is confident they can figure out what’s going on. She pulls Kay into the mix, knowing they’ll need all the help they can get… because the police don’t believe them. And more girls are vanishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separately, Kay, Becca and Jared believe their lives have hit rock bottom. But drawn together under extraordinary circumstances, they’ll discover the strength to fight back… and ultimately rebuild their lives from the ruins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set amidst the bleak landscape of the east Yorkshire coast, LIFE RUINS combines haunting landscapes that will appeal to readers of PETER MAY and ANN CLEVES with the thoughtful, internal crime writing of DENISE MINA in a new and unforgettable novel.</description>

  <description>Are you one of the elect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Helen Hope is a lecturer in eschatology – the study of death, judgement, and the destiny of humankind. She is also a Calvinist nun, her life devoted to atoning for a secret crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a body is found crucified on a Liverpool beach, she forms an unlikely alliance with suspect Mikko Kristensen, lead guitarist in death metal band Total Depravity. Together, they go on the trail of a rogue geneticist who they believe holds the key – not just to the murder, but to something much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on the trail is cynical Scouse detective Darren Swift. In his first murder case, he must confront his own lack of faith as a series of horrific crimes drag the city of two cathedrals to the gates of hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science meets religious belief in this gripping murder mystery.</description>

  <description>What Has Been Seen Cannot Be Unseen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liverpool is in the grip of an intense heatwave, and strange things are happening. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A woman dies in an apparent case of Spontaneous Human Combustion; a truck explodes on the dock road; the charred corpses of pets litter the city; forest fires ravage the pinewoods…and there are birds everywhere, silent flocks drawing in ominously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Detective Inspector Darren Swift thinks there are connections, and his investigation delves into the worlds of football, nightclubs and organised crime. But is he imagining things? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Helen Hope doesn’t think so. And she believes the key lies in a mysterious seventeenth-century occult book which has gone missing from Liverpool Library. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the blistering sequel to &lt;i&gt;Reprobation&lt;/i&gt;, DI Swift is forced to confront some inconvenient ghosts from his past, as a terrifying shadow lies over his city’s reality…. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Another knockout novel by Catherine Fearns! In this one, we continue with this thread of the unknown and supernatural that was introduced so wonderfully in book one and Fearns expands on it while keeping true to this also being a mystery as well.

  <description>Four years ago Eliza Dacey was brutally murdered.&lt;br /&gt;Within hours, her killer was caught.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn't he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So reads the opening titles of Jack Quick's new true-crime documentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A skilled producer, Jack knows that the bigger the conspiracy, the higher the ratings. Curtis Wade, convicted of Eliza's murder on circumstantial evidence and victim of a biased police force, is the perfect subject. Millions of viewers agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just before the finale, Jack uncovers a minor detail that may prove Curtis guilty after all. Convinced it will ruin his show, Jack disposes of the evidence and delivers the finale unedited: proposing that Curtis is innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Curtis is released, and a new victim is found bearing horrifying similarities to the original murder, Jack realizes that he may have helped a guilty man out of jail. And, as the only one who knows the real evidence of the case, he is the only one who can send him back...</description>

  <description>This is the story of Mary, a young girl born in a beautiful city full of rose gardens and fluttering kites. When she is still very small, Mary meets Lanmo, a shining golden snake, who becomes her very best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snake visits Mary many times, he sees her city change, become sadder as bombs drop and war creeps in. He sees Mary and her family leave their home, he sees her grow up and he sees her fall in love. But Lanmo knows that the day will come when he can no longer visit Mary, when his destiny will break them apart, and he wonders whether having a friend can possibly be worth the pain of knowing you will lose them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From one of Britain's most gifted and celebrated writers, The Little Snake is a magical and deeply moving fable about the journey we all take through life, about love and family, about war and resilience, about how we live in this world, and how we leave it.</description>

  <description>Every year, on the same night in July, a woman is taken from the streets of London; snatched by a killer who moves through the city like a ghost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie has a secret. On the morning of her tenth birthday, four bombs were detonated across the capital. That night her dad came home covered in blood. She thought he was hurt in the attacks - but then her sister Jessie found a missing woman's purse hidden in his room. Jessie says they mustn't tell. She says there's nothing to worry about. But when she takes a job looking after the woman's baby daughter, Addie starts to realise that her big sister doesn't always tell her the whole story. And that the secrets they're keeping may start costing lives...</description>

The premise was promising enough but it was Addie’s narrative voice that really made this book a gem for me.

  <description>Until she knows her husband’s fate, she cannot decide her own...&lt;br /&gt; An epic debut novel of forbidden love, loss, and the shattered hearts left behind in the wake of World War I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1921. Families are desperately trying to piece together the fragments of their broken lives. While many survivors of the Great War have been reunited with their loved ones, Edie’s husband Francis has not come home. He is considered ‘missing in action’, but when Edie receives a mysterious photograph taken by Francis in the post, hope flares. And so she beings to search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Harry, Francis’s brother, fought alongside him. He too longs for Francis to be alive, so they can forgive each other for the last things they ever said. Both brothers shared a love of photography and it is that which brings Harry back to the Western Front. Hired by grieving families to photograph gravesites, as he travels through battle-scarred France gathering news for British wives and mothers, Harry also searches for evidence of his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And as Harry and Edie’s paths converge, they get closer to a startling truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An incredibly moving account of an often-forgotten moment in history, &lt;i&gt;The Photographer of the Lost&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the thousands of soldiers who were lost amid the chaos and ruins, and the even greater number of men and women desperate to find them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caroline Scott is a freelance writer and historian specializing in WWI and women’s history. &lt;i&gt;The Photographer of the Lost&lt;/i&gt;, partially inspired by her family history, is her first novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A girl discovers that the ocean is holding secrets she never could have imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Summer loves the ocean. The smell, the immensity, the feeling she gets when she dives beneath the surface. She has lived in Barnes Bluff Bay since she was two years old, when Lindy found her on the beach. It's been the two of them ever since. But now, ten years later, Summer feels uncertainty about her place with Lindy and starts to wonder about where she came from. One night, Summer goes for a swim and gets caught in a riptide, swallowing mouthfuls of seawater. And that night, she dreams of a girl. A girl her age living in the same town, but not in the same time. Summer's not persuaded that this girl is real, but something about her feels familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer dreams again and again about this girl, Tink, and becomes convinced that she is connected to her past. As she sees Tink struggle with her sister growing away from her and her friends starting to pair off, Summer must come to terms with her own evolving home life and discover how the bonds that make us family can help heal the wounds of the past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Harriet Gordon stumbles into a murderous web of stolen gems and cutthroat thieves as she runs from her tragic past in an enthralling new historical mystery series set in early twentieth century Singapore.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Singapore 1910--&lt;/b&gt;Desperate for a fresh start and to distance herself from her tragic past, Harriet Gordon finds herself in Singapore at the height of colonial rule. Hoping to gain some financial independence, she advertises her services as a personal secretary. It is unfortunate that she should discover her first client, Sir Oswald Newbold--explorer, mine magnate and president of the exclusive Explorers and Geographers' Club--dead with a knife in his throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Inspector Robert Curran is put on the case, he realizes that he has an unusual witness in Harriet. Harriet's keen eye for detail and strong sense of duty interests him, as does her distrust of the police and her traumatic past, which she is at pains to keep secret from the gossips of Singapore society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a second body is dragged from the canal, Harriet feels compelled to help with the case. She and Curran are soon drawn into a complex web of stolen gemstones and a mysterious gang of thieves who have no qualms about killing again to protect their secrets.</description>

  <description>Readers of Adam Silvera (They Both Die at the End) and Elizabeth Acevedo (The Poet X) will pull out the tissues for this tender, quirky story of one seventeen-year-old boy's journey through first love and first heartbreak, guided by his personal hero, Oscar Wilde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words have always been more than enough for Ken Z, but when he meets Ran at the mall food court, everything changes. Beautiful, mysterious Ran opens the door to a number of firsts for Ken: first kiss, first love. But as quickly as he enters Ken's life, Ran disappears, and Ken Z is left wondering: Why love at all, if this is where it leads?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Letting it end there would be tragic. So, with the help of his best friends, the comfort of his haikus and lists, and even strange, surreal appearances by his hero, Oscar Wilde, Ken will find that love is worth more than the price of heartbreak.</description>

  <description>A YA retelling of classic fairy tale Sleeping Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Thomas cannot take the throne without a queen. Though the problem isn’t his lack of suitors but his refusal to marry a princess that is less than perfect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cardinal presents him with an opportunity: a quest to find the most beautiful princess in the land who has been in slumber for a century. But, unbeknown to the prince, the cardinal plans to kill him as soon as the prince embarks on his quest, and take the throne for himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Prince Thomas’s path crosses with Lucy, a spirited orphan runaway, who saves his life and convinces the prince to continue the quest. When they eventually find Princess Aurora, they also find another contender – Prince Philip – vying for the princess’s heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their mutual disdain for each other, Lucy agrees to assist the prince, and Thomas accepts her help to keep him alive long enough to beat out his competition and return to rule his kingdom alongside his perfect bride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just don’t count on falling for each other in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this game, even winning can be deadly...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it—teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy’s sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it’s naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way—a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they’re alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn’t give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she’s going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect herself and her family and save the life she’s built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can’t beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson’s trademark humor, Never Have I Ever explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>Justice watches from the shadows in this unique and suspenseful twist on a serial killer manhunt…&lt;br /&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;Throughout history, the world has witnessed cruel, gruesome, and twisted murders at the hands of the most notorious serial killers. For those who were never caught—Jack the Ripper, the Atlanta Ripper, and the Cleveland Torso Murderer—their crimes will live on in infamy as their identities are forever chased, but never revealed. &lt;br /&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1947 in Washington, D.C. and a dangerous murderer has boldly discarded two headless bodies nearby the White House and the Jefferson Memorial. With no leads, Detective Clive O’Reilly is feeling desperate. When a stranger convinces O’Reilly to join him at a local pub, he is treated to a wild tale about Prudence Blackwood, an immortal who seeks vengeance for those murdered by history’s most notorious serial killers. &lt;br /&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;Initially in disbelief over her existence, O’Reilly is surprised to discover that she’s very real and she’ll be assisting in the investigation. &lt;br /&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;But Prudence has unorthodox methods. With the body count rising, O’Riley will have to find a way to work with her to stop the most brutal killer in D.C.’s history before more victims are added to the list.&lt;br /&gt;​</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'A daring blend of romance, crime and history, and an intelligent exposé of the inherent injustice and consequences of all forms of oppression' Tsitsi Dangarembga, &lt;i&gt;Nervous Conditions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening with the shooting of Lady Virginia 'Ginie' Courtauld in her tranquil garden in 1950s Rhodesia, &lt;i&gt;The Dragon Lady &lt;/i&gt;tells Ginie's extraordinary story, so called for the exotic tattoo snaking up her leg. From the glamorous Italian Riviera before the Great War to the Art Deco glory of Eltham Palace in the thirties, and from the secluded Scottish Highlands to segregated Rhodesia in the fifties, the narrative spans enormous cultural and social change. Lady Virginia Courtauld was a boundary-breaking, colourful and unconventional person who rejected the submissive role women were expected to play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ostracised by society for being a foreign divorcée at the time of Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson, Ginie and her second husband ,Stephen Courtauld, leave the confines of post-war Britain to forge a new life in Rhodesia, only to find that being progressive liberals during segregation proves mortally dangerous. Many people had reason to dislike Ginie, but who had reason enough to pull the trigger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply evocative of time and place, &lt;i&gt;The Dragon Lady&lt;/i&gt; subtly blends fact and fiction to paint the portrait of an extraordinary woman in an era of great social and cultural change.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two sisters are torn apart by war and must fight their way back to each other in a futuristic, &lt;i&gt;Black Panther&lt;/i&gt;–inspired Nigeria.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2172. Climate change and nuclear disasters have rendered much of earth unlivable. Only the lucky ones have escaped to space colonies in the sky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a war-torn Nigeria, battles are fought using flying, deadly mechs and soldiers are outfitted with bionic limbs and artificial organs meant to protect them from the harsh, radiation-heavy climate. Across the nation, as the years-long civil war wages on, survival becomes the only way of life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two sisters, Onyii and Ify, dream of more. Their lives have been marked by violence and political unrest. Still, they dream of peace, of hope, of a future together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they're willing to fight an entire war to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed author Tochi Onyebuchi has written an immersive, action-packed, deeply personal novel perfect for fans of Nnedi Okorafor, Marie Lu, and Paolo Bacigalupi.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Return of King Lillian&lt;/i&gt; is a mythic journey tale - a metaphysical fantasy for dreamers and nonconformists of all ages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why the manly moniker in tandem with the womanly name?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The Firstborn Child of The Emperor-King Inherits the Ruling Crown, the Title of Emperor-King and All Powers Thereof."&lt;/i&gt; (Item 37, &lt;i&gt;The Royal Manual&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Lillian, the firstborn child of said Emperor-King. Cast out of her Kingdom by malevolent forces, mysteriously waylaid by Destiny, the spirited, self-reliant Lillian sets off on an exuberant journey to find her way home and claim her birthright. As she travels through marvelous and mystical lands in search of her origins, Lillian encounters and befriends a kaleidoscopic cast of characters. Most of the tale is told by Lillian herself, as she chronicles her extraordinary adventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audiobook of &lt;i&gt;The Return of King Lillian&lt;/i&gt; is performed by the author, Suzie Plakson.</description>

  <description>Anxiety. Frustration. Fear. Trust-Issues. All Socorro wanted in life was to exist without interruption. She had no plans for the present, nor the future. At 2:15pm on her 18th birthday, the past decided it had plans for her instead. Suddenly under the guidance of Merlin and hundreds of years of history, Socorro clashes with the weight of tradition and the expectations of her new life as a descendant of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. As the descendants prepare for the second round of the battle between good and evil against the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Socorro struggles with the idea of accepting this new life, particularly all the people that are now thrust into it.</description>

  <description>Book One of 'The Aten' Saga&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Awakening Aten envelops the reader in an Egypt of whispers and fears, of webs within webs, deceit upon deceit. Its themes of murder, intrigue, political and religious conflict, corruption, tomb robbing, war and executions are set against a background of fundamental ideological change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ancient Egypt is seen through the eyes of two families; one royal, the other commoner. Yuya, whose tomb is in the Valley of the Kings, is a foreigner who rises from slavery to become Regent to an infant Pharaoh and thus, the most powerful man in the world’s wealthiest empire. His children and descendants will remain at the very heart of the country’s destiny. Kha is a tomb painter and builder who experiences both the despair of imprisonment and the horror of war. As Overseer of the King’s Works he restores the Great Sphinx, and inscribes the ‘Dream Stela’ placed between its paws, still visible today. Through tragic and deathly events his family and that of Yuya become entwined.</description>

  <description>In a realm where toxic mist sweeps the lands and magic is forbidden, all Bleak wants is a cure for her power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still grieving the death of her guardian and dangerously self-medicating with alcohol, Bleak is snatched from her home by the Commander of the King’s Army, and summoned to the capital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the king isn’t the only one interested in Bleak’s powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader of an infamous society of warriors, the Valia Kindred, lays claim to her as well, and Bleak finds herself in the middle of a much bigger battle than she anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heart of Mist is the gripping first book in The Oremere Chronicles, a fantasy series of epic proportions.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5/5<br /><br />This was a lovely collection of fanciful folklore tales, some with the old 'Aesop's fables' morals at the end [though this is not inspired by Aesop or related, just an example to help]. Fuller gives us a great introduction into folklore that is outside of the usual tales we grow...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A compulsive, disturbingly relevant, twisty and powerful psychological, social-media thriller from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Black Path&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom is a successful author, but he’s struggling to finish his novel. His main distraction is an online admirer, Evie, who simply won’t leave him alone.&lt;br /&gt;Evie is smart, well read and unstable; she lives with her father and her social-media friendships are not only her escape, but everything she has.&lt;br /&gt;When she’s hit with a restraining order, her world is turned upside down, and Tom is free to live his life again, to concentrate on writing.&lt;br /&gt;But things aren’t really adding up. For Tom is distracted but also addicted to his online relationships, and when they take a darker, more menacing turn, he feels powerless to change things. Because maybe he needs Evie more than he’s letting on.&lt;br /&gt;A compulsive, disturbingly relevant, twisty and powerful psychological thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Closer I Get&lt;/i&gt; is also a searing commentary on the fragility and insincerity of online relationships, and the danger that can lurk just one ‘like’ away…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Fatal Attraction meets social media, haha, I loved it. A little too plausible and creepy which is what made it such a good read.

  <description>1861. Miss Lucinda Leavitt is shocked when she learns the author of her favorite serialized novel has died before completing the story. Determined to learn how it ends, Lucinda reluctantly enlists the help of her father’s young business partner, Mr. David Randall, to track down the reclusive author’s former whereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David is a successful young businessman, but is overwhelmed by his workload. He wants to prove himself to his late father, as well as to himself. He doesn’t have the time, nor the interest, for this endeavor, but Lucinda is not the type to take no for an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their search for the elusive Mrs. Smith and the rightful ending to her novel leads Lucinda and David around the country, but the truths they discover about themselves—and each other—are anything but fictional.</description>

  <description>J SS Bach is the story of three generations of women from either side of Germany's 20th Century horror story - one side, a Jewish family from Vienna, the other linked to a ranking Nazi official at Dachau concentration camp - who suffer the consequences of what men do. Fast forward to 1990s California, and two survivors from the families meet. Rosa is a young Australian musicologist; Otto is a world-famous composer and cellist. Music and history link them. A novel of music, the Holocaust, love, and a dog. The author's writing is a wonderland, captivating and drawing the reader in to the presented world. Time becomes no object as a literary universe unfolds and carries the reader through eighty years, where emotions are real and raw and beautifully given.</description>

  <description>Abandoned and alone, thirteen-year-old Joe's world is shattered when he enters a deserted council house and becomes trapped within a labyrinth protecting the last magical places on earth. There, Joe discovers a book charting this immense no-man's land, without time or place, its thirteen doors each leading to a different realm. Hunted by sinister foes, the boy is forced ever deeper into both the maze and the mystery of his missing parents. What will he find at the labyrinth's centre, and can it reunite him with the family he so desperately needs? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing through diverse landscapes from Victorian Britain to fifties New Orleans, The Stranger's Guide to Talliston is inspired by the internationally famous house and gardens dubbed 'Britain's Most Extraordinary Home' by the Sunday Times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a classic YA tale of adventure that introduces readers to an otherworld hiding in plain sight, cloaked in magic and steeped in imagined history. Yet beyond its fearsome huntsmen and battling magicians dwells the secret that lies within all of us - the power to live extraordinary lives.</description>

  <description>Pricolici.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A creature out of folklore. And nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 1889. When a Romanian village suffers a series of brutal attacks, occult investigator Anne Lawrence is dispatched to the forests of the Old Country to hunt the killer – only to vanish without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail leads her mentor Vivienne Cumberland deep into the Carpathians to a remote monastery. As a blizzard rages outside, trapping them all with the pricolici, Vivienne risks sharing the fate of the woman she came to find. But is the culprit truly a werewolf … or something even more dangerous?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man bent on revenge. And a love that was never meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned in a decaying castle, Anne finds herself ensnared in a web of dark enchantment, at the mercy of a mysterious captor with a beast inside – and a memory as old as the ancient legends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weeks pass, Anne learns his real identity, and slowly uncovers a complex and deeply passionate man. But is she willing to pay the price for falling under his spell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author’s Note: This darkly magical reimagining of Beauty and the Beast is the third book in the Gaslamp Gothic series, but can be read as a standalone with no need to start with Book #1, The Daemoniac.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Sometimes you have to risk everything to find your something...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew works with death for a living. Searching for people's next of kin and attending the funerals if they don't have anyone, he's desperate to avoid the same fate for himself. Which is fine, because he has the perfect wife and 2.4 children waiting at home for him after a long day. At least, that's what he's told people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, his life isn't exactly as people think and the little white lie he once told is about to catch up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because in all Andrew's efforts to fit in, he's forgotten one important thing: how to really live. And maybe, it's about time for him to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For as long as she can remember, Tova has lived among the Svell, the people who found her washed ashore as a child and use her for her gift as a Truthtongue. Her own home and clan are long-faded memories, but the sacred symbols and staves inked over every inch of her skin mark her as one who can cast the rune stones and see into the future. She has found a fragile place among those who fear her, but when two clans to the east bury their age-old blood feud and join together as one, her world is dangerously close to collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in generations, the leaders of the Svell are divided. Should they maintain peace or go to war with the allied clans to protect their newfound power? And when their chieftain looks to Tova to cast the stones, she sets into motion a series of events that will not only change the landscape of the mainland forever but will give her something she believed she could never have again - a home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Local police have announced that they're closing the investigation of the suspected drowning of 37-year-old painter Colleen Westcott. She disappeared on April 11, 2010, and her car was found parked near the waterfront in Cleveland two days later, but her body has never been found. The chief of police has stated that no concrete evidence of foul play has been discovered in the probe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I close the online search window, annoyed. These articles never have enough detail. They think my husband's first wife disappeared or they think she is dead. There's a big difference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My phone rings, jarring me away from my thoughts, and when I pick it up, it's an unknown number. The only answer to my slightly breathless &lt;i&gt;hello&lt;/i&gt; is empty static. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the voice does finally come, it's female, low, muffled somehow. "Where is it, Claire? What did you do with it? Tell me where it is."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman. A real flesh-and-blood woman on the other end of the phone. She's not just in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wave of panic spreads under my skin like ice water. It's Colleen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>'We lost all three girls that summer. Let them slip away like the words of some half-remembered song and when one came back, she wasn't the one we were trying to recall to begin with.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Tikka Molloy's recount of the summer of 1992 - the summer the Van Apfel sisters, Hannah, the beautiful Cordelia and Ruth - disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Eleven and one-sixth years old, Tikka is the precocious narrator of this fabulously endearing coming-of-age story, set in an eerie Australian river valley suburb with an unexplained stench. The Van Apfel girls vanish from the valley during the school's 'Showstopper' concert, held at the outdoor amphitheatre by the river. While the search for the sisters unites the small community on Sydney's urban fringe, the mystery of their disappearance remains unsolved forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly observed, sharp, lively, funny and entirely endearing, this novel is part mystery, part coming-of-age story - and quintessentially Australian. Think 'The Virgin Suicides' meets 'Jasper Jones' meets 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'</description>

An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47907309-spin-the-dawn" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Runway&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Mulan&lt;/i&gt; in this sweeping YA fantasy about a young girl who poses as a boy to compete for the role of imperial tailor and embarks on an impossible journey to sew three magic dresses, from the sun, the moon, and the stars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maia Tamarin dreams of becoming the greatest tailor in the land, but as a girl, the best she can hope for is to marry well. When a royal messenger summons her ailing father, once a tailor of renown, to court, Maia poses as a boy and takes his place. She knows her life is forfeit if her secret is discovered, but she'll take that risk to achieve her dream and save her family from ruin. There's just one catch: Maia is one of twelve tailors vying for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstabbing and lies run rampant as the tailors compete in challenges to prove their artistry and skill. Maia's task is further complicated when she draws the attention of the court magician, Edan, whose piercing eyes seem to see straight through her disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And nothing could have prepared her for the final challenge: to sew three magic gowns for the emperor's reluctant bride-to-be, from the laughter of the sun, the tears of the moon, and the blood of stars. With this impossible task before her, she embarks on a journey to the far reaches of the kingdom, seeking the sun, the moon, and the stars, and finding more than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steeped in Chinese culture, sizzling with forbidden romance, and shimmering with magic, this young adult fantasy is pitch-perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas or Renée Ahdieh.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>"Horizontal Collaboration" is a term used to describe the sexual and romantic relationships that some French women had with members of the occupying German forces during World War II. In this poignant, female-centered graphic novel created by writer/artist duo Carole Maurel and Mademoiselle Navie, the taboo of "sleeping with the enemy" is explored through the story of a passionate, and forbidden, affair. In June 1942, married Rose (whose husband is a prisoner of war) intervenes in the detainment of her Jewish friend and then accidentally embarks on a secret relationship with the investigating German officer, Mark. There is only one step between heroism and treason, and it's often a dangerous one. Inside an apartment building on Paris’s 11th arrondissement, little escapes the notice of the blind husband of the concierge. Through his sightless but all-knowing eyes, we learn of Rose and Mark’s hidden relationship, and also of the intertwined stories and problems of the other tenants, largely women and children, who face such complex issues as domestic violence, incest, and prostitution. This fascinating graphic novel tackles the still-sensitive topic of who it is acceptable to love, and how, and the story's drama is brought vividly to life by intimate and atmospheric illustrations.</description>

  <description>A single wish will spark a new dawn. Every millennium, one age ends and another age dawns...and whoever holds the Scroll of a Thousand Prayers holds the power to call the great Kami Dragon from the sea and ask for any one wish. The time is near and the missing pieces of the scroll will be sought throughout the land of Iwagoto. The holder of the first piece is a humble, unknown peasant girl with a dangerous secret. Demons have burned the temple Yumeko was raised in to the ground, killing everyone within, including the master who trained her to both use and hide her kitsune powers. Yumeko escapes with the temple's greatest treasure - one part of the ancient scroll. Fate thrusts her into the path of a mysterious samurai, Kage Tatsumi of the Shadow Clan. Yumeko knows he seeks what she has and is under orders to kill anything and anyone who stands between him and the scroll.</description>

  <description>The journey of grief is a strange one &lt;br /&gt;and one not often talked about and one not often talked about in our everyday reality of this society, &lt;br /&gt;but I know what it's like to dive deep, &lt;br /&gt;down to the bottom of the wreck, &lt;br /&gt;feel the ribs of the wreck, &lt;br /&gt;after losing a parent so young in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this collection, the sea refuses no river, there is an acceptance of the pain and an acceptance of the healing moments; the healing journeys. To quote Adrienne Rich: I came to explore the wreck', and in this collection, Bethany discovers how, 'The words are purposes. The words are maps.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Bethany Rivers is unusual in contemporary British poetry because she has evolved a discursive mode which allows her to speak explicitly about emotions and (even more unusually) ideas. That is a sign of her powerful personal investment in what she writes and her determination to make poetry speak about important questions - she refuses to write easy conventional poems. These qualities, combined with her ransacking of the everyday for signs of the archetypal, single her out as a poet who deserves to be widely read and thought about. - Ian Gregson</description>

      <![CDATA[I have always had a soft spot for poetry, and though it's nice to read love poems, romantic ones at that, I think that poetry spans so much more and offers a sort of comfort for almost any situation. In this collection, Rivers takes the reader on a journey of grief and healing, in this case it is...]]>

  &lt;strong&gt;A DCI Michael Yorke Thriller&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A vicious serial killer slithers from the darkness, determined to resurrect the ways of a long-dead civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ex-wife of one of DCI Michael Yorke’s closest allies is left mutilated and murdered, Yorke and his team embark on their greatest test yet. A  deeply personal case that will push them to their very limits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Yorke’s team are pulled further into the dark, the killer circles, preparing to strike again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The Repenting Serpent is a true edge-of-the-seat, nail-biting page turner.&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Lily’s gone.&lt;/strong&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Someone took her.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Unless she was she never there…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little girl has gone missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily was last seen being tucked into bed by her adoring mother, Nova. But the next morning, the bed is empty except for a creepy toy rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has Nova’s abusive ex stolen his “little bunny” back for good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Officer Ellie James assumes this is a clear custody battle. Until she discovers that there are no pictures of the girl and her drawers are full of unused toys and brand new clothes that have never been worn…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Ellie searching for a missing child who doesn’t actually exist?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Winner of a Northern Writers’ Award&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longlisted in The Bath Novel Award&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if reading the wrong book could get you arrested?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a decaying city controlled by the First General and his army, expressing the wrong opinion can have terrible consequences. Clara Winter knows this better than anyone. When she was a child, her father was taken by the Authorisation Bureau for the crime of teaching banned books to his students. She is still haunted by his disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Clara teaches at the same university, determined to rebel against the regime that cost her family so much – and her weapons are the banned books her father left behind. But she has started something dangerous, something that brings her to the attention of the Authorisation Bureau and its most feared interrogator, Major Jackson. The same man who arrested Clara’s father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her rights stripped away, in a country where democracy has been replaced with something more sinister, will she be the next one to disappear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Provocative and prescient, The Disappeared is an unflinching tale of resistance in dark political times. Set in a near-future Britain where books are banned, this is a thought-provoking dystopian debut.’ – Caroline Ambrose, Founder of The Bath Novel Award</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eerie, old Scottish manor in the middle of nowhere that’s now hers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ailsa Calder has inherited half of a house. The other half belongs to a man who disappeared without a trace twenty-seven years ago—her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving London behind to settle the inheritance from her mother’s estate, Ailsa returns to her childhood home, nestled amongst the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, joined by the half-sister who’s almost a stranger to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ailsa can’t escape the claustrophobic feeling that the house itself is watching her—as if her past hungers to consume her. She also can’t ignore how the neighbourhood animals refuse to set one foot within the gates of the garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first nighttime intruder shows up, Ailsa fears that the manor’s careless rugged beauty could cost her everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One thousand years ago, a wish was made to the Harbinger of Change and a sword of rage and lightning was forged. &lt;i&gt;Kamigoroshi.&lt;/i&gt; The Godslayer. It had one task: to seal away the powerful demon Hakaimono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he has broken free.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kitsune shapeshifter Yumeko has one task: to take her piece of the ancient and powerful scroll to the Steel Feather temple in order to prevent the summoning of the Harbinger of Change, the great Kami Dragon who will grant one wish to whomever holds the Scroll of a Thousand Prayers. But she has a new enemy now. The demon Hakaimono, who for centuries was trapped in a cursed sword, has escaped and possessed the boy she thought would protect her, Kage Tatsumi of the Shadow Clan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hakaimono has done the unthinkable and joined forces with the Master of Demons in order to break the curse of the sword and set himself free. To overthrow the empire and cover the land in darkness, they need one thing: the Scroll of a Thousand Prayers. As the paths of Yumeko and the possessed Tatsumi cross once again, the entire empire will be thrown into chaos.</description>

  <description>While staying in a Dorset cottage, Hugh Mullion finds a mysterious key down the side of an antique chair. No one can say how long the key has been there or what it opens. Hugh’s search for answers will unlock the secrets of the troubled life of a talented artist, destined to be hailed a neglected genius fifty years too late. And no secret is darker than that of The Amber Maze, from whose malign influence he never escaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail takes Hugh from Edwardian Oxfordshire to 1960s Camden Town, where the ghosts of the past are finally laid to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicately crafted noir fiction at its best.</description>

  <description>The Seventh Train is a ride - a ‘road movie’ on the railways. It’s a journey that Elizabeth invented; the only original thought she has ever had in her previously uneventful life. Unbeknown to her, she is not travelling alone. If only she’d pretended that the spare seat was taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a wonderfully eclectic cast of characters, The Seventh Train takes its passengers on a journey from the tragic to the strange, arriving finally at hope. By turns heart-breaking, thought-provoking and hilarious, this tale is a life-affirming exploration of the human spirit via the British railway timetable! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ingenious, great fun, and wholly original” - Fay Weldon CBE, on The Seventh Train</description>

  <description>Emerging out of the 1940-1941 London Blitz, the drama of these two short works, a novel and a memoir, comes from the courage and endurance of ordinary people met in the factories, streets and lodging houses of a city under bombardment. Inez Holden's novella Night Shift follows a largely working-class cast of characters for five night shifts in a factory that produces camera parts for war planes. It Was Different At The Time is Holden's account of wartime life from April 1938 to August 1941, drawn from her own diary. This was intended to be a joint project written with her friend George Orwell (he was in the end too busy to contribute), and includes disguised appearances of Orwell and other notable literary figures of the period. The experiences recorded in It Was Different At The Time overlap in period and subject with Night Shift, setting up a vibrant dialogue between the two texts. Inez Holden (1903-1974) was a British writer and literary figure whose social and professional connections embraced most of London's literary and artistic life. She modelled for Augustus John, worked alongside Evelyn Waugh, and had close relationships with George Orwell, Stevie Smith, H G Wells, Cyril Connolly, and Anthony Powell. The introduction and notes are by Kristin Bluemel, exploring how these short prose texts work as multiple stories: of Inez Holden herself, the history of the Blitz, of middlebrow women's writing, of Second World War fiction, and of the world of work.</description>

  <description>I killed the boy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jig loves football and his dog, hates school, misses his granda and knows to lie low when his ma's blitzed on the vodka and tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's just an ordinary boy on the mean streets alongside Dublin's Grand Canal. Streets that are ruled by Ghost and his crew. And now Ghost- inked, vicious, unprincipled- has a job for Jig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A job that no one can afford to go wrong- not the gangs, the police, the locals, and least of all not Jig.</description>

  <description>The second part of Arthur and Jo’s strange adventures throughout the land of Discoucia, and a time when Archie the Water Goddess has made the ultimate sacrifice to rid the world of her nemesis, Cordelia Paradise, the Fire Goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, things rarely go to plan and Arthur finds himself at war with Archie’s hidden agenda rather than the insane task that he has to help Archie complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden around Discoucia in its sixteen major cities are sixteen gems that Archie must collect before a year is up. If she wins then Cordelia will disappear to another dimension and not return until she agrees to stop causing forest fires, volcanic eruptions and droughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Team Archie has Arthur and Jo, who both have the understanding that by collecting these gems a natural order can be brought back and maybe Jo’s father will get well again. Team Cordelia has Alicia May, who has a talent for becoming anyone and a deep malicious streak; and Iren, who has a fanatical hatred for Archie, which Archie herself doesn’t like to talk about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way they meet old friends and old enemies, as well as Archie having to perform miracles without the use of divine power. From the murky ruins of Tanalos to the haunted corridors of Ashin Dance Academy, the frozen caverns of Icester and the verdant streets of Proceur, the adventure will take them around Discoucia and beyond, unless Cordelia and Alicia May can stop them first...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Revolution, romance and technological wonders are all in a day's work for the decorated hero of Alavonia, Sir Arthur Pageon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An acclaimed explorer and inventor, Sir Arthur Pageon takes his unofficial role as defender of the realm of Avalonia very seriously. A fantastical world, Avalonia is home to the Discoucian Monarchy, as well as monstrous creatures and secretive academies for the highly gifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon returning from his most recent exploits aboard on his personal flying galleon The Nostradamus, Pageon is treated to a hero’s welcome and celebratory procession through the streets of Avalonia’s capital, Evermore. Little does Pageon know he’s being followed by a mysterious group known as the Purple Guard, whose devious leader is his estranged sister, Queen Lily Pageon of Harrha Island. Fiercely intelligent, Lily specialises in dastardly technological inventions with the aim of bringing down the Discoucian Monarchy so that she may reign as its dictator. However, the heir to the throne is one Princes Josephine Oladine, whose youth and royal position masks her role in the Discoucian Secret Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining forces, Princess Josephine and Sir Arthur’s adventures will take them across the whole of Avalonia — from the fog-bound shores of Karga, to the secret underground shanty town beneath the frozen prison of Icester, south to the verdant city of Proceur and from there to the affluent Starfall Academy — in their quest to foil Lily’s revolutionary plans.</description>

  <description>Kent Fisher gets more than he bargained for when Detective Inspector Ashley Goodman enlists his help with a ten year old murder. She’s on a mission and needs a big case to put her career back on track. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And they don’t come much bigger than Miles Birchill, Downland’s wealthiest and most divisive resident. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not for the first time, Kent has doubts about the case, forcing him to make choices. But who do you trust when everyone has something to hide? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caught in the middle, he has no alternative but to solve the murder, unaware that his every move is being watched. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kent Fisher novels offer a fresh and contemporary reworking of the classic whodunit and murder mysteries of authors like Agatha Christie. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The realm’s darkest secret is out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cruelty of the capital and the power-hungry King Arden have scattered Bleak and her companions across the continents.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the run in a foreign land, Bleak finds herself tied to some unexpected strangers. When the answers she yearns for are finally within reach, she must face the hard truths of her past, and take her fate into her own hands before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, secrets and magic unravel as a dark power corrupts the realm. Bleak’s friends are forced to decide where their loyalties lie, and who, if anyone, they can trust.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But one thing is certain: war is coming, and they must all be ready when it does.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Intriguing and action-packed, Reign of Mist is the second installment in Helen Scheuerer’s epic YA fantasy series, The Oremere Chronicles.</description>

  <description>War is here.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toxic mist drives all life to the brink of destruction and the conqueror queen, Ines, has her talons in the kings of the realm.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bleak, having discovered her true heritage, must now scour the lands for the one thing that might save them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the search is a treacherous one – and it will push her to the very limits of endurance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amidst secrets, lies and the intricacies of battle, Bleak and her companions learn just how far they’ll go for the ones they love. But will it be enough?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As deadly forces grapple for power across the continents, families, friends and allies unite to take one final stand.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Explosive revelations, heart-wrenching betrayals and breathtaking magic soar in the epic conclusion to Helen Scheuerer’s bestselling trilogy, The Oremere Chronicles.</description>

  <description>I Will Find You, a tale of mystery and intrigue which starts in wartime Fenland near Ely and then moves halfway across the globe to Australia. John Taylor's story is colourful, poignant and moving as it charts the journey of young Robbie Spalding and his path from a Dr. Barnardos Home in Cambridge to a new life on the other side of the world. Robbie becomes Nick Thorne and this account of his arrival into adulthood is more than a little tragic and filled with unexpected twists and turns.&lt;br /&gt;Touching, funny, sad and filled with drama, I will find you is an authentic and pacey read, gripping and compelling, and will certainly keep the readers' attention until the last page is turned. Expect to shed a tear for the casualties of war.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing an epic new trilogy from Taran Matharu, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times–&lt;/i&gt;bestselling Summoner series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout history, people have vanished with no explanation. A group of teenagers are about to discover why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cade is settling into a new boarding school, contemplating his future, when he finds himself transported to another realm. He soon discovers their new world is populated with lost remnants from the past: prehistoric creatures, ancient relics, and stranger still — people. Overwhelmed by his new surroundings, Cade has little time to adjust, for soon he and his fellow classmates are forced to become contenders in a brutal game, controlled by mysterious overlords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who are these beings and why did they choose these teens? Cade must prepare for battle . . . because hiding is not an option.</description>

  <description>Part of a series of books containing myths as retold by first-rank contemporary authors, this is Alexander McCall Smith's telling of the Celtic myth of Dream Angus, a god of love, youth, beauty, and also the bringer of dreams. He is cherished by all, but fated to love only Caér, the swan maiden from his own dreams. Smith spins five charming stories of Dream Angus with five tales of his modern alter egos.</description>

  <description>From the author of the page-turning domestic suspense &lt;i&gt;Best Day Ever&lt;/i&gt;, comes another gripping novel of psychological suspense set in an upscale Southern California community, for fans of B.A. Paris and Shari Lapena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect home. The perfect family. The perfect lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Harris lives in a sparkling home in an oceanfront gated community in Orange County. It’s a place that seems too beautiful to be touched by sadness. But exactly one year ago, Jane’s oldest daughter, Mary, died in a tragic accident and Jane has been grief-stricken ever since. Lost in a haze of anti-depressants, she’s barely even left the house. Now that’s all about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time for Jane to reclaim her life and her family. Jane’s husband, David, has planned a memorial service for Mary and three days later, their youngest daughter, Betsy, graduates high school. Yet as Jane reemerges into the world, it’s clear her family has changed without her. Her husband has been working long days—and nights—at the office. Her daughter seems distant, even secretive. And her beloved Mary was always such a good girl—dutiful and loving. But does someone know more about Mary, and about her last day, than they’ve revealed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonds between mothers and daughters, and husbands and wives should never be broken. But you never know how far someone will go to keep a family together…</description>

  <description>Ruby Chernyavsky has been told the stories since she was a child: The women in her family, once possessed of great magical abilities to remake lives and stave off death itself, were forced to flee their Russian home for America in order to escape the fearful men who sought to destroy them. Such has it always been, Ruby’s been told, for powerful women. Today, these stories seem no more real to Ruby than folktales, except for the smallest bit of power left in their blood: when each of them comes of age, she will have a vision of who she will be when she dies—a destiny as inescapable as it is inevitable. Ruby is no exception, and neither is her mother, although she ran from her fate years ago, abandoning Ruby and her sisters. It’s a fool’s errand, because they all know the truth: there is no escaping one’s Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Ruby’s great-aunt Polina passes away, and, for the first time, a Chernyavsky’s death does not match her vision. Suddenly, things Ruby never thought she’d be allowed to hope for—life, love, time—seem possible. But as she and her cousin Cece begin to dig into the family’s history to find out whether they, too, can change their fates, they learn that nothing comes without a cost. Especially not hope.</description>

      <![CDATA[Podos starts this book with a leap into a world that I want to just never leave. She gives us a YA fantasy with a darker spin but leaving throughout the story glimpses of hope and goodness.

  <description>The second book in a series where your favorite literary characters come to life, inspired by the timeless classic, Little Women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s no one better than the boy next door. At least not according to Aurora Campbell, fourteen, who has been in love with Tobias May since their very first sandbox kiss. The problem is, he’s in love with her older sister, Merrilee. And Merri is already dating one of his best friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rory is learning all about pining as her class reads The Great Gatsby, a book she doesn’t find “great” at all. Also not great—her GPA, something she needs to fix, quickly, if she’d like to apply for the chance to spend a week studying art with her hero in New York City over winter break. But when Ms. Gregoire assigns her to read Little Women for extra credit, Rory discovers more than she expected—both about herself and Toby. Maybe she wasn’t in love with the boy next door. . . but the boy next story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is complicated, and it’s all about to get even trickier for Rory at Reginald R. Hero Prep . . . where with the help of one quirky English teacher, students’ fantasies come true, often with surprising consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I was born for killing – the gods made me to ruin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Convent of Sweet Mercy young girls are raised to be killers. In a few the old bloods show, gifting talents rarely seen since the tribes beached their ships on Abeth. Sweet Mercy hones its novices’ skills to deadly effect: it takes ten years to educate a Red Sister in the ways of blade and fist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even the mistresses of sword and shadow don’t truly understand what they have purchased when Nona Grey is brought to their halls as a bloodstained child of eight, falsely accused of murder: guilty of worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stolen from the shadow of the noose, Nona is sought by powerful enemies, and for good reason. Despite the security and isolation of the convent her secret and violent past will find her out. Beneath a dying sun that shines upon a crumbling empire, Nona Grey must come to terms with her demons and learn to become a deadly assassin if she is to survive…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Merciless. Murderer. Monster. He has been called many names in his time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Built for war and nothing else, he has witnessed every shade of violence humans know, and he has wrought his own masterpieces with their colours. He cared once, perhaps, but far too long ago. He is bound to his task, dead to the chaos he wreaks for his masters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he has a new master to serve and a new war to endure. In the far reaches of the Realm, Hartlund tears itself in two over coin and crown. This time he will fight for a boy king and a general bent on victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beneath it all he longs for change. For something to surprise him. For an end to this cycle of warfare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Action-packed and emotionally-charged, &lt;b&gt;The Heart of Stone&lt;/b&gt; is a dark fantasy novel that explores the aspects of human nature. Perfect for fans of Brandon Sanderson, Mark Lawrence, and Joe Abercrombie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The only light than can defeat this darkness is the light you carry within you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the consort of the Prince of the Vampiri, Saphrona resolves not to lose her identity in Gideon’s shadowy world. Though she feels ever more drawn to him and sympathizes with his people’s struggle to emulate human compassion, she refuses to allow anything to threaten her autonomy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gideon longs for Saphrona’s love, but he is reluctant to reveal the full reality of their new relationship, for fear it will drive an irrevocable wedge between them before he has a chance to win her heart. When Saphrona discovers his omission, it shatters her trust in him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heartbroken, Gideon risks self-destruction to prove to Saphrona that her free will is sacred to him. Even as his gamble leads to a revelation that will bring them forever closer, the consequences of such a risk set the Followers on the path of war with Antonia and tragic betrayal in House Bloodstone.</description>

  <description>By 4042 CE, the Hierophant and his Church have risen to political dominance with his cannibalistic army of genetically modified humans: martyrs. In an era when mankind's intergenerational cold wars against their long-lived predators seem close to running hot, the Holy Family is poised on the verge of complete planetary control. It will take a miracle to save humanity from extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will also take a miracle to resurrect the wife of 331-year-old General Dominia di Mephitoli, who defects during martyr year 1997 AL in search of Lazarus, the one man rumored to bring life to the dead. With the Hierophant's Project Black Sun looming over her head, she has little choice but to believe this Lazarus is really all her new friends say he is--assuming he exists at all--and that these companions of hers are really able to help her. From the foulmouthed Japanese prostitute with a few secrets of her own to the outright sapient dog who seems to judge every move, they don't inspire a lot of confidence, but the General has to take the help she can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, Dominia is no ordinary martyr. She is THE HIEROPHANT'S DAUGHTER, and her Father won't let her switch sides without a fight. Not when she still has so much to learn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A literary courtroom drama about a Korean immigrant family and a young, single mother accused of murdering her eight-year-old autistic son&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My husband asked me to lie. Not a big lie. He probably didn’t even consider it a lie, and neither did I, at first . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the small town of Miracle Creek, Virginia, Young and Pak Yoo run an experimental medical treatment device known as the Miracle Submarine—a pressurized oxygen chamber that patients enter for therapeutic “dives” with the hopes of curing issues like autism or infertility. But when the Miracle Submarine mysteriously explodes, killing two people, a dramatic murder trial upends the Yoos’ small community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who or what caused the explosion? Was it the mother of one of the patients, who claimed to be sick that day but was smoking down by the creek? Or was it Young and Pak themselves, hoping to cash in on a big insurance payment and send their daughter to college? The ensuing trial uncovers unimaginable secrets from that night—trysts in the woods, mysterious notes, child-abuse charges—as well as tense rivalries and alliances among a group of people driven to extraordinary degrees of desperation and sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angie Kim’s &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt;is a thoroughly contemporary take on the courtroom drama, drawing on the author’s own life as a Korean immigrant, former trial lawyer, and mother of a real-life “submarine” patient. An addictive debut novel for fans of Liane Moriarty and Celeste Ng, &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek &lt;/i&gt;is both a twisty page-turner and a deeply moving story about the way inconsequential lies and secrets can add up—with tragic consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The “gripping… page-turner” (&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;) hitting all the best of summer reading lists, &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for book clubs and fans of Liane Moriarty and Celeste Ng&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far will you go to protect your family? Will you keep their secrets? Ignore their lies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a small town in Virginia, a group of people know each other because they’re part of a special treatment center, a hyperbaric chamber that may cure a range of conditions from infertility to autism. But then the chamber explodes, two people die, and it’s clear the explosion wasn’t an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful showdown unfolds as the story moves across characters who are all maybe keeping secrets, hiding betrayals. Chapter by chapter, we shift alliances and gather evidence: Was it the careless mother of a patient? Was it the owners, hoping to cash in on a big insurance payment and send their daughter to college? Could it have been a protester, trying to prove the treatment isn’t safe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A stunning debut about parents, children and the unwavering hope of a better life, even when all hope seems lost" (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post), Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt; uncovers the worst prejudice and best intentions, tense rivalries and the challenges of parenting a child with special needs. It’s “a quick-paced murder mystery that plumbs the power and perils of community” (&lt;i&gt;O Magazine&lt;/i&gt;) as it carefully pieces together the tense atmosphere of a courtroom drama and the complexities of life as an immigrant family. Drawing on the author’s own experiences as a Korean-American, former trial lawyer, and mother of a “miracle submarine” patient, this is a novel steeped in suspense and igniting discussion. Recommended by Erin Morgenstern, Jean Kwok, Jennifer Weiner, Scott Turow, Laura Lippman, and more-- &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt; is a brave, moving debut from an unforgettable new voice.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was unlike any other I've read. I'm a huge mystery/thriller fan but I'd yet to read a courtroom drama and this sets the bar exceptionally high now for the genre. Angie Kim throws a story at you where you're forced to look at the darker side of people, but, not because they're evil but b...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Every tree in the sacred Forest of Laida houses a soul. Though each of those souls will return to the mortal world for many future lives, not all of them deserve to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seycia's father told her this story as a child -- a story of the most holy place in the Underworld, The Forest of Laida, where all souls go to rest before embarking on a new life. But Seycia's father is dead now, and his killer has put a target on her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being chosen for her village's human sacrifice ritual, Seycia is transported to the Underworld and must join forces with Haben, the demon to whom she was sacrificed, to protect the family she left behind from beyond the grave. In this story of love, survival, and what it means to be human, Seycia and Haben discover that the Underworld is riddled with secrets that can only be unlocked through complete trust and devotion, not only to their mission, but also to one another.</description>

  <description>Packed with high stakes mystery and tons of heart, this first installment in a new series introduces Kazu Jones-a spunky, scrappy detective who's this generation's Harriet the Spy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a string of dognappings grips her Denver neighborhood, Kazu Jones vows to track down the culprits. She can't stand to see more dogs go missing-especially once her neighbors' beloved pet is taken because of her gigantic mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of her gang-including her best friend and expert hacker, March; and her ginormous, socially anxious pup, Genki-Kazu uncovers evidence that suggests the dognapping ring is bigger than she ever imagined. But the more she digs, the more dangerous her investigation becomes. The dognappers are getting bolder, and Genki could be next.</description>

  <description>In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And, meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders' return and intends to destroy them once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crown of Feathers is an epic fantasy about love's incredible power to save or to destroy. Throughout is interspersed the story of Avalkyra Ashfire, the last Rider Queen, who would rather see her empire burn than fall into her sister's hands.</description>

  <description>In the midst of war, he found love&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of darkness, he found courage&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of tragedy, he found hope&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beekeeper of Aleppo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will you find from his story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuri is a beekeeper; his wife, Afra, an artist. They live a simple life, rich in family and friends, in the beautiful Syrian city of Aleppo - until the unthinkable happens. When all they care for is destroyed by war, they are forced to escape. But what Afra has seen is so terrible she has gone blind, and so they must embark on a perilous journey through Turkey and Greece towards an uncertain future in Britain. On the way, Nuri is sustained by the knowledge that waiting for them is Mustafa, his cousin and business partner, who has started an apiary and is teaching fellow refugees in Yorkshire to keep bees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nuri and Afra travel through a broken world, they must confront not only the pain of their own unspeakable loss, but dangers that would overwhelm the bravest of souls. Above all - and perhaps this is the hardest thing they face - they must journey to find each other again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving, powerful, compassionate and beautifully written, The Beekeeper of Aleppo is a testament to the triumph of the human spirit. Told with deceptive simplicity, it is the kind of book that reminds us of the power of storytelling.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Thirteen Months of Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of stories by the author, journalist, and activist, Rania Mamoun. Rania was featured in previous PEN Award winning project, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Khartoum&lt;/em&gt;, the first ever anthology of Sudanese short fiction in translation. The stories in this collection have been translated from Arabic into English for the first time, by translator Elisabeth Jacquette. &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Months of Sunrise&lt;/em&gt; is part of Comma's commitment to publish writers in translation from 'banned nations' in 2018.</description>

  <description>Edinburgh, 1953.&lt;br /&gt;Kirsten Mowat, eighteen years old and with a joyful spring in her step, couldn’t be more in love with her sea-faring sweetheart Duncan Armstrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, seven years later – after a hasty wedding, a twist of lies and wrenching loss – Duncan and Kirsten’s relationship has faded to tatters. When those closest to her turn their backs, Kirsten – alone, with a young family to care for – must gather all her spirit and strength if they are to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From much-loved Millie Gray, The House on Rosebank Lane is an Edinburgh story of families entwined, of sorrow and hopefulness . . . and of a young mother’s love for her children and a transforming quest for happiness.</description>

      <![CDATA[Millie Gray does a great job giving us a look back at Edinburgh through the 50s toward the 70s, not only that but she gives you a truly heartstring tugging and simultaneously heartwarming tale of not just one woman but the others in her life.

  <description>WAR DOESN'T END. IT SLEEPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delphine Venner is old, but she remembers everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She remembers what it is to be a child of war, she remembers fighting for her life and what the terrifying creatures from another world took from her all those years ago. She remembers the gateway, and those she lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in that other world, beast-filled and brutal, someone waits for her. Hagar, a centuries-old assassin, daily paying a terrible price for her unending youth, is planning one final death: that of her master, the Grand-Duc. A death that will cost her everything. A death that requires Delphine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voyaging into this violence and chaos, Delphine must remember who she really is and be ready to fight, before war reawakens. But in the battle to destroy an ageless evil, will both worlds be saved - or will every mortal creature lose everything?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In a most improbable friendship, she found love. In a world where women were silenced, she found her voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Patti Callahan comes an exquisite novel of Joy Davidman, the woman C. S. Lewis called “my whole world.” When poet and writer Joy Davidman began writing letters to C. S. Lewis—known as Jack—she was looking for spiritual answers, not love. Love, after all, wasn’t holding together her crumbling marriage. Everything about New Yorker Joy seemed ill-matched for an Oxford don and the beloved writer of Narnia, yet their minds bonded over their letters. Embarking on the adventure of her life, Joy traveled from America to England and back again, facing heartbreak and poverty, discovering friendship and faith, and against all odds, finding a love that even the threat of death couldn’t destroy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this masterful exploration of one of the greatest love stories of modern times, we meet a brilliant writer, a fiercely independent mother, and a passionate woman who changed the life of this respected author and inspired books that still enchant us and change us. Joy lived at a time when women weren’t meant to have a voice—and yet her love for Jack gave them both voices they didn’t know they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a fascinating historical novel and a glimpse into a writer’s life, &lt;em&gt;Becoming Mrs. Lewis&lt;/em&gt; is above all a love story—a love of literature and ideas and a love between a husband and wife that, in the end, was not impossible at all.</description>

  <description>Love, Witchcraft, Sorcery, Madness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fortune told …&lt;br /&gt;When Sarah Stone foresees Will Shakespeare’s latest play has opened doors to evil, she begs the playwright to abandon it. But Will refuses, aware the play is one of his best. And so rehearsals for Macbeth begin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forbidden desires …&lt;br /&gt;After her vision, Sarah fears for her life – she has never known the shewstone to lie, and she turns to her brother Tom for comfort. A strange darkness seems to haunt the playhouse, and when Tom sets out to seduce John Upton, the boy actor who plays Lady Macbeth, the boy sees the hand of witchcraft in his own forbidden desires for men. Then Sarah weaves a spell to win the love of the new lead actor, and John, terrified for the safety of his soul, begins to make his accusations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spirits have spoken …&lt;br /&gt;As rehearsals continue, Sarah and Tom must struggle to convince John he is mistaken and that his sins are his own – their lives and the fortune of the play are at stake. But the Spirits have spoken – will the fate that Sarah foresaw come to pass or is their destiny their own to decide? Set against the first production of Macbeth in 1606, Shakespeare’s Witch is a seductive tale of the origins of the curse of the Scottish Play.</description>

  <description>A Fast Paced Espionage Thriller for Alan Furst Fans Set In Post-Cold War Poland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1992 in Warsaw, Poland, and the communist era has just ended. A series of grisly murders suddenly becomes an international case when it's feared that the victims may have been couriers smuggling nuclear material out of the defunct Soviet Union. The FBI sends an agent to help with the investigation. When he learns that a Russian physicist who designed a portable atomic bomb has disappeared, the race is on to find him—and the bomb—before it ends up in the wrong hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith’s depiction of post-cold war Poland is gloomily atmospheric and murky in a world where nothing is quite as it seems. Suspenseful, thrilling, and smart, The Fourth Courier brings together a straight white FBI agent and gay black CIA officer as they team up to uncover a gruesome plot involving murder, radioactive contraband, narcissistic government leaders, and unconscionable greed.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved Holloway's writing style, she was evocative of the time and it was a brilliant time period to set a mystery in, the Harlem Renaissance.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ballet Lover&lt;/i&gt; exposes the beauty and cruelty of ballet, the performances, the back stage moments, and the personal dramas of the famous ballet dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Natalia Makarova as seen through the eyes of an American female journalist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, 1970s: the orchestra plays the first ominous note of &lt;i&gt;Swan Lake&lt;/i&gt;. In the audience sits Geneva, an American journalist and ballet lover, waiting for the heart-stopping beauty and seduction of the romantic duet to start, but instead she witnesses Rudolf Nureyev failing to catch his Russian partner Natalia Makarova, allowing her to fall with a crash upon the stage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geneva interprets the fall as an act of cruelty, a man with all the fame and power in the world brutally letting fall his delicate, wraith-like artistic partner. When other critics defend Nureyev and accuse Makarova of causing her own tumble, Geneva vows revenge on the page, creating havoc in her own career and discovering surprising parallels between herself and the fallen ballerina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ballet Lover&lt;/i&gt; is a refined, mesmerizing, fictional account of two of the most celebrated dancers in the dance world, how one compromised the other, and how the drama on the stage often mirrors those played out in real life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Girlhood, courage, nature, and flight from a tyrant’s hand in post-frontier Montana.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Swan Keeper&lt;/i&gt; is an historical, coming of age novel set in Northwest Montana's Mission Valley in the late 1920s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian Connelly loves trumpeter swans and vows to protect them from a hunter who is killing them and leaving their carcasses for the wolves and coyotes to ravage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her eleventh birthday Lilly’s family visits the Cattail Marsh to see the newly hatched cygnets. The family outing turns tragic when Dean Drake shows up with his shotgun and fires on not only the swans, but on Lilly’s family. Unable to prevent tragedy, Lillian witnesses Drake kill her father, injure her mother, and slaughter the bevy of trumpeter swans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheriff, Charlie West, thinks that Lilly is reacting to the trauma and blaming Drake because of a previous conflict between Drake and her father. Lilly’s mother, sister, and her best friend, Jerome West, the sheriff’s son, all think the same thing: that Lilly is trying to make sense of a senseless accident. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left alone to bring Dean Drake to justice, Lilly’s effort is subverted when Drake woos her sister, courts her mother, and moves into their home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The abyss watches him. Nightmares hunt him. And now, a battle begins.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrifying creatures, unseen to all around him, have tormented Elisse since he was a little boy. These “night terrors” and the cruel life as a young Westerner in a refugee camp have left him isolated and alone. The only clue to his past is an old, tattered envelope with a picture of his father who mysteriously abandoned him at a monastery as a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Elisse flees India and journeys to New Orleans in search of his father and the truth of his troubled existence, he finds not only the answers to his extraordinary life, an ancestral secret with a grave responsibility, but also the one thing he most desires. A family—but of beasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Elisse’s awakening gifts attract dark forces rooted in Louisiana magic, and he must do the unthinkable to protect everyone he loves. Will Elisse accept the burdens of his gifts and conquer darkness? Or will that same darkness consume him and destroy the love he so desperately longed for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariana Palova’s debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Nation of the Beasts: The Lord of the Sabbath&lt;/i&gt;, is an unforgettable journey of magic, heartache, and the unbreakable bonds that span this world and the other.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Magic has a price—if you’re willing to pay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born into a family of powerful witchdoctors, Arrah yearns for magic of her own. But each year she fails to call forth her ancestral powers, while her ambitious mother watches with growing disapproval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one thing Arrah hasn’t tried, a deadly last resort: trading years of her own life for scraps of magic. Until the Kingdom’s children begin to disappear, and Arrah is desperate to find the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She uncovers something worse. The long-imprisoned Demon King is stirring. And if he rises, his hunger for souls will bring the world to its knees… unless Arrah pays the price for the magic to stop him.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Chiyuki Matsuoka was born with heart problems, and her doctors say she won't live to see the next snow. Toya is an 18-year-old vampire who hates blood and refuses to make the traditional partnership with a human, whose life-giving blood would keep them both alive for a thousand years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chiyuki makes the most of the time she has left, even though things aren't that exciting--until she comes across a reluctant vampire late one chilly night. Can Chiyuki teach Touya to feel a passion for life, even as her own is ending?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;People lived because she killed.&lt;br /&gt;People died because he lived.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zafira is the Hunter, disguising herself as a man when she braves the cursed forest of the Arz to feed her people. Nasir is the Prince of Death, assassinating those foolish enough to defy his autocratic father, the king. If Zafira was exposed as a girl, all of her achievements would be rejected; if Nasir displayed his compassion, his father would punish him in the most brutal of ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are legends in the kingdom of Arawiya—but neither wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War is brewing, and the Arz sweeps closer with each passing day, engulfing the land in shadow. When Zafira embarks on a quest to uncover a lost artifact that can restore magic to her suffering world and stop the Arz, Nasir is sent by the king on a similar mission: retrieve the artifact and kill the Hunter. But an ancient evil stirs as their journey unfolds—and the prize they seek may pose a threat greater than either can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a richly detailed world inspired by ancient Arabia, &lt;i&gt;We Hunt the Flame&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping debut of discovery, conquering fear, and taking identity into your own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;

  <description>“&lt;i&gt;In Japan...everywhere...red strings tie all people we meet together. Some strings are weak. Some have tangles. Some strong.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meryl—Vietnam War widow—misses her grown son, feels left out after her father’s recent marriage. A WWII Japanese flag falls into her hands. The gentle push of a love-struck professor starts her adventure—take the flag home. From the neon of Osaka, to the ancient capital Nara, to the forests of Akita, the trail follows a newspaper reporter, factory manager, ikebana teacher, a Matagi hunter and winds through Japanese culture, past and present. A story of shared humanity and love “&lt;i&gt;in the simplest things.&lt;/i&gt;”</description>

  <description>Maité Martinez has always yearned for more than waitressing in a greasy diner, especially when most people have left the polluted ruins of Earth behind for a better life on other planets. It’s not just working at the diner that’s making life hard for her. Being a half-human, half-alien girl has never been trickier. With the corporate government hunting down the last of her father’s alien Auanare race living on Earth, hiding her growing special abilities has become a full-time job on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Every minute Maité stays on Earth is one minute closer to getting caught.&lt;/b&gt; The stress is almost more than she can bear, and when a fancy Space Tech officer gets handsy with her at the diner, she reacts without thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Breaking the officer’s nose wasn’t her smartest move. Now she’s faced with three years forced labor on the volcano planet, Abbadon. With the job she’s slotted for, it may as well have been a death sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It doesn’t take Maité long before she realizes there’s more to the mining on Abbadon than Space Tech has let on. As she makes unlikely allies, Maité uncovers Space Tech’s plot to nuke the Aunare homeworld. The firepower stored in Abbadon’s warehouses is more than enough to do the job ten times over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the clock ticks, Maité knows that if she can’t find a way to stop Space Tech, there will be an interstellar war big enough to end all life in the universe. There’s only one question:&lt;b&gt; Can she stop the total annihilation of humanity without getting herself killed in the process?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love, Witchcraft, Sorcery, Madness. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A fortune told …&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Sarah Stone foresees Will Shakespeare’s latest play has opened doors to evil, she begs the playwright to abandon it. But Will refuses, aware the play is one of his best. And so rehearsals for Macbeth begin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forbidden desires …&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After her vision, Sarah fears for her life – she has never known the shewstone to lie, and she turns to her brother Tom for comfort. A strange darkness seems to haunt the playhouse, and when Tom sets out to seduce John Upton, the boy actor who plays Lady Macbeth, the boy sees the hand of witchcraft in his own forbidden desires for men. Then Sarah weaves a spell to win the love of the new lead actor, and John, terrified for the safety of his soul, begins to make his accusations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Spirits have spoken …&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As rehearsals continue, Sarah and Tom must struggle to convince John he is mistaken and that his sins are his own – their lives and the fortune of the play are at stake. But the Spirits have spoken – will the fate that Sarah foresaw come to pass or is their destiny their own to decide? Set against the first production of Macbeth in 1606, Shakespeare’s Witch is a seductive tale of the origins of the curse of the Scottish Play.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a manor by the sea, twelve sisters are cursed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annaleigh lives a sheltered life at Highmoor, a manor by the sea, with her sisters, their father, and stepmother. Once they were twelve, but loneliness fills the grand halls now that four of the girls' lives have been cut short. Each death was more tragic than the last—the plague, a plummeting fall, a drowning, a slippery plunge—and there are whispers throughout the surrounding villages that the family is cursed by the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbed by a series of ghostly visions, Annaleigh becomes increasingly suspicious that the deaths were no accidents. Her sisters have been sneaking out every night to attend glittering balls, dancing until dawn in silk gowns and shimmering slippers, and Annaleigh isn't sure whether to try to stop them or to join their forbidden trysts. Because who—or what—are they really dancing with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Annaleigh's involvement with a mysterious stranger who has secrets of his own intensifies, it's a race to unravel the darkness that has fallen over her family—before it claims her next.</description>

  <description>In a universe of capricious gods, dark moons, and kingdoms built on the backs of spaceships, a cursed queen sends her infant daughter away, a jealous uncle steals the throne of Kali from his nephew, and an exiled prince vows to take his crown back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised alone and far away from her home on Kali, Esmae longs to return to her family. When the King of Wychstar offers to gift the unbeatable, sentient warship Titania to a warrior that can win his competition, she sees her way home: she’ll enter the competition, reveal her true identity to the world, and help her famous brother win back the crown of Kali. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a great plan. Until it falls apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the Mahabharata and other ancient Indian stories, A Spark of White Fire is a lush, sweeping space opera about family, curses, and the endless battle between jealousy and love.</description>

  <description>Set in 1491 during the reign of the last sultanate in the Iberian peninsula, &lt;em&gt;The Bird King&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Fatima, the only remaining Circassian concubine to the sultan, and her dearest friend Hassan, the palace mapmaker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hassan has a secret--he can draw maps of places he's never seen and bend the shape of reality. When representatives of the newly formed Spanish monarchy arrive to negotiate the sultan's surrender, Fatima befriends one of the women, not realizing that she will see Hassan's gift as sorcery and a threat to Christian Spanish rule. With their freedoms at stake, what will Fatima risk to save Hassan and escape the palace walls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Fatima and Hassan traverse Spain with the help of a clever jinn to find safety, &lt;i&gt;The Bird King&lt;/i&gt; asks us to consider what love is and the price of freedom at a time when the West and the Muslim world were not yet separate.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the former United States, sixteen-year-old Noam Álvaro wakes up in a hospital bed, the sole survivor of the viral magic that killed his family and made him a technopath. His ability to control technology attracts the attention of the minister of defense and thrusts him into the magical elite of the nation of Carolinia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of undocumented immigrants, Noam has spent his life fighting for the rights of refugees fleeing magical outbreaks—refugees Carolinia routinely deports with vicious efficiency. Sensing a way to make change, Noam accepts the minister’s offer to teach him the science behind his magic, secretly planning to use it against the government. But then he meets the minister’s son—cruel, dangerous, and achingly beautiful—and the way forward becomes less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught between his purpose and his heart, Noam must decide who he can trust and how far he’s willing to go in pursuit of the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Second World War is drawing to a close, but the world is far from safe. Left to fend for themselves, women and children are forced out of their homes in East Prussia to make way for the advancing victors. As the Russian soldiers arrive, the women know that they are still very much in danger, and that for them, the fight for survival is only just beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing critical food shortages and the onset of a bitter cold winter without heat, the women send their children into the nearby forests where they secretly cross the border into Lithuania, begging the local farmers for work or food to take back home to their waiting families. Along the way the children find cruelty, hardship and violence, but also kindness, hope, and the promise of a new and better future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on meticulous research, this stunning and powerful debut novel by Alvydas Šlepikas tells for the first time the story of the ‘wolf children’ and the measures many families were forced to take in order to survive.</description>

  <description>Lottie collects dead creatures and lovingly cares for them, hoping to preserve them, to save them from disintegration. Her father understands—Lottie has a scientific mind, he thinks. Her aunt wants it to stop, and she goes to cruel lengths to make sure it does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And her mother? Lottie’s mother died long ago. And Lottie is searching for a way to be close to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Art of Taxidermy is a heartbreaking verse novel exploring love and death, grief and beauty, and the ways we try to make sense of it all.</description>

  <description>It is the waning days of the Russian monarchy. A reckless man rules the land and his dragons rule the sky. Although the Tsar continues to send his reign of fire to scorch his enemies—Jews and Bolsheviks—instead he lays waste to his entire country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even dragons are cannot quell the conspiracies arising around the Tsar, from the ranks of the oppressed, political operatives, and one nameless functionary watching power slip away. Even the Tsar’s foreign-born wife believes that his tactics are tantamount to evil. But revolution is in the air—and the Red Army is hatching its own weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover the crux of Russian history as it is radically and entertainingly re-imagined by dynamic writing team Jane Yolen (&lt;i&gt;The Emerald Circus&lt;/i&gt;) and Adam Stemple.</description>

  <description>Being one of the most formidable archangels with the power to end the world doesn't serve you well if you don't know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown into a battle of courts and factions, tangled in a web of intrigues and palatial games, naïve Ariel is surrounded by powerful angels, chasing their own agendas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no one she can trust. Everyone stands to gain something from her death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid the bloody battle that Baza brought to her door at Uras, Ariel retreats back to Apkallu (Earth) to find her sister, but the Heavenly battles and intrigues she flees follow her, as Baza's immense hold on Apkallu forces Ariel and Rafe to make uncomfortable choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ariel's fight for survival is far from over and it looks like it's going to be a deadly one.</description>

      <![CDATA[First off I really enjoyed this book. I thought the pacing was great and that the ideas were fun! Gibbs really knows how to capture her target audience and I swear, 15 years old me would be eating this book up in an hour and demanding more, and thankfully there is more! I received a digital copy...]]>

  <description>Earth scientists and their families stationed on the remote planet of Fosaan were promised a tropical vacation-like experience. But Fosaan, devastated from an apocalyptic event nearly three-hundred years ago, is full of lethal predators and dangerous terrain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthers are forbidden to go beyond the safety zone of their settlement and must not engage the small population of reclusive Fosaanians, descendants of the survivors. Sixteen-year-old Quinn Neen plans to do both of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Quinn discovers a beautiful Fosaanian girl named Mira stealing food from his family’s living unit, he soon learns Earth’s government may not be telling the whole truth about Fosaan and the cause of the past disaster. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some who to restore the planet to its former glory by any means necessary. Quinn finds himself caught between his loyalty to his own people and what is right for Mira and her people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he can decide what to do, the scientists are taken captive, stranding the young Earthers on Fosaan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn must go from renegade to leader and convince Mira to become an ally in a fight against an enemy whose very existence threatens their lives and the future of those both on Fosaan and at home.</description>

  <description>FACT: 15% of the world's population is Rh-negative and the origin of their blood is debated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world with skyrocketing inflation and unemployment, blood has become the new commodity, and the rarer your blood type, the more it’s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her job and watching her savings dwindle, Liri is persuaded by a resourceful friend to sell her blood to ABO Blood Group, where she learns she is O Negative, the most valuable and sought after blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to afford living in New York City, Liri reluctantly decides to move back home and live with her parents, but her plan is interrupted when a virus is maliciously unleashed onto the island of Manhattan, resulting in a citywide quarantine. Before being able to devise an alternative plan, she is secretly informed of a covert mission by ABO to evacuate Negatives out of NYC. Although reluctant to trust them, it’s her only viable choice to escape, but unbeknown to Liri, she and the Negatives are vital to activating opposing agendas on Earth and beyond.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Zeta City, where the whole world goes to die. Here, the Node System uploads the minds of the dying so they can spend eternity in a digital Promised Land. But, this cyber heaven is causing hell on earth for the living because the System forces them to earn Points to buy data in the afterlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camille is a salty mercenary out to hoard as many Points as possible by exploiting the dying with illegal technology. She's on the hunt for Toy, a rebel leader who uploaded lethal technology to her own brain in an attempt to wipe out everyone’s Node Points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camille goes to increasingly dangerous lengths in pursuit of Toy. She soon finds that the Node is full of warm reunions with loved ones and otherworldly creations. It’s also full of lies.</description>

  <description>Anna is a student surviving the city, and she lives by a simple credo, “Never play their game; their game is always rigged.” For every man she has ever known, it’s a saying that has served her well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all changes on the night of “The Big Storm,” when Anna is slipped a date rape drug. Though she saves herself and her best friend, Anna is lost to the dark heart of the city and finds herself hunted by The Night Collectors. Unsure if these monsters are real or hallucinations, Anna nonetheless fights them as best she can. The battle attracts a stranger—Teej—who saves her using powers she cannot understand. He explains that she is an Undreamer and possesses the same powers, and in the future, he will not be the one to save her. She will save him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Anna is not yet ready to join Teej and stand against The Dreamers. She has difficult decisions of her own to make. Decisions she has always run from. She still has her partner’s suicide letter. It remains unopened. She still wears his ring, though she can’t seem to remember his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna learns of The Dreamers - artists so preeminent in their respective fields that they can paint, dance, sew or sing new realities - and as she travels through their creations, she learns that there’s as much beauty in the world as there is horror. With a complex conspiracy at work within the community of Dreamers that threatens to undermine reality itself, Anna will have to look deep within herself, and eventually have to face the horrors of her own past, to save her old world as well as her new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Undreaming is a dark urban fantasy, and the first book in the The Metiks Fade trilogy.</description>

  <description>Chloe was three years old when she became Chloe Holden, but her adoption didn’t scar her, and she’s had a great life. Now, fourteen years later, her loving parents’ marriage has fallen apart and her mom has moved them to Joyful, Texas. Starting twelfth grade as the new kid at school, everything Chloe loved about her life is gone. And feelings of déjà vu from her early childhood start haunting her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Chloe meets Cash Colton she feels drawn to him, as though they're kindred spirits. Until Cash tells her the real reason he sought her out: Chloe looks exactly like the daughter his foster parents lost years ago, and he’s determined to figure out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Chloe and Cash delve deeper into her adoption, the more things don’t add up, and the more strange things start happening. Why is Chloe’s adoption a secret that people would kill for?</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The power to love. The power to heed your own voice. The power to hope in a world of blood and shadow.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning, most of Saphrona Melioska's family was executed. Today, at dawn, she and her brother's widow would have followed them to the block. But something changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saphrona doesn't know who paid for their sentence to be commuted, but by that act of kindness, she and her hearth sister are exiled to the remote island of Ghondatha, where Saphrona's only relatives live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has nothing to take with her but the legacy of ten generations of master sculptors, a family name beloved in the world of Art, and her own credo: there is goodness and beauty in everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon their arrival at Ghondatha, however, Saphrona and Leigh find that even ageless Ghondatha is not what it once was. The island has a new liege-lord, a nobleman from the lavish Amkadan Empire, with deep pockets and extravagant ideas about progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Lord Gideon Bloodstone requires is that the villagers obey three laws: no one may leave the island; all who are invited to his nightly masquerades must attend; and those who are not invited must mind the curfew and stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is this man who has stolen the last familiar piece of life Saphrona has left in the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who will change forever how she defines that which is good and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From USA Today Bestselling Author Aileen Erin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an all-too-plausible future where corporate conglomerates have left the world’s governments in shambles, anyone with means has left the polluted Earth for the promise of a better life on a SpaceTech owned colony among the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maité Martinez is the daughter of an Earther Latina and a powerful Aunare man, an alien race that SpaceTech sees as a threat to their dominion. When tensions turn violent, Maité finds herself trapped on Earth and forced into hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over ten years, Maité has stayed hidden, but every minute Maité stays on Earth is one closer to getting caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s lived on the streets. Gone hungry. And found a way to fight through it all. But one night, while waitressing in a greasy diner, a customer gets handsy with her. She reacts without thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covered in blood, Maité runs, but it’s not long before SpaceTech finds her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrested and forced into dangerous work detail on a volcano planet, Maité waits for SpaceTech to make their move against the Aunare. She knows that if she can’t somehow find a way to stop them, there will be an interstellar war big enough to end all life in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one question: Can Maité prevent the total annihilation of humanity without getting herself killed in the process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Erin’s world-building is excellent and her characters are big and bold…” — Escape Into Worlds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I have enjoyed every minute of this book and will read what ever Aileen Erin wants to write at this point." — Smada's Book Smack, on Shattered Pack”</description>

  <description>In the year 2044, reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and fortune to whoever can unlock them. When Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet Harry Dresden, Chicago's first (and only) Wizard P.I. Turns out that 'everyday' world is full of strange and magical things - and most of them don't play well with humans. That's where Harry comes in.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry is the best at what he does - and not just because he's the only one who does it. So whenever the Chicago P.D. has a case that transcends mortal capabilities, they look to him for answers. But business isn't just slow, it stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the police bring him in to consult on a grisly double murder committed with black magic, Harry's seeing dollar signs. But where there's black magic, there's a black mage behind it. And now that mage knows Harry's name. And that's when things start to get . . . interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGIC - IT CAN GET A GUY KILLED.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A Fast Paced Espionage Thriller for Alan Furst Fans Sent In Post-Cold War Poland. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1992 in Warsaw, Poland, and the communist era has just ended. A series of grisly murders suddenly becomes an international case when it's feared that the victims may have been couriers smuggling nuclear material out of the defunct Soviet Union. The FBI sends an agent to help with the investigation. When he learns that a Russian physicist who designed a portable atomic bomb has disappeared, the race is on to find him—and the bomb—before it ends up in the wrong hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smith’s depiction of post-cold war Poland is gloomily atmospheric and murky in a world where nothing is quite as it seems. Suspenseful, thrilling, and smart, The Fourth Courier brings together a straight white FBI agent and gay black CIA officer as they team up to uncover a gruesome plot involving murder, radioactive contraband, narcissistic government leaders, and unconscionable greed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sarah Bennett has two secrets: she sees ghosts, and she is in love with a spy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sarah takes a job with occult expert Dr Matthew Geisler, he promises to help her understand the sorrowful spirit that seems to have attached itself to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sarah struggles to cope with the ghostly presence, she runs into Zeke, the man who left her six months earlier and is recovering from injuries suffered in an alleged accident. But Zeke has secrets of his own, and when an attempt is made on Geisler’s life, Sarah finds herself caught in a struggle between the living and the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsure who she can trust, Sarah must solve the mystery of the soul determined to haunt her, and save Dr Geisler and herself from an unknown threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book was previously published as WEEPING IN THE WINGS.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Larkin Bennett has always known her place, whether it's surrounded by her loving family in the lush greenery of the Pacific Northwest or conducting a dusty patrol in Afghanistan. But all of that changed the day tragedy struck her unit and took away everything she held dear. Soon after, Larkin discovers an unexpected treasure—the diary of Emily Wilson, a young woman who disguised herself as a man to fight for the Union in the Civil War. As Larkin struggles to heal, she finds herself drawn deeply into Emily's life and the secrets she kept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indiana, 1861&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing more dangerous to Emily Wilson than a rebel soldier is the risk of her own comrades in the Union Army discovering her secret. But in the minds of her fellow soldiers, if it dresses like a man, swears like a man, and shoots like a man, it must be a man. As the war marches on and takes its terrible toll, Emily begins to question everything she thought she was fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;High seas adventure, blackmail, and meddling gods meet in &lt;i&gt;Dark Shores&lt;/i&gt;, the first novel in a new YA fantasy series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world divided by meddlesome gods and treacherous oceans, only the Maarin possess the knowledge to cross the Endless Seas. But they have one mandate: East must never meet West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SAILOR WITH A WILL OF IRON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teriana is the second mate of the Quincense and heir to the Maarin Triumvirate. Her people are born of the seas and the keepers of its secrets, but when her closest friend is forced into an unwanted betrothal, Teriana breaks her people’s mandate so her friend might escape—a choice with devastating consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SOLDIER WITH A SECRET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus is the commander of the Thirty-Seventh, the notorious legion that has led the Celendor Empire to conquer the entire East. The legion is his family, but even they don’t know the truth he’s been hiding since childhood. It’s a secret he’ll do anything to protect, no matter how much it costs him – and the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A DANGEROUS QUEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an Empire senator discovers the existence of the Dark Shores, he captures Teriana’s crew and threatens to reveal Marcus’s secret unless they sail in pursuit of conquest, forcing the two into an unlikely—and unwilling—alliance. They unite for the sake of their families, but both must decide how far they are willing to go, and how much they are willing to sacrifice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Beatriz dreams of a life spent dancing--until tragedy on the day of her quinceañera changes everything.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until her fifteenth birthday, the most important thing in the world to Beatriz Mendez had been her dream of becoming a professional dancer and getting herself and her family far from the gang life that defined their days--that and meeting her dance idol Debbie Allen on the set of her favorite TV show, &lt;i&gt;Fame&lt;/i&gt;. But after the latest battle in a constant turf war leaves her gang leader brother, Junito, dead and her mother grieving, Beatriz has a new set of priorities. How is she supposed to feel the rhythm when her gang needs running, when her mami can't brush her own teeth, and when the last thing she can remember of her old self is dancing with her brother, followed by running and gunshots? When the class brainiac reminds Beatriz of her love of the dance floor, her banished dreams sneak back in. Now the only question is: will the gang let her go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in New Jersey in 1984, Beatriz's story is a timeless one of a teenager's navigation of romance, gang culture, and her own family's hard past. A companion novel to the much-lauded &lt;i&gt;Like Vanessa&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5/5<br /><br />A real joy to read, such a great work of fiction that draws on real life aspects and a masterful blend of cultures and diversity within it. Beatriz shows incredible character growth and I felt quite connected to her because of that, it was easy to be immersed in her story though...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Assassin's Creed meets Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in this gripping, epic fantasy romance trilogy.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;My heart wasn't part of the deal when I bargained for my life,&lt;br /&gt; But assassins so rarely keep their word.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exiled Charmer Leena Edenfrell is running out of time. Empty pockets forced her to sell her beloved magical beasts-an offense punishable by death-and now there's a price on her head. With the realm's most talented murderer-for-hire nipping at her heels, Leena makes Noc an offer he can't refuse: powerful mythical creatures in exchange for her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plagued by a curse that kills everyone he loves, Noc agrees to Leena's terms in hopes of finding a cure. Never mind that the dark magic binding the assassin's oath will eventually force him to choose between Leena's continued survival...and his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a game of trust and half-lies, only one thing can be certain: traps capture more than beasts and ensnared hearts are impossible to untangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Beast Charmer Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kingdom of Exiles&lt;br /&gt; The Frozen Prince (coming early 2020)&lt;br /&gt;The Shattered Crown (coming late 2020)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The massive labyrinth was built to protect Zadie Kalver's isolated desert town. Unfortunately, living in the maze's shadow makes her feel anything but safe. Even without its enchanted deathtraps and illusions, a mysterious killer named Dex lurks in its corridors, terrorizing anyone in his path. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Zadie's best friend vanishes into the labyrinth-and everyone mysteriously forgets he exists- completing the maze becomes her only hope of saving him. In desperation, Zadie bribes the only person who knows the safe path through-Dex-into forming a tenuous alliance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navigating a deadly garden, a lethal blood-filled hourglass, and other traps-with an untrustworthy murderer for her guide-Zadie's one wrong step from certain death. But with time running out before her friend (and secret crush) is lost forever, Zadie must reach the exit and find him. If Dex and the labyrinth don't kill her first.</description>

So when he's told it's time to shape up and try doing something else for a change, he has no idea where to even start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on a nighttime walk around his neighborhood, he sees a stranger with a telescope up on a hill: his name is Niko, and he loves to watch the stars.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Ember in the Ashes&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Three Dark Crowns&lt;/i&gt; in this lush debut fantasy novel about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to join a secret group of warriors that ride phoenixes into battle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I had a sister, once…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders—legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire—until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I promised her the throne would not come between us.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders—even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;But it is a fact of life that one must kill or be killed. Rule or be ruled.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders’ return and intends to destroy them once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes the title of queen is given. Sometimes it must be taken.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crown of Feathers &lt;/i&gt;is an epic fantasy about love’s incredible power to save—or to destroy. Interspersed throughout is the story of Avalkyra Ashfire, the last Rider queen, who would rather see her empire burn than fall into her sister’s hands.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As a child, Faye Morgan was always an outsider, shunned for the ancient and powerful magic that runs through her veins.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ever since she was a little girl, growing up in the village of Abercolme on the wild coast of Scotland, Faye Morgan’s life has been steeped in the old ways – witchcraft, herbal lore and a blood connection to the dangerous and unpredictable world of Faerie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But magic is both a gift and a burden, and Faye has more than paid the price of living between two worlds. Neither accepted by the villagers, nor welcome in the Faerie Kingdom of Murias after rebuffing the fickle and attractive Faerie warrior king, Finn Beatha, Faye runs from Abercolme, hoping to leave that life behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, even in the twisted, cobbled streets of London, Faye finds her blood bond with Faerie won’t be broken. A Faerie War of the Elements is brewing and, though she doesn’t yet know it, Faye is fated to play a terrible part. If she is to survive, she must learn to embrace her own dark power and face Finn Beatha once more… but in doing so Faye will discover secrets in her own past that never should have been disturbed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gripping, magical, action-packed novel, perfect for fans of K.F. Breene's &lt;i&gt;Natural Witch&lt;/i&gt;, Shannon Mayer and Laini Taylor.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What readers are saying about Anna McKerrow…  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;A sexy and intoxicating novel&lt;/b&gt;… The &lt;b&gt;battle between light and dark&lt;/b&gt; played out in very magical way for Faye that &lt;b&gt;kept me on the edge of my seat&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;b&gt;cast its own spell upon me, leaving me wanting more and more&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;The Luminessence&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I was hooked&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;b&gt;there is so much in this story and before you know it, you too will be sucked into the world of Faerie&lt;/b&gt; and all the vivid descriptions and magical elements, that you won't want the story to end.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;The chemistry between the characters is palpable and sparks fly&lt;/b&gt;… There is a mystery to the way the story unravels and it takes you for a ride you won’t soon forget. &lt;b&gt;I’d recommend this book to anyone who enjoys some paranormal fun&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Up All Night with Books&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;A fantasy romance based on Celtic lore. This book is a captivating, well-written dark fairy tale that I devoured in one sitting&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;A warm story of magic and witchcraft&lt;/b&gt;… The plot twists and turns and takes a few detours to get to the ending.... &lt;b&gt;A very enjoyable read!!!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Tonya’s Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Sexy fairies, witchcraft, elemental magic, folklore, witchy grannies&lt;/b&gt;... the driving energy of the tale comes from the main character's journey… a story about a woman stepping into her own power.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;The perfect book to read on a rainy day – a dreamy escape from the mundane world into one darker, sexier, and a lot more dangerous&lt;/b&gt;… Laced with magic and sensuality… &lt;b&gt;I can't wait for the second instalment&lt;/b&gt;.’ Melinda Salisbury &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I loved the melding of fae, witch, and magic lore and life&lt;/b&gt;.

As Security Director Deva Karrell investigates the Orpheus' first murder, she'll come face to face with a horror from beyond the confines of time itself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects INFINITE DARK #1-4&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Hans Christian Anderson award-winning author Philippe Fix, a dazzling portrait of a dreamy optimist filling Paris with ingenious gadgets, toys, and magical contraptions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seraphin, dreaming of gardens full of birdsongs, sunny avenues, and flowers, works as a ticket seller in a metro station underground. One day, after being scolded by the stationmaster for trying to save a butterfly that had flown into the station by accident, he learns that he has inherited an old, dilapidated house. Overjoyed by the possibilities, he and his friend Plume set about building the house of their dreams, and much more besides! Philippe Fix's illustrations, cinematic in their scope, have enchanted children since their 1967 d�but. In a fresh translation, &lt;i&gt;Seraphin&lt;/i&gt; now allows a new generation to experience the wonder and inventive spectacle of the original.</description>

  <description>Injured and on the run, it has been seven days since June and Day barely escaped Los Angeles and the Republic with their lives. Day is believed dead having lost his own brother to an execution squad who thought they were assassinating him. June is now the Republic's most wanted traitor. Desperate for help, they turn to the Patriots - a vigilante rebel group sworn to bring down the Republic. But can they trust them or have they unwittingly become pawns in the most terrifying of political games?</description>

  <description>Sally is sixteen and uncommonly pretty. Her knowledge of English literature, French, history, art and music is non-existent, but she has a thorough grounding in military tactics, can run a business, ride like a Cossack and shoot straight with a pistol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her dear father is drowned in suspicious circumstances in the South China Sea, Sally is left to fend for herself, an orphan and alone in the smoky fog of Victorian London. Though she doesn't know it, Sally is already in terrible danger. Soon the mystery and the danger will deepen - and at the rotten heart of it all lies the deadly secret of the ruby in the smoke...</description>

  <description>Malcolm Polstead is the kind of boy who notices everything but is not much noticed himself. And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a spy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm's father runs an inn called the Trout, on the banks of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his dæmon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal, but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new: intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance called Dust--and the spy it was intended for finds &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, Malcolm sees suspicious characters everywhere; Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium; an Egyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with an evil monkey for a dæmon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl--just a baby--named Lyra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyra is the kind of person who draws people in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices, to bring her safely through the storm.</description>

  <description>For the past three years, Brynna has been patrolling the streets of Forcadel as a masked vigilante, protecting the innocent and beating up bad guys. Her current target is Lord Beswick, a slumlord businessman who keeps the townsfolk in a vicious poverty cycle. But one fateful evening, she's captured by Felix, the captain of the king's guard, and told a shocking truth: her father and brother are dead, and she needs to hang up her mask and become queen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, she negotiates a deal with Felix: attend to her royal duties during the day and continue her vigilante mission to take out Lord Beswick at night - at least until her coronation. But the politics of Forcadel are as volatile as the streets, and Brynna isn't sure whom she can trust in the castle. With two royals dead in less than a month, she must use all her wits to make sure she isn't the third.</description>

Pfffft. This had my name all over it.<br /><br />But honestly, I loved Brynna just being, well, Brynna. She’s ro...]]>
