  <description>&lt;i&gt;Be careful of the dark, dark wood…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Especially the woods surrounding the town of Fir Haven. Some say these woods are magical. Haunted, even.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rumored to be a witch, only Nora Walker knows the truth. She and the Walker women before her have always shared a special connection with the woods. And it’s this special connection that leads Nora to Oliver Huntsman—the same boy who disappeared from the Camp for Wayward Boys weeks ago—and in the middle of the worst snowstorm in years. He should be dead, but here he is alive, and left in the woods with no memory of the time he’d been missing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Nora can feel an uneasy shift in the woods at Oliver’s presence. And it’s not too long after that Nora realizes she has no choice but to unearth the truth behind how the boy she has come to care so deeply about survived his time in the forest, and what led him there in the first place. What Nora doesn’t know, though, is that Oliver has secrets of his own—secrets he’ll do anything to keep buried, because as it turns out, he wasn’t the only one to have gone missing on that fateful night all those weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For as long as there have been fairy tales, we have been warned to fear what lies within the dark, dark woods and in&lt;i&gt; Winterwood, New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Shea Ernshaw, shows us why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Wicked Deep &lt;/i&gt;comes a haunting romance perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Practical Magic&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;where dark fairy tales and enchanted folklore collide after a boy, believed to be missing, emerges from the magical woods—and falls in love with the witch determined to unravel his secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It happens at the start of every November: the Scorpio Races. Riders attempt to keep hold of their water horses long enough to make it to the finish line. Some riders live. Others die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At age nineteen, Sean Kendrick is the returning champion. He is a young man of few words, and if he has any fears, he keeps them buried deep, where no one else can see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puck Connolly is different. She never meant to ride in the Scorpio Races. But fate hasn’t given her much of a chance. So she enters the competition — the first girl ever to do so. She is in no way prepared for what is going to happen.</description>

  <description>A young adult fiction anthology of 15 stories featuring contemporary, historical, and futuristic stories featuring witchy heroines who are diverse in race, class, sexuality, religion, geography, and era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are you a good witch or a bad witch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glinda the Good Witch. Elphaba the Wicked Witch. Willow. Sabrina. Gemma Doyle. The Mayfair Witches. Ursula the Sea Witch. Morgan le Fey. The three weird sisters from &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History tells us women accused of witchcraft were often outsiders: educated, independent, unmarried, unwilling to fall in line with traditional societal expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold. Powerful. Rebellious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bruja’s traditional love spell has unexpected results. A witch’s healing hands begin to take life instead of giving it when she ignores her attraction to a fellow witch. In a terrifying future, women are captured by a cabal of men crying witchcraft and the one true witch among them must fight to free them all. In a desolate past, three orphaned sisters prophesize for a murderous king. Somewhere in the present, a teen girl just wants to kiss a boy without causing a hurricane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From good witches to bad witches, to witches who are a bit of both, this is an anthology of diverse witchy tales from a collection of diverse, feminist authors. The collective strength of women working together—magically or mundanely--has long frightened society, to the point that women’s rights are challenged, legislated against, and denied all over the world. &lt;i&gt;Toil &amp;amp; Trouble&lt;/i&gt; delves deep into the truly diverse mythology of witchcraft from many cultures and feminist points of view, to create modern and unique tales of witchery that have yet to be explored.</description>

  <description>The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, "None of what’s going to happen is your fault". Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: "Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.</description>

  <description>In this dark, suspenseful thriller, Alex North weaves a multi-generational tale of a father and son caught in the crosshairs of an investigation to catch a serial killer preying on a small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of his wife, Tom Kennedy believes a fresh start will help him and his young son Jake heal. A new beginning, a new house, a new town. Featherbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the town has a dark past. Twenty years ago, a serial killer abducted and murdered five residents. Until Frank Carter was finally caught, he was nicknamed "The Whisper Man," for he would lure his victims out by whispering at their windows at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tom and Jake settle into their new home, a young boy vanishes. His disappearance bears an unnerving resemblance to Frank Carter's crimes, reigniting old rumors that he preyed with an accomplice. Now, detectives Amanda Beck and Pete Willis must find the boy before it is too late, even if that means Pete has to revisit his great foe in prison: The Whisper Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Jake begins acting strangely. He hears a whispering at his window...</description>

  <description>My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise, I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cap mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

  <description>A very young woman's first job: governess for two weirdly beautiful, strangely distant, oddly silent children, Miles and Flora, at a forlorn estate...An estate haunted by a beckoning evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-seen figures who glare from dark towers and dusty windows- silent, foul phantoms who, day by day, night by night, come closer, ever closer. With growing horror, the helpless governess realizes the fiendish creatures want the children, seeking to corrupt their bodies, possess their minds, own their souls...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worse-much worse- the governess discovers that Miles and Flora have no terror of the lurking evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For they want the walking dead as badly as the dead want them.</description>

His lips are as sculpted as David. And his ego is the size of the Guggenheim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the type—wolfish smile and the gravity of a black hole. The kind of man who sucks all the air from the room the second he enters it.

If I can stay away from his devil lips, that is. Lips that cut me down and kiss me in the same breath, leaving me certain he’s on a mission to ruin my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A brand new STANDALONE romantic comedy full of steam, laughs, and heart by bestselling author Staci Hart*</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A thrilling new fantasy series full of magic and betrayal—from Evelyn Skye, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of the Crown’s Game series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sora can move as silently as a ghost and hurl throwing stars with lethal accuracy. Her gemina, Daemon, can win any physical fight blindfolded and with an arm tied around his back. They are apprentice warriors of the Society of Taigas—marked by the gods to be trained in magic and the fighting arts to protect the kingdom of Kichona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their graduation approaches, Sora and Daemon look forward to proving themselves worthy of belonging in the elite group—but in a kingdom free of violence since the Blood Rift Rebellion many years ago, it’s been difficult to make their mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Sora and Daemon encounter a strange camp of mysterious soldiers while on a standard scouting mission, they decide the only thing to do to help their kingdom is to infiltrate the group. Taking this risk will change Sora’s life forever—and lead her on a mission of deception that may fool everyone she’s ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Love, spies, and adventure abound as Sora and Daemon unravel a complex web of magic and secrets that might tear them—and the entire kingdom—apart forever.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;One of Us Is Lying&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what happens when five strangers walk into detention and only four walk out alive. Everyone is a suspect, and everyone has something to hide.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay close attention and you might solve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.&lt;br /&gt; Bronwyn, &lt;b&gt;the brain, &lt;/b&gt; is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. &lt;br /&gt; Addy, &lt;b&gt; the beauty, &lt;/b&gt; is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. &lt;br /&gt; Nate, &lt;b&gt;the criminal&lt;/b&gt;, is already on probation for dealing.&lt;br /&gt; Cooper, &lt;b&gt;the athlete&lt;/b&gt;, is the all-star baseball pitcher.&lt;br /&gt; And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Simon, &lt;b&gt; the outcast&lt;/b&gt;, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention, Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose? &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alice’s life on the road, always a step ahead of the uncanny bad luck biting at their heels. But when Alice’s grandmother, the reclusive author of a cult-classic book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate, the Hazel Wood, Alice learns how bad her luck can really get: her mother is stolen away―by a figure who claims to come from the Hinterland, the cruel supernatural world where her grandmother's stories are set. Alice's only lead is the message her mother left behind: “Stay away from the Hazel Wood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice has long steered clear of her grandmother’s cultish fans. But now she has no choice but to ally with classmate Ellery Finch, a Hinterland superfan who may have his own reasons for wanting to help her. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmother's tales began―and where she might find out how her own story went so wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now in development for TV!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time(R) by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final volume of the Wheel of Time, &lt;i&gt;A Memory of Light, &lt;/i&gt; was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan's editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;TV series update: &lt;/b&gt;"Sony will produce along with Red Eagle Entertainment and Radar Pictures. Rafe Judkins is attached to write and executive produce. Judkins previously worked on shows such as ABC's "Agents of SHIELD," the Netflix series "Hemlock Grove," and the NBC series "Chuck." Red Eagle partners Rick Selvage and Larry Mondragon will executive produce along with Radar's Ted Field and Mike Weber. Darren Lemke will also executive produce, with Jordan's widow Harriet McDougal serving as consulting producer." --&lt;i&gt;Variety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;(R)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Spring: The Novel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;The Eye of the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 &lt;i&gt;The Great Hunt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 &lt;i&gt;The Dragon Reborn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 &lt;i&gt;The Shadow Rising&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 &lt;i&gt;The Fires of Heaven&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 &lt;i&gt;Lord of Chaos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 &lt;i&gt;A Crown of Swords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8 &lt;i&gt;The Path of Daggers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#9 &lt;i&gt;Winter's Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#10 &lt;i&gt;Crossroads of Twilight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#11 &lt;i&gt;Knife of Dreams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#12 &lt;i&gt;The Gathering Storm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#13 &lt;i&gt;Towers of Midnight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#14 &lt;i&gt;A Memory of Light&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wheel of Time Companion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By Robert Jordan and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy Romanczuk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patterns of the Wheel: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Tessa and Hardin have defied all the odds, but will their fairy tale ending be turned on its head? AFTER EVER HAPPY...Life will never be the same. #HESSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s never been all rainbows and sunshine for Tessa and Hardin, but each new challenge they’ve faced has only made their passionate bond stronger and stronger. But when a revelation about the past shakes Hardin’s inpenetrable façade to the core—and then Tessa suffers a tragedy—will they stick together again, or be torn apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the shocking truth about each of their families emerges, it’s clear the two lovers are not so different from each other. Tessa is no longer the sweet, simple, good girl she was when she met Hardin—any more than he is the cruel, moody boy she fell so hard for. Tessa understands all the troubling emotions brewing beneath Hardin’s exterior, and she knows she’s the only one who can calm him when he erupts. He needs her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more layers of his past come to light, the darker he grows, and the harder he pushes Tessa—and everyone else in his life—away. Tessa’s not sure if she really can save him—not without sacrificing herself. She refuses to go down without a fight. But who is she fighting for—Hardin or herself?</description>

  <description>Book 3 of the After series—newly revised and expanded, Anna Todd's After fanfiction racked up 1 billion reads online and captivated readers across the globe. Experience the internet's most talked-about book for yourself from the writer Cosmopolitan called “the biggest literary phenomenon of her generation.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa and Hardin’s love was complicated before. Now it’s more confusing than ever. AFTER WE FELL...Life will never be the same. #HESSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Tessa makes the biggest decision of her life, everything changes. Revelations about first her family, and then Hardin’s, throw everything they knew before in doubt and makes their hard-won future together more difficult to claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa’s life begins to come unglued. Nothing is what she thought it was. Not her friends. Not her family. The one person she should be able to rely on, Hardin, is furious when he discovers the massive secret she’s been keeping. And rather than being understanding, he turns to sabotage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa knows Hardin loves her and will do anything to protect her, but there’s a difference between loving someone and being able to have them in your life. This cycle of jealousy, unpredictable anger, and forgiveness is exhausting. She’s never felt so intensely for anyone, so exhilarated by someone’s kiss—but is the irrepressible heat between her and Hardin worth all the drama? Love used to be enough to hold them together. But if Tessa follows her heart now, will it be...the end?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Book 2 of the After series—newly revised and expanded, Anna Todd's After fanfiction racked up one billion reads online and captivated readers across the globe. Experience the internet's most talked-about book for yourself from the writer Cosmopolitan called “the biggest literary phenomenon of her generation.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa has everything to lose. Hardin has nothing to lose...except her. AFTER WE COLLIDED...Life will never be the same. #HESSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a tumultuous beginning to their relationship, Tessa and Hardin were on the path to making things work. Tessa knew Hardin could be cruel, but when a bombshell revelation is dropped about the origins of their relationship—and Hardin’s mysterious past—Tessa is beside herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardin will always be...Hardin. But is he really the deep, thoughtful guy Tessa fell madly in love with despite his angry exterior—or has he been a stranger all along? She wishes she could walk away. It’s just not that easy. Not with the memory of passionate nights spent in his arms. His electric touch. His hungry kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Tessa’s not sure she can endure one more broken promise. She put so much on hold for Hardin—school, friends, her mom, a relationship with a guy who really loved her, and now possibly even a promising new career. She needs to move forward with her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardin knows he made a mistake, possibly the biggest one of his life. He’s not going down without a fight. But can he change? Will he change...for love?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Our Dragon doesn’t eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real dragon. Of course that’s not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but he’s still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. He protects us against the Wood, and we’re grateful, but not that grateful.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I live for the dream that my children will be born free," she says. "That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I live for you," I say sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eo kisses my cheek. "Then you must live for more."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of The Girl on the Train, The Silent Wife, and Gone Girl comes an enthralling psychological thriller that spins one woman's seemingly good fortune and another woman's mysterious fate through a kaleidoscope of duplicity, death, and deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Ron Howard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The request seems odd, even intrusive - and for the two women who answer, the consequences are devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from a traumatic break-in, Emma wants a new place to live. But none of the apartments she sees are affordable or feel safe. Until One Folgate Street. The house is an architectural masterpiece: a minimalist design of pale stone, plate glass, and soaring ceilings. But there are rules. The enigmatic architect who designed the house retains full control: no books, no throw pillows, no photos or clutter or personal effects of any kind. The space is intended to transform its occupant - and it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a personal tragedy, Jane needs a fresh start. When she finds One Folgate Street, she is instantly drawn to the space - and to its aloof but seductive creator. Moving in, Jane soon learns about the untimely death of the home's previous tenant, a woman similar to Jane in age and appearance. As Jane tries to untangle truth from lies, she unwittingly follows the same patterns, makes the same choices, crosses paths with the same people, and experiences the same terror as the girl before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 59 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Shadows of Self&lt;/i&gt; shows Mistborn’s society evolving as technology and magic mix, the economy grows, democracy contends with corruption, and religion becomes a growing cultural force, with four faiths competing for converts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bustling, optimistic, but still shaky society now faces its first instance of terrorism, crimes intended to stir up labor strife and religious conflict. Wax and Wayne, assisted by the lovely, brilliant Marasi, must unravel the conspiracy before civil strife stops Scadrial’s progress in its tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shadows of Self&lt;/i&gt; will give fans of &lt;i&gt;The Alloy of Law&lt;/i&gt; everything they’ve been hoping for and, this being a Brandon Sanderson book, more, much more.</description>

  <description>Centuries after the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is on the verge of modernity - railroads, electric street lights, and skyscrapers. Waxillium Ladrian can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will. After 20 years in the dusty Roughs, in the city of Elendel, the new head of a noble house may need to keep his guns.</description>

  <description>Vin, the street urchin who has grown into the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and Elend Venture, the idealistic young nobleman who loves her, must build a healthy new society in the ashes of an empire. Three separate armies attack. As the siege tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller&lt;i&gt; The Wife Between Us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave. But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking…and what she’s hiding. As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Trouble is haunting Cassidy Blake . . . even more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She (plus her ghost best friend, Jacob, of course) are in Paris, where Cass's parents are filming their TV show about the world's most haunted cities. Sure, it's fun eating croissants and seeing the Eiffel Tower, but there's true ghostly danger lurking &lt;i&gt;beneath&lt;/i&gt; Paris, in the creepy underground Catacombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cass accidentally awakens a frighteningly strong spirit, she must rely on her still-growing skills as a ghosthunter -- and turn to friends both old and new to help her unravel a mystery.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a single mother hears a rumor outside her son’s school, she never intends to pass it on. But one casual comment leads to another. . . . And now there’s no going back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumor has it that a notorious killer, a woman who has been released from prison years after her brutal crime, is living under a new identity in Joanna’s seaside town. So who is the supposedly reformed murderer now living in their neighborhood? Suspicion falls on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joanna becomes obsessed with the case, her curiosity will expose her son and his father to a heartless psychopath who has killed—and may kill again. And she will learn how dangerous one rumor can become . . . and just how far she must go to protect those she loves from harm. She is going to regret the day she ever said a word. . . .</description>

  <description>THEN&lt;br /&gt;She was fifteen, her mother's golden girl. She had her whole life ahead of her. And then, in the blink of an eye, Ellie was gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW &lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Ellie disappeared, but Laurel has never given up hope of finding her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one day a charming and charismatic stranger called Floyd walks into a café and sweeps Laurel off her feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before too long she’s staying the night at this house and being introduced to his nine year old daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy is precocious and pretty - and meeting her completely takes Laurel's breath away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Poppy is the spitting image of Ellie when she was that age. And now all those unanswered questions that have haunted Laurel come flooding back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to Ellie? Where did she go? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who still has secrets to hide?</description>

  <description>Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Then She Was Gone&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Watching You&lt;/i&gt; comes another page-turning look inside one family’s past as buried secrets threaten to come to light. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you let in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Family Upstairs&lt;/i&gt;, the master of “bone-chilling suspense” (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;) brings us the can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The end draws near....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Last Battle has started. The seals on the Dark One’s prison are crumbling. The Pattern itself is unraveling, and the armies of the Shadow have begun to boil out of the Blight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun has begun to set upon the Third Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perrin Aybara is now hunted by specters from his past: Whitecloaks, a slayer of wolves, and the responsibilities of leadership. All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around his neck. To prevail, he must seek answers in &lt;i&gt;Tel’aran’rhiod&lt;/i&gt; and find a way--at long last--to master the wolf within him or lose himself to it forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Matrim Cauthon prepares for the most difficult challenge of his life. The creatures beyond the stone gateways--the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn--have confused him, taunted him, and left him hanged, his memory stuffed with bits and pieces of other men’s lives. He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The time is coming when he will again have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes, playing a game that cannot be won. The Tower of Ghenjei awaits, and its secrets will reveal the fate of a friend long lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This penultimate novel of Robert Jordan’s #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series--the second of three based on materials he left behind when he died in 2007--brings dramatic and compelling developments to many threads in the Pattern. The end draws near.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dovie’andi se tovya sagain.&lt;/i&gt; It’s time to toss the dice.</description>

  <description>After an awkward first encounter, Birdie and Daniel are forced to work together in a Seattle hotel where a famous author leads a mysterious and secluded life in this romantic contemporary novel from the author of Alex, Approximately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystery-book aficionado Birdie Lindberg has an overactive imagination. Raised in isolation and homeschooled by strict grandparents, she’s cultivated a whimsical fantasy life in which she plays the heroic detective and every stranger is a suspect. But her solitary world expands when she takes a job the summer before college, working the graveyard shift at a historic Seattle hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her new job, Birdie hopes to blossom from introverted dreamer to brave pioneer, and gregarious Daniel Aoki volunteers to be her guide. The hotel’s charismatic young van driver shares the same nocturnal shift and patronizes the waterfront Moonlight Diner where she waits for the early morning ferry after work. Daniel also shares her appetite for intrigue, and he’s stumbled upon a real-life mystery: a famous reclusive writer—never before seen in public—might be secretly meeting someone at the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To uncover the writer’s puzzling identity, Birdie must come out of her shell…discovering that the most confounding mystery of all may be her growing feelings for the elusive riddle that is Daniel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pan's Labyrinth&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Hazel Wood&lt;/i&gt; in this novel about a girl with terrifying visions and a wish-granting witch whose lives collide in the most unexpected of ways.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waking forest has secrets. To Rhea, it appears like a mirage, dark and dense, at the very edge of her backyard. But when she reaches out to touch it, the forest vanishes. She's desperate to know more--until she finds a peculiar boy who offers to reveal its secrets. If she plays a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Witch, the forest is her home, where she sits on her throne of carved bone, waiting for dreaming children to beg her to grant their wishes. One night, a mysterious visitor arrives and asks her what she wishes for, but the Witch sends him away. And then the uninvited guest returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strangers are just the beginning. Something is stirring in the forest, and when Rhea's and the Witch's paths collide, a truth more treacherous and deadly than either could ever imagine surfaces. But how much are they willing to risk to survive?</description>

  <description>Selah has waited her whole life for a happily ever after. As the only daughter of the leader of Potomac, she knows her duty is to find the perfect match, a partner who will help secure the future of her people. Now that day has finally come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after an excruciatingly public rejection from her closest childhood friend, Selah’s stepmother suggests an unthinkable solution: Selah must set sail across the Atlantic, where a series of potential suitors awaits—and if she doesn’t come home engaged, she shouldn’t come home at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From English castle gardens to the fjords of Norge, and under the eye of the dreaded Imperiya Yotne, Selah’s quest will be the journey of a lifetime. But her stepmother’s schemes aren’t the only secrets hiding belowdecks…and the stakes of her voyage may be higher than any happy ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A single mom discovers just how deadly gossip can be in this irresistible debut thriller inspired by a sensational true crime story, for fans of &lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Couple Next Door&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Widow&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna is desperate to ingratiate herself with a popular clique of mothers at her son's new school. But when she tries to impress them by repeating a rumor she overheard at the school gates, there's no going back. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumor has it that a notorious killer, a woman who has been released from prison years after her brutal crime, is living under a new identity in Joanna's seaside town. So who is the supposedly reformed murderer now living in their neighborhood? Suspicion falls on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna becomes obsessed with the case, pawing through decades-old records in an attempt to name the killer. But her curiosity not only ostracizes her from the community, but exposes her son and his father to a heartless psychopath who has killed--and may kill again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How dangerous can one rumor become? And how far will Joanna go to protect those she loves from harm, when she realizes what she's unleashed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna is going to regret the day she ever said a word....&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>It's been eighteen months since the Raxter School for Girls was put under quarantine. Since the Tox hit and pulled Hetty's life out from under her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started slow. First the teachers died one by one. Then it began to infect the students, turning their bodies strange and foreign. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and left to fend for themselves on their island home, the girls don't dare wander outside the school's fence, where the Tox has made the woods wild and dangerous. They wait for the cure they were promised as the Tox seeps into everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Byatt goes missing, Hetty will do anything to find her, even if it means breaking quarantine and braving the horrors that lie beyond the fence. And when she does, Hetty learns that there's more to their story, to their life at Raxter, than she could have ever thought true.</description>

  <description>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>This is the story of three best friends: one who was murdered, one who went to prison, and one who's been searching for the truth all these years . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she was sixteen years old, Angela Wong—one of the most popular girls in school—disappeared without a trace. Nobody ever suspected that her best friend, Georgina Shaw, now an executive and rising star at her Seattle pharmaceutical company, was involved in any way. Certainly not Kaiser Brody, who was close with both girls back in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fourteen years later, Angela Wong's remains are discovered in the woods near Geo's childhood home. And Kaiser—now a detective with Seattle PD—finally learns the truth: Angela was a victim of Calvin James. The same Calvin James who murdered at least three other women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the authorities, Calvin is a serial killer. But to Geo, he's something else entirely. Back in high school, Calvin was Geo's first love. Turbulent and often volatile, their relationship bordered on obsession from the moment they met right up until the night Angela was killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fourteen years, Geo knew what happened to Angela and told no one. For fourteen years, she carried the secret of Angela's death until Geo was arrested and sent to prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While everyone thinks they finally know the truth, there are dark secrets buried deep. And what happened that fateful night is more complex and more chilling than anyone really knows. Now the obsessive past catches up with the deadly present when new bodies begin to turn up, killed in the exact same manner as Angela Wong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far will someone go to bury her secrets and hide her grief? How long can you get away with a lie? How long can you live with it?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fan favorite character Kenji Kishimoto narrates t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;his gripping companion novella to Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling Shatter Me series, set during the explosive events in &lt;em&gt;Restore Me&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette is still reeling from Warner's betrayal, and Kenji is trying to balance his friendship with her with his responsibilities as a leader of the resistance against the Reestablishment. Things get even more interesting when an unexpected person from Omega Point’s past surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending of &lt;em&gt;Restore Me &lt;/em&gt;left readers gasping, and this novella full of Kenji’s signature sass and big heart is the perfect story to tide fans over until &lt;em&gt;Defy Me&lt;/em&gt;, the shocking fifth book in the Shatter Me series, hits shelves in April 2019.</description>

  <description>Rafe Pierce just wants to keep his head down and earn his next promotion. Becoming Houston’s “Hot Cop” is his worst nightmare, and things only get worse when the sexiest reporter he’s ever met starts digging through his past. Sophie Klein has the power to expose a childhood he’d rather keep hidden, so why can’t he stay away from her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s everything Sophie Klein hates: brash, arrogant, and hot as hell. When a chance encounter with a bachelorette party makes Rafe a social-media sensation, Sophie is the lucky reporter chosen to tell his story. She can’t deny the chemistry between them, but is determined to keep her distance. Unfortunately for her, a drunken hookup in a bar supply closet ensures she will be spending at least the next nine months with him…</description>

  <description>Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in The Girl on the Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, Megan Miranda’s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women—a decade apart—told in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace. Back again to tie up loose ends and care for her ailing father, Nic is soon plunged into a shocking drama that reawakens Corinne’s case and breaks open old wounds long since stitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decade-old investigation focused on Nic, her brother Daniel, boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne’s boyfriend Jackson. Since then, only Nic has left Cooley Ridge. Daniel and his wife, Laura, are expecting a baby; Jackson works at the town bar; and Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, Nic’s younger neighbor and the group’s alibi the night Corinne disappeared. Then, within days of Nic’s return, Annaleise goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told backwards—Day 15 to Day 1—from the time Annaleise goes missing, Nic works to unravel the truth about her younger neighbor’s disappearance, revealing shocking truths about her friends, her family, and what really happened to Corinne that night ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like nothing you’ve ever read before, All the Missing Girls delivers in all the right ways. With twists and turns that lead down dark alleys and dead ends, you may think you’re walking a familiar path, but then Megan Miranda turns it all upside down and inside out and leaves us wondering just how far we would be willing to go to protect those we love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Sweetness can be deceptive.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Hanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s the sweet-but-silent angel in the adoring eyes of her Daddy. He’s the only person who understands her, and all Hanna wants is to live happily ever after with him. But Mommy stands in her way, and she’ll try any trick she can think of to get rid of her. Ideally for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Suzette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She loves her daughter, really, but after years of expulsions and strained home schooling, her precarious health and sanity are weakening day by day. As Hanna’s tricks become increasingly sophisticated, and Suzette's husband remains blind to the failing family dynamics, Suzette starts to fear that there’s something seriously wrong, and that maybe home isn’t the best place for their baby girl after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From blazing new talent Zoje Stage, &lt;i&gt;Baby Teeth&lt;/i&gt; is a story about a perfect-looking family, and a darling little girl who wants nothing more than to kill her mother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The rite has existed for as long as anyone can remember: when the prince-who-will-be-king comes of age, he must venture out into the gray lands, slay a fierce dragon, and rescue a damsel to be his bride. This is the way things have always been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ama wakes in the arms of Prince Emory, however, she knows none of this. She has no memory of what came before she was captured by the dragon, or what horrors she has faced in its lair. She knows only this handsome prince, the story he tells of her rescue, and her destiny to sit on the throne beside him. Ama comes with Emory back to the kingdom of Harding, hailed as the new princess, welcomed to the court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as soon as her first night falls, she begins to realize that not all is as it seems, that there is more to the legends of the dragons and the damsels than anyone knows–and that the greatest threats to her life may not be behind her, but here, in front of her.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>As a Red, Darrow grew up working the mines deep beneath the surface of Mars, enduring backbreaking labor while dreaming of the better future he was building for his descendants. But the Society he faithfully served was built on lies. Darrow’s kind have been betrayed and denied by their elitist masters, the Golds—and their only path to liberation is revolution. And so Darrow sacrifices himself in the name of the greater good for which Eo, his true love and inspiration, laid down her own life. He becomes a Gold, infiltrating their privileged realm so that he can destroy it from within. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lamb among wolves in a cruel world, Darrow finds friendship, respect, and even love—but also the wrath of powerful rivals. To wage and win the war that will change humankind’s destiny, Darrow must confront the treachery arrayed against him, overcome his all-too-human desire for retribution—and strive not for violent revolt but a hopeful rebirth. Though the road ahead is fraught with danger and deceit, Darrow must choose to follow Eo’s principles of love and justice to free his people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He must live for more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a witty romance about first love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being burned by her dream job in New York City, sports journalist Neely Kimber suddenly finds herself jobless and paying a long-overdue visit to her hometown in Tennessee. Her plan? Relax, reset, and head back up the corporate ladder. There’s just one unexpected step. Neely’s back in Dogwood Lane for barely a day when she sees the man she ran from nine years ago: the bad boy next door who was her first kiss, her first love, and her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted single dad Dane Madden knows he hurt Neely in the worst way. He’s got a lot to make up for. And as passionate as their reconnection is, it’s a lot to hope for. Having her back in his arms feels so right. But falling in love all over again with a woman who wants to live a world away is bound to go so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s it going to take for Neely to give him—and Dogwood Lane—just one more chance?</description>

  <description>From debut author Caroline Kepnes comes &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, one of Suspense Magazine’s Best Books of 2014, and a brilliant and terrifying novel for the social media age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a beautiful aspiring writer strides into the East Village bookstore where Joe Goldberg works, he does what anyone would do: he Googles the name on her credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one Guinevere Beck in New York City. She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A terrifying exploration of how vulnerable we all are to stalking and manipulation, debut author Caroline Kepnes delivers a razor-sharp novel for our hyper-connected digital age. You is a compulsively readable page-turner that’s being compared to &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;American Psycho&lt;/i&gt;, and Stephen King’s &lt;i&gt;Misery&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a manor by the sea, twelve sisters are cursed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annaleigh lives a sheltered life at Highmoor, a manor by the sea, with her sisters, their father, and stepmother. Once they were twelve, but loneliness fills the grand halls now that four of the girls' lives have been cut short. Each death was more tragic than the last—the plague, a plummeting fall, a drowning, a slippery plunge—and there are whispers throughout the surrounding villages that the family is cursed by the gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disturbed by a series of ghostly visions, Annaleigh becomes increasingly suspicious that the deaths were no accidents. Her sisters have been sneaking out every night to attend glittering balls, dancing until dawn in silk gowns and shimmering slippers, and Annaleigh isn't sure whether to try to stop them or to join their forbidden trysts. Because who—or what—are they really dancing with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Annaleigh's involvement with a mysterious stranger who has secrets of his own intensifies, it's a race to unravel the darkness that has fallen over her family—before it claims her next.</description>

  <description>Carlos Ramirez has always prided himself on two things: being damn good at his job on the Houston police force and being able to land any woman he wants. When a devastating car accident leaves him crippled and in excruciating pain, he begins to rely too heavily on his prescription painkillers. The only person who can help him heal is the only woman who has ever rejected him—and on more than one occasion. Living with Kelsey while he works through physical therapy wasn’t anything he ever expected to happen, but it might just be what he needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a divorce that left her doubting her ability to love, Kelsey Byrne wants nothing to do with relationships. Unfortunately for her, the only man she could see herself loving needs a place to live and help while he recovers. She had a hard time pushing him away after a one-night stand, so how can she possibly keep him at arm’s length when he’s in her house every day, playing with her son, cooking her meals, and leaving her cute notes every morning? Carlos may be working his way into her heart one sweet gesture at a time, but can she give him everything knowing that she’s more than a little broken inside? </description>

I need to let her go. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Perfect Duet is a FRIENDS to LOVERS contemporary romance with one epic twist that will leave you breathless and emotionally SATISFIED! Bestselling author, Meghan Quinn will have you on the edge of your seat, saying OH MY GOD what just happened in this epic, heart-felt and beautifully written romance.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For better or for worse,'til death do us part . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The better captured me; she's who stole my heart. &lt;br /&gt;And made me realize I couldn’t live without this woman. &lt;br /&gt;The worse of her took my breath away--kicked me when I was down and twisted me into a million knots. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I first met her, I thought she was someone I would never see again. &lt;br /&gt;The second time I ran into her, it was a random coincidence. &lt;br /&gt;The third? &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know it at the time, but she was the girl I was going to marry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But life isn’t always perfect. You have to take the better and the worse--even if it means giving her up, having her slip between your fingers, and letting her walk away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m getting married. &lt;br /&gt;This is forever, 'til death do us part.</description>

  <description>This isn’t a story about a love triangle. There is no triangle involved. &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a story about an accidental pregnancy. Although having a baby with her . . . I would. &lt;br /&gt;This isn’t a story about lies and deception, even though at times I’ve lied to myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story about sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;A story about a man who fell in love with the wrong girl. &lt;br /&gt;A story I wish I never had to tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story about the true meaning of the downside of love.</description>

  <description>Tucked away at the base of the Rocky Mountains lived a little boy with one singular dream: leave this broken and battered home and become someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be somebody’s hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That boy was me—Colby Brooks. Except I’m not that same little boy anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My dreams might still be the same, but my reality isn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m smarter. Stronger. A man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I learned a long damn time ago, the only way to achieve my dreams was to avoid distractions—at any cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focus. Resolve. Determination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all it took was one single night. One night and my entire life…changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night had me colliding head first with the biggest distraction of my life; Rory Oaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart. Charming. Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rory changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickly, my one-track mind started to bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each kiss faded decade-long dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with one single incident, I fly off course.</description>

  <description>When you read this book, you will make many assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume you are reading about a jealous ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;You will assume she is obsessed with her replacement – a beautiful, younger woman who is about to marry the man they both love. &lt;br /&gt;You will assume you know the anatomy of this tangled love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Assume nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted and deliciously chilling, Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; exposes the secret complexities of an enviable marriage - and the dangerous truths we ignore in the name of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read between the lies. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Kaine Reynolds wants nothing more than solitude. After an unthinkable tragedy destroys his family, he’s cut off all ties to his former life so he can battle his grief the only way he knows how. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when Piper Campbell knocks on his door, rambling on about being his new neighbor, he slams the door in her face. &lt;br /&gt;But Kaine’s gruff demeanor doesn’t scare her. She’s set on living in Montana and starting over after a terrible divorce. And she wouldn’t mind having a fling to chase away the pain of her husband’s betrayal. Her handsome, albeit rude, neighbor is the perfect candidate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet what neither of them suspect is that their no-strings affair will result in the surprise of Piper’s lifetime—and Kaine’s worst fear.</description>

  <description>Willa Doon has always been shy. Her quiet demeanor was something she’s always embraced. That is, until Jackson Page moves to town. The one man she desperately wants to take notice struggles to remember her name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Year after year, Willa stands by, watching as the bartender slash playboy drowns his demons in beer and sex. Then one night, he shows up at her door, suddenly aware that the girl he’s seen around Lark Cove is now a beautiful woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except what he doesn’t remember is that this visit isn’t his first. They spent a night together once before. A night he’s forgotten, thanks to a bottle of tequila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A night that crushed a timid girl’s heart, and set a broken man on the path to heal them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He was raised in revolution. She was raised in a palace. Can their love stop a war? &lt;em&gt;Code Name Verity&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;The Winner's Curse&lt;/em&gt; in Joanna Hathaway's &lt;em&gt;Dark of the West&lt;/em&gt;, a breathtaking YA fantasy debut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurelia Isendare is a princess of a small kingdom in the North, raised in privilege but shielded from politics as her brother prepares to step up to the throne. Halfway around the world, Athan Dakar, the youngest son of a ruthless general, is a fighter pilot longing for a life away from the front lines. When Athan’s mother is shot and killed, his father is convinced it’s the work of his old rival, the Queen of Etania—Aurelia’s mother. Determined to avenge his wife’s murder, he devises a plot to overthrow the Queen, a plot which sends Athan undercover to Etania to gain intel from her children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Athan’s mission becomes complicated when he finds himself falling for the girl he’s been tasked with spying upon. Aurelia feels the same attraction, all the while desperately seeking to stop the war threatening to break between the Southern territory and the old Northern kingdoms that control it—a war in which Athan’s father is determined to play a role. As diplomatic ties manage to just barely hold, the two teens struggle to remain loyal to their families and each other as they learn that war is not as black and white as they’ve been raised to believe.</description>

      <![CDATA[3 stars<br /><br />Dark of the West had me hooked from the moment I read the synopsis. It sounded exactly like a book I would enjoy reading. But I found myself struggling with most of the book. I enjoyed many aspects of the book, but this was not the story for me.<br /><br />Some of the best part...]]>

  <description>Welcome to Crimson Elite, the most exclusive sex club in the world. &lt;br /&gt;Enter at your own risk, and always remember our number one rule—&lt;br /&gt;You must never speak of Crimson Elite—the punishment is severe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creed ‘Too Hot For Words’ Christopher &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If God created the perfect man he would closely resemble Creed, on the outside that is. &lt;br /&gt;He’s as cavalier as they come. Unconcerned. Cold. Dismissive. I wonder if he has any feelings at all. &lt;br /&gt;And when his lips touch mine, everything goes black. He takes me into his world, and it’s the most magical thing I’ve ever experienced. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m sucked in time and time again. &lt;br /&gt;Like a moth to the flame, I am ready to be set alight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elicea ‘F*cks With My Head’ Beckham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elicea is a firecracker. She has piqued my interest, and no one piques my interest anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful women are what I do—it’s my work. &lt;br /&gt;Not one of them has managed to get their claws into me the way she does. It’s as if she’s seeing my ice heart and trying to melt it set it alight with each touch of her sinful lips. &lt;br /&gt;But that can’t work, it won’t work. &lt;br /&gt;Not in my world.</description>

  <description>A luxuriously magical retelling of &lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/i&gt; set in seventeenth-century France--and told from the point of view of the Beast himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am neither monster nor man—yet I am both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the Beast.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a broken, wild thing, his heart’s nature exposed by his beastly form. Long ago cursed with a wretched existence, the Beast prowls the dusty hallways of his ruined château with only magical, unseen servants to keep him company—until a weary traveler disturbs his isolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bewitched by the man’s dreams of his beautiful daughter, the Beast devises a plan to lure her to the château. There, Isabeau courageously exchanges her father’s life for her own and agrees to remain with the Beast for a year. But even as their time together weaves its own spell, the Beast finds winning Isabeau’s love is only the first impossible step in breaking free from the curse . . .</description>

  <description>In the small town of Aurora, teens go missing all the time. But when one of Piper and Hazel's classmates disappears, they become determined to find out the truth of what happened to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While investigating, they meet three handsome and rich grad students...who kidnap them. The girls are taken to a building in the middle of a privately-owned forest. The building isn't just designed to keep them locked away—every room is a test in survival. And Piper and Hazel won't give up without a fight.</description>

  <description>On Christmas Eve five years ago, Holly was visited by three ghosts who showed her how selfish and spoiled she'd become. They tried to convince her to mend her ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she's stuck working for the top-secret company Project Scrooge--as the latest Ghost of Christmas Past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, they save another miserly grouch. Every year, Holly stays frozen at seventeen while her family and friends go on living without her. So far, Holly's afterlife has been miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, everything is about to change. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following their adventures in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Tower&lt;/i&gt;, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the bestselling Winternight Trilogy, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Winternight Trilogy introduced an unforgettable heroine, Vasilisa Petrovna, a girl determined to forge her own path in a world that would rather lock her away. Her gifts and her courage have drawn the attention of Morozko, the winter-king, but it is too soon to know if this connection will prove a blessing or a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers—and for someone to blame. Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The Grand Prince is in a rage, choosing allies that will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders. Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old cupid-in-training Kali is in an Olympus-sized mountain of trouble. Rule number one in arrow-toting matchmaking: don't stick yourself. But accidents happen, and Kali instantly falls hard for her indie rock, bass-playing target, Benicio. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The God of Love is going to kill her. Even if he is her dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the daughter of Eros isn't all it's cracked up to be. For one thing, a girl can get jaded when her parents have the most beautiful and fatalistic love story in history. For another, immortality royally sucks when the Oracle condemns you to eternity in the wrong profession. Do the Gods care that Kali wants to ditch the love stuff and be a muse? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reclaim her heart and her destiny, Kali is left with no choice but to defy the Gods, tempt the Fates, date the mortal love-of-her-life, and hope she doesn't lose her best friend, Hector, in the process.</description>

  <description>For Sophie, small town life has never &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; small. With her four best friends—loving, infuriating, and all she could ever ask for—she can weather any storm. But when Sophie’s beloved Acadia High School marching band is selected to march in the upcoming Rose Parade, it’s her job to get them all the way to LA. Her plan? To persuade country singer Megan Pleasant, their Midwestern town’s only claim to fame, to come back to Acadia to headline a fundraising festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that Megan has very publicly sworn never to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ensues is a journey filled with long-kept secrets, hidden heartbreaks, and revelations that could change everything—along with a possible fifth best friend: a new guy with a magnetic smile and secrets of his own.</description>

  <description>Victoria Parker knew her dad's behavior toward her was a little unusual, but she convinced herself everything was fine—until she found herself locked out of the house at 3:00 a.m., surrounded by flashing police lights. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, dumped into a crowded, chaotic foster home, Victoria has to tiptoe around her domineering foster mother, get through senior year at a new school, and somehow salvage her college dreams . . . all while keeping her past hidden.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But some secrets won't stay buried—especially when unwanted memories make Victoria freeze up at random moments and nightmares disrupt her sleep. Even worse, she can't stop worrying about her stepsister Sarah, left behind with her father. All she wants is to move forward, but how do you focus on the future when the past won't leave you alone?</description>

  <description>Lemon Fresh has seen better days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the climactic battle in Babel, she finds herself separated from Ezekiel and Cricket in the wastelands. Lemon’s abilities to manipulate electricity mark her as a deviate, and deadly corporate operatives are hunting her to use as a weapon in the war between BioMaas Incorporated and Daedelus Technologies. Instead, Lemon finds herself falling in with a group of fellow deviates—a band of teenagers with astonishing abilities, led by an enigmatic figure known as the Major, who may hold the secrets to Lemon’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Cricket finds himself in possession of the puritanical Brotherhood, a religious cult set for a head-on collision with the Major and his band. Searching for Lemon, Ezekiel finds a strange ally in an old enemy, and uncovers a plot that may see him reunited with his beloved Ana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And inside Babel, a remade Eve hatches a plan to bring an end to the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this spellbinding and suspenseful debut, a young woman haunted by the past returns home to care for her ailing mother and begins to dig deeper into her sister’s unsolved murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years ago, Sylvie’s sister Persephone never came home. Out too late with the boyfriend she was forbidden to see, Persephone was missing for three days before her body was found—and years later, her murder remains unsolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the present day, Sylvie returns home to care for her estranged mother, Annie, as she undergoes treatment for cancer. Prone to unexplained “Dark Days” even before Persephone’s death, Annie’s once-close bond with Sylvie dissolved in the weeks after their loss, making for an uncomfortable reunion all these years later. Worse, Persephone’s former boyfriend, Ben, is now a nurse at the cancer center where Annie is being treated. Sylvie’s always believed Ben was responsible for the murder—but she carries her own guilt about that night, guilt that traps her in the past while the world goes on around her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she navigates the complicated relationship with her mother, Sylvie begins to uncover the secrets that fill their house—and what really happened the night Persephone died. As it turns out, the truth really will set you free, once you can bear to look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Winter Sister&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing portrayal of the complex bond between sisters, between mothers and daughters alike, and forces us to ask ourselves—how well do we really know the people we love most?</description>

  <description>Thea Landry has always known her place in modern-day society. It’s somewhere just above the trash can her mother dumped her in as a newborn but below the class where much comes easy. With her tattered shoes and bargain-bin clothes, her life has never been full of glamour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a rich and charismatic man takes interest, she doesn’t fool herself into thinking their encounter is anything more than a one-night stand. Months later, she’s kicking herself for not getting his phone number. Or his last name. She’s given up hope of seeing him ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, years later, Logan Kendrick waltzes into her life once more and turns everything she’s built upside down. This time around, she won’t make the same mistake. She’s going to fight to keep him in her life—not for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for their daughter.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From New York Times bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward comes an unexpected love story of secondhand hearts and second chances…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started with a mysterious blue note sewn into a wedding dress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something blue. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d gone to sell my own unworn bridal gown at a vintage clothing store. That’s when I found another bride’s “something old.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stitched into the lining of a fabulously feathered design was the loveliest message I’d ever read: &lt;i&gt;Thank you for making all of my dreams come true. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name embossed on the blue stationery: &lt;i&gt;Reed Eastwood&lt;/i&gt;, obviously the most romantic man who ever lived. I also discovered he’s the most gorgeous. If only my true-love fantasies had stopped there. Because I’ve since found out something else about Mr. Starry-Eyed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s arrogant, cynical, and demanding. I should know. Thanks to a twist of fate, he’s my new boss. But that’s not going to stop me from discovering the story behind his last love letter. A love letter that did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; result in a happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; story is nothing compared to the one unfolding between us. It’s getting hotter, sweeter, and more surprising than anything I could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something new. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have no idea how this one is going to end...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Spensa's world has been under attack for decades.&lt;/b&gt; Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with that of her father's—a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa the daughter of a coward, her chances of attending Flight School slim to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the USA Today Bestselling Duo that brought you the &lt;i&gt;Checkmate Duet Series&lt;/i&gt;, Brooke Cumberland and Lyra Parish comes a brand new addictive STANDALONE series!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Never trust a man who answers the front door wearing nothing more than a pair of low-cut jeans and a panty-melting smirk. &lt;br /&gt;That should’ve been my first sign. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I write about guys just like him for a living—sexy and charming, yet reluctant to get into a serious relationship. His body screams sex appeal, but his condescending personality makes him a classic f*ckboy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I want nothing to do with that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing romance novels comes with its perks—traveling, meeting new people, creating characters from the voices in my head—but Ethan Rochester enters my life and rearranges all my preconceived notions about writing what inspires you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One week is all it took. One week to realize that not everything is as it seems. &lt;br /&gt;One week with the bad boy, and I wanted more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is a complete STANDALONE novel—filled with plenty of humor, steam, &amp;amp; romance!** &lt;br /&gt;18 &amp;amp; up only due to explicit sexual content, language, and adult content.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Rafe Pierce just wants to keep his head down and earn his next promotion. Becoming Houston’s “Hot Cop” is his worst nightmare, and things only get worse when the sexiest reporter he’s ever met starts digging through his past. Sophie Klein has the power to expose a childhood he’d rather keep hidden, so why can’t he stay away from her?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s everything Sophie Klein hates: brash, arrogant, and hot as hell. When a chance encounter with a bachelorette party makes Rafe a social-media sensation, Sophie is the lucky reporter chosen to tell his story. She can’t deny the chemistry between them, but is determined to keep her distance. Unfortunately for her, a drunken hookup in a bar supply closet ensures she will be spending at least the next nine months with him…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The task is simple: don a disguise. Survive the Labyrinth. Best the boys.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a thrilling new fantasy from the bestselling author of the Storm Siren Trilogy, one girl makes a stand against society and enters a world made exclusively for boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year for the past fifty-four years, the residents of Pinsbury Port have received a mysterious letter inviting all eligible-aged boys to compete for an esteemed scholarship to the all-male Stemwick University. The poorer residents look to see if their names are on the list. The wealthier look to see how likely their sons are to survive. And Rhen Tellur opens it to see if she can derive which substances the ink and parchment are created from, using her father’s microscope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the province of Caldon, where women train in wifely duties and men pursue collegiate education, sixteen-year-old Rhen Tellur wants nothing more than to become a scientist. As the poor of her seaside town fall prey to a deadly disease, she and her father work desperately to find a cure. But when her mum succumbs to it as well? Rhen decides to take the future into her own hands—through the annual all-male scholarship competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her cousin, Seleni, by her side, the girls don disguises and enter Mr. Holm’s labyrinth, to best the boys and claim the scholarship prize. Except not everyone is ready for a girl who doesn’t know her place. And not everyone survives the deadly maze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Labyrinth.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/i&gt; has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, the lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.</description>

  <description>The waking forest has secrets. To Rhea, it appears like a mirage, dark and dense, at the very edge of her backyard. But when she reaches out to touch it, the forest vanishes. She’s desperate to know more—until she finds a peculiar boy who offers to reveal its secrets. If she plays a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Witch, the forest is her home, where she sits on her throne of carved bone, waiting for dreaming children to beg her to grant their wishes. One night, a mysterious visitor arrives and asks her what she wishes for, but the Witch sends him away. And then the uninvited guest returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strangers are just the beginning. Something is stirring in the forest, and when Rhea’s and the Witch’s paths collide, a truth more treacherous and deadly than either could ever imagine surfaces. But how much are they willing to risk to survive?</description>

  <description>Paris in 1789 is a labyrinth of twisted streets, filled with beggars, thieves, revolutionaries—and magicians...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When smallpox kills her parents, Camille Durbonne must find a way to provide for her frail, naive sister while managing her volatile brother. Relying on petty magic—la magie ordinaire—Camille painstakingly transforms scraps of metal into money to buy the food and medicine they need. But when the coins won’t hold their shape and her brother disappears with the family’s savings, Camille must pursue a richer, more dangerous mark: the glittering court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With dark magic forbidden by her mother, Camille transforms herself into the ‘Baroness de la Fontaine’ and is swept up into life at the Palace of Versailles, where aristocrats both fear and hunger for la magie. There, she gambles at cards, desperate to have enough to keep herself and her sister safe. Yet the longer she stays at court, the more difficult it becomes to reconcile her resentment of the nobles with the enchantments of Versailles. And when she returns to Paris, Camille meets a handsome young balloonist—who dares her to hope that love and liberty may both be possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But la magie has its costs. And when Camille loses control of her secrets, the game she's playing turns deadly. Then revolution erupts, and she must choose—love or loyalty, democracy or aristocracy, freedom or magic—before Paris burns…</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn's story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways. &lt;i&gt;The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means--and what it costs--to face the truth.</description>

  <description>Courtney Bishop is as sugary sweet as her famous blueberry muffins.&lt;br /&gt;Southern belle at heart, Cali girl by choice.&lt;br /&gt;She barged into my life and easily became my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;All was great as roommates and just friends, but then I fell for the girl who could chop firewood, deliver baby calves, and bail hay without breaking a sweat. &lt;br /&gt;She's the perfect mixture of sugar and spice, and I &lt;i&gt; love &lt;/i&gt; her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being more than friends and trying to build our future isn't as easy as it sounds. &lt;br /&gt;Moving forward and creating memories is all I want for us, but when the past continues to come back and haunt me, I'm not so sure she'll stay for the ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving her is easy, but losing her will break me. Burning passion combined with an undeniable chemistry constantly pushes and pulls us together. In the end, I'll prove we're worth the fight, even when the game is far from over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Checkmate, &lt;/i&gt; sweetheart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is book 2 in the Checkmate Duet Series--a friends to lovers romance. You must read book 1, Checkmate: This is Reckless first. Highly recommended to read the Checkmate Duet, This is War and This is Love first, but not necessary. This can read as a standalone duet.** </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The chocolate went first, then the cheese, the fries, the ice cream. The bread was more difficult, but if she could just lose a little more weight, perhaps she would make the soloists’ list. Perhaps if she were lighter, danced better, tried harder, she would be good enough. Perhaps if she just ran for one more mile, lost just one more pound.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Roux was a professional dancer who followed the man of her dreams from Paris to Missouri. There, alone with her biggest fears – imperfection, failure, loneliness – she spirals down anorexia and depression till she weighs a mere eighty-eight pounds. Forced to seek treatment, she is admitted as a patient at 17 Swann Street, a peach pink house where pale, fragile women with life-threatening eating disorders live. Women like Emm, the veteran; quiet Valerie; Julia, always hungry. Together, they must fight their diseases and face six meals a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yara Zgheib's poetic and poignant debut novel is a haunting, intimate journey of a young woman's struggle to reclaim her life. Every bite causes anxiety. Every flavor induces guilt. And every step Anna takes toward recovery will require strength, endurance, and the support of the girls at 17 Swann Street.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Only when she’s locked away does the truth begin to escape… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four walls. One window. No way to escape. Hannah knows there's been a mistake. She didn't need to be institutionalized. What happened to her roommate at her summer program was an accident. As soon as the doctors and judge figure out that she isn't a danger to herself or others, she can go home to start her senior year. In the meantime, she is going to use her persuasive skills to get the staff on her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Lucy arrives. Lucy has her own baggage. And she may be the only person who can get Hannah to confront the dangerous games and secrets that landed her in confinement in the first place.</description>

  <description>Drew Fisher is the type of guy every girl wants.&lt;br /&gt;Noble police officer by day, charming prince by night.&lt;br /&gt;He has no idea the effect he has on women, especially me—his little sister’s best friend.&lt;br /&gt;I’m the blonde Southern belle who lives up to the cliché, except I have my own quirks. I’m smart as a whip, can change my own oil, and recite The Pledge of Allegiance backward, but he doesn’t see that girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’d be easier to forget him if he wasn’t my roommate and if the first thing I saw in the morning wasn't his shirtless body covered in tattoos. I’ve crushed on him since the day we met, but he’s made it perfectly clear where we stand. Just friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I need to move on and accept that his feelings will never be mutual, but every day he smiles at me, I’m left dreaming of what if.&lt;br /&gt;He has girl issues, and I’ve got a crush I can’t deny.&lt;br /&gt;We’re friends, but I want more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drunken hookup leaves us with much more than a platonic friendship. Pretending it never happened proves to be more difficult than anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crazy ex-girlfriend, a dangerous war of stolen glances, and passionate kisses leads to the most reckless battle yet. I won’t be a pawn in his game, but I’ll play by his rules if it will show him I’m the one worth breaking them for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Checkmate,&lt;/i&gt; Prince Charming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This is book 1 of 2 in the Checkmate Duet Series--a friends to lovers romance. Highly recommended to read the Checkmate Duet, This is War and This is Love first, but not necessary. This can read as a standalone duet.**</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The anticipated conclusion of &lt;i&gt;The Checkmate Duet&lt;/i&gt; from a secret duo of bestselling authors! Checkmate: This is War is an enemies to lovers romance that will have you crying with laughter one moment and screaming in frustration the next... but you'll be begging to play the game with The King. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Game on.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Viola Fisher is the epitome of perfection.&lt;br /&gt;She despises my one-night stands and mocks my less-than-classy habits.&lt;br /&gt;She's smart, beautiful, and too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;And I &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she were anyone else, I'd have made my move years ago, but considering she's my best friend's little sister, she's always been off-limits. Not to mention how much she loathes my very existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hating me is her religion, but needing her is mine. Her sexy curves and filthy smart mouth make me want her even more, and I'm more determined than ever to change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll prove I'm done playing games.&lt;br /&gt;But until then, we'll continue to play by her rules.&lt;br /&gt;Viola Fisher may have won the battle, but the war isn't over yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Checkmate&lt;/i&gt;, princess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Recommend for ages 18+ due to sexual content and adult language.*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**This is Love is book in the Checkmate Duet. You must read This is War first.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Coming from a new duo of bestselling authors, &lt;i&gt;The Checkmate Duet&lt;/i&gt;, an enemies to lovers romance!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis King is the worst kind of a**hole.&lt;br /&gt;He taunts me for being a good girl and mocks my high standards.&lt;br /&gt;He's cruel, crass, and has enough confidence to last two lifetimes.&lt;br /&gt;And I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn't matter so much if he were avoidable.&lt;br /&gt;But considering he's my older brother's best friend and roommate, I see him more than I'd ever want to.&lt;br /&gt;His sculpted abs and gorgeous eyes are wasted on such an arrogant man, which makes me hate him even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I've had a crush on him since I was ten, the feelings weren't mutual and he's made that very clear.&lt;br /&gt;He's always loved getting under my skin and one night against my better judgment, I let him in my bed.&lt;br /&gt;I've succumbed to his manw**re ways, but that doesn't change a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the King is about to get played at his own game--and lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Checkmate&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Recommend for ages 18+ due to sexual content and adult language.**</description>

  <description>The Shadow Market is a meeting point for faeries, werewolves, warlocks and vampires. There the Downworlders buy and sell magical objects, make dark bargains, and whisper secrets they do not want the Nephilim to know. Through two centuries, however, there has been a frequent visitor to the Shadow Market from the City of Bones, the very heart of the Shadowhunters. As a Silent Brother, Brother Zachariah is sworn keeper of the laws and lore of the Nephilim. But once he was a Shadowhunter called Jem Carstairs, and his love, then and always, is the warlock Tessa Gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Brother Zachariah and see, against the backdrop of the Shadow Market’s dark dealings and festive celebrations, Anna Lightwood’s first romance, Matthew Fairchild’s great sin and Tessa Gray plunged into a world war. Valentine Morgenstern buys a soul at the Market and a young Jace Wayland’s soul finds safe harbor. In the Market is hidden a lost heir and a beloved ghost, and no one can save you once you have traded away your heart. Not even Brother Zachariah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ghosts of the Shadow Market will be co-written with Maureen Johnson, Robin Wasserman, Sarah Rees Brennan and Pulitzer finalist Kelly Link and will initially be available digitally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first eight stories will be published as e-books from around March 2018 monthly, with the final two available in a print bind-up of all the stories, to be published in 2019.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In a lush, contemporary fantasy retelling of Beauty and the Beast, Brigid Kemmerer gives readers another compulsively readable romance perfect for fans of Marissa Meyer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Fall in love, break the curse.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It once seemed so easy to Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall. Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year over and over, he knew he could be saved if a girl fell for him. But that was before he learned that at the end of each autumn, he would turn into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. That was before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever been easy for Harper Lacy. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother barely holding their family together while constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, she learned to be tough enough to survive. But when she tries to save someone else on the streets of Washington, DC, she's instead somehow sucked into Rhen's cursed world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Break the curse, save the kingdom.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince? A monster? A curse? Harper doesn't know where she is or what to believe. But as she spends time with Rhen in this enchanted land, she begins to understand what's at stake. And as Rhen realizes Harper is not just another girl to charm, his hope comes flooding back. But powerful forces are standing against Emberfall . . . and it will take more than a broken curse to save Harper, Rhen, and his people from utter ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Advance Readers Copy&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sequel to the instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Furyborn&lt;/i&gt;, two queens, separated by a thousand years, connected by secrets and lies, must continue their fight amid deadly plots and unthinkable betrayals that will test their strength—and their hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rielle Dardenne has been anointed Sun Queen, but her trials are far from over. The Gate keeping the angels at bay is falling. To repair it, Rielle must collect the seven hidden castings of the saints. Meanwhile, to help her prince and love Audric protect Celdaria, Rielle must spy on the angel Corien—but his promises of freedom and power may prove too tempting to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries later, Eliana Ferracora grapples with her new reality: She is the Sun Queen, humanity's long-awaited savior. But fear of corruption—fear of becoming another Rielle—keeps Eliana's power dangerous and unpredictable. Hunted by all, racing against time to save her dying friend Navi, Eliana must decide how to wear a crown she never wanted—by embracing her mother's power, or rejecting it forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jackson Bishop is your typical playboy. &lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable, charming, and overly confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in Texas, the ranch life is all he’s ever known. Horses and late night partying are his lifestyles, and all the local girls know it too. Riding lessons aren’t the only things taught at the stables, and he makes sure clients never leave unsatisfied. Everyone knows Jackson’s a wild card, but not everything is as it seems. He may be a womanizer on the surface, but he’s hiding deep feelings about the one who’s had his heart since he was a teen. Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as roping her in and claiming her as his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiera Young is well-known for her sassy nature and outgoing personality. Though she’s one of the best horse trainers in the area, she’s never been able to tame her best friend and the man she’s secretly loved since she was fifteen—Jackson Bishop. She’s waited years for him to confess his true feelings but as time goes on, she decides she’s done waiting. Kiera finally meets a man who promises to give her the world, and when he pops the question, she says yes—knowing they’re both ready to settle down and start a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if her heart beats for another man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson’s certain he’s lost Kiera for good and has no one to blame but himself. However, on the day of her wedding, he can’t bring himself to watch the woman he loves walk down the aisle to someone else. Kiera’s already having second thoughts and knows she can’t get married without his support. It’s not until she’s at the altar that she realizes she can’t let Jackson go and will do whatever it takes to keep him—even if it means running out on her own wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is book 4 in the Bishop Brothers series. Each book features a different brother and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed!&lt;br /&gt;**Not suitable for readers under 18 due to adult language and sexual content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>John Bishop isn’t your typical single dad.&lt;br /&gt;Reserved, impatient, and utterly clueless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running the family’s bed and breakfast has many perks. Working long hours, picking up after the guests, and hearing couples going at it all night long aren’t any of them. Hooking up with girls who come to the ranch for horseback riding lessons? Best perk of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until a baby shows up at his doorstep with a note claiming it’s his. Growing up on a ranch was anything but easy, but raising a newborn is proving to be the hardest task he’ll ever tackle. Leaving the bachelor life behind, his only priority is to hire a nanny who can teach him a thing or two about parenting — except he doesn’t anticipate her being gorgeous and quirky with an unhealthy football obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mila Carmichael has many talents — making balloon animals, creating origami art, and remaining in the friend zone. Often seen as one of the guys, she’s struck out more times than a rookie baseball player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking a new adventure, she flies to Texas to visit family and is offered a position she can’t refuse. Helping out a new dad should come easy to her, considering her past experience, but what she doesn’t anticipate is him being an attractive Southern temptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that’s only the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While growing close to his family and falling madly in love with the baby girl who’s stealing their hearts, things are bound to get complicated. Everyone knows not to mix business with pleasure. That means no late movie nights, no stolen glances, and definitely no kissing behind closed doors. Too bad the universe has other plans — one that’ll threaten taking away the main thing that binds them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is book 3 in the Bishop Brothers series. Each book features a different brother and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed!&lt;br /&gt;**Not suitable for readers under 18 due to adult language and sexual content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Evan Bishop is your typical hotshot doctor. &lt;br /&gt;Hardass, brooding, and all business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of working on the family ranch, Evan broke the mold and became an ER doctor. &lt;br /&gt;He’s good with his hands—in more ways than one—smart as a whip and is the definition of God’s gift to women. Being a gentleman is in his Southern roots, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t flawed. Exclusive dating has never been a top priority and his tragic past makes him stay at arm’s length. Deciding to let loose for a wild night, he takes a page from the Bishop brother’s relationship book and hooks up with a mysterious girl he’ll never have to see again, which is perfect for this self-proclaimed bachelor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily Bell is a city girl through and through but is determined to get away from her family and past. All she wants is a fresh start and to make a name for herself in the medical field. No random hookups and no dating coworkers—that’s her new motto after being burned time and again. When she agrees to attend a wedding as a plus-one, she’s soon ditched and left to drink solo—but not for long. Mr. Suit is the ultimate temptation with his Southern charm, messy blond hair, and irresistible sex appeal. Everything about him screams bad news, but he makes her reconsider her rules just for one night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, some rules are made to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They want the same thing—one night of passion then they’ll go their separate ways. No cuddling afterward. No next day phone calls. No awkward goodbyes. Too bad the universe has other plans—one that’ll be obvious when they report to work on Monday morning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is book 2 in the Bishop Brothers series. Each book features a different brother and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed!&lt;br /&gt;**Not suitable for readers under 18 due to adult language and sexual content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Archer has always wanted what he can’t have—Quinn Dawson. Since the moment he saw her, he’s been denying his feelings for her, ignoring the void in his heart he knows only she can fill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything about them was wrong, the kind of wrong that felt so right. But none of it mattered. Not the terrible timing. And definitely not the mess it would create if Archer made a move on his best friend’s baby sister. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be one night, but one night is all it takes to make everything more complicated, and they only have nine short months to sort it all out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, none of it mattered. Until it did. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Cheat Codes is book one in The Dawson Family Series.**</description>

  <description>Alex Bishop is your typical cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;Charming, sexy, and wears a panty-melting smirk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working on the ranch helped build his solid eight-pack and smoking body. He's every girl's wet fantasy, and he knows it too. Alex doesn't follow the rules of your typical playboy bachelor. After wining and dining his dates and giving them the best night of their lives, he always sends flowers and calls the next day—even if it's to say, let's just be friends. His mama taught him manners after all, and his Southern blood knows how to be a gentleman. Still, that isn’t enough to tame the wildest of the Bishop brothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River Lancaster has finally met the man of her dreams. Too bad after six months of romantic bliss, she finds out he's married. With a broken heart and blind rage, she books herself a ticket to Key West, Florida. Tired of cheaters and liars, she’s set on escaping to forget he ever existed. Who needs a man when there's an all-you-can-drink margarita bar, anyway? That's what she tells herself until she bumps into the right guy who can make all those bad memories disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even if it's only temporarily.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks on the beach is what they both need. No strings attached, no expectations, no broken hearts. Too bad the universe has other plans—one that'll change the entire course of their lives in just nine short months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is book 1 in the Bishop Brothers series. Each book features a different brother and can be read as a complete standalone. HEA guaranteed!&lt;br /&gt;**Not suitable for readers under 18 due to adult language and sexual content.**&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In Strickland County, there isn’t a lot of anything to go around. But when eighteen-year-old Harlowe Compton’s brother is killed by the Praters—the family who controls everything, from the mines to the law—he wonders if the future will ever hold more than loss. Until he meets Tennessee Moore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Tennessee, Harlowe feels for the first time that something good might happen, that he might’ve found the rarest thing of all: hope. Even as she struggles with the worst of the cards she’s been dealt, Tennessee makes Harlowe believe that they can dare to forge their own path—if they only give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Harlowe searches for the answers behind his brother’s death, his town’s decay, and his family’s dysfunction, he discovers truths about the people he loves—and himself—that are darker than he ever expected. Now, Harlowe realizes, there’s no turning back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful story of first love, poverty, and the grip of the opioid crisis in the rural South, Kristin Russell’s gorgeous debut novel asks a universal question: When hope seems lost, are dreams worth the risk?</description>

  <description>When seventeen-year-old Nedra Brysstain leaves her home in the rural, northern territories of Lunar Island to attend the prestigious Yugen Academy, she has only one goal in mind: learn the trade of medicinal alchemy. A scholarship student matriculating with the children of Lunar Island's wealthiest and most powerful families, Nedra doesn't quite fit in with the other kids at Yugen, who all look down on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All, except for Greggori "Grey" Astor. Grey is immediately taken by the brilliant and stubborn Nedra, who he notices is especially invested in her studies. And that's for a good reason: a deadly plague has been sweeping through the North, and it's making its way toward the cities. With her family's life--and the lives of all of Lunar Island's citizens--on the line, Nedra is determined to find a cure for the plague. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grey and Nedra continue to grow closer, but as the sickness spreads and the body count rises, Nedra becomes desperate to find a cure. Soon, she finds herself diving into alchemy's most dangerous corners--and when she turns to the most forbidden practice of all, necromancy, even Grey might not be able to pull her from the darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Never trust a guy in spandex.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Abby Hamilton’s world, superheroes do more than just stop crime and save cats stuck in trees—they also drink milk straight from the carton and hog the television remote. Abby’s older brother moonlights as the famous Red Comet, but without powers of her own, following in his footsteps has never crossed her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until the city’s newest vigilante comes bursting into her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saving Abby from an attempted mugging, Morriston’s fledgling supervillain Iron Phantom convinces her that he’s not as evil as everyone says, and that their city is under a vicious new threat. As Abby follows him deeper into their city’s darkest secrets, she comes to learn that heroes can’t always be trusted, and sometimes it’s the good guys who wear black.</description>

  <description>Charlotte has spent her twenties adrift, floating from interest to interest, job to job, and guy to guy, searching for a spark but never quite finding it. All she knows is that she won’t discover it working as a waitress at a pies-and-fries joint in Los Angeles or living with her fun but aimless best friend in a tiny apartment in the Arts District.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Charlotte collides with Adam, a gorgeous and soulful painter who seems just as lost as she feels. Their instant connection turns into a midnight drink… and a whirlwind night of champagne, Chinese food, and the kind of conversation that only happens in romantic comedies. But the next morning, Adam gives Charlotte the cold shoulder, leaving her confused and hurt—and wondering if the few odd moments between them the night before were red flags in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later, Charlotte hasn’t been able to shake Adam, so she decides to find out what happened the morning after their magical night together. This fateful decision rewrites their wild love story, but what Charlotte doesn’t know yet is that the ending has already been written.</description>

  <description>A Chicago reporter in her mid-twenties unexpectedly finds love in Napa Valley when she’s assigned to spend a week with a famously reclusive genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Corbin has lost her spark. From the outside, her life seems charmed. She has a handsome, long-term boyfriend and a budding journalism career at a popular Chicago newspaper. But in reality, her relationship is going nowhere, and she’s quickly losing motivation for what she once believed was her dream job. When her boyfriend dumps her unceremoniously, Kate loses all hope of finding love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no living family and few friends, Kate confides in her boss. Trusting that the hungry, ace reporter is buried somewhere deep inside, he gives Kate the opportunity to jumpstart her career. The assignment: to interview the famously reclusive R.J. Lawson, a wealthy tech genius who disappeared years ago but recently reemerged as a Napa Valley vintner. The week takes an unexpected turn, however, when Lawson refuses to divulge any information. Desperate for a lead, Kate turns to Jamie, a vineyard hand who shows her the romance of wine country—and stirs her aching heart. But his connection to Lawson is ambiguous, and when Jamie disappears before the end of the week, Kate is left to investigate another story: the truth behind the man who stole her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USA TODAY bestselling author Renée Carlino explored love and heartbreak in her beautifully written debut Sweet Thing, and her newest novel does not disappoint. For fans of Colleen Hoover, K.A. Tucker, and Katja Millay, Nowhere But Here is a stirring and satisfying romance that you won’t want to put down.</description>

  <description>"You have to teach your heart and mind how to sing together... then you'll hear the sound of your soul."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Kelly thinks she has it all figured out. She's an Ivy League graduate, a classically trained pianist, and the beloved daughter of a sensible mother and offbeat father. Yet Mia has been stalling since graduation, torn between putting her business degree to use and exploring music, her true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her father unexpectedly dies, she decides to pick up the threads of his life while she figures out her own. Uprooting herself from Ann Arbor to New York City, Mia takes over her father's cafe, a treasured neighborhood institution that plays host to undiscovered musicians and artists. She's denied herself the thrilling and unpredictable life of a musician, but a chance encounter with Will, a sweet, gorgeous, and charming guitarist, offers her a glimpse of what could be. When Will becomes her friend and then her roommate, she does everything in her power to suppress her passions—for him, for music—but her father's legacy slowly opens her heart to the possibility of something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A "heartbreaking and romantic" (Aestas Book Blog) debut, Sweet Thing explores the intensity and complexities of first love and self-discovery.</description>

  <description>To the Green-eyed Lovebird:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met fifteen years ago, almost to the day, when I moved my stuff into the NYU dorm room next to yours at Senior House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You called us fast friends. I like to think it was more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We lived on nothing but the excitement of finding ourselves through music (you were obsessed with Jeff Buckley), photography (I couldn’t stop taking pictures of you), hanging out in Washington Square Park, and all the weird things we did to make money. I learned more about myself that year than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, somehow, it all fell apart. We lost touch the summer after graduation when I went to South America to work for National Geographic. When I came back, you were gone. A part of me still wonders if I pushed you too hard after the wedding…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t see you again until a month ago. It was a Wednesday. You were rocking back on your heels, balancing on that thick yellow line that runs along the subway platform, waiting for the F train. I didn’t know it was you until it was too late, and then you were gone. Again. You said my name; I saw it on your lips. I tried to will the train to stop, just so I could say hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing you, all of the youthful feelings and memories came flooding back to me, and now I’ve spent the better part of a month wondering what your life is like. I might be totally out of my mind, but would you like to get a drink with me and catch up on the last decade and a half?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sweet Thing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nowhere But Here&lt;/i&gt; comes a love story about a Craigslist “missed connection” post that gives two people a second chance at love fifteen years after they were separated in New York City.</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>Once upon a time… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A town will only suffer the presence of a witch for as long as she is useful. Aisling watches the flames lick her thighs and prays for a quick death. But when an Unseelie prince appears through the smoke, she does what any self respecting witch would do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She curses him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bran should never have traveled to the human realm, and is shocked when a witch binds them together. His life is hers and he refuses to die. He saves her from the fires, casts a hex on the townsfolk for good measure, then whisks her away to safety. His only stipulation? She has to remove the binding curse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for them both, she can’t. Witch and Unseelie must travel across the Otherworld to break the ties that bind them. Secrets and lies stand between them, but both will stop at nothing to save themselves.</description>

  <description>Best friends Corey and Kyra were inseparable in their snow-covered town of Lost Creek, Alaska. When Corey moves away, she makes Kyra promise to stay strong during the long, dark winter, and wait for her return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just days before Corey is to return home to visit, Kyra dies. Corey is devastated―and confused. The entire Lost community speaks in hushed tones about the town's lost daughter, saying her death was meant to be. And they push Corey away like she's a stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corey knows something is wrong. With every hour, her suspicion grows. Lost is keeping secrets―chilling secrets. But piecing together the truth about what happened to her best friend may prove as difficult as lighting the sky in an Alaskan winter...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When six clones join Emmaline’s prestigious boarding school, she must confront the heartbreak of seeing her dead best friend’s face each day in class.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Similars are all anyone can talk about at the elite Darkwood Academy. Who are these six clones? What are the odds that all of them would be Darkwood students? Who is the madman who broke the law to create them? Emma couldn't care less. Her best friend, Oliver, died over the summer and all she can think about is how to get through her junior year without him. Then she comes face-to-heartbreaking-face with Levi—Oliver's exact DNA replica and one of the Similars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma wants nothing to do with the Similars, but she keeps getting pulled deeper and deeper into their clique, uncovering dark truths about the clones and her prestigious school along the way. But no one can be trusted…not even the boy she is falling for who has Oliver's face.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series finale and sequel to &lt;i&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Shadow of Night&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing the magic and suspense of the All Souls Trilogy to a deeply satisfying conclusion, this highly anticipated finale went straight to #1 on the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller list. In &lt;i&gt;The Book of Life,&lt;/i&gt; Diana and Matthew time-travel back from Elizabethan London to make a dramatic return to the present—facing new crises and old enemies. At Matthew’s ancestral home, Sept-Tours, they reunite with the beloved cast of characters from &lt;i&gt; A Discovery of Witches&lt;/i&gt;—with one significant exception. But the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency.</description>

  <description>Picking up from &lt;i&gt;A Discovery of Witches’&lt;/i&gt; cliffhanger ending, &lt;i&gt;Shadow of Night&lt;/i&gt; takes Diana and Matthew on a trip through time to Elizabethan London, where they are plunged into a world of spies, magic, and a coterie of Matthew’s old friends, the School of Night. As the search for Ashmole 782 deepens and Diana seeks out a witch to tutor her in magic, the net of Matthew’s past tightens around them, and they embark on a very different—and vastly more dangerous—journey.</description>

  <description>Two teens discover the government is staging terrorist attacks to exploit and control the public in Tracy Lawson’s eerily believable YA debut novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In an alternate reality version of 2034, terrorist attacks on American soil continue after the events of 9/11. The Office of Civilian Safety and Defense, created in 2019 to oversee domestic security, rises to unprecedented heights of power by exploiting the people’s overriding fear of terrorism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Tommy Bailey and Careen Catecher meet during one of the bogus terrorist attacks, they discover the OCSD’s darkest secret: an antidote distributed by the government to “protect” people from the effects of imaginary toxins in the air is really being used to lull them into a state of submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tommy and Careen face a difficult choice: stay quiet about what they know—or risk their safety and anonymity to join an underground rebel group that’s determined to break the OCSD’s grip on the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Counteract explores the nature of power and the consequences and difficulties created when government attempts to control minute details of citizens’ daily existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Tracy Lawson's novel asks an even more disturbing question--what if the real culprit was someone or something we trusted? I thought The Hunger Games might be the Millennial generation's version of George Orwell's 1984. Now, I think Counteract and the Resistance Series are more primed to take that spot."--SR Staley, author of St. Nic, Inc., and the Tortuga Bay series.</description>

  <description>In a world where women have no rights, sisters Serina and Nomi Tessaro face two very different fates: one in the palace, the other in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serina has been groomed her whole life to become a Grace - someone to stand by the heir to the throne as a shining, subjugated example of the perfect woman. But when her headstrong and rebellious younger sister, Nomi, catches the heir's eye, it's Serina who takes the fall for the dangerous secret that Nomi has been hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now trapped in a life she never wanted, Nomi has only one way to save Serina: surrender to her role as a Grace until she can use her position to release her sister. This is easier said than done. A traitor walks the halls of the palace, and deception lurks in every corner. But Serina is running out of time, imprisoned on an island where she must fight to the death to survive and one wrong move could cost her everything.</description>

  <description>Children can have a cruel, absolute sense of justice. Children can kill a monster and feel quite proud of themselves. A girl can look at her brother and believe they’re destined to be a knight and a bard who battle evil. She can believe she’s found the thing she’s been made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hazel lives with her brother, Ben, in the strange town of Fairfold where humans and fae exist side by side. The faeries’ seemingly harmless magic attracts tourists, but Hazel knows how dangerous they can be, and she knows how to stop them. Or she did, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of it all, there is a glass coffin in the woods. It rests right on the ground and in it sleeps a boy with horns on his head and ears as pointed as knives. Hazel and Ben were both in love with him as children. The boy has slept there for generations, never waking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, he does…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the world turns upside down, Hazel tries to remember her years pretending to be a knight. But swept up in new love, shifting loyalties, and the fresh sting of betrayal, will it be enough?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the "gift" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: "Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally." When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.</description>

  <description>Zera is a Heartless – the immortal, unageing soldier of a witch. Bound to the witch Nightsinger ever since she saved her from the bandits who murdered her family, Zera longs for freedom from the woods they hide in. With her heart in a jar under Nightsinger’s control, she serves the witch unquestioningly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Nightsinger asks Zera for a Prince’s heart in exchange for her own, with one addendum; if she’s discovered infiltrating the court, Nightsinger will destroy her heart rather than see her tortured by the witch-hating nobles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crown Prince Lucien d’Malvane hates the royal court as much as it loves him – every tutor too afraid to correct him and every girl jockeying for a place at his darkly handsome side. No one can challenge him – until the arrival of Lady Zera. She’s inelegant, smart-mouthed, carefree, and out for his blood. The Prince’s honor has him quickly aiming for her throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins a game of cat and mouse between a girl with nothing to lose and a boy who has it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winner takes the loser’s heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally.</description>

  <description>Sometimes you just have to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding her destiny nearly cost her everything. Kristia knows she can handle whatever The Fates throw at her next—including her long-awaited honeymoon with the God of Winter. But as things heat up between Kristia and Ull, a frost settles over Asgard. An unexpected death marks the beginning of the end, much earlier than anyone expected. Kristia’s barely begun to understand what she’s capable of, and controlling her powers seems completely out of her grasp. With her new family fighting for their lives, and Ull fighting for their future, Kristia has to make a devastating choice: preserve the life she loves, or protect the god she can’t live without?</description>

  <description>Featured in USA Today&lt;br /&gt;RE-RELEASING JULY 17, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, finding your destiny means doing the exact opposite of what The Fates have planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning the heart of an immortal assassin was a dream come true for Kristia Tostenson. Now she’s knee deep in wedding plans, goddess lessons, and stolen kisses. But her decision to become immortal could end in heartbreak -- not only for Kristia, but for the god who loves her. Because while Ull would do anything to protect his bride, even the God of Winter is powerless against the Norse apocalypse. Ragnarok is coming. And the gods aren’t even close to ready.</description>

  <description>Featured in USA Today &lt;br /&gt;An Upper YA/New Adult Paranormal Romance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristia Tostenson prefers Earl Grey to Grey Goose and book clubs to nightclubs. But when she transfers from her one-stoplight Oregon town to Cardiff University in Wales, she falls in love with Ull Myhr. Her new boyfriend isn’t exactly what she was expecting. His cashmere sweaters and old world charm mask a warrior who's spent an eternity fighting for his very existence. Ull is an honest-to-goodness Norse god — an immortal assassin fated to die at Ragnarok, the battle destined to destroy Asgard and Earth. On top of being marked for death, Asgardian law prohibits Ull from tying his fate to a mortal. No matter what she feels for Ull, Kristia knows she's the one thing he can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Ragnarok on the horizon and a lunatic haunting her dreams, Kristia has to find a way to convince Ull that breaking the rules is the only way to survive; that defying the order he's sworn to uphold is their only chance to be together. And when someone starts asking the wrong questions, Kristia realizes the crazy visions she's had all her life might be the key to saving their realms... even if they end up costing her her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsker: The Elsker Saga, Book One</description>

  <description>Inga Andersson is the envy of every girl in Asgard. On the surface she has it all -- great friends, a job as Odin’s personal fight choreographer, and a happy ever after with her realm’s hottest assassin. But when evil invades Asgard, her perfect world comes crashing down. Someone is planning to kill off the gods, and Inga’s best friend Ull is first on their list. With the Norse apocalypse a nanosecond away, Inga has to decide how she’ll spend her final moments of freedom. Because from the moment this battle begins, Inga’s happily ever after will be nothing more than a memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things are worth fighting for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TUR is an Elsker Saga novella. It is approximately 10,000 words long.</description>

  <description>Katya’s power to freeze anything she touches has made her an outcast in her isolated village. And when she loses control of her ability, accidentally killing several villagers, she is banished to the palace of the terrifying Prince Sasha in Kiev. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the castle, though, she is surprised to find that Sasha is just like her—with his own strange talent, the ability to summon fire. Instead of punishment, Sasha offers Katya friendship, and the chance to embrace her power rather than fear it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But outside the walls of Kiev, Sasha’s enemies have organized their own army of people who can control the very earth. Bent on taking over the entire world, they won’t stop until they’ve destroyed everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katya and Sasha are desperate to stop the encroaching army, and together their powers are a fearsome weapon. But as their enemies draw nearer, leaving destruction in their wake, will fire and frost be enough to save the world? Or will they lose everything they hold dear?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The final battle is here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aelin Galathynius has vowed to save her people―but at a tremendous cost. Locked within an iron coffin by the Queen of the Fae, Aelin must draw upon her fiery will as she endures months of torture. The knowledge that yielding to Maeve will doom those she loves keeps her from breaking, but her resolve is unraveling with each passing day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Aelin captured, friends and allies are scattered to different fates. Some bonds will grow even deeper, while others will be severed forever. As destinies weave together at last, all must fight if Erilea is to have any hope of salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years in the making, Sarah J. Maas's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Throne of Glass series draws to an explosive conclusion as Aelin fights to save herself―and the promise of a better world.</description>

  <description>Sadie Hunt isn’t perfect—but her husband is. Nathan Hunt has her coffee waiting every morning. He holds her hand until the last second. He worships the Manhattan sidewalk she walks on. Until one day, he just…stops. And Sadie finds herself in the last place she ever expected to be. Lonely in her marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rugged and sexy Finn Cohen moves into the apartment across the hall, he and Sadie share an immediate spark. Finn reveals dreams for a different life. Sadie wants to save her marriage. Their secrets should keep them apart, not ignite a blistering affair. But while Sadie’s marriage runs colder by the day, she and Finn burn hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Her husband doesn’t want her anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The man next door would give up everything to have her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slip of the Tongue is a standalone contemporary romance. The second book in the series, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30050787-the-first-taste" rel="nofollow"&gt;The First Taste&lt;/a&gt;, is a standalone about a different couple.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>I remember the lights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember I wanted to photograph them, the way the red and blue splashed across his cold, emotionless face. But I knew even if my feet could move from the place where they had cemented themselves to the ground and I could run for my camera, I wouldn’t be able to capture that moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had trusted him, I had loved him, and even though my body had changed that summer, he’d made sure to help me hold on to who I was inside, regardless of how the exterior altered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then everything changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He stole my innocence. He scarred my heart. He took everything I thought I knew about my life and fast-pitched it out the window, shattering the glass that held my world together in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the lights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The passionate, desperate, hot strikes of red. The harsh, cruel, icy bolts of blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They symbolized everything I endured that summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And everything I would never face again.</description>

  <description>Left or right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s that simple, and it isn’t simple at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I turn left, the road will lead me back to the man I promised my life to, the one I’d imagined building a family with, the one who’s done everything in his power to get me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I turn right, the road will take me to the man I loved first, the man who brought me back to life, the man who would do anything to keep me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew the fork in the road was inevitable; it was the decision I never wanted to make between choices I didn't know I had. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart is destined to exist in two equal halves — one with each man. But one half beats stronger, the vein running deepest, and holds my choice in silence long before I know it for myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The realization of what I have to do, of the heart I have to break, just might break mine too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left or right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to do is take a breath and turn.</description>

  <description>Matthew Fairchild is the Consul’s son and the golden-haired boy of the Nephilim. He has the love of his family and his parabatai James Herondale, and nothing to wish for, except excitement and artistry and beauty that do not seem to fit in with a warrior’s way of life. Matthew gets more than he bargained for at the Shadow Market, where he commits the greatest sin of his life—something he can never tell his parabatai, or any of the honorable Shadowhunters around him.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The highly anticipated conclusion to the Something in the Way series, a forbidden love saga.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake&lt;br /&gt;It was a hot summer day when I met him on the construction site next to my parents' house. If I’d known then what I do now, would I have kept on walking? Manning was older, darker, experienced—and I’d trusted him when he said the story would only ever be about us. I’d held those words close and challenged fate, but I had lost.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A part of me is still that sixteen-year-old girl squinting up at Manning, but no matter how far I fall or high I soar, I’ll always be a bird without her bear and nothing without him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Manning&lt;br /&gt;When I close my eyes, I can no longer see her. The decisions I made were to push Lake in the right direction—away from me. But now that she’s gone, would I have made those same choices?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d walked away like I was supposed to. I’d kept my distance. I’d bent over backward to keep Lake pure, but she’s no longer that girl, and I don’t know if I can stay away anymore. I only know I don’t want to. She’s still everything I want and nothing I should ever have, but if anyone can move the stars, it’s her great bear in the sky.</description>

  <description>If I closed my eyes, I could still see them—all blonde sunshine, ocean-blue eyes, and long limbs. The glint of Lake’s gold bracelet. Pink cotton candy on Tiffany’s tongue. My scenery may have changed from heaven to hell, but some things never would: my struggle to do right by both sisters. To let Lake soar. To lift Tiffany up. The sacrifices I made for them, I made willingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better man would’ve walked away by now, but I never claimed to be any good. I only promised myself I’d keep enough distance. If I’d learned one thing from my past, it was that love came in different forms. You could love passionately, hurt deep, die young. Or you could provide the kind of firm, steady support someone else could lean on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake was everything I wanted, and nothing I could ever have. I was nobody before I knew her and a criminal after. The way to love her was to let her shine—even if it would be for somebody else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book two in the Something in the Way series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Darker Shade of Magic&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in V.E. Schwab's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Shades of Magic trilogy, is now available in a special collector's edition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a revamped, metallic ink detailed cover and reading ribbon, this edition will also feature the following bonus material:&lt;br /&gt;*End papers featuring fan art&lt;br /&gt;*A glossary of Arnesian and Antari terms&lt;br /&gt;*An interview between author and editor&lt;br /&gt;*Original (never before seen!) tales from within the Shades of Magic world&lt;br /&gt;*Signed title page&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell is one of the last Antari―magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell was raised in Arnes―Red London―and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.</description>

  <description>On the northeast side of town, there is a house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house was once magical, filled with love and joy and plans for the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside its walls are many things that belong to me — my books, the china from my mother on my wedding day, the beautiful cage once home to two birds, now empty, just like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who also belongs to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man I no longer wish to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man who, no doubt, has not slept, though the sun is rising. Because the house where he waits is where I laid my head to rest every night for eight years. Until last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one who knows me would believe Charlie Pierce, the quiet, bookish girl who never made waves is pulling out of the driveway of a man who isn’t her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they don’t know me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t even know me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say there are two sides to every story, and I suppose in most cases, that’s true. But the one I live inside of? It has three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the northeast side of town, there is a house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is no longer a home.</description>

  <description>Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.</description>

  <description>In 1886, a mysterious travelling circus becomes an international sensation. Open only at night, constructed entirely in black and white, &lt;i&gt;Le Cirque des Rêves&lt;/i&gt; delights all who wander its circular paths and warm themselves at its bonfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are acrobats, fortune-tellers and contortionists, the Circus of Dreams is no conventional spectacle. Some tents contain clouds, some ice. The circus seems almost to cast a spell over its aficionados, who call themselves the &lt;i&gt;rêveurs&lt;/i&gt; - the dreamers. At the heart of the story is the tangled relationship between two young magicians, Celia, the enchanter's daughter, and Marco, the sorcerer's apprentice. At the behest of their shadowy masters, they find themselves locked in a deadly contest, forced to test the very limits of the imagination, and of their love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fabulous, fin-de-siècle feast for the senses and a life-affirming love story, &lt;i&gt;The Night Circus&lt;/i&gt; is a captivating novel that will make the real world seem fantastical and a fantasy world real.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How do you kill a god?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her father's chosen heir, eighteen-year-old Rasmira has trained her whole life to become a warrior and lead her village. But when her coming-of-age trial is sabotaged and she fails the test, her father banishes her to the monster-filled wilderness with an impossible quest: to win back her honour, she must kill the oppressive god who claims tribute from the villages each year or die trying.</description>

  <description>The ancient land of Éirinn is mired in war. Ciara, Princess of Mide, has never known a time when Éirinn’s kingdoms were not battling for power, or Northmen were not plundering their shores. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Mide have thankfully always been safe because of Ciara’s unearthly ability to control her enemies’ minds and actions. But lately, a mysterious crow has been appearing to Ciara, whispering warnings of an even darker threat. Although her clansmen dismiss her visions as pagan nonsense, Ciara fears this coming evil will destroy not just Éirinn, but the entire world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the crow leads Ciara to Leif, a young Northman leader. Leif should be Ciara’s enemy, but when Ciara discovers that he, too, shares her prophetic visions, she knows he’s something more. Leif is mounting an impressive army, and with Ciara’s strength in battle the two might have a chance to save their world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With evil rising around them, they’ll do what it takes to defend the land they love…even if it means making the greatest sacrifice of all.</description>

  <description>Celine Montclaire goes to the Shadow Market to escape. She would go anywhere in Paris, or the entire world, to escape the suffering she experiences at the hands of her family. She did not expect to meet Valentine Morgenstern there, or to have him promise her freedom and the heart of the man she secretly loves. On one condition, of course. At the Shadow Market, nothing is for free.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the riveting new novel from the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;First Comes Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Something Borrowed&lt;/i&gt;, three very different people must choose between their family and their values.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Browning is living the good life after marrying into Nashville’s elite. More recently, her husband made a fortune selling his tech business, and their adored son has been accepted to Princeton. Yet sometimes the middle-class small-town girl in Nina wonders if she’s strayed from the person she once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Volpe is a single dad working multiple jobs while struggling to raise his headstrong daughter, Lyla. His road has been lonely, long, and hard, but he finally starts to relax after Lyla earns a scholarship to Windsor Academy, Nashville’s most prestigious private school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid so much wealth and privilege, Lyla doesn’t always fit in—and her overprotective father doesn’t help—but in most ways, she’s a typical teenage girl, happy and thriving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one photograph, snapped in a drunken moment at a party, changes everything. As the image spreads like wildfire, the Windsor community is instantly polarized, buzzing with controversy and assigning blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the lies and scandal, Tom, Nina, and Lyla are forced together—all questioning their closest relationships, asking themselves who they really are, and searching for the courage to live a life of true meaning.</description>

  <description>On the night of her high school graduation, Vale McKinley and her boyfriend Crawford are in a terrible car accident that leaves Crawford in a coma. They were supposed to spend the summer planning for college, for a bright future full of possibility. Together. Instead, Vale spends long days in the hospital, hoping Crawford will awaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slate Allen, a college friend of Vale's brother, has been visiting his dying uncle at the same hospital. When he and Vale meet, she can't deny the flutter of an illicit attraction. She tries to ignore her feelings, but she's not immune to Slate's charm. Slowly, they form a cautious friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Crawford wakes up . . . with no memory of Vale or their relationship. Heartbroken, Vale opts to leave for college and move on with her life. Except now, she's in Slate's territory, and their story is about to take a very strange turn.</description>

Pursued by Blades of the Red Church and soldiers of the Luminatii legion, she may never escape the City of Bridges and Bones alive. Her mentor Mercurio is now in the clutches of her enemies.

Truedark approaches. Night is falling on the Republic for perhaps the final time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Mia survive in a world where even daylight must die?</description>

  <description>A heart to protect. A debt to repay. A game to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being swept up in the magical world of Caraval, Donatella Dragna has finally escaped her father and saved her sister, Scarlett, from a disastrous arranged marriage. The girls should be celebrating, but Tella isn’t yet free. She made a desperate bargain with a mysterious criminal, and what Tella owes him no one has ever been able to deliver: Caraval Master Legend’s true name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only chance of uncovering Legend’s identity is to win Caraval, so Tella throws herself into the legendary competition once more—and into the path of the murderous heir to the throne, a doomed love story, and a web of secrets…including her sister's. Caraval has always demanded bravery, cunning, and sacrifice, but now the game is asking for more. If Tella can’t fulfill her bargain and deliver Legend’s name, she’ll lose everything she cares about—maybe even her life. But if she wins, Legend and Caraval will be destroyed forever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome, welcome to Caraval . . . the games have only just begun.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The new gut-wrenching epic from the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sky in the Deep&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, Tova has lived among the Svell, the people who found her washed ashore as a child and use her for her gift as a Truthtongue. Her own home and clan are long-faded memories, but the sacred symbols and staves inked over every inch of her skin mark her as one who can cast the rune stones and see into the future. She has found a fragile place among those who fear her, but when two clans to the east bury their age-old blood feud and join together as one, her world is dangerously close to collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in generations, the leaders of the Svell are divided. Should they maintain peace or go to war with the allied clans to protect their newfound power? And when their chieftain looks to Tova to cast the stones, she sets into motion a series of events that will not only change the landscape of the mainland forever but will give her something she believed she could never have again—a home.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>One summer will challenge everything the Garrett sisters thought they knew about themselves—and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kat lands the lead in the community theater’s summer play, but the drama spills offstage when her ex and his new girlfriend are cast too. Can she get revenge by staging a new romance of her own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bea and her boyfriend are heading off to college together in the fall, just like they planned when they started dating. But Bea isn’t sure she wants the same things as when she was thirteen…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vi has a crush on the girl next door. It makes her happy and nervous, but Cece has a boyfriend…so it’s not like her feelings could ever be reciprocated, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the oldest, Des shoulders a lot of responsibility for her family and their independent bookstore. Except it’s hard to dream big when she’s so busy taking care of everyone else.</description>

  <description>**Slow Build Reverse Harem YA Paranormal Romance** &lt;br /&gt;Learning Knight is alive brings light back to Lisbeth’s pallid world, yet stabbing daggers of guilt may force them apart. &lt;br /&gt;Despite Lisbeth’s unyielding efforts, the tentative alliance between the Vampires and Lycans is hanging by a thread. Add to that the rebellious uprising of turned vampires against their blood born masters, and flames of civil war are burning across the land. Unfortunately, that’s only the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;A curse far more deadly looms over them all, one that could bring the world to its knees. With Knight by her side, Lisbeth must seek answers from the most fearsome legend of them all. But the truth they uncover there may end up being their greatest weapon. &lt;br /&gt;Can Lisbeth and Knight rekindle their love in time to save them all? Or will their failure plunge the world into a nightmarish madness? &lt;br /&gt;War of the Chosen is a thrilling, young adult page-turner written by Elizabeth Dunlap!&lt;br /&gt;***--*** &lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in the description, this is a slow build reverse harem paranormal romance. You may not see the harem for several books, but don't fret! It's definitely there! &lt;br /&gt;If slow build isn't your thing, that's completely fine! But if you don't mind waiting a little for it, keep reading!</description>

  <description>**Slow Build Reverse Harem YA Paranormal Romance** &lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for her crimes, Lisbeth awaits the Council’s order of execution. With Knight—the love of her life—dead, their verdict would be a merciful relief from her crippling anguish. &lt;br /&gt;But mercy is not their intent. Instead, Lisbeth is thrust into a position of power and charged with coordinating an alliance between vampires and Lycans. An alliance that has the fanged community in an uproar. &lt;br /&gt;Little do they know, a storm far more deadly is brewing. There have been murmurings of dissension in the ranks between turned vampires and their Born masters. Can Lisbeth quell their threats of an uprising? Or will the blaze of civil war scorch the land? &lt;br /&gt;Child of the Outcast is a must-read, young adult page-turner written by Elizabeth Dunlap! &lt;br /&gt;***--*** &lt;br /&gt;As mentioned in the description, this is a slow build reverse harem paranormal romance.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The conclusion of &lt;i&gt;Heart of the Fae&lt;/i&gt;, where Beauty and the Beast meets Irish Mythology&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartache dogs the steps of Sorcha of Ui Neill. Although she is home with her family, she is unable to shake the memories of her time in Hy-brasil. She heals with a heavy heart, tells stories with melancholy words, and cannot forget the magic of the Otherworld. When an opportunity arises to return to her beloved Fae Prince, she makes a questionable deal. Dark magic, druidic curses, and a witch open a portal and send her tumbling into the middle of a war she must end for the sake of all who dwell in the Otherworld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving the faeries will not be easy when she has become a woman they fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The once banished king battles his way through the Otherworld, freeing the Lesser Fae with each swing of his sword. Each attack turns Eamonn into something far more beastly than before. Geodes multiply and hinder his movements, harden his heart, and crystalize his resolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they face the King of the Seelie Fae and his golden army to end the war that will change the fate of the Otherworld forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/i&gt; meets Irish Mythology in this sweeping retelling of the beloved fairytale....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A plague sweeps across the emerald hills of Uí Néill, leaving a young midwife’s father with months to live. To save her people, Sorcha makes a deal with a dangerous Fae. She must travel across the sea, through merrow and kelpie lands, to find a forgotten king on a crumbling throne. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Born king of the Seelie Fae, Eamonn fought battles unnumbered to uphold honor, duty, and freedom… until his twin brother sank a blade between his shoulders. Crystals grew from the wound, splitting open skin and bone. His people banished him to a cursed isle for his disfigurement, now king of criminals and fools. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the help of brownies, pixies, and will-o’-the-wisps, Sorcha battles to break through his crystalline shell and persuade him to take back his stolen throne.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This determined beauty could come dangerously close to stealing his beastly heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/i&gt; meets Irish Mythology in this retelling of the beloved classic… The first Companion Novel in the &lt;i&gt;Otherworld&lt;/i&gt; Series&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saoirse dreams of land. Her father has other plans, and intends to marry her off as soon as possible. When a ship sinks near her home, she carries the only surviving sailor to a faerie blessed isle and plans her escape. Who better to help her than a man with few scruples and little cares in the world? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manus dreams of the sea. He spent every coin in his pockets to get back on a ship but never expected the vessel to sink. When a merrow saves him, he realizes the chance meeting is an opportunity. She could make him rich and become his good luck charm, so the legends say. Now, he just needs to get off the isle she’s trapped him on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They intend to use each other, but find their souls drawn together bit by bit. Can either leave the isle and the sea without losing their hearts in the bargain?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The highly anticipated sequel to New York Times bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Everless&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jules Ember was raised hearing legends of the ancient magic of the wicked Alchemist and the good Sorceress. But she has just learned the truth: not only are the stories true, but she herself is the Alchemist, and Caro—a woman who single-handedly murdered the Queen and Jules’s first love, Roan, in cold blood—is the Sorceress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole kingdom believes that Jules is responsible for the murders, and a hefty bounty has been placed on her head. And Caro is intent on destroying Jules, who stole her heart twelve lifetimes ago. Jules must delve into the stories that she now recognizes are accounts of her own past. For it is only by piecing together the mysteries of her lives that Jules will be able to save the person who has captured her own heart in this one.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut novel that pulses with humor and empathy and explores the heart's capacity for forgiveness...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zadie Anson and Emma Colley have been best friends since their early twenties, when they first began navigating serious romantic relationships amid the intensity of medical school. Now they're happily married wives and mothers with successful careers--Zadie as a pediatric cardiologist and Emma as a trauma surgeon. Their lives in Charlotte, North Carolina are chaotic but fulfilling, until the return of a former colleague unearths a secret one of them has been harboring for years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As chief resident, Nick Xenokostas was the center of Zadie's life--both professionally and personally--throughout a tragic chain of events in her third year of medical school that she has long since put behind her. Nick's unexpected reappearance during a time of new professional crisis shocks both women into a deeper look at the difficult choices they made at the beginning of their careers. As it becomes evident that Emma must have known more than she revealed about circumstances that nearly derailed both their lives, Zadie starts to question everything she thought she knew about her closest friend.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groomsman and his last-minute guest are about to discover if a fake date can go the distance in a fun and flirty debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to go to a wedding with a guy she gets stuck with in an elevator is something Alexa Monroe wouldn't normally do. But there's something about Drew Nichols that's too hard to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the eve of his ex's wedding festivities, Drew is minus a plus one. Until a power outage strands him with the perfect candidate for a fake girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Alexa and Drew have more fun than they ever thought possible, Drew has to fly back to Los Angeles and his job as a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa heads home to Berkeley, where she's the mayor's chief of staff. Too bad they can't stop thinking about the other... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're just two high-powered professionals on a collision course toward the long distance dating disaster of the century--or closing the gap between what they think they need and what they truly want...</description>

  <description>I thought he'd always be mine, &lt;br /&gt;even when I was forced to say goodbye. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We were never meant to let go, &lt;br /&gt;but it happened anyway. &lt;br /&gt;Too bad I didn’t know someone was waiting to take my place, or I would've held on a lot tighter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two years later, we were exactly where we'd always planned to be. &lt;br /&gt;I'd kept my promise. &lt;br /&gt;He'd forgotten all about his. &lt;br /&gt;Not only had he moved on, but the person he'd moved on with was my best friend, leaving me to begin college with a broken heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I guess this is the part where I’m supposed to tell you some other guy stepped in, repaired my shattered pieces, and made me smile again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This isn't that kind of story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My heart might have been broken, &lt;br /&gt;but it refused to fall out of love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WARNING: this book contains cheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each book in the Gray Springs world can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When a bestselling debut novel from mysterious author J.Colby becomes the literary event of the year, Emiline reads it reluctantly. As an adjunct writing instructor at UC San Diego with her own stalled literary career and a bumpy long-term relationship, Emiline isn’t thrilled to celebrate the accomplishments of a young and gifted writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet from the very first page, Emiline is entranced by the story of Emerson and Jackson, two childhood best friends who fall in love and dream of a better life beyond the long dirt road that winds through their impoverished town in rural Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s because the novel is patterned on Emiline’s own dark and desperate childhood, which means that “J. Colby” must be Jase: the best friend and first love she hasn’t seen in over a decade. Far from being flattered that he wrote the novel from her perspective, Emiline is furious that he co-opted her painful past and took some dramatic creative liberties with the ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way she can put her mind at ease is to find and confront “J. Colby,” but is she prepared to learn the truth behind the fiction?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one believes in them. But soon no one will forget them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1889. The city is on the cusp of industry and power, and the Exposition Universelle has breathed new life into the streets and dredged up ancient secrets. Here, no one keeps tabs on dark truths better than treasure-hunter and wealthy hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie. When the elite, ever-powerful Order of Babel coerces him to help them on a mission, Séverin is offered a treasure that he never imagined: his true inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hunt down the ancient artifact the Order seeks, Séverin calls upon a band of unlikely experts: An engineer with a debt to pay. A historian banished from his home. A dancer with a sinister past. And a brother in arms if not blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they will join Séverin as he explores the dark, glittering heart of Paris. What they find might change the course of history--but only if they can stay alive.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;One night was all it took...&lt;br /&gt;One night to ruin everything I thought I knew.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the outside, I had the perfect lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy fiancé, blossoming career, amazing friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t looking to get married yet, but when William—“Manhattan’s royalty”—charmed his way into my life, I couldn’t deny the security and comfort that overcame me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To society, I was the girl only after his money. I was the party-goer who managed to seduce a man twice my age to have the lifestyle some could only dream of. I was every magazine’s cliché of what a gold-digging whore was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to prove them wrong—that our love was real and that I wasn’t that girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then everything changed. &lt;br /&gt;One wrong decision. One unfaithful night. One haunting reality.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps they were right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The media didn’t see it coming... and neither did I. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a stand alone romance suspense novel with no cliffhanger. HEA depends on who you ask. Recommended for readers 18 and up due to strong language and explicit sexual content.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>At Stonewall Academy, one secret is worth dying for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina Griffin seems to have it all—supermodel looks, edgy confidence, astronomical IQ—so no one is prepared when she climbs onto the roof and leaps four stories onto the concrete steps, suffers massive brain damage, and is wheeled away in a vegetative state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is ready when six hours later, her parents prematurely take her off life support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is aware of the clue she planted in her suicide note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking closure for the death of his high school sweetheart, Jaden and Sabrina’s best friend, Danae, follow a bizarre trail of breadcrumbs to figure out why she jumped. But when the clues begin to link a headmaster’s dark deed, a girl’s self-mutilation, and a stranger who claims to be the real Sabrina Griffin, they realize they’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg of a horrific secret lurking inside the walls of their elite boarding school.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;These Royals will ruin you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Hartley Wright met Easton Royal, her life hasn’t been the same. There are enemies behind every corner and dangers beyond each door. When tragedy strikes and steals her memories, she can’t trust anyone, not even the blue-eyed boy who promises her that everything will be all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because while Hartley’s memory is full of gaps, her instincts tell her Easton is dangerous. She doesn’t know if he’s the snake in the garden or her chance at salvation. The chaos he brings wherever he goes is too much to handle, the intense feelings he evokes are too confusing to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton wants her to remember. Hartley thinks it’s better to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tragedy. Treachery. Trust.&lt;/b&gt; Hartley has to face the facts—in this world, you can’t escape the Royals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Either you live by their rules or you die by them.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>These Royals will ruin you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easton Royal has it all: looks, money, intelligence. His goal in life is to have as much fun as possible. He never thinks about the consequences because he doesn’t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Hartley Wright appears, shaking up his easy life. She’s the one girl who’s said no, despite being attracted to him. Easton can’t figure her out and that makes her all the more irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hartley doesn’t want him. She says he needs to grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rivals. Rules. Regrets. For the first time in Easton’s life, wearing a Royal crown isn’t enough. He’s about to learn that the higher you start, the harder you fall.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows what happens in the end. A mermaid, a prince, a true love’s kiss. But before that young siren’s tale, there were three friends. One feared, one royal, and one already dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since her best friend, Anna, drowned, Evie has been an outcast in her small fishing town. A freak. A curse. A witch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl with an uncanny resemblance to Anna appears offshore and, though the girl denies it, Evie is convinced that her best friend actually survived. That her own magic wasn’t so powerless after all. And, as the two girls catch the eyes—and hearts—of two charming princes, Evie believes that she might finally have a chance at her own happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her new friend has secrets of her own. She can’t stay in Havnestad, or on two legs, unless Evie finds a way to help her. Now Evie will do anything to save her friend’s humanity, along with her prince’s heart—harnessing the power of her magic, her ocean, and her love until she discovers, too late, the truth of her bargain.</description>

  <description>Graham Russell and I weren’t made for one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was driven by emotion; he was apathetic. I dreamed while he lived in nightmares. I cried when he had no tears to shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his frozen heart and my readiness to run, we sometimes shared seconds. Seconds when our eyes locked and we saw each other’s secrets. Seconds when his lips tasted my fears, and I breathed in his pains. Seconds when we both imagined what it would be like to love one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those seconds left us floating, but when reality knocked us sideways, gravity forced us to descend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham Russell wasn’t a man who knew how to love, and I wasn’t a woman who knew how to either. Yet if I had the chance to fall again, I’d fall with him forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if we were destined to crash against solid ground.</description>

  <description>Moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our lives are a collection of moments. Some utterly painful and full of yesterday's hurts. Some beautifully hopeful and full of tomorrow's promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had many moments in my lifetime, moments that changed me, challenged me. Moments that scared me and engulfed me. However, the biggest ones—the most heartbreaking and breathtaking ones—all included him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ten years old when I lost my voice. A piece of me was stolen away, and the only person who could truly hear my silence was Brooks Griffin. He was the light during my dark days, the promise of tomorrow, until tragedy found him. Tragedy that eventually drowned him in a sea of memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of a boy and girl who loved each other, but didn’t love themselves. A story of life and death. Of love and broken promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Book Three in the Elements Series. Complete Standalone. Coming Fall 2016.)</description>

  <description>There once was a boy, and I loved him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan Francis Silverstone was the complete opposite of me. I danced while he stood still. He was quiet, and I was always running my mouth. He struggled to find a smile while I refused to frown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night I saw the darkness that truly lived inside of him, I couldn’t look away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were broken together, yet somehow whole. We were wrong together, but always right. We were the stars that burned across the night sky, searching for a wish, praying for better tomorrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the day I lost him. He threw us away with one hasty decision—a decision that changed us forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There once was a boy, and I loved him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for a few breaths, a few whispers, a few moments, &lt;i&gt; I think he loved me, too. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>*new adult romance*&lt;br /&gt;**explicit scenes and language**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t care what my cousin says; I am not the queen of impossible relationships. I mean, just because my last boyfriend tried to kill me and left a bit of a scar on my neck, then forced me to move across the country and legally change my name to Reese Randall to escape him, does not mean—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oh, who am I kidding? For a freshman in college, I have to have the worst dating track record ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It’s no wonder love is the last thing on my mind when Mason Lowe enters my life. But the chemistry between us is like bam! Our connection defies logic. And he’s just so freaking hot. Being around him makes me feel more alive than I’ve ever felt before. I even like bickering with him. He could be my soul mate...except for one teeny tiny glitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a gigolo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, do I know how to pick them.</description>

  <description>I was warned about Tristan Cole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Stay away from him,” people said.&lt;br /&gt;“He’s cruel.”&lt;br /&gt;“He’s cold.”&lt;br /&gt;“He’s damaged.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to judge a man because of his past. To look at Tristan and see a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I couldn’t do that. I had to accept the wreckage that lived inside of him because it also lived inside of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both empty.&lt;br /&gt;We were both looking for something else. Something more.&lt;br /&gt;We both wanted to put together the shattered pieces of our yesterdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then perhaps we could finally remember how to breathe.</description>

  <description>Princess Lira is siren royalty and the most lethal of them all. With the hearts of seventeen princes in her collection, she is revered across the sea. Until a twist of fate forces her to kill one of her own. To punish her daughter, the Sea Queen transforms Lira into the one thing they loathe most—a human. Robbed of her song, Lira has until the winter solstice to deliver Prince Elian’s heart to the Sea Queen or remain a human forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ocean is the only place Prince Elian calls home, even though he is heir to the most powerful kingdom in the world. Hunting sirens is more than an unsavory hobby—it’s his calling. When he rescues a drowning woman in the ocean, she’s more than what she appears. She promises to help him find the key to destroying all of sirenkind for good—But can he trust her? And just how many deals will Elian have to barter to eliminate mankind’s greatest enemy?</description>

  <description>Colleen Hoover delivers a tour de force novel about a troubled marriage and the one old forgotten promise that might be able to save it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn and Graham’s perfect love is threatened by their imperfect marriage. The memories, mistakes, and secrets that they have built up over the years are now tearing them apart. The one thing that could save them might also be the very thing that pushes their marriage beyond the point of repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Your Perfects&lt;/i&gt; is a profound novel about a damaged couple whose potential future hinges on promises made in the past. This is a heartbreaking page-turner that asks: Can a resounding love with a perfect beginning survive a lifetime between two imperfect people?</description>

  <description>The Lightwoods, the Shadowhunters who run the New York Institute, are expecting a new addition to their family: the orphaned son of their father's friend, Jace Wayland. Alec and Isabelle aren't too sure they want a new brother, and their parents are not assuaging their fears, too occupied with the dark news that Raphael Santiago, second-in-command of the New York vampire clan, has brought from the Shadow Market.</description>

  <description>These Royals will ruin you…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From mortal enemies to unexpected allies, two teenagers try to protect everything that matters most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Harper has met every challenge that life has thrown her way. She’s tough, resilient, and willing to do whatever it takes to defend the people she loves, but the challenge of a long-lost father and a boyfriend whose life is on the line might be too much for even Ella to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has a quick temper and even faster fists. But his tendency to meet every obstacle with violence has finally caught up with him. If he wants to save himself and the girl he loves, he’ll need to rise above his tortured past and tarnished reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one believes Ella can survive the Royals. Everyone is sure Reed will destroy them all.&lt;br /&gt;They may be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything and everyone conspiring to keep them apart, Ella and Reed must find a way to beat the law, save their families, and unravel all the secrets in their Twisted Palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Are you trying to kill us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but we love Ella so much and her adventures with the Royals that we needed to write this third book. You’ll see when you read it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Who’s in this book? And don’t say Ella!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella, the five Royal brothers, and a few more huge surprises.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From wharf fights and school brawls to crumbling lives inside glittery mansions, one guy tries to save himself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE ROYALS WILL RUIN YOU...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has it all—looks, status, money. The girls at his elite prep school line up to date him, the guys want to be him, but Reed never gave a damn about anyone but his family until Ella Harper walked into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started off as burning resentment and the need to make his father’s new ward suffer turned into something else entirely—keep Ella close. Keep Ella safe. But when one foolish mistake drives her out of Reed’s arms and brings chaos to the Royal household, Reed’s entire world begins to fall apart around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella doesn’t want him anymore. She says they’ll only destroy each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Secrets. Betrayal. Enemies. It’s like nothing Reed has ever dealt with before, and if he’s going to win back his princess, he’ll need to prove himself Royally worthy. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Speak, &lt;/i&gt;this extraordinary debut novel “is a poignant book that realistically looks at the lasting effects of trauma on love, relationships, and life” (&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;, starred review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden was always good at being good. Starting high school didn’t change who she was. But the night her brother’s best friend rapes her, Eden’s world capsizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was once simple, is now complex. What Eden once loved—who she once loved—she now hates. What she thought she knew to be true, is now lies. Nothing makes sense anymore, and she knows she’s supposed to tell someone what happened but she can’t. So she buries it instead. And she buries the way she used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in four parts—freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior year—this provocative debut reveals the deep cuts of trauma. But it also demonstrates one young woman’s strength as she navigates the disappointment and unbearable pains of adolescence, of first love and first heartbreak, of friendships broken and rebuilt, all while learning to embrace the power of survival she never knew she had hidden within her heart.</description>

  <description>Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie worries he’ll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself that strong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were biddable. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her, even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a faerie world.</description>

  <description>They say I am a queen.&lt;br /&gt;They say I married a monster. That I did so willingly.&lt;br /&gt;They say he cannot die, that he does not age. That together, we rule a ravaged world.&lt;br /&gt;They say I used to be one of them, but now I am a traitor. &lt;br /&gt;They say many things, all which I cannot remember, but … &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I fear what they say is true.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is what they don’t say, what I see in their eyes—&lt;br /&gt;The king terrifies them. He cannot be stopped. And, most worrisome of all …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He is coming for me.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When their paths first cross, Ben Livingston is a fledgling screenwriter on the brink of success; Tatum Connelly is a struggling actress tending bar in a New York City dive. They fall in love, they marry, they become parents, and they think only of the future. But as the years go by, Tatum’s stardom rises while Ben’s fades. In a marriage that bears the fallout of ambition and fame, Ben and Tatum are at a crossroads. Now all they can do is think back…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life of passion, joy, tragedy, and loss—once shared—becomes one as shifting and unpredictable as a memory. And as they explore the ways love can bend and break, they recount their individual versions of the story, Ben’s moving backward and Tatum’s moving forward, each wondering what they can do now to make it all right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They came to earth—Pestilence, War, Famine, Death—four horsemen riding their screaming steeds, racing to the corners of the world. Four horsemen with the power to destroy all of humanity. They came to earth, and they came to end us all. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Pestilence comes for Sara Burn’s town, one thing is certain: everyone she knows and loves is marked for death. Unless, of course, the angelic-looking horseman is stopped, which is exactly what Sara has in mind when she shoots the unholy beast off his steed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad no one told her Pestilence can’t be killed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the horseman, very much alive and very pissed off, has taken her prisoner, and he’s eager to make her suffer. Only, the longer she’s with him, the more uncertain she is about his true feelings towards her … and hers towards him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, well, Sara might still be able to save the world, but in order to do so, she'll have to sacrifice her heart in the process.</description>

  <description>In a land of perpetual war and wandering, warrior Thalgor not only leads his people in battle, but keeps the hope alive that somebody his displaced tribe can rebuild the kingdom that was lost to the treachery between witches and men. When he captures a beautiful witch, he knows he cannot trust her. But to succeed in his quest to find a new home and prevail over his enemies, he also knows he needs her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erwyn might be a slave and feared for her powers and precognition, but she doesn’t cower when confronted by the feared warrior. Nor does she act as expected. Thalgor’s kindness confuses her. His flashes of humor confound her. And the reaction he ignites in her body creates a longing that she cannot deny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither anticipated falling in love. The stakes are high, but when Thalgor is mortally wounded, Erwyn realizes she must accept help from an unlikely source to save him.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where, two centuries ago, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters’ return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets. The townspeople turn against one another. Penny and Bo suspect each other of hiding secrets. And death comes swiftly to those who cannot resist the call of the sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only Penny sees what others cannot. And she will be forced to choose: save Bo, or save herself.</description>

  <description>They killed my mother.&lt;br /&gt;They took our magic.&lt;br /&gt;They tried to bury us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zélie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers and her growing feelings for an enemy.</description>

  <description>Raised to be a warrior, seventeen-year-old Eelyn fights alongside her Aska clansmen in an ancient rivalry against the Riki clan. Her life is brutal but simple: fight and survive. Until the day she sees the impossible on the battlefield—her brother, fighting with the enemy—the brother she watched die five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with her brother's betrayal, she must survive the winter in the mountains with the Riki, in a village where every neighbor is an enemy, every battle scar possibly one she delivered. But when the Riki village is raided by a ruthless clan thought to be a legend, Eelyn is even more desperate to get back to her beloved family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is given no choice but to trust Fiske, her brother’s friend, who sees her as a threat. They must do the impossible: unite the clans to fight together, or risk being slaughtered one by one. Driven by a love for her clan and her growing love for Fiske, Eelyn must confront her own definition of loyalty and family while daring to put her faith in the people she’s spent her life hating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Wonder Woman, part &lt;i&gt;Vikings&lt;/i&gt;—and all heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alice’s life on the road, always a step ahead of the uncanny bad luck biting at their heels. But when Alice’s grandmother, the reclusive author of a cult-classic book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate, the Hazel Wood, Alice learns how bad her luck can really get: Her mother is stolen away―by a figure who claims to come from the Hinterland, the cruel supernatural world where her grandmother's stories are set. Alice's only lead is the message her mother left behind: “Stay away from the Hazel Wood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice has long steered clear of her grandmother’s cultish fans. But now she has no choice but to ally with classmate Ellery Finch, a Hinterland superfan who may have his own reasons for wanting to help her. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmother's tales began―and where she might find out how her own story went so wrong.</description>

  <description>Perfect for fans of Tahereh Mafi’s New York Times bestselling &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; trilogy, this book collects her two companion novellas, &lt;i&gt;Fracture Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt;, in print for the first time ever. It also features an exclusive look into Juliette’s journal and a preview of Ignite Me, the hotly anticipated final novel of the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt; tells the events between &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt; from Warner’s point of view. Even though Juliette shot him in order to escape, Warner can’t stop thinking about her—and he’ll do anything to get her back. But when the Supreme Commander of The Reestablishment arrives, he has much different plans for Juliette. Plans Warner cannot allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fracture Me&lt;/i&gt; is told from Adam’s perspective and bridges the gap between &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignite Me&lt;/i&gt;. As the Omega Point rebels prepare to fight the Sector 45 soldiers, Adam's more focused on the safety of Juliette, Kenji, and his brother. The Reestablishment will do anything to crush the resistance . . . including killing everyone Adam cares about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; series is perfect for fans who crave action-packed young adult novels with tantalizing romance like &lt;i&gt;Divergent&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;. This captivating story, which combines the best of dystopian and paranormal, was praised as “a thrilling, high-stakes saga of self-discovery and forbidden love” by Ransom Riggs, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>The thrilling second installment in New York Times bestselling author Tahereh Mafi’s Shatter Me series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have taken Juliette a single touch to kill Warner. But his mysterious immunity to her deadly power has left her shaken, wondering why her ultimate defense mechanism failed against the person she most needs protection from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and Adam were able to escape Warner’s clutches and join up with a group of rebels, many of whom have powers of their own. Juliette will finally be able to actively fight against The Reestablishment and try to fix her broken world. And perhaps these new allies can help her shed light on the secret behind Adam’s—and Warner’s—immunity to her killer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette’s world is packed with high-stakes action and tantalizing romance, perfect for fans of the Red Queen series by Victoria Aveyard and the Darkest Minds trilogy by Alexandra Bracken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ransom Riggs, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, raved: "A thrilling, high-stakes saga of self-discovery and forbidden love, the Shatter Me series is a must-read for fans of dystopian young-adult literature—or any literature!"</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet Tess, a brave new heroine from beloved epic fantasy author Rachel Hartman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the medieval kingdom of Goredd, women are expected to be ladies, men are their protectors, and dragons get to be whomever they want. Tess, stubbornly, is a troublemaker. You can’t make a scene at your sister’s wedding and break a relative’s nose with one punch (no matter how pompous he is) and not suffer the consequences. As her family plans to send her to a nunnery, Tess yanks on her boots and sets out on a journey across the Southlands, alone and pretending to be a boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Tess is headed is a mystery, even to her. So when she runs into an old friend, it’s a stroke of luck. This friend is a quigutl—a subspecies of dragon—who gives her both a purpose and protection on the road. But Tess is guarding a troubling secret. Her tumultuous past is a heavy burden to carry, and the memories she’s tried to forget threaten to expose her to the world in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the fascinating world she created in the award-winning and New York Times bestselling &lt;i&gt;Seraphina&lt;/i&gt;, Rachel Hartman introduces readers to a new character and a new quest, pushing the boundaries of genre once again in this wholly original fantasy.</description>

  <description>A Jane Austen-inspired YA tale about a sixteen-year-old girl who finds a magical book—and discovers that anything she writes inside it comes true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma is used to things going her way. Her father is headmaster of her prestigious boarding school, her friends take her advice as gospel, and she's convinced that a relationship with her long-time crush is on the horizon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, Emma hasn't seen anything yet. When she finds an old book in an abandoned library, things really start going Emma's way: anything she writes in the book comes true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the power of the book is not without consequences, and Emma soon realizes that she isn't the only one who knows about it. Someone is determined to take it from her—and they'll stop at nothing to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new boy in school—the arrogant, aloof, and irritatingly handsome Darcy de Winter—becomes Emma's unlikely ally as secrets are revealed and danger creeps ever closer.</description>

  <description>The gripping fifth installment in the New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestselling Shatter Me series. Will Juliette’s broken heart make her vulnerable to the strengthening darkness within her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette’s short tenure as the supreme commander of North America has been an utter disaster. When the children of the other world leaders show up on her doorstep, she wants nothing more than to turn to Warner for support and guidance. But he shatters her heart when he reveals that he’s been keeping secrets about her family and her identity from her—secrets that change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette is devastated, and the darkness that’s always dwelled within her threatens to consume her. An explosive encounter with unexpected visitors might be enough to push her over the edge.</description>

Will she be able to control the power she wields and use it for good?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The stunningly original, must-read fantasy of 2018 follows two fiercely independent young women, centuries apart, who hold the power to save their world...or doom it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When assassins ambush her best friend, Rielle Dardenne risks everything to save him, exposing herself as one of a pair of prophesied queens: a queen of light, and a queen of blood. To prove she is the Sun Queen, Rielle must endure seven elemental magic trials. If she fails, she will be executed...unless the trials kill her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thousand years later, the legend of Queen Rielle is a fairy tale to Eliana Ferracora. A bounty hunter for the Undying Empire, Eliana believes herself untouchable--until her mother vanishes. To find her, Eliana joins a rebel captain and discovers that the evil at the empire's heart is more terrible than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rielle and Eliana fight in a cosmic war that spans millennia, their stories intersect, and the shocking connections between them ultimately determine the fate of their world--and of each other.</description>

  <description>You may think you know the story. After a miserable childhood, penniless orphan Jane Eyre embarks on a new life as a governess at Thornfield Hall. There, she meets one dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite their significant age gap (!) and his uneven temper (!!), they fall in love—and, Reader, she marries him. (!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for an adventure of Gothic proportions, in which all is not as it seems, a certain gentleman is hiding more than skeletons in his closets, and one orphan Jane Eyre, aspiring author Charlotte Brontë, and supernatural investigator Alexander Blackwood are about to be drawn together on the most epic ghost hunt this side of Wuthering Heights.</description>

  <description>One week. That's all Jessie said. A one-week break to get some perspective before graduation, before she and her boyfriend, Chris, would have to make all the big, scary decisions about their future--decisions they had been fighting about for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Chris vanishes. The police think he's run away, but Jessie doesn't believe it. Chris is popular and good-looking, about to head off to college on a full-ride baseball scholarship. And he disappeared while going for a run along the river--the same place where some boys from the rival high school beat him up just three weeks ago. Chris is one of the only black kids in a depressed paper mill town, and Jessie is terrified of what might have happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the police are spurred to reluctant action, Jessie speaks up about the harassment Chris kept quiet about and the danger he could be in. But there are people in Jessie's town who don't like the story she tells, who are infuriated by the idea that a boy like Chris would be a target of violence. They smear Chris’s character and Jessie begins receiving frightening threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Friday since they started dating, Chris has written Jessie a love letter. Now Jessie is writing Chris a letter of her own to tell him everything that’s happening while he’s gone. As Jessie searches for answers, she must face her fears, her guilt, and a past more complicated than she would like to admit.</description>
