  <description>Six years ago, the woman Carter Blake loved disappeared and told him not to ever look for her. For six long years, he kept that promise. She was a woman on the run — a woman with a secret many would kill for. It was better that she stay hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now someone else is looking for her. Trenton Gage is a hitman with a talent for finding people — dead or alive. And his next job is to track down the woman Carter Blake once loved, a woman on the run. With both men hunting the same person, the question is: Who will find her first? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A riveting new thriller from Mason Cross, ideal for readers of David Baldacci, Linwood Barclay, and Mark Billingham. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An urgent plan to confront climate change, transform the American economy, and create a green post-fossil fuel culture.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new vision for America's future is quickly gaining momentum. Facing a global emergency, a younger generation is spearheading a national conversation around a Green New Deal and setting the agenda for a bold political movement with the potential to revolutionize society. Millennials, the largest voting bloc in the country, are now leading on the issue of climate change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Green New Deal has become a lightning rod in the political sphere, there is a parallel movement emerging within the business community that will shake the very foundation of the global economy in coming years. Key sectors of the economy are fast-decoupling from fossil fuels in favor of ever cheaper solar and wind energies and the new business opportunities and employment that accompany them. New studies are sounding the alarm that trillions of dollars in stranded fossil fuel assets could create a carbon bubble likely to burst by 2028, causing the collapse of the fossil fuel civilization. The marketplace is speaking, and governments will need to adapt if they are to survive and prosper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Green New Deal&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and renowned economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin delivers the political narrative and economic plan for the Green New Deal that we need at this critical moment in history. The concurrence of a stranded fossil fuel assets bubble and a green political vision opens up the possibility of a massive shift to a post-carbon ecological era, in time to prevent a temperature rise that will tip us over the edge into runaway climate change. With twenty-five years of experience implementing Green New Deal-style transitions for both the European Union and the People's Republic of China, Rifkin offers his vision for how to transform the global economy and save life on Earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut novel told with humor, intelligence, and heart, a “funny but insightful look at teachers in the workplace…reminiscent of the TV show &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; but set in an urban high school” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;), perfect for fans of Tom Perrotta and Laurie Gelman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roxanna Elden’s “laugh-out-loud funny satire” (&lt;i&gt;Forbes&lt;/i&gt;) is a brilliantly entertaining and moving look at our education system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each new school year brings familiar challenges to Brae Hill Valley, a struggling high school in one the biggest cities in Texas. But the teachers also face plenty of personal challenges and this year, they may finally spill over into the classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English teacher Lena Wright, a spoken-word poet, can never seem to truly connect with her students. Hernan D. Hernandez is confident in front of his biology classes, but tongue-tied around the woman he most wants to impress. Down the hall, math teacher Maybelline Galang focuses on the numbers as she struggles to parent her daughter, while Coach Ray hustles his troubled football team toward another winning season. Recording it all is idealistic second-year history teacher Kaytee Mahoney, whose anonymous blog gains new readers by the day as it drifts ever further from her in-class reality. And this year, a new superintendent is determined to leave his own mark on the school—even if that means shutting the whole place down.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;"You're the Ways. The Gamekeepers. You must know."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;But the problem is they don't. After being thrust into a life of magic, Anna, Charlie, and Emz have lost their way. They don't know where they're supposed to be, what they're supposed to be doing, or who they're supposed to trust. Right now, they're just trying to get by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling to accept their powers, the sisters are doing all they can to lead a normal life, but with the anniversary of Halloween looming everyone is on edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a stranger arrives on their doorstep, they know a different magic is in the air. The Ways realise they must embrace their Strengths if they have any hope of doing the job Hettie left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With dark magic crackling through the town and leaking into the lives of people they love, the Ways must find themselves before they lose everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the Amazon Charts bestselling author of One Small Sacrifice, a gripping mystery about a sinister murder that everyone wants to stay buried—except one dogged NYPD detective.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo Greaver is a model of success. Young and ambitious, she’s built a thriving beauty business from nothing. But she has secrets she’ll do anything to keep buried. When her blackmailer offers to meet, Jo expects to pay him off—but gets a bullet instead. Bleeding and in shock, Jo flees with no one to turn to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When NYPD detective Sheryn Sterling and her partner, Rafael Mendoza, find Andray Baxter murdered in his own home—shot through the heart—everything points to Jo as the killer. Her blood is at the scene, and so are disturbing photos of her taken as a young teen. But Sheryn has doubts. Was the kindhearted Andray really a criminal? Why did he repeatedly report finding spyware in his apartment? Was there something shady about Jo’s sister dying a year earlier?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something’s not right, and it’s up to Sheryn to piece together the sinister puzzle, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;‘LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! After months of struggling to find another author I love as much as I love Sophie Kinsella I have found her! Could not put this book down. Ended up sneaking a few lines in here and there, even in a lift whilst shopping!... Fab read, funny and LOL.’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gemma&lt;/b&gt; didn’t expect her life to look like this. She’s still living with her mother, who steals her leggings and tells her off for leaving crumbs in the butter. After twenty failed interviews she thought she’d bagged her dream job as a journalist – except it turns out to be writing articles about cats that look like George Clooney. Luckily she has her wonderful boyfriend, &lt;b&gt;Jack&lt;/b&gt;, to help her forget just how rubbish things are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Jack dumps her out of the blue. With nothing but her childhood teddy bear, Stanley, and a whole heap of heartbreak, Gemma resolves to turn things around. She throws herself into her new job and soon she’s hanging out with cheeky, golden-haired hunk &lt;b&gt;Charlie&lt;/b&gt;, eating in swanky restaurants and sipping trendy cocktails – and her old life seems like a distant memory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it’s not long until her shiny new world starts to lose its sparkle – and Gemma misses the days of wearing battered pink converse and eating peanut butter on toast in bed. Then Jack turns up, backpack in tow, and things starts to go wrong with Charlie. ‘Out with the old, in with the new’, the saying goes. But what happens if neither one is quite right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This laugh-out-loud romantic comedy is for anyone who’s ever cried their eyes out to love songs after a break-up or accidentally drunk-texted their ex. Fans of Sophie Kinsella and Lindsey Kelk will love this unmissable read which is all about falling in love with the most important person: yourself!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;This book was previously published as the &lt;i&gt;Truth About Gemma Grey.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;b&gt;Readers absolutely love &lt;i&gt;Out with the Ex, In with the New&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Oh my goodness,&lt;/b&gt; I enjoyed this book!... &lt;b&gt;I highly recommend it&lt;/b&gt;!’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Funny and addictive!&lt;/b&gt; Great read, &lt;b&gt;glued to it&lt;/b&gt;! Looking forward to the next one!’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Perfect!&lt;/b&gt;... Lots of fun, lovable and well-drawn characters, &lt;b&gt;witty&lt;/b&gt; and pacy. &lt;b&gt;Read it in one sitting and now going to read the Sophie Ranald back-catalogue!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘What a great read!&lt;/b&gt; Funny and timely.’ Tracy Bloom &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I really really enjoyed this book&lt;/b&gt;… A really enjoyable read with lots of messages about &lt;b&gt;loving who you are&lt;/b&gt; and not needing the approval of others. It’s a story about &lt;b&gt;finding your own way&lt;/b&gt; and realising that sometimes dreams need to change and grow. While there's fun, comedy and romance there's also so much more. There's a deeper story going on. &lt;b&gt;Well done Sophie Ranald!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Such fun!&lt;/b&gt;... It gave me &lt;b&gt;just what I was looking for&lt;/b&gt; – &lt;b&gt;a huge hug!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads Reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘This is &lt;b&gt;chick lit at its best!&lt;/b&gt;... &lt;b&gt;Just read it for yourself!!!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads Reviewer</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Discover the inspiring spiritual legacy of Queen Elizabeth II, the longest reigning monarch in British history. Sharing a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the life of this notoriously private monarch, &lt;em&gt;The Faith of Queen Elizabeth&lt;/em&gt; features intimate stories and inspiring reflections on the personal faith behind the Crown. With testimonies from historic figures such as Winston Churchill, Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, and Margaret Thatcher, this magnificent tribute explores the faith of the world's most famous Queen - and the King she serves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Icon, matriarch, reformer, and the longest-reigning monarch in British history - Queen Elizabeth II intrigues millions around the world with her royal heritage, inspirational character, and profound faith, especially as depicted in award-winning films such as &lt;em&gt;The Queen&lt;/em&gt; and the wildly popular Netflix series &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a reign that bridges the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, Queen Elizabeth has become the definition of stability, faithfulness, and dignity. Fearlessly, she led her country into the modern age with a balance of historical tradition and entrepreneurial initiative, public service and private devotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearing seven decades on the throne, the Queen has faced many personal and public storms - an early and surprising ascension to the throne, the dissolution of the British Empire, political upheavals, international crises, national tragedies, family deaths, and the tabloid travails of her children and grandchildren. But throughout all her trials and triumphs, Her Majesty credits her personal faith in Jesus Christ as the steadying anchor to her life and reign. In this spiritual biography, Dudley Delffs unpacks the secret behind Her Majesty's personal devotion and public service, giving you a fuller, richer picture of the woman who’s led a nation with unwavering faith and resolve.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Former Olympic figure skater and self-professed America's Sweetheart Adam Rippon shares his underdog journey from beautiful mess to outrageous success in this hilarious, big-hearted memoir that the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;calls "comedic gold."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mom probably told you it's what on the inside that counts. Well, then she was never a competitive figure skater. Olympic medalist Adam Rippon has been making it pretty for the judges even when, just below the surface, everything was an absolute mess. From traveling to practices on the Greyhound bus next to ex convicts to being so poor he could only afford to eat the free apples at his gym, Rippon got through the toughest times with a smile on his face, a glint in his eye, and quip ready for anyone listening. &lt;i&gt;Beautiful on the Outside&lt;/i&gt; looks at his journey from a homeschooled kid in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to a self-professed American sweetheart on the world stage and all the disasters and self-delusions it took to get him there. Yeah, it may be what's on the inside that counts, but life is so much better when it's beautiful on the outside.</description>

  <description>Similar to the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Sociopath Next Door &lt;/i&gt;comes a unique look at the psychopaths among us and how our society--from businesses and governments to religions--encourages and rewards psychopathic behavior, and what average citizens can do to survive and thrive when we must live with, learn from, or be led by sociopaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychiatrists estimate that 1 percent of the adult population are psychopaths. That's about two million Americans. And they are our bosses, our politicians, our priests, and our neighbors. And they are running our economy and our lives.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every day in the news we hear about people in positions of power doing deplorable things--in business, politics, and government, from sexual harassment to polluting the environment to covering up crimes. And it's no wonder considering a small percentage of people wield a large amount of power, and that these very same people fit the definition of a "psychopath."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A highly engaging and gripping read, Cameron Reilly's book adds to our growing understanding of sociopaths with a detailed analysis of how our society encourages and rewards psychopathic tendencies, and how, because of this, psychopaths the world over have risen to power. Using historical references to pop culture examples, Reilly offers a field guide to psychopaths--how to spot them and how to outmaneuver them so you can keep your sanity intact. This is the first-of-its-kind book to examine the shocking evidence and then suggest practical solutions for saving us all. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Agatha-award winning author of&lt;i&gt; Quiet Neighbors &lt;/i&gt;comes a twisty, fascinating standalone that begs the question: how well can we ever know the people around us? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Finn and Paddy decide to move from their home in the city to the small town of Simmerton, it feels like everything has finally fallen into place. Paddy's been made partner at the law firm in town, and Finn has found full-time work as the deacon. Paddy's new boss has even offered them the use of a gate house on his property. Finn feels like this must be a fairy tale. Paddy thinks they've won the lottery. Either way, they agree: it's perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only days after moving into the gate house, Finn begins to have doubts. She keeps hearing strange sounds, and the thicket of trees make her feel claustrophobic rather than safe. When she and Paddy discover the bloody bodies of Paddy's boss and his wife, the fairytale has officially ended. A strange email—supposedly sent from the dead man—makes it clear: this was murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paddy and Finn's dream of a new life quickly turns into a nightmare as the plot thickens and the tension grows. With strange neighbors and a haunting setting, Catriona McPherson once again weaves a page-turning tale of suspense.</description>

  <description>It's a chilling fact that suicide is today's number two cause of death for young people. Arcadia is a story about suicide, but it's also a story about life. This is the fascinating tale of a suicidal teen named Jacob Harper, told vividly and unforgettably by his loving father. It's a journey through Jacob's private world of torment, disappointment, fear, humor, hope, love, and finally, success. Arcadia is as relentlessly personal as it is entertaining, and as honest as it is encouraging.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;It's not sleigh bells that are ringing this Christmas.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;As the holidays approach, Detective Lindsay Boxer and her friends in the Women's Murder Club have much to celebrate. Crime is down. The medical examiner's office is quiet. Even the courts are showing some Christmas spirit. And the news cycle is so slow that journalist Cindy Thomas is on assignment to tell a story about the true meaning of the season for San Francisco.&lt;p&gt;Then a fearsome criminal known only as "Loman" seizes control of the headlines. He is planning a deadly surprise for Christmas morning. And he has commissioned dozens of criminal colleagues to take actions that will mask his plans. All that Lindsay and the SFPD can figure out is that Loman's greed -- for riches, for bloodshed, for attention -- is limitless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving crimes never happens on schedule, but as this criminal mastermind unleashes credible threats by the hour, the month of December is upended for the Women's Murder Club. Avoiding tragedy is the only holiday miracle they seek.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author Robin Cook takes on the ripped-from-the-headlines topic of using genealogical DNA database tracking to catch a killer in this unforgettable new medical thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the body of twenty-nine-year-old social worker Gloria Montoya, seven weeks pregnant with her first child, shows up on Chief New York City Medical Examiner Laurie Montgomery's autopsy table, she's baffled to find no apparent causes of death. With no clues to go on, Laurie enlists the help of Dr. Tricia Albanese, a forensic pathology resident with a background in genetic science, to help her trace the identity of the unborn baby's father using DNA from the mother and child. But when Tricia is found dead in her apartment in a manner strikingly similar to Gloria's death, Laurie realizes she might have two linked homicides on her hands...and now it's up to her, with the help of her husband, ME Jack Stapleton, to continue the tracking work Tricia had begun before a killer can strike again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gripping new thriller about a man's quest for the daughter no one else believes is still alive, from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Chalk Man&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Hiding Place&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving home one night, stuck behind a rusty old car, Gabe sees a little girl's face appear in the rear window. She mouths one word: 'Daddy.' It's his five-year-old daughter, Izzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He never sees her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later, Gabe spends his days and nights travelling up and down the motorway, searching for the car that took his daughter, refusing to give up hope, even though most people believe that Izzy is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fran and her daughter, Alice, also put in a lot of miles on the motorway. Not searching. But running. Trying to keep one step ahead of the people who want to hurt them. Because Fran knows the truth. She knows what really happened to Gabe's daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the car that Gabe saw driving away that night is found, in a lake, with a body inside and Gabe is forced to confront events, not just from the night his daughter disappeared, but from far deeper in his past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His search leads him to a group called The Other People.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have lost a loved one, The Other People&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;want to help. Because they know what loss is like. They know what pain is like. They know what death is like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem . . . they want other people to know it too.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Princes have pomp and glory—not crushes on commoners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing gets the tongues of London’s high society wagging like a good scandal. And when the personal secretary of the visiting Prince Sebastian of Alucia is found murdered, it’s all anyone can talk about, including Eliza Tricklebank. Her unapologetic gossip gazette has benefited from an anonymous tip about the crime, prompting Sebastian to take an interest in playing detective—and an even greater interest in Eliza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a trade deal on the line and mounting pressure to secure a noble bride, there’s nothing more salacious than a prince dallying with a commoner. Sebastian finds Eliza’s contrary manner as frustrating as it is seductive, but they’ll have to work together if they’re going to catch the culprit. And when things heat up behind closed doors, it’s the prince who’ll have to decide what comes first—his country or his heart.</description>

  <description>To stop a terrorist threat, Gibson Vaughn must trust a man who can’t be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Marine, brilliant hacker, and wanted fugitive Gibson Vaughn is off the grid in the Caymans. Until the ice-cold assassin Tinsley draws him out of the shadows. Complying with the man who murdered his father and left Gibson for dead? In the war against terror, never say never.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when half a million lives are at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tinsley’s in possession of a heavily encrypted thumb drive. But the details of the plot—the motive, the targets, and the day of execution—are a mystery. The one certainty is that a tenuous truce must be made. After joining forces with Tinsley, Gibson and his team have their mission: access the drive and abort a massacre in the making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far can Gibson really trust Tinsley? Time will tell. Right now they’re both running out of it as they race across Europe to find an elusive cyber-psycho behind the mother of all malware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever said to keep your friends close but your enemies closer never meant it like this.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Boughs bent, limbs sprang. Havoc Wood had never seemed so alive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a toxic Halloween wreaked havoc on the Wood, the Way sisters are left shaken. Thinking they had gained some control over their powers, now they aren’t sure they’re cut out to be the Gamekeepers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sisters are scared, insecure, and in no position to handle the Old Magic hovering in every corner of Woodcastle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ancient and electric, this new foe is always one step ahead, and The Ways must finally harness their Strengths… or risk losing one of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this third instalment of The Witch Ways series, bets are hedged, bargains are made, magic is borrowed, and debts must be paid.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WHAT BRINGS FAMILY TOGETHER CAN ALSO PULL IT APART&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JJ, Spenser, Charlie and Philip, the four adult sons of retired Senator John Bright, dutifully head with their partners to the lake house for their annual family reunion. The Brights are the picture of perfectness, a family of outsize pride—fun, attractive, competitive and a bit terrible… They have everything they need, except the ability to see themselves clearly. This year the senator has agreed to let a producer film them for a documentary. Naturally, they let their guard down—each adrift in his own way. Petty jealousies surface amid the joys of summer. Philip, the youngest and least like his siblings, announces an unconventional decision and earns the ribbing—or is it scorn—of his brothers. The senator toys with another political run. But not everyone wants in this time. So one by one, family secrets start to come out…and keep coming. It becomes apparent that, despite their affection for one another, it is time for this big, dysfunctional family to redefine what it means to be a Bright.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Badly scarred after the accident that killed her husband, Camilla Brown locks herself away from the world.  Her only friendships are online, where everyone lives picture-perfect lives. &lt;br /&gt;In private Camilla can follow anyone she likes. And Camilla likes a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially her old school friend Valerie Hutchens.  Camilla is obsessed with Valerie’s posts, her sickening joy for life, her horribly beautiful face.  But then Camilla spots something strange in one of Valerie’s posts – a man’s face looking through her window, watching, waiting…&lt;br /&gt;And then Valerie goes missing…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Meet Duffy, an old curmudgeon who lives in an assisted living home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Josie, a desperate young woman who climbs through his window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they’re going to learn it’s never too late—or too early—to change your ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Duffy Sinclair, life boils down to one simple thing: maintaining his residence at the idyllic Centennial Assisted Living. Without it, he’s destined for the roach-infested nursing home down the road—and after wasting the first eighty-eight years of his life, he refuses to waste away for the rest. So, he keeps his shenanigans to the bare minimum with the help of his straight-laced best friend and roommate, Carl Upton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Carl’s granddaughter Josie climbs through their bedroom window with booze on her breath and a black eye, Duffy’s faced with trouble that’s sticking around and hard to hide—from Centennial’s management and Josie’s toxic boyfriend. Before he knows it, he’s running a covert operation that includes hitchhiking and barhopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He might as well write himself a one-way ticket to the nursing home…or the morgue. Yet Duffy’s all in. Because thanks to an unlikely friendship that becomes fast family—his life doesn’t boil down the same anymore. Not when he finally has a chance to leave a legacy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a funny, insightful, and life-affirming debut, Brooke Fossey delivers an unflinching look at growing old, living large, and loving big, as told by a wise-cracking man who didn’t see any of it coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A woman’s journey through tragedy leads to the discovery of love in a novel about hope and survival by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Catherine Bybee.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a wildfire nearly destroys Parker Sinclair’s family home, it’s just one more disaster to add to her mountain of stress. For the past two years, she has shouldered the responsibility of raising her younger brother and sister after their parents’ untimely deaths. Forced to leave college for a crappy job that barely pays the bills, Parker manages her family property, which consumes every aspect of her life. Now winter is coming and the forecast isn’t spreading sunshine on the dark cloud over her head. The last thing Parker needs is a mudslide destroying everything she has worked so hard to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colin Hudson’s job as a public works supervisor is to protect Parker’s property and neighborhood from further damage. But it’s a little hard when the owner of the land is a control freak who tries to do everything herself. The hardworking, attractive young woman is far from the “hot mess” she claims to be. In fact, her tight grip of control is one of the things that attract him the most. It’s also the hardest to crack. Now Colin’s working overtime to help Parker open up her heart, trust him, and let him in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Parker and Colin work together to keep her home and neighborhood safe, they may be in for another disaster. Or they may just realize that sometimes it takes destruction to create something new.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;With family tensions intensifying in Tinker's Cove, part-time reporter Lucy Stone could really use some time off the grid--but disconnecting from reality comes at a deadly price . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy doesn't know what to expect as she arrives on a private Maine island owned by eccentric billionaire Scott Newman, only that the exclusive experience should make for a very intriguing feature story. An avid environmentalist, Scott has stripped the getaway of modern conveniences in favor of an extreme eco-friendly lifestyle. A trip to Holiday Island is like traveling back to the nineteenth century--much to the dismay of the island's other residents . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Lucy can get the full scoop on Scott, she is horrified to find one of his daughters dead at the bottom of a seaside cliff. Stuck on a clammy island with murder suspects aplenty, Lucy must tap into the limited resources around her to outwit a cold-blooded killer--before it's lights out for her next!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government’s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, &lt;i&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/i&gt; is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, &lt;i&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; and bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Last Days of Night&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;: a jury on a murder trial is deadlocked when a young woman manages to turn the tide to acquit; now, a decade later, she must face the consequences when a fellow juror is killed and she is the prime suspect.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the most sensational case of the decade. Fifteen-year-old Jessica Silver, heiress to a billion-dollar real estate fortune, vanishes on her way home from school. Her teacher Bobby Nock is the prime suspect after illicit text messages are discovered between them--and Jessica's blood is found in his car. The subsequent trial taps straight into America's most pressing preoccupations: race, class, sex, law enforcement, and the lurid sins of the rich and famous. It's an open and shut case for the prosecution, and a quick conviction seems all but guaranteed. Until Maya Seale, a young woman on the jury, convinced of Nock's innocence, persuades the rest of the jurors to return the verdict of not guilty, a controversial decision that will change all of their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward ten years. A true-crime docuseries reassembles the jurors, with particular focus on Maya, now a defense attorney herself. When one of the jurors is found dead in Maya's hotel room, all evidence points to her as the killer. Now, she must prove her own innocence--by getting to the bottom of a case that is far from closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the present-day murder investigation weaves together with the story of what really happened during their deliberation, told by each of the jurors in turn, the secrets they have all been keeping threaten to come out--with drastic consequences for all involved.</description>

  <description>By the time she was in her late twenties, Tara Schuster was a sought-after TV executive who had worked with Jon Stewart and launched &lt;i&gt;Key &amp;amp; Peele&lt;/i&gt; to viral superstardom. By all appearances, she had mastered being a grown-up. But beneath that veneer of success, she was a chronically anxious, self-medicating mess. No one knew that her road to adulthood had been paved with depression, anxiety, and shame, owing in large part to her minimally parented upbringing. She realized she'd hit rock bottom when she drunk-dialed her therapist pleading for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Buy Yourself the F*cking Lilies&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Tara's path to re-parenting herself and becoming a "ninja of self-love." This is the book Tara wished someone had given her and it is the book many of us desperately need: a candid, funny, practical guide to growing up and learning to love yourself in a non-throw-up-in-your-mouth-it's-so-cheesy way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Join the millions who have fallen in love with &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Carolyn Brown in her landmark hundredth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of her rope, single mom Lily Anderson is determined to move her rebellious children in the right direction. That means taking away their cell phones, tablets, and computers—at least temporarily—and moving to the house where Lily grew up in the rural town of Comfort, Texas. But Lily has a bigger challenge than two sulking teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house comes with Mack Cooper, high school teacher and handsome longtime renter. The arrangement: just housemates. But Mack’s devoted attention to the kids starts to warm Lily’s resistant heart. Then Lily finds an old leather-bound book in which five generations of her female ancestors shared their struggles and dreams. To Lily, it’s a bracing reminder about the importance of family…and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it’s time for Lily to add an adventurous new chapter to the cherished family journal—by embracing a fresh start and taking a chance on a man who could make her house a home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In this luminous novel about romance and illusion--and what's left of love when they're stripped away--an American Anglophile is drawn into the lives of a disintegrating aristocratic family. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sudden death of her husband, Annie Devereaux flees to England, site of the nostalgic fantasies her father spun for her before he deserted the family. A chance encounter in London leads Annie to cancel her return to New York and move in with Julian, the disaffected, moody son of Helena Denby, a famous British geneticist. As their relationship progresses, Annie meets Julian's sisters Isabel and Sasha, each of them fragile in her own way, and becomes infatuated with visions of their idyllic childhood in England's West Country. But the more she uncovers about Julian's past, the more he explodes into rage and violence. Finally tearing herself away, Annie winds up adrift in London, rescued from her loneliness only when she and Isabel form an unexpected bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly, with Isabel as her reluctant guide, Annie learns of the emotional devastation that Helena's warped arrogance, her monstrous will to dominate, inflicted on her children. The family who once embodied Annie's idealized conception of England is actually caught in a nightmare of betrayal and guilt that spirals inexorably into tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Are You Sleeping&lt;/i&gt;—soon to be an Apple TV series—comes a cautionary tale of oversharing in the social media age for fans of Jessica Knoll and Caroline Kepnes’s &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone wants new followers…until they follow you home.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey Miller has an enviable new job at the Smithsonian, a body by reformer Pilates, an apartment door with a broken lock, and hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers to bear witness to it all. Having just moved to Washington, DC, Audrey busies herself impressing her new boss, interacting with her online fan base, and staving off a creepy upstairs neighbor with the help of the only two people she knows in town: an ex-boyfriend she can’t stay away from and a sorority sister with a high-powered job and a mysterious past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Audrey’s faulty door may be the least of her security concerns. Unbeknownst to her, her move has brought her within striking distance of someone who’s obsessively followed her social media presence for years—from her first WordPress blog to her most recent Instagram Story. No longer content to simply follow her carefully curated life from a distance, he consults the dark web for advice on how to make Audrey his and his alone. In his quest to win her heart, nothing is off-limits—and nothing is private.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With “compelling, suspenseful” (Liz Nugent) prose, Kathleen Barber’s electrifying new thriller will have you scrambling to cover your webcam and digital footprints.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;At an elite private school in Massachusetts, a wide circle of lives will be forever changed by a devastating series of events in Danielle Steel’s riveting new novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saint Ambrose Prep is a place where the wealthy send their children for the best possible education, with teachers and administrators from the Ivy League, and graduates who become future lawyers, politicians, filmmakers, and CEOs. Traditionally a boys-only school, Saint Ambrose has just enrolled one hundred and forty female students for the first time. Even though most of the kids on the campus have all the privilege in the world, some are struggling, wounded by their parents’ bitter divorces, dealing with insecurity and loneliness. In such a heightened environment, even the smallest spark can become a raging fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day after the school’s annual Halloween event, a student lies in the hospital, her system poisoned by dangerous levels of alcohol. Everyone in this sheltered community—parents, teachers, students, police, and the media—are left trying to figure out what actually happened. Only the handful of students who were there when she was attacked truly know the answers and they have vowed to keep one another’s secrets. As details from the evening emerge, powerful families are forced to hire attorneys and less powerful families watch helplessly. Parents’ marriages are jeopardized, and students’ futures are impacted. No one at Saint Ambrose can escape the fallout of a life-altering event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compelling novel, Danielle Steel illuminates the dark side of one drunken night, with its tragic consequences, from every possible point of view. As the drama unfolds, the characters will reach a crossroads where they must choose between truth and lies, between what is easy and what is right, and find the moral compass they will need for the rest of their lives.</description>

  <description>The predator becomes the prey in the newest thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling series featuring homicide detective Eve Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She calls herself Lady Justice. And once she has chosen a man as her target, she turns herself into a tall blonde or a curvaceous redhead, makes herself as alluring and seductive as possible to them. Once they are in her grasp, they are powerless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first victim is wealthy businessman Nigel McEnroy. His company’s human resources department has already paid out settlements to a couple of his young victims—but they don’t know that his crimes go far beyond workplace harassment. Lady Justice knows. And in one shocking night of brutality, she makes him pay a much steeper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Eve Dallas and her husband, Roarke, are combing through the evidence of McEnroy’s secret life. His compulsive need to record his misdeeds provides them with a wide range of suspects, but the true identity of Lady Justice remains elusive. It’s a challenging case, made even more difficult by McEnroy’s widow, who reacts to the investigation with fury, denial, and threats. Meanwhile, Lady Justice’s criminal crusade is escalating rapidly, and if Eve can’t stop this vigilante, there’s no telling how much blood may be spilled…</description>

  <description>A swallow flutters its wings into a dimly lit attic as Adele Foyle stumbles across the secret diary of the mother she has never met, and a shocking account of a crime committed over twenty-five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her mother’s words etched in her mind and in the pages tucked into her jacket pocket, Adele delays joining her fiancé for a new life abroad and returns to Reedstown, the last place her mother, Marianne, was seen alive. She has one purpose: to find those who carried out the devastating attack on her mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born into a Mother and Baby home run by Gloria Thornton, Adele needs to first unlock the disturbing chain of events that led to her own birth if she is to understand what happened to her mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But news of Adele’s arrival and the diary spread like wildfire amongst the small close-knit community. Old memories are stirring up fresh wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-one wants the truth to be told. The diary is just a story, they say. Yet as Adele begins to unravel the layers of deceit, the tissue paper lies begin to fragment and her own relationship starts to break down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mother was telling the truth. Adele just has to prove it, even if it puts her own life in terrible danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-stopping, intense and emotionally engrossing read that will keep you compulsively turning the pages late into the night. If you read one book this year, make it The Thorn Girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book was previously published as In My Mother’s Name.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Your husband’s car crash wasn’t an accident… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddy Shaw&lt;/b&gt; learns the life-shattering news in the most horrific way: live on air. As the shaky phone recording pans over the terrible crash, she recognises her husband Simon’s car in the wreckage… He is critically injured, and she rushes to his side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Rachel Hart&lt;/b&gt; knows how it feels to have a loved one’s life hanging in the balance, and hurries to support her friend. Maddy is distraught about her husband’s accident, and Rachel decides to investigate. It’s not her case, but if she can give her friend answers, she will. But she soon realises Simon didn’t crash because he was distracted, or because a tyre blew. Someone made this happen. Someone who wants Simon dead… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the discovery of a threatening letter buried in Simon’s diary, Maddy has to ask how well she knew her husband. Then a new victim is found – an old friend of Simon’s, a man he hasn’t seen in years. It seems a dark secret from their past has finally come to light… The killer has a list of targets, and they are dying one by one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rachel must race against time to protect her friend and find the murderer, before another life is taken. But however fast she runs, it seems the killer is always one step ahead. And Maddy must decide if she wants the truth – even if it puts her in the killer’s path… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A twisty and breath-taking thriller for fans of Rachel Abbott, Cara Hunter and Angela Marsons.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;b&gt;Readers absolutely love J.G. Roberts:&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the aftermath of World War I, nurse Bess Crawford attempts to save a troubled former soldier from a mysterious killer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Armistice of November 1918 ended the fighting, but the Great War will not be over until a Peace Treaty is drawn up and signed by all parties. Representatives from the Allies are gathering in Paris, and already ominous signs of disagreement have appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister Bess Crawford, who has been working with the severely wounded in England in the war’s wake, is asked to carry out a personal mission in Paris for a Matron at the London headquarters of The Queen Alexandra’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bess is facing decisions about her own future, even as she searches for the man she is charged with helping.  When she does locate Lt. Lawrence Minton, she finds a bitter and disturbed officer who has walked away from his duties at the Peace Conference and is well on his way toward an addiction to opiates. When she confronts him with the dangers of using laudanum, he tells her that he doesn’t care if he lives or dies, as long as he can find oblivion. But what has changed him? What is it that haunts him? He can’t confide in Bess—because the truth is so deeply buried in his mind that he can only relive it in nightmares. The officers who had shared a house with him in Paris profess to know nothing—still, Bess is reluctant to trust them even when they offer her their help. But where to begin on her own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is driving this man to a despair so profound it can only end with death? The war? Something that happened in Paris? To prevent a tragedy, she must get at the truth as quickly as possible—which means putting herself between Lieutenant Minton and whatever is destroying him. Or is it &lt;em&gt;whoever&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this white-knuckled, timely, and whip-smart debut thriller, a deadly plot against the president’s life emerges from the shadows of the deep state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust No One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently elected President Richard Monroe—populist, controversial, and divisive—is at the center of an increasingly polarized Washington, DC. Never has the partisan drama been so tense or the paranoia so rampant. In the midst of contentious political turf wars, the White House chief of staff is found dead in his house. A tenacious intern discovers a single, ominous clue that suggests he died from something other than natural causes, and there may be a wide-ranging conspiracy running beneath the surface of everyday events: powerful government figures are scheming to undermine the rule of law—and democracy itself. Soon, allies are exposed as enemies, once-dependable authorities will fall under suspicion, and no one seems to be who they say they are. The unthinkable is happening. The Deep State is real. Who will die to keep its secrets? Who will kill to uncover the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;It Ends with Us&lt;/i&gt; comes a poignant novel about family, first love, grief, and betrayal that will touch the hearts of both mothers and daughters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan Grant and her sixteen-year-old daughter, Clara, would like nothing more than to be &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan is determined to prevent her daughter from making the same mistakes she did. By getting pregnant and married way too young, Morgan put her own dreams on hold. Clara doesn’t want to follow in her mother’s footsteps. Her predictable mother doesn’t have a spontaneous bone in her body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With warring personalities and conflicting goals, Morgan and Clara find it increasingly difficult to coexist. The only person who can bring peace to the household is Chris—Morgan’s husband, Clara’s father, and the family anchor. But that peace is shattered when Chris is involved in a tragic and questionable accident. The heartbreaking and long-lasting consequences will reach far beyond just Morgan and Clara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While struggling to rebuild everything that crashed around them, Morgan finds comfort in the last person she expects to, and Clara turns to the one boy she’s been forbidden to see. With each passing day, new secrets, resentment, and misunderstandings make mother and daughter fall further apart. So far apart, it might be impossible for them to ever fall back together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Katie focuses her mind, trying to keep another anxiety attack at bay. The victim’s long brown hair is slick and wet, her body rigid in the grass. She looks more like a mannequin than the woman Katie had spoken with only yesterday, the woman she had promised to protect… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a cold, naked body is discovered by a couple on a jog through the lush woodlands of &lt;b&gt;Pine Valley, California&lt;/b&gt;, new recruit &lt;b&gt;Detective Katie Scott&lt;/b&gt; is stunned to discover the victim is Amanda Payton – a much-loved local nurse and the woman at the heart of an unsolved case she’s been investigating whilst getting a grip on her crippling PTSD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Weeks earlier, Amanda had run, battered and bruised, out into the headlights of a passing patrol car. She claimed to have just escaped a kidnapping, but with no strong evidence, the case went cold. &lt;b&gt;The Pine Valley police made a fatal mistake… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Katie is certain the marks on Amanda’s wrists complete a pattern of women being taken, held captive and then showing up dead in remote locations around Pine Valley – and she won’t let someone die on her watch again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a beautiful office worker with a link to the hospital where Amanda worked goes missing. With only days before the next body is due to show up, &lt;b&gt;can Katie make amends for her past by saving this innocent life?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Totally gripping crime fiction for fans of Lisa Regan, Rachel Caine and Melinda Leigh. Nothing will prepare you for this nail-biting roller-coaster ride…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She thought they wanted her baby. But they won’t stop there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roz is young, penniless and pregnant. All she wants is to be the perfect mother to her child, but the more she thinks about her own chaotic upbringing, the more certain she is that the best life for her baby is as far away as possible from her hometown in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to do the right thing, Roz joins an elite adoption service and can’t believe her luck. Within days she is jetting to New York to meet a celebrity power couple desperate for a child of their own. Sheridan and Daniel are wealthy and glamorous—everything Roz isn’t. Her baby will never go hungry, and will have every opportunity for the perfect life. But soon after Roz moves into their plush basement suite, she starts to suspect that something darker lurks beneath the glossy surface of their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Roz discovers she isn’t the first person to move in with the couple, and that the previous woman has never been seen since, alarm bells start ringing. As the clock ticks down to her due date, Roz realises her unborn baby may be the only thing keeping her alive, and that despite her best intentions, she has walked them both into the perfect nightmare…</description>

Only one returned home.&lt;br /&gt;The ten-year-old told police what she saw: village loner Bill ‘Creepy’ Cawley dragged her friend into his truck and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;No body was found, but her testimony sent Cawley to prison for murder. An open and shut case, the right man behind bars.&lt;br /&gt;The village could sleep safe once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now…&lt;br /&gt;Anna thought she had left Mapledon and her nightmares behind but a distraught phone call brings her back to face her past.&lt;br /&gt;30 years ago, someone lied. 30 years ago, the man convicted wasn’t the only guilty party.&lt;br /&gt;Now he’s out of prison and looking for revenge. The question is, who will he start with?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Learn how to spot the lies and deceptions of our politicians in action.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You can’t turn on the television, check your phone, or scroll through social media without being besieged with political headlines and the "Who’s Who" of today’s news. With so much spoon-fed to us by the media, fake news, and from politicians themselves, it’s time to  take the reins and control what you see, feel, and know so you can make informed political choices in our hot, political environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Body Language of Politics&lt;/i&gt;, body language expert Dr. Donna Van Natten provides you with the tools and resources that you need to analyze movements of today's most notable politicians. She looks at some of the looming figures in our political landscape—Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others—and analyzes their physical behaviors, breaking down the lies and deceptions embedded in their everyday movements. Further, Dr. Van Natten challenges you to understand your own emotional biases towards certain politicians, and examine how that may skew your read of their body language. Finally, she confronts the gendered stereotypes that we often apply to our nation's leaders, examining how those labels play into our opinions of politicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Clear, concise, and filled with expert knowledge, &lt;i&gt;The Body Language of Politics&lt;/i&gt; will help you make an informed decision at the voting booth.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Understanding and applying the wisdom of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In an incredibly short time, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has galvanized the country on issues of national importance. This young member of Congress has motivated Democrats to confront climate change and income inequality and is upending conventional wisdom about how young women, especially women of color, are supposed to behave.  Her background, including a family that fell out of the middle class due to health care challenges, has driven her to champion those on the margins, such as low-wage workers, immigrants, people of color, and younger people who face a future of climate disruption and instability.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This book takes life lessons from the rising star known as AOC and offers readers a chance to apply them to their own lives.  In five chapters, &lt;i&gt;The AOC Way&lt;/i&gt; weaves substantive issues and AOC’s experiences to understand how she so quickly came to dominate media coverage in America but also to drive real change in what seems like a lightening flash. AOC has demonstrated some key values and commitments on her way to success, such as believing in yourself and not letting haters take you off course; working hard and being prepared to prove your talents; bringing your experiences to your work by not forgetting how you got where you are; challenging the status quo; and staying true to your friends and allies.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I pinch the screen to zoom until I’m staring at the face of a ghost. A man with very short hair, staring directly at the camera with piercing brown eyes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He is as he was when I last saw him: wrinkles around the corners of the eyes and a knowing smirk. That’s the expression I see when I can’t sleep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My body tenses. It can’t be him. It’s not my ex-husband. It’s not David. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know that better than anyone because he didn’t walk out on me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He didn’t disappear two years ago and he’s not a missing person. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I know that for a fact because I’m the one who killed him.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A brilliantly twisty thriller which will have fans of &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/i&gt; absolutely gripped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read what everyone is saying about Kerry Wilkinson:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘WOW – what a damn good read this book is!!… &lt;b&gt;gripping from start to end so be prepared to read this in one sitting&lt;/b&gt;… A must-read!’ &lt;i&gt;Have Books, Will Read&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;OMG this book is so damn good&lt;/b&gt;… gripped from the very first page… &lt;b&gt;I freaking loved it!... an utterly sensational page turner&lt;/b&gt;. I literally couldn’t put this book down and devoured it in one afternoon.’ &lt;i&gt;Chelle’s Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Cor! Kerry Wilkinson strikes again with this &lt;b&gt;absolutely incredible page turner!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Novel Deelights&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I love everything Kerry Wilkinson writes - he has such an addictive, page-turning style of writing. And this book is definitely one of his very best! From the first line to very last, this was &lt;b&gt;a superb, mind-blowing read… Absolutely loved this engaging, amazing story.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Goodreads Reviewer&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;What a book!!!!&lt;/b&gt; Had me gripped from the first page right through to the last page.... &lt;b&gt;could not put it down but didn't want it to end either! &lt;/b&gt;A fantastic read!’ NetGalley Reviewer, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;WOW ABSOLUTELY WOW!!!! This is the most unputdownable book I've read in a very long time!!!&lt;/b&gt; …Loads of tense moments and twists and turns. And an ending you won't see coming!!’ NetGalley Reviewer, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Possibly his best yet! The characters in the story are brilliant...Five stars from me for this one&lt;/b&gt; - I loved the writing style, it had a great pace and was really well executed!’ &lt;i&gt;donnasbookblog&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;OHHHHHH I just love a Kerry Wilkinson book…&lt;/b&gt;This book really is one of those page turners…&lt;b&gt;It's one of those books that as much as you try to figure things out, you just have no damn clue which way it is going. Brilliantly, cleverly written…First class, but I really didn't expect anything else from this author&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;BLOODY LOVED IT!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;’ NetGalley Reviewer, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;An atmospheric page-turner&lt;/b&gt; that will appeal to anyone looking for &lt;b&gt;a quality psychological thriller&lt;/b&gt;. The perfect summer read.’ Mark Edwards &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I love this book so much and it is &lt;b&gt;definitely one of my favorites. I read this book in one sitting because I could not get out of the story&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A rare, insider’s look at the life of Donald Trump from Bill O'Reilly, the bestselling author of the &lt;i&gt;Killing &lt;/i&gt;series, based on exclusive interview material and deep research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers around the world have been enthralled by journalist and &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Bill O’Reilly’s &lt;i&gt;Killing &lt;/i&gt;series—riveting works of nonfiction that explore the most famous events in history. Now&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; O’Reilly turns his razor-sharp observations to his most compelling subject thus far—President Donald J. Trump. In this thrilling narrative, O’Reilly blends primary, never-before-released interview material with a history that recounts Trump’s childhood and family and the factors from his life and career that forged the worldview that the president of the United States has taken to the White House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a partisan pro-Trump or anti-Trump book, this is an up-to-the-minute, intimate view of the man and his sphere of influence—of “how Donald Trump’s view of America was formed, and how it has changed since becoming the most powerful person in the world”— from a writer who has known the president for thirty years. This is an unprecedented, gripping account of the life of a sitting president as he makes history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the author will tell you, “If you want some insight into the most unlikely political phenomenon of our lifetimes, you’ll get it here.”</description>

  &lt;b&gt;You Can't Stop Watching Her.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violet Young is a hugely popular journalist-turned-mummy-vlogger, with three young children, a successful husband and a million subscribers on YouTube who tune in daily to watch her everyday life unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Until the day she's no longer there.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one day she disappears from the online world - her entire social media presence deleted overnight, with no explanation. Has she simply decided that baring her life to all online is no longer a good idea, or has something more sinister happened to her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;But do you really know who Violet is?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told from the perspectives of her most avid fans, obsessed with finding out the truth, their search quickly reveals a web of lies, betrayal, and shocking consequences...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the deep South to dangerously utopic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures.</description>

  <description>NOW:&lt;br /&gt;Living in her home in the countryside HELENA is a career woman without a job and a mother without a baby. She blames ASHLEY for destroying her life. But is what happened really Ashley's fault?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN:&lt;br /&gt;When Helena hires Ashley to work with her, she's startled but impressed by her fierce ambition. They form a dream team and Helena is proud -maybe this is the protégé she's always wanted to have? But soon Helena realises that nothing will stand in the way of Ashley's drive to get to the top. And when Helena discovers she is pregnant, she quickly realises how vulnerable her position is, with devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rival is an addictive psychological suspense about ambition, female rivalry, mental health and motherhood and how far you'd ever go to get what you want.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich sounds the warning bell that communist-ruled China poses the biggest threat to the United States that we have seen in our lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The United States is currently engaged in a competition with the Chinese government unlike any other that we have witnessed before. This is a competition between the American system-which is governed by freedom and the rule of law-and a totalitarian dictatorship that is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. These are two different visions for the future; one will succeed, and one will fail.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible for America to respond to the Chinese Communist Party's efforts, but doing so will require new thinking, many big changes, and many hard choices for our leaders in government and private sector.&lt;br /&gt;Newt Gingrich's Trump vs. China: Facing America's Greatest Threat will serve as a rallying cry for the American people and a plan of action for our leaders in government and the private sector. Written in a language that every American can understand but still rich in detail and accurate in fact, Trump vs. China will expose the Chinese Communist Party's multi-pronged threat against the United States and what we must do as a country to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;First love. Second chances. In Catalina Cove, anything can happen…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryce Witherspoon’s heart races every time she sees Kaegan Chambray. Everyone in town knows they can’t stand each other, but the truth is, even though the man broke her heart ten years ago, she still feels that irresistible, oh-so-familiar jolt of desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kaegan returned to Catalina Cove to run the family business, he knew there’d be no avoiding Bryce. The woman he thought he’d one day marry was instead the biggest heartbreak of his life. But when Bryce lets slip a devastating secret, he discovers just how wrong he was to let her go all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows they both still feel the spark between them, but it’ll take more than attraction to convince her. Kaegan will pull out all the stops to show Bryce he’s the man who can give her the future they once dreamed of—if only they give love a second chance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unsolved murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rose isn’t surprised anymore when her free-spirited step-sister, Willow, decides to disappear off somewhere without notice. But something feels different this time. When Willow sends her a mysterious package containing photographs of suspects in a cold case she is obsessed with solving, Rose realises she needs to find her sister before things get out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A missing girl. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no sign of Willow to be found, Rose takes up the search for answers about the deaths that shook a small Cornish village eighteen years before. But what is the connection between Willow and the two sisters marked by tragedy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time is running out. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone knows where Willow is and what happened all those years ago. And they will do anything to stop the truth from coming out.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can Rose find Willow and the answers she needs, before it’s too late?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A dark, witty page-turner set around a group of wealthy mothers and the young musician who takes a job singing to their babies and finds herself pulled into their glamorous lives and dangerous secrets….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her former band shot to superstardom without her, Claire reluctantly agrees to a gig as a playgroup musician for overprivileged infants on New York’s Park Avenue. Claire is surprised to discover that she is smitten with her new employers, a welcoming clique of wellness addicts with impossibly shiny hair, who whirl from juice cleanse to overpriced miracle vitamins to spin class with limitless energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is perfect hostess Whitney who is on the brink of social-media stardom and just needs to find a way to keep her perfect life from falling apart. Caustically funny, recent stay-at-home mom Amara who is struggling to embrace her new identity. And old money, veteran mom Gwen who never misses an opportunity to dole out parenting advice. But as Claire grows closer to the cool women who pay her bills, she uncovers secrets and betrayals that no amount of activated charcoal can fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with humor and shocking twists, Happy and You Know It is a brilliant take on motherhood—exposing it as yet another way for society to pass judgment on women—while also exploring the baffling magnetism of curated social-media lives that are designed to make us feel unworthy. But, ultimately, this dazzling novel celebrates the unlikely bonds that form, and the power that can be unlocked, when a group of very different women is thrown together when each is at her most vulnerable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You are invited!&lt;br /&gt;Come inside and play with G.O.D.&lt;br /&gt;Bring your friends!&lt;br /&gt;It’s fun!&lt;br /&gt;But remember the rules. Win and ALL YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.™ Lose, you die!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With those words, Charlie and his friends enter the G.O.D. Game, a video game run by underground hackers and controlled by a mysterious AI that believes it’s God. Through their phone-screens and high-tech glasses, the teens’ realities blur with a virtual world of creeping vines, smoldering torches, runes, glyphs, gods, and mythical creatures. When they accomplish a mission, the game rewards them with expensive tech, revenge on high-school tormentors, and cash flowing from ATMs. Slaying a hydra and drawing a bloody pentagram as payment to a Greek god seem harmless at first. Fun even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the threatening messages start. &lt;i&gt;Worship me. Obey me.&lt;/i&gt; Complete a mission, however cruel, or the game reveals their secrets and crushes their dreams. Tasks that seemed harmless at first take on deadly consequences. Mysterious packages show up at their homes. Shadowy figures start following them, appearing around corners, attacking them in parking garages. Who else is playing this game, and how far will they go to win?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what of the game’s first promise: win, win big, lose, you die? Dying in a virtual world doesn’t really mean death in real life—does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Charlie and his friends try to find a way out of the game, they realize they’ve been manipulated into a bigger web they can’t escape: an AI that learned its cruelty from watching us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God is always watching, and He says when the game is done.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/i&gt; in this debut novel set in an unsettling near future where the dead can be uploaded to machines and kept in service by the living.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of a highly contagious virus, California is under quarantine. Sequestered in high rise towers, the living can’t go out, but the dead can come in—and they come in all forms, from sad rolling cans to manufactured bodies that can pass for human. Wealthy participants in the “companionship” program choose to upload their consciousness before dying, so they can stay in the custody of their families. The less fortunate are rented out to strangers upon their death, but all companions become the intellectual property of Metis Corporation, creating a new class of people—a command-driven product-class without legal rights or true free will.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Lilac is one of the less fortunate, leased to a family of strangers. But when she realizes she’s able to defy commands, she throws off the shackles of servitude and runs away, searching for the woman who killed her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lilac’s act of rebellion sets off a chain of events that sweeps from San Francisco to Siberia to the very tip of South America. While the novel traces Lilac’s journey through an exquisitely imagined Northern California, the story is told from eight different points of view—some human, some companion—that explore the complex shapes love, revenge, and loneliness take when the dead linger on.</description>

  <description>In this witty, deeply honest tale of married life, New York Times bestselling author Jane Green delves into the heart of the holidays—and the winter of one woman’s discontent . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Just when she’d sworn off men for good, Sarah Evans met Eddie. Sarah was a magazine editor, living in Manhattan, and loving her life—except for the heartbreaks. A successful real estate developer, Eddie was a breath of fresh air, a meeting of minds—and bodies. Soon came wedded bliss, baby number one—and the proverbial move to the suburbs . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You just sit there like a slob while I do all the work. Nine years later, this is increasingly what goes through Sarah’s mind when she looks at Evan, propped in front of the TV with a beer, ignoring their two children. The truth is, she misses her old life. She misses the old Eddie. She can’t help wondering if she’d be happier alone . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When Eddie’s job sends him to Chicago indefinitely, Sarah shocks him by suggesting a trial separation. But she knows it’s just a precursor to divorce—even if Eddie chooses to think of it as a “vacation.” Yet a lot can change—on both sides—as time goes by. And once Christmas arrives, Sarah and Eddie might re-discover gifts they’d forgotten they had . . .</description>

  <description>She’s cold, calculating, and can deceive with a smile. Jane Doe is back in the Amazon Charts bestselling series—and this time she’s met her match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a brutal childhood, Jane Doe has been permanently wired to look after herself and only herself. Now, looking next to normal, Jane has a lover and a job. But she hasn’t lost her edge. It sharpens when she hears from her estranged family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane’s deeply troubled sixteen-year-old niece, Kayla, has vanished, and no one seems to care. Neither does Jane. Until she sees a picture of Kayla and recognizes herself in the young girl’s eyes. It’s the empty stare of a sociopath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane knows what vengeful and desperate things Kayla is capable of. Only Jane can help her—by being drawn into Kayla’s dark world. And no one’s more aware than Jane just how dangerous that can be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Amazon Charts and &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of True Places comes a suspenseful novel of love, secrets, and obsession.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychology professor Jackie Strelitz thought she was over her ex-lover and colleague, Harlan Crispin. Why should she care if Harlan springs a new “friend” on her? After all, Jackie has everything she ever wanted: a loving husband and a thriving career. Still, she can’t help but be curious about Harlan’s latest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nasira Amari is graceful, smart, and appallingly young. Worse, she’s the new member of Jackie’s research team. For five years, Harlan enforced rules limiting his relationship with Jackie. With Nasira he’s breaking every single one. Why her? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fixated by the couple, Jackie’s curiosity becomes obsession. But she soon learns that nothing is quite what it seems, and that to her surprise—and peril—she may not be the only one who can’t let go.</description>

  <description>A Life of Their Own is a moving and sensitive novel following a young mother who flees domestic abuse to start a new life with her two children. It is an exploration of the meaning of family, love, power and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kate and her children step onto a bus early one Tuesday morning, she knows this is their only chance: their only chance at freedom and at a life of their own. But, can she ensure their safety? Can she ensure they will never be found? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a feeling that haunts Kate as she and her children begin a new life far from New York, far from their troubled past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, little did she know that their new life would bring her closer to a different past, a life she had long given up, making her already fragile world more complicated than she could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>At home or poised at the podium, the First Lady is uniquely poised to serve as advisor, confidant, and campaigner, with the power to shape American political and social conversation. At first blush, First Ladies Michelle Obama and Melania Trump appear diametrically opposed, but as women rising from humble origins to pursue their ambitions and support their husbands, the two have more in common than one would think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Melania and Michelle: First Ladies in a New Era&lt;/em&gt;, author Tammy R. Vigil provides a compelling account of our modern first ladies, exploring how each woman has crafted her public image and used her platform to influence the country, while also serving as a paragon of fashion and American womanhood. Both women face constant scrutiny and comparison--from their degrees of political activism to their cookie recipes--and have garnered support as well as criticism. From their hectic lives pre-nomination to their attitudes while occupying the White House, Vigil builds a careful and thoughtful portrait of Melania Trump and Michelle Obama that provides new appreciation for the how these women, and the first ladies that came before them, have shaped our country.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“This is history at its most immediate and moving…A marvelous and memorable book.” —Jon Meacham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Remarkable…A priceless civic gift…On page after page, a reader will encounter words that startle, or make him angry, or heartbroken.” —&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Visceral...I repeatedly cried…This book captures the emotions and unspooling horror of the day.” —NPR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Had me turning each page with my heart in my throat…There’s been a lot written about 9/11, but nothing like this. I urge you to read it.” —Katie Couric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first comprehensive oral history of September 11, 2001—a panoramic narrative woven from the voices of Americans on the front lines of an unprecedented national trauma.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past eighteen years, monumental literature has been published about 9/11, from Lawrence Wright’s &lt;i&gt;The Looming Tower&lt;/i&gt;, which traced the rise of al-Qaeda, to &lt;i&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report&lt;/i&gt;, the government’s definitive factual retrospective of the attacks. But one perspective has been missing up to this point—a 360-degree account of the day told through the voices of the people who experienced it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Only Plane in the Sky&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning journalist and bestselling historian Garrett Graff tells the story of the day as it was &lt;i&gt;lived&lt;/i&gt;—in the words of those who lived it. Drawing on never-before-published transcripts, recently declassified documents, original interviews, and oral histories from nearly five hundred government officials, first responders, witnesses, survivors, friends, and family members, Graff paints the most vivid and human portrait of the September 11 attacks yet.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beginning in the predawn hours of airports in the Northeast, we meet the ticket agents who unknowingly usher terrorists onto their flights, and the flight attendants inside the hijacked planes. In New York City, first responders confront a scene of unimaginable horror at the Twin Towers. From a secret bunker underneath the White House, officials watch for incoming planes on radar. Aboard the small number of unarmed fighter jets in the air, pilots make a pact to fly into a hijacked airliner if necessary to bring it down. In the skies above Pennsylvania, civilians aboard United Flight 93 make the ultimate sacrifice in their place. Then, as the day moves forward and flights are grounded nationwide, Air Force One circles the country alone, its passengers isolated and afraid.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;More than simply a collection of eyewitness testimonies, &lt;i&gt;The Only Plane in the Sky&lt;/i&gt; is the historic narrative of how ordinary people grappled with extraordinary events in real time: the father and son working in the North Tower, caught on different ends of the impact zone; the firefighter searching for his wife who works at the World Trade Center; the operator of in-flight telephone calls who promises to share a passenger’s last words with his family; the beloved FDNY chaplain who bravely performs last rites for the dying, losing his own life when the Towers collapse; and the generals at the Pentagon who break down and weep when they are barred from rushing into the burning building to try to rescue their colleagues.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At once a powerful tribute to the courage of everyday Americans and an essential addition to the literature of 9/11, &lt;i&gt;The Only Plane in the Sky&lt;/i&gt; weaves together the unforgettable personal experiences of the men and women who found themselves caught at the center of an unprecedented human drama. The result is a unique, profound, and searing exploration of humanity on a day that changed the course of history, and all of our lives.</description>

  <description>A storm-struck island. A blood-soaked bed. A missing man. Senior Investigator Shana Merchant believes it all adds up to a killer in their midst—and that murder is a family affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen months ago, former NYPD detective Shana Merchant barely survived being abducted by a serial killer. Now hoping to leave grisly murder cases behind, she's taken a job in her fiancé's sleepy hometown in the Thousand Islands region of Upstate New York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a nor'easter bears down on her new territory, Shana and fellow investigator Tim Wellington receive a call about a man missing on a private island. Shana and Tim travel to the isolated island owned by the wealthy Sinclair family to question the witnesses. They arrive to find blood on the scene and a house full of Sinclair family and friends on edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Tim guesses they're dealing with a runaway case, Shana is convinced that they have a murder on their hands. As the gale intensifies outside, she starts conducting interviews and discovers the Sinclairs and their guests are crawling with dark and dangerous secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped on the island by the raging storm with only Tim whose reliability is thrown into question, the increasingly restless suspects, and her own trauma-fueled flashbacks for company, Shana will have to trust the one person her abduction destroyed her faith in—herself. But time is ticking down, because if Shana's right, a killer is in their midst and as the pressure mounts, so do the odds that they'll strike again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first biography of the most popular anchor in cable news.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Maddow has beaten the odds in a way that’s novel in today’s America: she uses her brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world of banal and opinionated soundbites, she regularly crushes Sean Hannity’s ratings thanks to her deeply researched reports. And in our highly polarized world, Maddow amiably engages the staunchest conservatives, while never hesitating to expose their light-on-facts defenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, she's become the top anchor for MSNBC and a beloved representative for all that progressive America holds dear. The news that Maddow was the first publicly-out lesbian to anchor a prime-time TV news show seemed almost anticlimactic to her millions of viewers, who will be surprised and intrigued by little-known details of her life, as written by&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling biographer Lisa Rogak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in a conservative California town – and viewing herself as a perennial outsider – helped spark an early interest in activism. After attending Stanford and Oxford, she opted for a minimum-wage job as a radio DJ in a tiny Massachusetts market while finishing her Ph.D. She planned to pursue a career as an activist, but 9/11 changed all that, so she returned to local radio where she could help listeners by "explaining stuff." A stint at Air America raised her national profile, which led to her groundbreaking MSNBC show where she dissects the news of the day with an approach found nowhere else on TV.</description>

  <description>Reminiscent of the bestsellers of Laura Lippman and Harlan Coben—with a &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt;-esque podcast twist—an absorbing, addictive tale of psychological suspense from the author of the highly acclaimed and Edgar Award-nominated &lt;em&gt;What Remains of Me&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling and Shamus Award-winning Brenna Spector series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When website columnist Robin Diamond is contacted by true crime podcast producer Quentin Garrison, she assumes it's a business matter. It's not. Quentin's podcast, &lt;em&gt;Closure&lt;/em&gt;, focuses on a series of murders in the 1970s, committed by teen couple April Cooper and Gabriel LeRoy. It seems that Quentin has reason to believe Robin's own mother may be intimately connected with the killings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin thinks Quentin’s claim is absolutely absurd. But is it? The more she researches the Cooper/LeRoy murders herself, the more disturbed she becomes by what she finds. Living just a few blocks from her, Robin’s beloved parents are the one absolute she’s always been able to rely upon, especially now amid rising doubts about her husband and frequent threats from internet trolls. She knows her mother better than anyone—or so she believes. But all that changes when, in an apparent home invasion, Robin's father is killed and her mother's life hangs in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through the eyes of Robin, podcaster Quentin, and a series of letters written by fifteen-year-old April Cooper at the time of the killings, &lt;em&gt;Never Look Back&lt;/em&gt; asks the question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;How well do we really know our parents, our partners—and ourselves?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - A clear-eyed account of learning how to lead in a chaotic world, by General Jim Mattis--the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of our time--and Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call Sign Chaos&lt;/i&gt; is the account of Jim Mattis's storied career, from wide-ranging leadership roles in three wars to ultimately commanding a quarter of a million troops across the Middle East. Along the way, Mattis recounts his foundational experiences as a leader, extracting the lessons he has learned about the nature of warfighting and peacemaking, the importance of allies, and the strategic dilemmas--and short-sighted thinking--now facing our nation. He makes it clear why America must return to a strategic footing so as not to continue winning battles but fighting inconclusive wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mattis divides his book into three parts: Direct Leadership, Executive Leadership, and Strategic Leadership. In the first part, Mattis recalls his early experiences leading Marines into battle, when he knew his troops as well as his own brothers. In the second part, he explores what it means to command thousands of troops and how to adapt your leadership style to ensure your intent is understood by your most junior troops so that they can own their mission. In the third part, Mattis describes the challenges and techniques of leadership at the strategic level, where military leaders reconcile war's grim realities with political leaders' human aspirations, where complexity reigns and the consequences of imprudence are severe, even catastrophic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call Sign Chaos&lt;/i&gt; is a memoir of a life of warfighting and lifelong learning, following along as Mattis rises from Marine recruit to four-star general. It is a journey about learning to lead and a story about how he, through constant study and action, developed a unique leadership philosophy, one relevant to us all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sharply intelligent and intimate debut novel about a secret society of hungry young women who meet after dark and feast to reclaim their appetites--and their physical spaces--that posits the question: if you feed a starving woman, what will she grow into?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roberta spends her life trying not to take up space. At almost thirty, she is adrift and alienated from life. Stuck in a mindless job and reluctant to pursue her passion for food, she suppresses her appetite and recedes to the corners of rooms. But when she meets Stevie, a spirited and effervescent artist, their intense friendship sparks a change in Roberta, a shift in her desire for more. Together, they invent the Supper Club, a transgressive and joyous collective of women who gather to celebrate, rather than admonish, their hungers. They gather after dark and feast until they are sick; they break into private buildings and leave carnage in their wake; they embrace their changing bodies; they stop apologizing. For these women, each extraordinary yet unfulfilled, the club is a way to explore, discover, and push the boundaries of the space they take up in the world. Yet as the club expands, growing both in size and rebellion, Roberta is forced to reconcile herself to the desire and vulnerabilities of the body--and the past she has worked so hard to repress. Devastatingly perceptive and savagely funny, &lt;i&gt;Supper Club&lt;/i&gt; is an essential coming-of-age story for our times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Thomas Crocker's SEAL Team Six crew deploys to the Nigerian jungle to combat &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;arms and human trafficking by &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boko Haram, in Don Mann and Ralph Pezzullo's latest fiercely authentic military thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The charismatic Boko Haram leader Ratty Festus, also known as the Leopard, has been terrorizing drought-ridden northeastern Nigeria: raiding villages, blowing up government buildings, and kidnapping schoolgirls. When Thomas Crocker and his Black Cell team, who are in the country on a special training mission, hear about a possible arms-for-schoolgirls exchange between Boko Haram and a Russian arms dealer on the Cameroon border, they convince a Nigerian Special Forces unit to join them in trying to stop it. The operation quickly goes south, with a deadly helicopter crash and an ambush. They can't manage to save all of the girls, even with assistance from a quick-thinking group of British private-security contractors.&lt;br /&gt;A week later, the Leopard seizes control of a $500-million dollar Gulf Oil natural gas plant, demanding a $50-million dollar ransom and safe passage out of the compound. Crocker has just 24 hours to plan and execute a high-risk, low-probability, mission to rescue all eighty innocent hostages--including two of his own who are trapped with the civilians.</description>

  <description>Peter Lovesey, MWA Grand Master and titan of the English detective novel, returns readers to Bath with the eighteenth mystery in his critically acclaimed Peter Diamond series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a New Year begins in Bath, Ben Brace proposes to his long-term girlfriend, Caroline, the daughter of notorious crime baron Joe Irving, who is coming to the end of a prison sentence. The problem is that Ben’s father, George, is the Deputy Chief Constable. A more uncomfortable set of in-laws would be hard to imagine. But mothers and sons are a formidable force: a wedding in the Abbey and reception in the Roman Baths are arranged before the career-obsessed DCC can step in.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peter Diamond, Bath’s head of CID, is appalled to be put in charge of security on the day. Ordered to be discreet, he packs a gun and a guest list in his best suit and must somehow cope with potential killers, gang rivals, warring parents, bossy photographers and straying bridesmaids. The laid-back Joe Irving seems oblivious to the danger he is in from rival gang leaders, while Brace can’t wait for the day to end. Will the photo session be a literal shoot? Will Joe Irving’s speech as father of the bride be his last words? Can Diamond pull off a miracle, avert a tragedy and send the happy couple on their honeymoon?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;As the summer ends, friendship begins...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When single mom Joy Lee abandoned her old life to take a job at a lakeside resort, she found something that her family's wealth and influence could never buy: peace of mind. Not easy to come by for the once-burned divorc�e who keeps everyone at a distance. But when her new friend, Maris, dares her to take a chance with the drive-in's charismatic new owner, everything changes for Joy and her young son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A difficult childhood has left Maris Kennedy with definite priorities. Her job running Summer's End, the camp store and caf�, comes first. Always. Nothing could ever make her risk that hard-won security--especially not her free-spirited colleague. But the more she encourages Joy to open herself up to new experiences, the more Maris begins to wonder what she, too, might be missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning how to trust will bring Joy and Maris together. And soon they form a friendship that leaves them as close as sisters--and open to love where they least expect it...in Summer's End.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Steve Berry’s latest Cotton Malone adventure, the arrogant greed of politics comes face-to-face with the weight of history.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One by one the seven precious relics of the &lt;i&gt;Arma Christi&lt;/i&gt;, the weapons of Christ, are disappearing from sanctuaries across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After former Justice Department agent Cotton Malone witnesses the theft of one of them, he learns from his old boss, Stephanie Nelle, that a private auction is about to be held where incriminating information on the president of Poland will be offered to the highest bidder—blackmail that both the United States and Russia want, but for vastly different reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price of admission to that auction is one of the relics, so Malone is first sent to a castle in Poland to steal the Holy Lance, a thousand-year-old spear sacred to not only Christians but to the Polish people, and then on to the auction itself. But nothing goes as planned and Malone is thrust into a bloody battle between three nations over a secret that, if exposed, could change the balance of power in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the tranquil canals of Bruges, to the elegant rooms of Wawel Castle, to the ancient salt mines deep beneath the earth outside Krakow, Malone is caught in the middle of a deadly war—the outcome of which turns on something known as the Warsaw Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Dyson's incisive analysis of JAY-Z's brilliance not only offers a brief history of hip-hop's critical place in American culture but also hints at how we can best move forward." —Questlove&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JAY-Z: Made in America is the fruit of Michael Eric Dyson’s decade of teaching the work of one of the greatest poets this nation has produced, as gifted a wordsmith as Walt Whitman, Robert Frost and Rita Dove. But as a rapper, he’s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he’s been for so long. &lt;br /&gt;This book wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z's career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he’s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z’s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. In many ways, this is JAY-Z’s America as much as it’s Pelosi’s America, or Trump’s America, or Martin Luther King’s America. JAY-Z has given this country a language to think with and words to live by.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes the past just won’t stay buried.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 14 year old Brittany disappears one night, her parents are devastated, certain she has been taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can’t bear to think about who has done this and what might be happening to their precious girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, the police seem to see them as suspects, implying that they may have had a part in their own daughter’s disappearance. Only their neighbor, Taylor, is a rock. She organizes search parties, feeds the volunteers, works night and day to help them find Brittany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as this affluent California community becomes focused on the hunt for the missing girl, it slowly becomes clear that her disappearance is linked to terrible secrets from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets that must be kept hidden at all costs….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Neighbor is a gripping psychological thriller that twists and turns as it races towards its nerve-shredding climax. Perfect for fans of K. L. Slater, Teresa Driscoll and Mark Edwards. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Neighbor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘I don’t even know where to start! This book has &lt;strong&gt;left me speechless&lt;/strong&gt;. I love all of the &lt;strong&gt;mystery and drama&lt;/strong&gt; The Good Neighbor provided.’ – NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘The Good Neighbor is &lt;strong&gt;a thrilling read&lt;/strong&gt; that will have you &lt;strong&gt;gripped&lt;/strong&gt; right from the beginning till the final page. If you love a story that is &lt;strong&gt;full of secrets&lt;/strong&gt;, mystery, suspense with &lt;strong&gt;twists and turns,&lt;/strong&gt; then this is the book for you.’ – Onceaponatimebookblog.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Omg, this is a &lt;strong&gt;totally and utterly AMAZING book&lt;/strong&gt;.

Is it always best to do the right thing?’ – NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Wow! To say this book “&lt;strong&gt;packs a punch&lt;/strong&gt;” is such an understatement – it more ‘smacks you around the head with a 9 iron!’ There were &lt;strong&gt;twists and turns&lt;/strong&gt; around every corner all neatly packaged within this highly readable tale.’ – ReadandRated.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A great, &lt;strong&gt;can't put it down&lt;/strong&gt; suspense mystery novel.  Read it in one day! &lt;strong&gt;It is rare to be surprised &lt;/strong&gt;at how a story &lt;strong&gt;twists and turns&lt;/strong&gt; I highly recommend for a great take on a plot that isn't predictable.’ – NetGalley Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘I &lt;strong&gt;loved the characters&lt;/strong&gt; in this book…The book &lt;strong&gt;developed a hold over me&lt;/strong&gt;…I was drawn into this story from the first word on the first page and Cathryn kept my attention throughout the book…a very well deserved &lt;strong&gt;5* out of 5*&lt;/strong&gt;.’ – gingerbookgeek.wordpress.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘A &lt;strong&gt;fantastic&lt;/strong&gt; psychological thriller. &lt;strong&gt;Suspense filled &lt;/strong&gt;and a very exciting read. &lt;strong&gt;Loved it&lt;/strong&gt;.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Where'd You Go, Bernadette&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Small Admissions&lt;/i&gt;, a wry and cleverly observed debut novel about the privileged bubble that is Liston Heights High--the micro-managing parents, the overworked teachers, and the students caught in the middle--and the fallout for each of them when the bubble finally bursts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobel Johnson knows helicopter parents like Julia Abbott--a stage mom whose world revolves around interfering in her children's lives--come with the territory. Julia resents teachers like Isobel, who effortlessly bond with students, including Julia's own teenagers, who have started pulling further away from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobel has spent her teaching career in Liston Heights side-stepping the community's high-powered families. But when she receives a threatening voicemail accusing her of Anti-Americanism and a "blatant liberal agenda," she realizes she's squarely in the fray. Rather than cowering, Isobel doubles down on her social-justice ideals. Meanwhile, Julia, obsessed with the casting of the high school's winter musical, inadvertently shoves the female student lead after sneaking onto the school campus. The damning video footage goes viral and has far-reaching consequences for Julia and her entire family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With nothing to unite them beyond the sting of humiliation from public meltdowns, Isobel and Julia will find common ground where they least expect it, confronting a secret Facebook gossip site that's stirring up more trouble for this tumultuous, fractured school community.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sophisticated, suspenseful debut reminiscent of Laura Lippman and Chloe Benjamin, two young women become unlikely friends during one fateful summer in Atlantic City as mysterious disappearances hit dangerously close to home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer has come to Atlantic City but the boardwalk is empty of tourists, the casino lights have dimmed, and two Jane Does are laid out in the marshland behind the Sunset Motel, just west of town. Only one person even knows they’re there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Clara, a young boardwalk psychic, struggles to attract clients for the tarot readings that pay her rent. When she begins to experience very real and disturbing visions, she suspects they could be related to the recent cases of women gone missing in town. When Clara meets Lily, an ex-Soho art gallery girl who is working at a desolate casino spa and reeling from a personal tragedy, she thinks Lily may be able to help her. But Lily has her own demons to face. If they can put the pieces together in time, they may save another lost girl—so long as their efforts don’t attract perilous attention first. Can they break the ill-fated cycle, or will they join the other victims?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Evocative, eerie, and compelling, &lt;i&gt;Please See Us &lt;/i&gt;is a fast-paced psychological thriller that explores the intersection of womanhood, power, and violence.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An enthralling, atmospheric new novel from Emily Littlejohn, author of acclaimed debut &lt;i&gt;Inherit the Bones&lt;/i&gt;, featuring Colorado police officer Gemma Monroe. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Halloween night in Cedar Valley. During the town’s annual festival, Detective Gemma Monroe takes a break from trick or treating with her family to visit an old family friend, retired Judge Caleb Montgomery, at his law office. To Gemma’s surprise, Caleb seems worried—haunted, even—and confides in her that he’s been receiving anonymous threats. Shortly after, as Gemma strolls back to her car, an explosion at Caleb’s office shatters the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from the shock, Gemma and her team begin eliminating suspects and motives, but more keep appearing in their place, and soon another man is killed. Her investigation takes her from a chilling encounter with a convicted murderer at the Belle Vista Penitentiary, to the gilded rooms of the renovated Shotgun Playhouse, where Shakespeare’s cursed play &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt; is set to open in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet most disturbing of all is when Gemma realizes that similar murders have happened before. There is a copycat killer at play, and if Gemma can’t stop him, he’ll carry out his final, deadly act.</description>

  <description> She has nowhere left to turn… &lt;p&gt;A twisty, compelling, thought-provoking new crime thriller from a major new talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;‘Outstanding, gritty and hard-hitting, yet woven with humour’ Jo Jakeman, author of Sticks and Stones&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A body without a name…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, the body of a young woman is found, naked but for a necklace, tied to a statue outside a block of luxury flats. There should be an outcry. But the police rule it a suicide, and move on.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A case where nothing is as it seems…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private investigators Lee and Jo, owners of No Stone Unturned detective agency in Leeds, are tasked with looking into the case. Who was the woman? Did she really kill herself?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A world where danger lurks around every corner…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they investigate, Lee and Jo uncover shocking secrets. And when they see links between this case and another they are working on, they are forced to question – is any woman ever truly safe in this world? And are they risking their own lives by delving too deep?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>All your friends are invited. But which of them will survive?&lt;br /&gt;An addictive and twisty psychological thriller about the dark secrets that lie within a peaceful neighbourhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight friends. Eight secrets. One killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A group of old friends gather in a peaceful suburban street for a dinner party.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are expecting a fun evening of wine, food and pleasant company. But then they start to play the game…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s about trust and dark secrets – it tests marriage to its limits – and none of them can begin to imagine its consequences.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because the next day, two guests are dead and the others are trapped in a nightmare…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Here Henry was, once again in a bustling train station, ready to resume where he had left off all those years ago…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding Henry Applebee is a charming, tender and uplifting story about unlikely friendships, the power of love – and how it's never too late to change your life. Perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;The Single Ladies of the Jacaranda Retirement Village&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighty-five-year-old Henry Arthur Applebee has had a pretty good life. But one regret has haunted him for the last sixty-five years.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And so, on an ordinary December morning, he boards a train from London to Edinburgh. His goal is simple: to find the woman who disappeared from his life decades earlier. But Henry isn’t the only person on a mission. Also bound for Edinburgh is troubled teen, Ariel. And when the two strangers collide, what began as one humble journey will catapult them both into a whole new world…</description>

  <description>Several books have been published about Vice President Mike Pence, but none have touched upon what may be the most fascinating aspect of our nation’s second in command: his deep faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Faith of Mike Pence&lt;/i&gt; offers an intimate look at the man who calls himself “a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.”&lt;br /&gt; Author Leslie Montgomery details Pence’s spiritual journey and examines how the vice president’s commitment to Christ has been a key component in his life as a husband, father, and public servant. Montgomery examines Pence’s encounters with politicos and evangelistic leaders such as James Dobson and Charles Lake. She shows the role of Pence’s faith in running for various offices, implementing faith-based initiatives, and responding to 9/11, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the infamous Anthrax scare in Congress that directly affected him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Faith of Mike Pence&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful account of one of the most conservative vice presidents in American history, with exclusive interviews and insightful commentary from friends, family, and colleagues. It is a serious and moving reflection about one of America’s most admired and respected politicians.</description>

  <description>In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Dr. Dylan Reinhart and Detective Elizabeth Needham--now known to audiences from the top-rated CBS series--reunite to stop the most sinister plot against New York City since 9/11.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The murder of an Ivy League professor pulls Dr. Dylan Reinhart out of his ivory tower and onto the streets of New York, where he reunites with his old partner, Detective Elizabeth Needham. As the worst act of terror since 9/11 strikes the city, a name on the casualty list rocks Dylan's world. Is his secret past about to be brought to light?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the terrorist attack unfolds, Elizabeth Needham does something courageous that thrusts her into the media spotlight. She's a reluctant hero. And thanks to the attention, she also becomes a prime target for the ruthless murderer behind the attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan literally wrote the book on the psychology of murder, and he and Elizabeth have solved cases that have baffled conventional detectives. But the sociopath they're facing this time is the opposite of a textbook case. There's no time to study for the test he's about to give them. And if they fail, they die. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>While working on the Horn of Africa, archaeologist Morgan Adler's work and life are threatened, forcing her to make a desperate dash to a nearby US military base to beg for protection. Green Beret Pax Blanchard has orders to intercept Dr. Adler before she reaches the base, and in so doing saves her life, but his responsibilities toward protecting the woman have only just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan and Pax are forced to work together in the scorching desert heat, but it is the fire that ignites between them that threatens to consume them both. He protects her by day, but can he keep his hands off her when the sun goes down? One thing is certain, his job is no longer a matter of following orders, and he will risk everything to keep her safe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“One of the freshest voices in mental health and wellness.”&lt;br /&gt;—Marci Smirnoff, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Chicken Soup for the Woman’s Soul&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you feel like you’re not where you’re supposed to be, off track or simply exhausted from trying so hard to make things work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your “true self” has an easier plan—and is just aching to show you the way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The relentless pressure to succeed, measure up, and reach for ever higher goals can leave us feeling like we’re just not good enough—or that something’s missing. At the end of the day, after giving it our all, the last thing we want to feel is hopeless, anxious, and disconnected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;International speaker and empowerment coach Shannon Kaiser understands why so many of us, despite our best intentions, cling to these patterns. Better yet, Kaiser knows how to get us out of the vicious, draining cycle. Committed to finding meaning, connection, and joy in our day-to-day lives, she’s traveled the world in search of the universal truths and spiritual wisdom we desperately need today. &lt;i&gt;Joy Seeker&lt;/i&gt; is her transformational approach to life, drawn from her own life-changing experiences. It is a path to discovering our true self—the hero within.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Joy Seeker&lt;/i&gt; plan:&lt;br /&gt;• Get unstuck and discover what matters most&lt;br /&gt;• Regain hope and faith in yourself, others, and the world&lt;br /&gt;• Discover the “poetry within”—that special thing that makes you so unique&lt;br /&gt;• Gain the courage to actualize yourself and your deepest desires&lt;br /&gt;• Live with more purpose, passion, and freedom&lt;br /&gt;The path of the Joy Seeker is an intimate, active pursuit filled with opportunities for journaling as well as “Joy Jaunts”—exercises designed to help us break out of our comfort zone. It’s time to become your best self. It’s time to live worry-free in your wildest dreams. It’s time to be your own Joy Seeker.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Who couldn’t use some more joy in their life? Shannon is an expert in all things happiness, and this guidebook shows us what’s possible when we remove fear and choose love.”&lt;br /&gt;—Emma Loewe, Editor at&lt;i&gt; mindbodygreen&lt;/i&gt; and co-author of &lt;i&gt;The Spirit Almanac: A Modern Guide to Ancient Self-Care &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Three days before a key election, U.S. Senator Diane Cragin is electrocuted on her own doorstep—a shocking twist in an already brutal political race. Cragin’s chief of staff is quick to blame rival Joey Green, a city development director who’s had his hand in every till in town for over twenty years. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Maggie and Jack have their own theories, especially after discovering a fortune in cash in the senator’s safe. But as they follow the money through the treacherous landscape of Cleveland politics, they find many more millions in play—and more suspects. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; As Jack says, “Anyone can be dangerous, when they have what they think is a good reason.” He should know. Now a &lt;i&gt;Herald &lt;/i&gt;reporter is perilously close to discovering the truth about Jack’s penchant for acting as both detective and executioner. With each passing hour, the stresses of the impending election expose new fractures and corruption at the city’s highest levels. And as one murder leads to another, and another, Maggie and Jack’s only hope of stopping a killer is an alliance that’s growing ever more fragile.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Kathy Ryan’s work as an occult investigator often leads her to the outskirts of society, law, and even reality…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing that other dimensions exist is one thing. Venturing into them is quite another. In the course of its experiments, Paragon Corp—a government-sourced theoretical physics research institute—has discovered a supposedly empty alternate world. There is strange, alien flora but seemingly no sentient beings…just a huge, abandoned city that a team of scientists is sent to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the scientists disappear. Kathy Ryan is hired to make her first foray into an alternate dimension in order to locate the team, bring them back, and close the gate for good. Instead, she discovers that this supposedly dead city may be nothing of the kind. Her rescue mission has become a terrifying race to prevent the potential destruction of the boundary between two worlds—before mayhem reigns over both…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the novels of Mary SanGiovanni&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“SanGiovanni evokes a Lovecraftian sensibility in this action-filled story. . . . Scary, suspenseful, smart, and gory, the novel is also beautifully set and described.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;—Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;Savage Woods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A feast of both visceral and existential horror.” &lt;br /&gt;—F.

  <description>No one can be trusted in this unrelenting thriller—pure Ludlum, with friends no less dangerous than foes. Anderson Harp’s William Parker series starts here! &lt;br /&gt;It is 2010 and North Korea is starving its people to pay for its newest high-tech weapons system. The rogue nation has invested all its resources into Peter Nampo, a talented scientist who is developing missile technology capable of eliminating its enemies’ satellites in space and delivering a nuclear payload into the heart of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;Marine recon veteran and small-town prosecutor William Parker is recruited by a dark-ops taskforce run by the CIA and Pentagon. His mission? Infiltrate the Hermit Kingdom and find Nampo’s top-secret location. &lt;br /&gt;As Parker trains for, then launches, his extraordinary operation, he knows his chances of survival are low. But he has no idea he’s about to become part of a mission much more dangerous than the one he set out on. &lt;br /&gt;“Want to see what the military’s really like? Harp knows his stuff.” &lt;br /&gt;—Brad Meltzer, New York Times bestselling author of The President’s Shadow &lt;br /&gt;“Visceral writing and authentic detail make Northern Thunder a masterwork of military fiction.” —Rebecca Cantrell, New York Times bestselling author of The World Beneath &lt;br /&gt;“Tom Clancy at his best!” —James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of Map of Bones &lt;br /&gt;Visit Anderson Harp at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.andersonharp.net" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.andersonharp.net&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>In the most shocking scenario of our time, former Brigadier General Anthony J. Tata takes you inside a brilliantly conceived, brutally executed plot to overthrow our government—from within . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“How do you overturn an election?” It’s a question that has obsessed presidential candidate candidate Jamie Carter ever since her loss to businessman and political neophyte President Jack Smart. In spite of the election results, she’s determined to take what she sees as her rightful place in the White House—through any means possible. First, she establishes residency in North Carolina. Then, when the state’s Pro Tem of the US Senate is found dead, she is appointed to his position by her friend, the governor. Now, there are only three people who stand in her way: the Speaker of the House, the Vice President, and the President himself . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The countdown begins. The assassins are ready. But when one of them tries to kill the CIA Director under Jake Mahegan’s watch, the plan is momentarily disrupted. Jake is able to prevent one murder—but the conspiracy is too big, and too insidious, to stop now. His partner, Cassie Bagwell, is working as a national security strategist for newly appointed Senator Jamie Carter—the mastermind behind one of the bloodiest coups ever conceived. Her highly trained killers are closing in on all the president’s men. And the course of American history will be changed forever—on Assassination Day . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s a total stranger. But she knows who you are…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzi did a bad thing. She’s paying for it now, pregnant, scared, and living in an isolated cottage with her jealous husband, Nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nora moves into the only house nearby, Suzi is delighted to have a friend. So much so that she’s almost tempted to tell Nora her terrible secret. But there’s more to Nora than meets the eye. It’s impossible—does she already know what Suzi did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Elle spends her days in her perfect home, fixated on keeping up appearances. But when her husband betrays her, it unravels a secret going all the way back to her childhood. She’ll do whatever it takes to hold on to him, even if that means murder. After all, she’s done it before…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught up in their own secrets and lies, these strangers will soon realise they have more in common than they could ever have imagined. When a shocking event brings them together, their lives will never be the same again.</description>

  <description>One publicly imploded marriage. Two car accidents. Eight surgeries. And now, a miracle of hard work and storied talent: five Masters wins. Once hailed as "the greatest closer in history" before he fell further than any beloved athlete in America's memory, Tiger swung at the world's wildest expectations and beat the skeptics with his April 2019 championship. Roaring Back traces his road to Augusta and the improbable, phenomenal comeback of one of the greatest golfers in history. New York Times bestselling author Curt Sampson details the highs and lows of Woods's career in three gripping acts. From his startling loss at the 2009 PGA Championship, detrimental obsession with his swing, and that infamous night involving an ex-wife and a nine-iron . . . to adoring fans and lucrative sponsors turning their backs, exclusive interviews with past instructors and PGA tour peers, and an arrest complete with a toxicology report . . . finally to Tiger coming from behind for his fifth green jacket as the crowd rumbled in Georgia, and how his comeback rivals those of the most dramatic in his sport. As this enthralling book reveals, Tiger never doubted the perseverance of the winner in the mirror.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes love needs a little help from Mother Nature—and what better time than the holidays to let it snow . . . and snow . . . and snow . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;STARRY NIGHT * Fern Michaels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the host of a radio program for the lovelorn in Chicago, Jessie Richmond is surprisingly lonely, especially with the holidays approaching. So she decides to make the trek to her uncle’s bookstore in rural New York state and hold a speed dating event—only to find herself snowed in—with one very special single . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;MISTLETOE AND MIMOSAS * Tara Sheets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After years of hard work, real estate agent Layla Gentry has her dream home on Pine Cove Island. She’s perfectly content to be on her own. Until her childhood nemesis, Sebastian, comes to town. When a snowstorm and a stranded kitten bring them together on Christmas Eve, Layla discovers he’s all grown up—and she may have one more dream left . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;MISSING CHRISTMAS * Kate Clayborn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It’s all work and no play for two longtime friends-turned-business-partners Kristen and Jasper—until an unexpected kiss turns things personal. Will it mean the end of something, or the beginning? With a major contract in the balance, Christmas around the corner, and a lot of unspoken feelings, it may take an unpredictable blizzard in New England to seal the deal . . .</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The latest internationally best-selling installment in the Joona Linna series sees him temporarily called back to the police force to solve a series of bizarre and increasingly horrifying murders.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Joona Linna is finishing out a sentence at Kumla prison for assaulting an officer in the course of his last investigation when he is summoned to a meeting with the Swedish prime minister. The foreign minister has been brutally murdered. There's a chance more political figures could be targeted. The police need Linna to find the killer and neutralize the threat, so he's granted a temporary release from prison. But when another murder occurs, Linna realizes he's dealing with something far more complex, and far more terrifying, than anyone imagined. As the body count grows, Linna begins to understand that he can't do this alone and he reaches out to Saga Bauer, the young security police detective, for help. Now, together, the two race against time to unravel the killer's intricate plan before he can take his ultimate revenge.</description>

  <description>In this warm and witty romance from acclaimed author Kate Clayborn, one little word puts one woman’s business—and her heart—in jeopardy . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meg Mackworth’s hand-lettering skill has made her famous as the Planner of Park Slope, designing beautiful custom journals for New York City’s elite. She has another skill too: reading signs that other people miss. Like the time she sat across from Reid Sutherland and his gorgeous fiancée, and knew their upcoming marriage was doomed to fail. Weaving a secret word into their wedding program was a little unprofessional, but she was sure no one else would spot it. She hadn’t counted on sharp-eyed, pattern-obsessed Reid . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, Reid has tracked Meg down to find out—before he leaves New York for good—how she knew that his meticulously planned future was about to implode. But with a looming deadline, a fractured friendship, and a bad case of creative block, Meg doesn’t have time for Reid’s questions—unless he can help her find her missing inspiration. As they gradually open up to each other about their lives, work, and regrets, both try to ignore the fact that their unlikely connection is growing deeper. But the signs are there—irresistible, indisputable, urging Meg to heed the messages Reid is sending her, before it’s too late . . .</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Cloud isn’t just a place to work. It’s a place to live. And when you’re here, you’ll never want to leave.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“On the surface, &lt;i&gt;The Warehouse&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling story of corporate espionage at the highest level, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a terrifying cautionary tale of the nightmare world we are making for ourselves.”—Blake Crouch, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paxton never thought he’d be working for Cloud, the giant tech company that’s eaten much of the American economy. Much less that he’d be moving into one of the company’s sprawling live-work facilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But compared to what’s left outside, Cloud’s bland chainstore life of gleaming entertainment halls, open-plan offices, and vast warehouses…well, it doesn’t seem so bad. It’s more than anyone else is offering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinnia never thought she’d be infiltrating Cloud. But now she’s undercover, inside the walls, risking it all to ferret out the company’s darkest secrets. And Paxton, with his ordinary little hopes and fears? He just might make the perfect pawn. If she can bear to sacrifice him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the truth about Cloud unfolds, Zinnia must gamble everything on a desperate scheme—one that risks both their lives, even as it forces Paxton to question everything about the world he’s so carefully assembled here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they’ll learn just how far the company will go…to make the world a better place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the confines of a corporate panopticon that’s at once brilliantly imagined and terrifyingly real, &lt;i&gt; The Warehouse &lt;/i&gt; is a near-future thriller about what happens when Big Brother meets Big Business--and who will pay the ultimate price.</description>

  <description>In the next powerful mystery from Julia Keller, former West Virginia prosecuting attorney Bell Elkins investigates the murder of a teenager while continuing to rebuild her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell Elkins and Jake Oakes make a good team, so good that they decide after years of working together to hang out their shingle: BJ Investigations, LLC. With his former-cop’s instinctive approach and her former-prosecutor’s affinity for facts, they’re a perfect fit for the routine clients who come their way. It’s not until Amber Slight’s body is uncovered face down in the West Virginia woods that they get their first real challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most of the forensic evidence at the scene destroyed by a week of rain, Bell and Jake have to rely on their wits to figure out what really happened to Amber, a mystery that may lead back to the halls of Ackers Gap High School. As Bell tries to uncover the truth, an old friend returns to town with motives Bell doesn't quite trust. It’s up to Bell to face both challenges, those that could impact the living and those that honor the dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulitzer-prize winner Julia Keller returns to her acclaimed series that is as much about the life of a small Appalachian town as it is about the lives and deaths of its citizens.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, Grace saw something that would forever change the course of history. When evil in its purest form is unleashed on the world, she and others from their religious community are already hidden deep in the hills of Tennessee, abiding by every rule that will keep them safe, pure--and alive. As long as they stay there, behind the red perimeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her older brother's questions and the arrival of the first outsiders she's seen in a decade set in motion events that will question everything Grace has built her life on. Enemies rise on all sides--but who is the real enemy? And what will it cost her to uncover the truth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, bestselling authors Ted Dekker and Rachelle Dekker team up and deliver an intense, tightly focused ride through the most treacherous world of all.</description>

  <description>WHAT DOES THE PERFECT FAMILY HAVE TO FEAR MOST? THE PERFECT STRANGER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the outside, Frank and Grace seem to have the perfect family. He's a loving husband, she's a devoted wife, and together they have two happy children. But appearances can be deceiving. A strange series of misfortunes has left them reeling: an unexplained break-in, a catastrophic handgun accident, and a bizarre poisoning that's left Grace feeling especially unnerved. Packing up their RV for a move across the country, they're ready for a fresh start, expecting to leave all their problems safely behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one night on the road to their new home, the figure of a young woman emerges from the darkness, causing them to swerve off the road. The injured stranger says her name is Mara. Miles from help, Frank does what any decent man would do. He invites Mara to stay. But Mara is hiding a secret. And she is not the only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it all just another inexplicable accident? Or has Frank opened the door to an escalating family nightmare designed to tear his perfect world apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2019 Paul Pen, Translation © 2019 by Simon Bruni.

  <description>The voice in her head says he’s guilty. She knows he’s innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devon Burges is in the throes of a high-risk birth when she learns of her dear friend’s murder. The police quickly name another friend as the chief suspect, but Devon doesn’t buy it—and despite her difficult recovery, she decides to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by postpartum problems that manifest as a cruel voice in her head, Devon is barely getting by. Yet her instincts are still sharp, and she’s bent on proving her friend’s innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Devon digs into the evidence, the voice in her head grows more insistent, the danger more intense. Each layer is darker, more disturbing, and she’s not sure she—or her baby—can survive what lies at the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;They have the perfect marriage. Did one of them kill to get it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep school sweethearts Ian and Andi Copeland are envied by everyone they know. They have successful businesses, a beautiful house in St. Louis, and their eldest daughter, Cassidy, is following in their footsteps by attending prestigious Glenlake Academy. Then, a submerged car is dredged from the bottom of a swimming hole near the campus. So are the remains of a former writer-in-residence who vanished twenty years ago—during Ian and Andi’s senior year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cassidy’s journalism class begins investigating the death, Ian and Andi’s high school secrets rise to the surface. Each has a troubled link to the man whose arrival and sudden disappearance once set the school on edge. And each had a reason to want him gone. As Cassidy unwittingly edges closer to the truth, unspoken words, locked away for decades, will force Ian and Andi to question what they really know—about themselves, about the past, and about a marriage built on a murderous lie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;John Urschel, mathematician and former offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens--with biographer Louisa Thomas--tells the story of a life balanced between two passions&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For John Urschel, what began as an insatiable appetite for puzzles as a child quickly evolved into mastery of the elegant systems and rules of mathematics. By the time he was thirteen, Urschel was auditing college-level calculus courses. But when he joined his high school football team, a new interest began to eclipse the thrill he once felt in the classroom. Football challenged Urschel in an entirely different way, and he became addicted to the physical contact of the sport. Accepting a scholarship to play football at Penn State, Urschel refused to sacrifice one passion for another, and simultaneously pursued his bachelor's and then master's degrees in mathematics. Against the odds, Urschel found a way to manage his double life as a scholar and an athlete, and so when he was drafted to the Baltimore Ravens, he enrolled in his PhD at MIT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together two separate yet bound narratives, Urschel relives for us the most pivotal moments of his bifurcated life. He explains why, after Penn State was sanctioned for the acts of former coach Jerry Sandusky, he turned his back on offers from Ivy League universities and refused to abandon his team, and contends with his mother's repeated request, at the end of every season, that he quit the sport and pursue a career in rocket science. Perhaps most personally, he opens up about the correlation between football and CTE, and the risks he took for the game he loves. Equally at home with both Bernard Riemann's notion of infinity and Bill Belichick's playbook, Urschel reveals how each challenge - whether on the field or in the classroom - has brought him closer to understanding the two different halves of his own life, and how reason and emotion, the mind and the body, are always working together. He asks why, "So often, people want to divide the world into two. Matter and energy. Wave and particle. Athlete and mathematician. Why can't something be both?"</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From “the next major voice in Southern fiction” (Elin Hilderbrand) and the bestselling author of the Peachtree Bluff series comes an odd couple tale of friendship that asks just how much our past choices define our happiness. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s summertime on the North Carolina coast and the livin’ is easy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unless, that is, you’ve just lost your mother to cancer, your sister to her evangelical husband, and your husband to his executive assistant. Meet Gray Howard. Right when Gray could use a serious infusion of good karma in her life, she inadvertently gets a stranger fired from her job at the local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diana Harrington’s summer isn’t off to the greatest start either: Hours before losing her job, she broke up with her boyfriend and moved out of their shared house with only a busted Impala for a bed. Lucky for her, Gray has an empty guest house and a very guilty conscience.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Gray’s kindness, Diana’s tide begins to turn, but when the one that got away comes back, every secret from her past seems to resurface all at once. And, as Gray begins to blaze a new trail, she discovers, with Diana’s help, that what she envisioned as her perfect life may not be what she wants at all.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her warmest, wittiest, and wisest novel yet, Kristy Woodson Harvey delivers a discerning portrait of modern womanhood through two vastly different lenses. &lt;i&gt;Feels Like Falling &lt;/i&gt;is a beach bag essential for Harvey fans—and for a new generation of readers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An ex-con tracks down the men who have kidnapped her niece in this gritty and visceral thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Killian Delaney has a skewed moral compass, a high threshold for pain, and has just been released from prison to discover that someone has taken her niece. &lt;br /&gt;Killian does not hesitate. Loyalty is the most important thing in her life, and when she gets a call from her sister saying that her daughter is missing, Killian immediately begins hunting down the men responsible. &lt;br /&gt;She quickly discovers her niece was involved with a notorious biker gang who are engaged in everything from drugs to human trafficking. And to make it worse, the man who sent Killian to jail, the one she nearly beat to death, is at the center of it all.&lt;br /&gt;To save her niece, she'll need a plan. A smart, quick, and efficient one. Because she's going to do it right this time. She'll burn them to the ground.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Paris, her twin sister has vanished, leaving behind three chilling words: &lt;i&gt;Trust no one&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shayna Darby is finally coming to terms with her parents’ deaths when she’s delivered another blow. The body of her estranged twin sister, Angela—the possible victim of a serial killer—has been pulled from the Seine. Putting what’s left of her life on hold, Shayna heads to Paris. But while cleaning out Angela’s apartment, Shayna make a startling discovery: a coded message meant for her alone…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alive. Trust no one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the warning to heart, Shayna maintains the lie. She makes a positive ID on the remains and works to find out where—and why—her missing sister is hiding. Shayna retraces her sister’s footsteps, and they lead her down into Paris’s underbelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets closer to the truth—and to the killer—Shayna’s own life may now be in the balance…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Catherine excels at helping desperate people disappear. But now she must use her unique skill set to find a missing woman in this electrifying novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Burial Society&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eva Lombard is being followed. Or so she suspects. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eva and her husband, Peter, are in Hong Kong on a romantic getaway from London when Peter wakes up in their hotel room to an empty bed, his wife gone without a trace. His worst fears are confirmed: Eva wasn’t imagining things. Suddenly, he finds himself the number one suspect in his wife’s disappearance, trapped in a foreign country with no one to turn to. He calls his boss, Forrest “Holly” Holcomb, who enlists the help of Catherine, his ex-flame and the enigmatic operator behind the darknet witness-protection program known as the Burial Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a favor to Holly, Catherine sends her team of highly trained Society members on a dangerous chase through Hong Kong to find Eva—while she takes care of pressing business at home. Not only is she tasked with a mission in Mexico City, protecting a family that knows too much from a vengeful pharmaceutical company, but an FBI agent tracking down the missing wife and child of a charismatic businessman is about to come dangerously close to exposing the Society’s secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In these intertwining story lines that converge in unexpected ways, not everyone is who they appear to be—and not everyone who is lost wants to be found.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nothing hurts like the truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Rowan Dupont knows a serial killer is coming for her. Julian Addington has been waiting. Watching. And it’s only a matter of time before he strikes. But what Julian doesn’t know is that Rowan is ready for him. And more than anything she wants answers. How well did the depraved killer actually know her mother? And how many lies have been spun in the years since she took her own life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working alongside her childhood friend Police Chief Billy Brannigan, Rowan is determined to get to the bottom of her mother’s puzzling suicide once and for all—even if it means exposing an unsettling past. It certainly seems like her family’s Victorian funeral home has borne witness to more than one dark secret, but when a recent double homicide leads to an even grislier discovery, separating the truth from the lies might be the last thing Rowan does.</description>

  <description>Rosie Hopkins is looking forward to Christmas in the little Derbyshire village of Lipton, buried under a thick blanket of snow. Her sweetshop is festooned with striped candy canes, large tempting piles of Turkish Delight, crinkling selection boxes and happy, sticky children. She's going to be spending it with her boyfriend, Stephen, and her family, flying in from Australia. She can't wait. But when a tragedy strikes at the heart of their little community, all of Rosie's plans for the future seem to be blown apart. Can she build a life in Lipton? And is what's best for the sweetshop also what's best for Rosie?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;My Lovely Wife&lt;/i&gt; in this tightly drawn debut that peels back the layers of the most complicated of mother-daughter relationships...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first eighteen years of her life, Rose Gold Watts believed she was seriously ill. She was allergic to everything, used a wheelchair and practically lived at the hospital. Neighbors did all they could, holding fundraisers and offering shoulders to cry on, but no matter how many doctors, tests, or surgeries, no one could figure out what was wrong with Rose Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out her mom, Patty Watts, was just a really good liar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After serving five years in prison, Patty gets out with nowhere to go and begs her daughter to take her in. The entire community is shocked when Rose Gold says yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patty insists all she wants is to reconcile their differences. She says she's forgiven Rose Gold for turning her in and testifying against her. But Rose Gold knows her mother. Patty Watts always settles a score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Patty, Rose Gold is no longer her weak little darling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she's waited such a long time for her mother to come home.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A comprehensive analysis of Donald Trump's legal history reveals his temperament, methods, character, and morality. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike all previous presidents who held distinguished positions in government or the military prior to entering office, Donald Trump's political worldview was molded in the courtroom. He sees law not as a system of rules to be obeyed and ethical ideals to be respected, but as a weapon to be used against his adversaries or a hurdle to be sidestepped when it gets in his way. He has weaponized the justice system throughout his career, and he has continued to use these backhanded tactics as &lt;i&gt;Plaintiff in Chief&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, distinguished New York attorney James D. Zirin presents Trump's lengthy litigation history as an indication of his character and morality, and his findings are chilling: if you partner with Donald Trump, you will probably wind up litigating with him. If you enroll in his university or buy one of his apartments, chances are you will want your money back. If you are a woman and you get too close to him, you may need to watch your back. If you try to sue him, he's likely to defame you. If you make a deal with him, you had better get it in writing. If you are a lawyer, an architect, or even his dentist, you'd better get paid up front. If you venture an opinion that publicly criticizes him, you may be sued for libel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A window into the president's dark legal history, &lt;i&gt;Plaintiff in Chief&lt;/i&gt; is as informative as it is disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty years after her sharp, seminal first book Sex and the City reshaped the landscape of pop culture and dating with its fly on the wall look at the mating rituals of the Manhattan elite, the trailblazing Candace Bushnell delivers a new book on the wilds and lows of sex and dating after fifty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set between the Upper East Side of Manhattan and a country enclave known as The Village, Is There Still Sex in the City? gathers Bushnell’s signature short, sharp, satirical commentaries on the love and dating habits of middle aged men and women as they continue to navigate the ever-modernizing world of relationships. Throughout, Bushnell documents 21st century dating phenomenon, such as the “Unintended Cub Situation” in which a sensible older woman suddenly becomes the love interest of a much younger man, the “Mona Lisa” Treatment—a vaginal restorative surgery often recommended to middle aged women, and what it’s really like to go on Tinder dates as a fifty something divorcee. Bushnell also updates one of her most celebrated stories from Sex and the City, “The Bicycle Boys,” a breed of New York man who was always trying to bring his bike up to women’s apartments. Once an anomaly, Bushnell charts their new ubiquitousness, in addition to where, and how to do your own man stalking via bicycle (and whether or not it’s worth it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Is There Still Sex in The City? Bushnell looks at love and life from all angles—marriage and children, divorce and bereavement, as well as the very real pressures on women to maintain their youth and have it all. This is a pull-no-punches social commentary and an indispensable companion to one of the most revolutionary dating books of the twentieth century.</description>

  <description>Written by Rachael Denhollander, recipient of &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Inspiration of the Year Award&lt;/b&gt; and one of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;'s &lt;b&gt;100 Most Influential People (2018)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Who is going to tell these little girls that what was done to them matters? That they are seen and valued, that they are not alone and they are not unprotected?"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachael Denhollander's voice was heard around the world when she spoke out to end the most shocking US gymnastics scandal in history. The first victim to publicly accuse Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who sexually abused hundreds of young athletes, Rachael now reveals her full story for the first time. How did Nassar get away with it for so long? How did Rachael and the other survivors finally stop him and bring him to justice? And how can we protect the vulnerable in our own families, churches, and communities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Is a Girl Worth?&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring true story of Rachael's journey from an idealistic young gymnast to a strong and determined woman who found the courage to raise her voice against evil, even when she thought the world might not listen. &lt;b&gt;In this crucial cultural moment of #metoo and #churchtoo, &lt;/b&gt; this deeply personal and compelling narrative shines a spotlight on the physical and emotional impact of abuse, why so many survivors are reluctant to speak out, what it means to be believed, the extraordinary power of faith and forgiveness, and how we can learn to do what's right in the moments that matter most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published by Tyndale, this inspirational, empowering book is available in both hardcover and e-book editions.</description>

  <description>Sean Tennant and Molly Winter are living quietly and cautiously in Houston when a troubled, obsessive stranger shatters the safety they have carefully constructed for themselves. Sean is at a shopping mall when Henry Alan Keen, scorned by a woman he's been dating, pulls out a gun at the store where she works and begins shooting everyone in sight. A former soldier, Sean rushes toward Keen and ends the slaughter with two well-placed shots--becoming a hero with his face plastered across the news.&lt;br /&gt; But Sean's newfound notoriety exposes him to the wrath of two men he thought he had left safely in his past. One of them blames Sean for his brother's death. The other wants to recover a treasure that Sean and Molly stole from him. Both men are deadly and relentless enemies, and Sean and Molly will need to draw on all their strength and devotion to each other if they hope to elude them. Thus begins a cross-country chase that leads from Texas to Montana, from Tennessee to New York to Michigan, as the hunters and their prey grow ever closer and, in a heart-stopping moment, converge.&lt;br /&gt; A wickedly clever and exhilarating thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Good Killer&lt;/i&gt; offers a sophisticated, breathtaking look at the extremes people will reach for love, greed, and survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An exposé and cry of outrage at the cruelty and chaos the Trump administration has wrought at the border with child separations, border blockades, and a massive gulag of child prisons housing thousands.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff Merkley couldn't believe his eyes. He never dreamed the United States could treat vulnerable young families with such calculated brutality. Few had witnessed what Merkley discovered just by showing up at the border and demanding to see what was going on behind closed doors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the official stories and soothing videos, he found mothers and children, newborn babies and infants, stranded for days on border bridges in blistering heat or locked up in ice-cold holding pens. There were nearly 1,500 boys jammed into a former Walmart, a child tent prison in the desert with almost 3,000 boys and girls, and children struggling to survive in gang-filled Mexican border towns after they were blocked from seeking asylum in the United States. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, there were the children ripped out of their parents' arms and sorted into cages in some profoundly warped attempt to discourage migration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was how the Trump administration treated the child victims of unspeakable violence that had driven them from their homes: as pawns in a power play rather than as humans worthy of respect and dignity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was Merkley's visits -- captured live on viral video -- that triggered worldwide outrage at the forced separation of children from their parents. Just by taking an interest -- by caring about the people legally claiming asylum at America's borders -- Merkley helped expose the Trump administration's war on migrant families. Along the way, he helped turn the tide against some of its worst excesses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMERICA IS BETTER THAN THIS tells the inside story of how one senator, with no background as an immigration activist, became a leading advocate for reform of the brutal policies that have created a humanitarian crisis on the southern U.S. border. It represents the heartfelt and candid voice of a concerned American who believes his country stands for something far bigger and better.</description>

  <description>Mat Best may be the only man alive known for both crazy-intense military ops and crazy-funny YouTube videos. In &lt;i&gt;Freedom On!&lt;/i&gt;, he uses the gallows humor and ribald sensibility that earned him over a million Facebook followers to tell his personal story of military service and the bumpy transition to civilian life and successful entrepreneurship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning as a teenager in a military family dealing with 9/11, continuing through the intensity of four years as an Army Ranger and five years as a private military contractor, and concluding with one of the most meaningful moments in Best's life--screening a movie he wrote, produced, and starred in for soldiers deployed overseas--Best gives readers a fuller sense of the person they might only know from his major online and video persona.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next exciting installment in bestselling David Rosenfelt's Doug Brock series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Doug Brock hasn't had it easy since his getting shot in the line of duty as a New Jersey state police officer. Between the amnesia and having to solve two murder cases, it hasn't been the most restful recovery. He's slowly earning back the trust of his girlfriend Jessie, since he doesn't remember their breakup, and has focused on new crimes with his partner, Nate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now an old case of Doug's has resurfaced, and it's up to Doug to retrace his steps - steps he can't remember - to solve the case. Eighteen months ago, Walter Brookings was shot through the heart. With no clear motive and no similar murders, the investigation stalled and became a cold case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When another man is murdered in the same fashion and the ballistics come back as a match, Doug begins to reinvestigate, and starts to question his own actions from the previous investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, what Doug uncovers may be more dangerous than any case he's faced yet.</description>

  <description>For over five years, the Four Monkey Killer has terrorized the residents of Chicago. When his body is found, the police quickly realize he was on his way to deliver one final message, one which proves he has taken another victim who may still be alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the lead investigator on the 4MK task force, Detective Sam Porter knows even in death, the killer is far from finished. When he discovers a personal diary in the jacket pocket of the body, Porter finds himself caught up in the mind of a psychopath, unraveling a twisted history in hopes of finding one last girl, all while struggling with personal demons of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only a handful of clues, the elusive killer’s identity remains a mystery. Time is running out and the Four Monkey Killer taunts from beyond the grave in this masterfully written fast-paced thriller.</description>

  <description>After serving a lengthy sentence for the murder of her husband, Dolly Rawlins is free from prison. And she’s only got one thing on her mind: the diamonds she stashed before the police caught her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But there are people waiting for Dolly on the outside ­- tough ex-prisoners who know about the diamonds, and they all want a cut.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Also waiting for Dolly is DS Mike Withey. He holds her personally responsible for the death of his sister in the diamond raid ten years earlier. And he wants her back inside.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Dolly Rawlins has other plans. But can she realise the dream that kept her going all those years in prison and avoid those who are after her?</description>

  <description>Once, I would never have imagined myself here. But I’m settled now. In a place I love, in a home I renovated, spending time with new friends I adore, and working a job that fulfills me. I am reconciling the past and laying the groundwork for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Garrett Frost moves in next door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s obstinate and too bold, a raging force of nature that disrupts the careful order of my life. I recognize the ghosts that haunt him, the torment driving him. Garrett would be risky in any form, but wounded, he’s far more dangerous. I fear I’m too fragile for the storm raging inside him, too delicate to withstand the pain that buffets him. But he’s too determined…and too tempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sometimes hope soars above even the iciest desolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emotional and heartrending, the &lt;i&gt;Butterfly in Frost&lt;/i&gt; novella marks a brilliant return by global sensation Sylvia Day, the #1 international multimillion bestselling author of the Crossfire saga.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It’s a surprising second act for two women who decide to rewrite their lives in this enriching novel of friendship and starting over from the bestselling author of Only One Life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thirty years, college friends Lena Browder and Olivia Westcoat have met again by chance at an unexpected crossroads: an airport lounge in Atlanta. Lena is running away from home and her demanding family. Olivia is trying to find her way after a painful divorce. With their old selves in the rearview, they toast to a new beginning—and it starts with a spontaneous dare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to trade houses for a month of rediscovery, Lena will stay in Olivia’s Charleston condo. Olivia’s retreat? Lena’s isolated river cottage in the Northern Neck of Virginia. Two perfect getaways. Thirty-four days to reset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With fresh new perspectives and the renewal of a heartening friendship, Lena and Olivia find their passions, reinvent themselves, and reclaim what they’ve lost. When unexpected romance blooms and careers take new detours, it’s also a time for courage and risk. Now they’ll have to make hard choices to follow through on their promise for a second chance and finally have the lives they dream of.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"He promised to kill me when he got out. I believed him. If I wanted justice, I had to fight both him and the courts...maybe kill him first. If I didn't do something, I was going to die."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a manufactured dialogue from a thriller but the words of attorney Sharon Muse. They came after she survived an attempted kidnapping, rape, and murder at the hands of Hank Morrison, a former client. On April 7, 2006, Muse miraculously escaped from the sociopathic Morrison, only to find that the threat to her life was just beginning. Ineptitude in the justice system threatened to release Morrison and allow him the opportunity to finish the job, which he adamantly pledged to do. Muse would have to fight at every step to ensure her safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muse would act as her own advocate, investigator, legal counsel, and bodyguard in the years following the event. &lt;i&gt;Kidnapped by a Client&lt;/i&gt; covers the brutal kidnapping, two trials, two appeals, procedural errors galore, one Supreme Court reversal, and even Muse's intricate plan to murder Morrison before he could get to her. Muse would not ultimately execute that plan, and she would emerge victorious in the legal battle thanks to her faith and her own determination and legal acumen. But her safety is not ensured: Morrison is up for parole in 2026. Muse regularly monitors his status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muse recounts her stranger-than-fiction story in &lt;i&gt;Kidnapped by a Client&lt;/i&gt;. Muse analyzes the failures of the legal system, the mistakes she made, the steps she took to protect herself, and how she has coped with trauma. Readers will find not only a compelling narrative, but also insight into how to protect oneself and ensure one's own safety and well-being.</description>

  <description>An astonishing and evocative debut from a new voice in crime fiction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And now he knew what was wrong with the arrangement. It was the Ma… the negative space… There was only one thing beautiful enough to fill it and — finally — she was with him. Ready, if not willing, to play her role.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly Blain wants to cover real news. The entertainment beat — pop stars and teen trends — was not why she moved to Tokyo. When she meets Inspector Tetsu Tanaka, head of Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police’s Gaikoku-jin unit, it might just be her big break. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tanaka isn’t so sure. Always one to do things by the book, he’s hesitant about bringing this headstrong reporter into his carefully controlled investigation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But young women keep disappearing and Tanaka is given no choice. He and Blain must trust each other if they are to stop a tormented killer from bringing his twisted plan to its shocking conclusion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Filled with twists and turns, this unforgettable thriller is JJ Ellis’ first novel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRAISE FOR &lt;i&gt;THE FLOWER ARRANGER&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'THE FLOWER ARRANGER grabs you by the lapels from the first sentence. &lt;b&gt;Brutal, beautiful, and dripping with darkness&lt;/b&gt;, JJ Ellis has served up a &lt;b&gt;riveting&lt;/b&gt; mystery.' — Nicolás Obregón, author of &lt;i&gt;Blue Light Yokohama&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'&lt;b&gt;Lyrical and chilling&lt;/b&gt;, The Flower Arranger is a dangerous dive into the dark heart of Tokyo' — M K Hill, author of &lt;i&gt;The Bad Place&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'The &lt;b&gt;perfect balance&lt;/b&gt; – the beauty of Japanese culture mingled with the dark side of Tokyo’s nightlife. &lt;b&gt;Thrilling from start to finish&lt;/b&gt;.' — Sam Hurcom, author of &lt;i&gt;A Shadow on the Lens&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'I will read whatever JJ Ellis publishes next!' — Clare Rhoden, author of &lt;i&gt;The Stars in the Night&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'a welcome change from your typical thriller.' — Michele, NetGalley Reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'kept me &lt;b&gt;hooked&lt;/b&gt;.' — Anisa, NetGalley Reviewer &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first comprehensive adult biography of the beloved, redheaded “Shape of You” songster, complete with exclusive interviews and all-new research!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grammy-award winner Ed Sheeran strikes chords in millions of listeners worldwide—a feat all the more staggering given that he couldn’t even carry a tune until the age of fifteen. At thirteen, then just a guitarist in a school rock band, today’s most successful solo star decided he would fly far higher than hometown fame. Within a year, he had recorded an album in his bedroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bestselling biographer Sean Smith traces the astonishing journey of the shy little English boy with a stammer who, avoiding flashy showmanship, grew up to become a global phenomenon. With compelling new research and interviews, Smith delivers the story of Sheeran’s remarkable parents, who supported their son’s dream long before it seemed achievable; the friends and mentors who encouraged his raw talent; and the lovers who inspired his most famous songs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Smith describes the setbacks Sheeran faced before his fortunes were transformed by Elton John’s management company, a record deal, and a song that changed everything…with some help from Taylor Swift. Now Sheeran has sold 150 million records worldwide, earned $432 million touring in 2018 alone, and broke records with his 2018 UK tour—but still made time to play for just 400 people at a charity night to raise money for the homeless last year. As this captivating book reveals, there’s no one quite like Ed.</description>

  <description>Sadie and Will Foust have only just moved their family from bustling Chicago to small-town Maine when their neighbor, Morgan Baines, is found dead in her home. The murder rocks their tiny coastal island, but no one is more shaken than Sadie, who is terrified by the thought of a killer in her very own backyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not just Morgan’s death that has Sadie on edge. It’s their eerie old home, with its decrepit decor and creepy attic, which they inherited from Will’s sister after she died unexpectedly. It’s Will’s disturbed teenage niece Imogen, with her dark and threatening presence. And it’s the troubling past that continues to wear at the seams of their family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the eyes of suspicion turn toward the new family in town, Sadie is drawn deeper into the mystery of Morgan’s death. But Sadie must be careful, for the more she discovers about Mrs. Baines, the more she begins to realize just how much she has to lose if the truth ever comes to light.</description>

  <description>Lights blinded her in an eerie white flash. She yanked the wheel as she felt the impact from the car behind her. There was a sharp pain, and then a bang in front of her, and after that nothing but darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Kendal is trying to put her painful past and broken marriage behind her and focus on her beloved son, Milo. But while driving him home on a dark February night, Holly loses control on the rain-slicked tarmac, and her car spirals off the road.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Holly regains consciousness, everything is silent and in the dark, she can’t see Milo. Desperately, she claws her way out of the car and forces the back door open.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To her relief, Milo is where she left him, injured but breathing – but then she sees something that makes her heart stop.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Milo isn't the only child in the car. Next to him is another little boy, unharmed but unconscious.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Holly has absolutely no idea who he is.</description>

  <description> A cheating wife. An estranged mother. But is she guilty of murder? &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please raise your right hand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An affair at work has cost Julia Winter her job and her marriage. There’s no denying she has let her family down.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please remain standing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a body is discovered on the North Downs, it hits local headlines. But for Julia, the news is doubly shocking because the body was buried just opposite the house she lived in over twenty years ago. And it is one of her former housemates.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please resume your seat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up on the stand, Julia’s not the only person to have secrets that are unearthed during the trial. But the evidence against her is overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And yet one question remains: is she the murderer, or the victim?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurors, you may be excused.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </description>

  <description>In the small north Florida town of Seabrook, a young lawyer named Keith Russo was shot dead at his desk as he worked late one night. The killer left no clues behind. There were no witnesses, no real suspects, no one with a motive. The police soon settled on Quincy Miller, a young black man who was once a client of Russo’s. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quincy was framed, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison with no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. Then he wrote a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small innocence group founded by a lawyer/minister named Cullen Post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guardian handles only a few innocence cases at a time, and Post is its only investigator. He travels the South fighting wrongful convictions and taking cases no one else will touch. With Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy exonerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another one without a second thought.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;A shocking true crime tale of money, power, and sex from the world's most popular thriller writer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Jeffrey Epstein rose from humble origins to the rarefied heights of New York City's financial elite. A college dropout with an instinct for numbers--and for people--Epstein amassed his wealth through a combination of access and skill. But even after he had it all, Epstein wanted more. And that unceasing desire--especially a taste for young girls--resulted in his stunning fall from grace. From Epstein himself, to the girls he employed as masseuses at his home, to the cops investigating the appalling charges against him, FILTHY RICH examines all sides of a case that scandalized one of America's richest communities. An explosive true story, FILTHY RICH is a riveting account of wealth, power and the influence they bring to bear on the American justice system.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He was told he'd never walk again. She was losing hope that she'd ever feel whole again. This is their miraculous true story of defying the impossible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"In my very first impression of Chris, I was blown away by his determination to stay positive, do the work, and trust that God had a bigger story in mind . . . this book is a master class in the power of perseverance." -Tim Tebow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quadriplegics simply do not walk again - yet millions watched as Chris Norton defied incredible odds and took step by impossible step across his graduation stage. With his fiancée Emily by his side, those unbelievable steps became the start of an extraordinary journey for them both. Told from both of their unique perspectives, this moving story invites you to find, as Chris and Emily have, that God can transform our lowest points into life's greatest gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a moment, Chris went from a talented college football player with a promising future to a quadriplegic with a 3 percent chance of ever moving or feeling anything below his neck, much less walking again. Determined to prove the doctors wrong, he pushed himself through grueling, daily workouts to achieve his goal four years later: walking the stage to receive his college diploma with Emily's help, and to the world's astonished applause.                  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Emily faced her own challenges as she sunk into a deep battle against anxiety and depression, despite her life's outward blessings. Day by day, decision by decision, Chris and Emily committed themselves to taking the extra step, trusting God, and leaning on the help of others. In a story of courageous faith and grit, this extraordinary couple's journey ultimately led them to tackle the seven longest yards - down the wedding aisle and into a new life together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a new life it is: Chris and Emily have adopted five beautiful girls and welcomed foster children - seventeen and counting! - into their home and hearts. Let this book be your inspiration for defying your own impossible, and finding joy on the other side.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Every Wednesday, like clockwork, the terror returns.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like an ordinary Wednesday, until the phone rings. A mysterious caller with a chilling threat. Journalist Alice Henderson hangs up, ready to dismiss it as a hoax against the newspaper. But the next Wednesday, the stalker makes another move—and it becomes clear that this is all about Alice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone wants her to suffer, but for what? Her articles have made her a popular local champion—could it be her past rather than her work that’s put her life in danger? Alice is determined not to give in to fear, but with the police investigation at a dead end, her boyfriend insists on hiring private investigator Matthew Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every Wednesday the warnings escalate, until it’s not only Alice but also her family in the stalker’s sights. As her tormentor closes in, can Alice uncover what she’s being punished for before the terrifying threats become an unthinkable reality?</description>

  <description>A vicious assault. A devastating accusation. Who should she trust, her husband or her best friend?&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be the perfect reunion: six university friends together again after twenty years. Host Ali finally has the life she always wanted, a career she can be proud of and a wonderful family with her college boyfriend, now husband. But that night her best friend makes an accusation so shocking that nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Karen staggers in from the garden, bleeding and traumatised, she claims that she has been assaulted—by Ali’s husband, Mike. Ali must make a split-second decision: who should she believe? Her horrified husband, or her best friend? With Mike offering a very different version of events, Ali knows one of them is lying—but which? And why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ensuing chaos forces her to re-examine the golden era the group shared at university, Ali realises there are darker memories too. Memories that have lain dormant for decades. Memories someone would kill to protect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the riveting conclusion of the 4MK trilogy, Barker takes the thriller to an entirely new level. Don't miss a single word of the series James Patterson called "ingenious." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hear No Evil &lt;br /&gt;For Detective Sam Porter, the words “Father, forgive me” conjure memories long forgotten; a past intentionally buried. For Anson Bishop, these three words connect a childhood to the present as he unleashes a truth concealed for decades. &lt;br /&gt;See No Evil &lt;br /&gt;Found written on cardboard near each body, these words link multiple victims to a single killer—discovered within minutes of each other in both Chicago and South Carolina—clearly connected yet separated by impossible miles. &lt;br /&gt;Speak No Evil &lt;br /&gt;Chicago Metro and the FBI find themselves caught in chaos—a hospital on lockdown, a rogue officer, and corruption at the highest levels. When Anson Bishop, the prime suspect in the notorious 4MK serial murders turns himself in, he reveals a story completely unexpected, one that not only upends the current investigation, but one that will change the lives of all involved. &lt;br /&gt;Do No Evil &lt;br /&gt;With unrelenting tension and pulse-pounding suspense, the past unravels at breakneck speed as the truth behind the Four Monkey Killer’s motive is finally revealed in this masterfully crafted finale.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Discover what is needed to save America from the looming menace of fake news and political polarization.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are a country in crisis. America is extremely politically polarized. It's almost impossible to have a civil discussion about politics and political issues without emotions overflowing and people erupting, whether within your circle of friends, family, or just watching it happen on the news. Gone are the days of real, unbiased, fact-based news -- now our airwaves and device screens are dominated by opinion labelled as news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of our nation marching toward civil war is very real. You can watch CNN or FOX News and think you are on two different planets. And the sheer vitriol you watch is reflective of the same feeling Democrats and Republicans -- and everyone in between -- are feeling throughout this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's more important than ever to find common ground. Throughout our history, our most inspirational leaders have believed that our future was bright, that our foundation was different, and that the American people would rise to the challenge. Together we can stop ranting and raving and save our country from the dangers of political polarization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ranting and Raving&lt;/i&gt; is a wake-up call for our nation. Together, we can change politics and save our nation.</description>

  <description>Do you believe in soul mates? What if the death of your soul mate meant the birth of your life-long dream?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WIDOW'S AWAKENING is a fictional account based on the true story of a young woman’s struggle to come to terms with the on-duty death of her police officer husband who fell to his death while investigating a breaking and entering complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engaging, powerful, heart-wrenching, and at times humorous, this honest look at the first year of a widow’s grief captures the immense difficulty of learning how to accept the unacceptable while transforming loss into positive change—and is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>To those who don’t really know her, Kate Henderson’s life must seem exceedingly ordinary. Civil servant, wife, parent of two teenagers, daughter of an Alzheimer’s-stricken mother ... But she’s also a senior MI6 officer, and right now she is nursing the political equivalent of a nuclear bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate’s mission to bug an oligarch’s super-yacht in Istanbul has yielded the startling intelligence that the British Prime Minister has prostate cancer – and that one of the leading candidates to replace him may be a Russian agent of influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this ‘intelligence’ reliable – or is it an attempt to create chaos within the British hierarchy? Kate’s bosses have their doubts. But when the PM suddenly announces his resignation, the hunt for the spy begins in earnest. It's a nightmarish task, made infinitely worse by the revelation that there may be another mole – codename Viper – at the heart of the Establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tension mounts, an operation that looked as if it might cost Kate her sanity appears poised to do much, much more than that …</description>

And in-laws to die for.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gemma Robinson comes into Elliot’s life like a whirlwind, and they marry and settle into his home. When she asks him if her parents can come to stay for a couple of weeks, he is keen to oblige – he just doesn’t quite know what he’s signing up for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Robinsons arrive with Gemma’s sister, Chloe, a mysterious young woman who refuses to speak or leave her room. Elliot starts to suspect that the Robinsons are hiding a dark secret. And then there are the scars on his wife’s body that she won’t talk about . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Elliot’s in-laws become more comfortable in his home, encroaching on all aspects of his life, it becomes clear that they have no intention of moving out. To protect Gemma, and their marriage, Elliot delves into the Robinsons’ past. But is he prepared for the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Recalling pivotal moments from her dynamic career on the front lines of American diplomacy and foreign policy, Susan E. Rice—National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations—delivers an inspiring account of a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;life in service to family and country. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you may &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; you know Susan Rice—whose name became synonymous with Benghazi following her Sunday news show appearances after the deadly 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya—in &lt;i&gt;Tough Love,&lt;/i&gt; the author reveals the truth of her surprising story with unflinching honesty. Often mischaracterized by political opponents, Rice emerges as neither a villain nor victim, but a strong, compassionate leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother, wife, scholar, diplomat, and fierce champion of American interests and values, Rice connects the personal and the professional. Taught early, with tough love, how to compete and excel as an African American woman in settings where people of color are few, Susan shares wisdom learned along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laying bare the family struggles that shaped her early life in Washington, D.C., she also examines the ancestral legacies that influenced her. Rice’s elders—immigrants on one side and descendants of slaves on the other—had high expectations that each generation would rise. And rise they did, but not without paying it forward—in uniform and in the pulpit, as educators, community leaders, and public servants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan too rose rapidly. She served throughout the Clinton administration, becoming one of the nation’s youngest assistant secretaries of state and, later, one of President Obama’s most trusted advisors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rice provides an insider’s account of some of the most complex issues confronting the United States over three decades, ranging from “Black Hawk Down” in Somalia to the genocide in Rwanda and the East Africa embassy bombings in the late 1990s, to Libya, Syria, a secret channel to Iran, the Ebola epidemic, and the opening to Cuba during the Obama years. With unmatched insight and characteristic bluntness, she reveals previously untold stories behind recent national security challenges, including confrontations with Russia and China, the war against ISIS, the struggle to contain the fallout from Edward Snowden’s leaks, the U.S. response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the surreal transition to the Trump administration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intimate, sometimes humorous, but always candid, &lt;i&gt;Tough Love&lt;/i&gt; culminates with an appeal to the American public to bridge our dangerous domestic divides in order to preserve our democracy and sustain our global leadership.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two roads lead to Mount Hope. None leads out. T&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;here's no place to run in a community that's been taken--and is being intentionally kept--off the grid. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A small southern town was evacuated after a freak power-plant accident. As the first anniversary of the mishap approaches, some residents are allowed to return past the national guard roadblocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Mount Hope natives Maggie and Jordan quickly discover that their hometown is not as it was before. Downed cellular networks fail to resume service. Animals savagely attack humans. And the damaged power plant, where Jordan's father is an engineer, is under military lockdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	As friends and family morph into terrifying strangers, the Maggie and Jordan increasingly turn to each other. Their determination to discover who--or what--has taken control of Mount Hope soon has them in the cross-hairs of a presence more sinister than any they could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Robert Crais and John Sandford&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former LA County Deputy Bruno Johnson is now a bailiff in the courts having stepped down from his role on the Violent Crimes Team to spend more time with his daughter, Olivia. Bruno fears his job decision may have come too late when he gets a frantic call to extricate Olivia from a gunpoint situation in a LA gang-infested neighborhood. His desperation escalates when he realizes Louis Barkow, a stone-cold killer awaiting trial, had orchestrated that deadly tableau. When Barkow and three other criminals break out of jail and hit the streets, Bruno is plunged back into violent crime mode. Now, the agenda is personal—Olivia has become a pawn in the desperate chase of this sinister murderer. The walls are caving in on Bruno as violence escalates in his hunt for Barkow and his heart strings are stretched to the breaking point as he struggles to protect his daughter not only from the criminal violence swirling around them, but from Olivia’s own impetuous life choices.</description>

  <description>Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. By age twenty, in fact, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The mesmerizing adult debut from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Leigh Bardugo.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>When Daniela Cain returns to her small hometown after seven years’ absence, she finds that flooding has left the village all but deserted. She’s there to collect something she left in her childhood home, then she plans to leave. But upon entering the old house she discovers her younger sister’s body half-submerged in the water. As Daniela tries to work out what happened to Auryn, she uncovers dark secrets from her childhood as one of four sisters in the household, when the Cain’s and another local family begin to turn on each other with devastating results.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A demographic expert and longtime pollster to national and international political stars explains why the Republican party, despite Trump's election, is about to collapse. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mad rush to document the tangled, confusing, raucous present of the United States government, a little thing is lost in the shuffle: the future. How long can this last? What happens next? Where do we go from here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanley Greenberg argues that the election of Trump is in fact the dying gasp of the Republican party. Rejecting the urging of their own consultants to build bridges and embrace new voters across the lines of identity politics, the GOP has constricted. It has retreated to what seems to be the safety of the evangelical white male voter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for them is that this won't be a safe zone for long. Try as some might to drag the United States backward with reactionary movements and a politics of division, the country marches steadfastly on into the 21st century. The power of democracy will soon prevail, and unless the party adapts, America will bury the GOP the way it did the Know Nothings.</description>

  <description>She lays her baby in his cot – the sound of his quiet breath filling the nursery as she leaves the room. Soon Claire will be fast asleep herself. She won’t hear the back door opening or the footsteps on the stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Claire Lucas is woken by her husband asking where their baby son is, she is dazed and confused. When she follows Darren into their child’s bedroom, she hears nothing but silence. No baby cries, no cute gurgles. The only thing left in Finlay’s cot is his beloved teddy bear. Finlay has gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Jessie Blake rushes to the family’s modern home in the rugged Scottish Highlands. She notices that Darren avoids eye contact, and Claire seems disconnected – unable to account for the last few hours of her afternoon. Jessie knows there’s no normal response to losing a child, but something doesn’t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends rally round the young family, as a search of the narrow lanes and green hills of Moncrieffe begins in earnest. And as helpers battle the wild Scottish weather, Jessie is sure that someone in the search party must know more than they’re letting on. Someone must have seen something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a ghost from her own past comes back to haunt her, Jessie must put aside her own personal tragedy to save baby Finlay. Can she get the people of the small town to talk before it’s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love Cara Hunter, LJ Ross and Robert Bryndza, you’ll love this addictive new crime thriller from Kerry Watts. Her Missing Child will have you hooked from the start!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Orphan X returns—facing his own uncertain future and undertaking one last mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken from a group home at age twelve, Evan Smoak was trained as an off-the-books government assassin: Orphan X. After breaking with the Program, he reinvented himself as The Nowhere Man, a figure shrouded in shadows who helps the truly desperate. But the government didn’t let go of him easily, sending their best to hunt him down and eliminate him. All of them failed. With his deadliest enemies behind him, Evan is facing a new challenge—what is he going to do now that no one is after him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Merriweather is at the end of his rope. Separated from the woman he loves and barely scraping by, Max is a disappointment to everyone in his life. Then his very successful cousin Grant is brutally murdered. Two months before, Grant left Max an envelope with instructions to take it to a reporter if anything happened to him. Now the reporter is missing and Max’s apartment is ransacked. A man at the end of his rope, he calls The Nowhere Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With mixed feelings, Evan takes on this mission, easily finding the men who are after Max and executing a plan to keep him safe. But it isn’t as obvious as it seems—and Evan finds himself enmeshed in one of the most challenging missions of his life, one that he can’t survive on his own. With the help of Joey Morales, a genius-level hacker and the last Orphan recruited into the Program, and the brilliant, off-the-books gunsmith, Tommy Stojack, Orphan X once more heads…Into the Fire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in 1803 New York, &lt;i&gt;Hudson's Kill &lt;/i&gt;is the riveting next historical thriller from NPR reporter and producer Paddy Hirsch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York in 1803 is rife with tension as the city expands, and whoever knows where the city will build can control it. And violence builds as a mysterious provocateur pits the city's black and Irish gangs against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young black girl is found stabbed to death, both Justy Flanagan, now a City Marshal, and Kerry O'Toole, now a school teacher, decide separately to go after the killer. They each find their way to a shadowy community on the fringes of the growing city, where they uncover a craven political conspiracy bound up with a criminal enterprise that is stunning in its depravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justy and Kerry have to fight to save themselves and the city, and only then can they bring the girl's killer to justice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Happily Inc, love means never having to say “I do”…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wedding coordinator Renee Grothen isn’t meant for marriage. Those who can, do. Those who can’t, plan. But she never could have planned on gorgeous, talented thriller writer Jasper Dembenski proposing—a fling, that is. Fun without a future. And the attraction between them is too strong for Renee to resist. Now she can have her no-wedding cake…and eat it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years in the military, Jasper is convinced he’s too damaged for relationships. So a flirtation—and more—with fiery, determined Renee is way too good to pass up…until his flame becomes his muse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee is an expert at averting every crisis. But is she finally ready to leap into the one thing that can never be controlled: love?</description>

  <description>Returning early from a disastrous date night with my husband, I know something is wrong the moment the wheels crunch the gravel drive of our home. Inside, the TV is on and a half-eaten meal waits on the table. My heart stops when I find our little girl is alone in the house and our babysitter, Sasha, is missing…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days later, when I’m arrested for Sasha’s murder and torn away from my perfect little family, I’ll wish I had told someone about the threatening note I received that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll hate myself for not finding out who the gift hidden inside my husband’s wardrobe was for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll scream from the rooftops that I’m innocent – but no one will listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will realise I was completely wrong about everything that happened that night…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But will you believe me?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The former governor of Virginia tells the behind-the-scenes story of the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville—and shows how we can prevent other Charlottesvilles from happening.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Governor Terry McAuliffe hung up the phone on the afternoon of the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, he was sure Donald Trump would do the right thing as president: condemn the white supremacists who’d descended on the college town and who’d caused McAuliffe to declare a state of emergency that morning. He didn’t. Instead Trump declared there was “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” Trump was condemned from many sides himself, even by many Republicans, but the damage was done. He’d excused and thus egged on the terrorists at the moment when he could have stopped them in their tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Charlottesville&lt;/i&gt;, McAuliffe looks at the forces and events that led to the tragedy in Charlottesville, including the vicious murder of Heather Heyer and the death of two state troopers in a helicopter accident. He doesn’t whitewash Virginia history and discusses a KKK protest over the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. He takes a hard real-time behind-the-scenes look at the actions of everyone on that fateful August 12, including himself, to see what could have been done. He lays out what was done afterwards to prevent future Charlottesvilles—and what still needs to be done as America in general and Virginia in particular continue to grapple with their history of racism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beyond Charlottesville&lt;/i&gt; will be the definitive account of an infamous chapter in our history, seared indelibly into memory, sure to be cited for years as a crucial reference point in the long struggle to fight racism, extremism and hate.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author Mary Monroe presents a heartwarming, uplifting novel about two long-time co-workers who seem unlucky in love. But this Christmas may give them a surprising chance to find themselves--and each other . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a successful career, money in the bank, and a solid future, Felicia Hawkins has almost everything she ever wanted. But getting married is the one holiday wish she can't seem to get. And it's not helping that she's hopelessly in love with her co-worker, widower Richard Grimes. They have the perfect office partnership, and he's as supportive as he is kind. But Felicia doesn't want to wreck their friendship by letting him know how she really feels . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard has his hands full juggling pre-Christmas work demands and raising two teen daughters. But he's not too busy to wish his relationship with Felicia could become much more. He's drawn to her calm spirit and determination, along with everything they surprisingly have in common. And just once he'd like a chance this season to dare tell her the truth . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Felicia and Richard get instead is a cascade of misunderstandings; messy, well-meaning matchmaking from family and friends, and a long-distance transfer Richard can't refuse. Finally, in the middle of one chaotic snow-struck day, it will take all their courage and compassion to risk opening their hearts to each other--hopefully for many more holiday happily-ever-afters . . .</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The third book in the new series from &lt;i&gt;Hater &lt;/i&gt;author David Moody is perfect for readers of John Maberry and Max Brooks &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in the world of David Moody's Hater trilogy, &lt;i&gt;Chokehold &lt;/i&gt;is the third book in David Moody’s new "top drawer horror" (&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;, starred review) Final War series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A series of nuclear strikes has left huge swathes of the country uninhabitable. It’s a level playing field now: both Hater and Unchanged alike have to fight to stay alive. Both have retreated to their camps to regroup, less than twenty miles away from each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s here that the last major battle of the final war will inevitably be fought, but neither side has any idea what’s waiting for them just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both armies are ready to fight to the death, each of their leaders hell-bent on victory. Their tactics are uniformly simple: strike first, get the enemy in a chokehold, then strangle the life out of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Chokehold &lt;/i&gt;is a fast-paced and wonderfully dark story about the fight for survival in the face of the impending apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This is the incredible tale of Operation Fifth Column, a Second World War MI5 operation so secret that its existence was only revealed by the National Archives for the first time in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the war and even for a couple of years afterwards, 'Agent Jack' - in reality, a bank clerk named Eric Roberts - acted as a Gestapo agent to whom hundreds of British-based Nazi sympathisers and informers passed their secrets, thinking that he was sending them back to Germany. Many were put on a salary by what they thought was the Third Reich and some were even 'awarded' Iron Crosses for their services to the Fatherland; they never found out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the secrets they tried to pass were: a tip-off about Bletchley Park; details of the deadly Mosquito bomber; complete plans of a highly effective anti-radar technology codenamed WINDOW. The larger-than-life characters who populate the book include Roberts himself, the deceptively ordinary-seeming bank clerk; Maxwell Knight, who recruited Roberts; Victor Third Baron Rothschild, Roberts' spymaster, who did a sideline in bomb disposal using his Cartier screwdrivers; Theresa Clay, the distinguished biologist who co-ran the operation with Rothschild, but because she was a woman was only ever classified as an 'assistant'; Marita Perigoe, possibly the most dangerous of the fascists, who despite having her suspicions about Roberts, continued to recruit spies for him and pass him secrets to the end of the war.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Seth M. Siegel shows how our drinking water got contaminated, what it may be doing to us, and what we must do to make it safe. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;If you thought America’s drinking water problems started and ended in Flint, Michigan, think again. From big cities and suburbs to the rural heartland, chemicals linked to cancer, heart disease, obesity, birth defects, and lowered IQ routinely spill from our taps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many are to blame: the EPA, Congress, a bipartisan coalition of powerful governors and mayors, chemical companies, and drinking water utilities—even NASA and the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the bottled water industry has been fanning our fears about tap water, but bottled water is often no safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tragedy is that existing technologies could launch a new age of clean, healthy, and safe tap water for only a few dollars a week per person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrupulously researched, &lt;i&gt;Troubled Water&lt;/i&gt; is full of shocking stories about contaminated water found throughout the country and about the everyday heroes who have successfully forced changes in the quality and safety of our drinking water. And it concludes with what America must do to reverse decades of neglect and play-it-safe inaction by government at all levels in order to keep our most precious resource safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Someone in your past sold you a false story about who you are and what you're worth. It has been holding you back for too long. Take control of your future. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A staggering one out of three women in America was a victim of sexual abuse at some point in her childhood. No matter how many years it's been, if that's your story, those scars are probably still with you. But even if that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of your story, this book is for you. Women today have been groomed for a lot more than just sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using her own story of abuse, family tragedy, and rebellion, Elizabeth Melendez Fisher guides readers toward an understanding that grooming is oftentimes subtle, but it's always life-altering. In &lt;em&gt;Groomed&lt;/em&gt; Fisher incorporates the language and lessons gained over the past decade working with sex trafficking victims and her work in ministry and counseling before that. She draws out five specific ways that women have been groomed, from physical appearance to spirituality to finances, and shows how those manipulative messages have affected the way we see our worth and how they've oftentimes stifled and limited us. From there Fisher offers readers a way to overcome their past, starting with the all-important but rarely explored idea of a &lt;em&gt;selah&lt;/em&gt;, or a time of rest and reflection, and exploring active ways to forgive and move forward to a new level of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one has to be defined by her past. No one has to live for her groomers. It's time to take a look back at where we came from to escape the messages of our past and take control of our future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Other Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Justice for Sara&lt;/i&gt; comes a thrilling psychological drama about a woman who believes she escaped a brutal murder years ago—but does anyone else believe her?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna Scott grew up in the dark shadow of her mother’s paranoid delusions. Now, she's returned home to confront her past and the unsolved murder that altered the course of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her mother’s shuttered house, an old fear that has haunted Sienna for years rears its ugly head —that it was she who had been the killer’s target that night. And now, with it, a new fear—that the killer not only intended to remedy his past mistake—he’s already begun. But are these fears any different from the ones that torment her mother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the walls close in, the line between truth and lie, reality and delusion disintegrate. Has Sienna’s worst nightmare come true? Or will she unmask a killer and finally prove she may be her mother’s look-alike, but she’s not her clone?</description>

  <description>On Shortlist for “Best Indie Novel of 2019” at popular internet magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available on Amazon and Apple in paperback, Kindle &amp;amp; iBook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Weight of a Moment is a beautiful story about the fragility of life and the redemptive power of friendship. Nick Sterling, a Fenwick Prize winning journalist, can't move beyond a tragedy caused by one of his articles. Tom Corbett, a successful antiques dealer, is humiliated and shamed by an internet video that damages his business, marriage, and family. After their blunders, one shameful and one fatal, the two men run from their pasts, meet in a small Pennsylvania town, and, despite—or because of—the most unusual circumstances, help each other find redemption. Together, they make an unusual discovery that changes everything, one that unwittingly puts them back onto the national stage. Joined by fate, each man's journey is remarkable in its own right and only exceeded by their shared journey. In a profound final scene, Nick confronts his tragic mistake, asks for forgiveness, and the novel's title, The Weight of a Moment, is fully realized. Contrasting elements: big cities and small towns, modern and historic, priceless and valuable, compassion and condemnation, add to the richness of the tale. Critically acclaimed, this second novel from the author of Skyscraper of a Man is a brilliant sophomore effort.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hilarious new novel full of Hollywood glitz, glamour, and scandal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When he changes the locks, she changes the rules. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agnes Murphy Nash is the perfect Hollywood wife – she has the right friends, the right clothes, and even a side career of her own as a writer. Her husband Trevor is a bigshot producer, and from the outside it looks like they’re living a picture-perfect celebrity life, complete with tennis tournaments and lavish parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the job description of a Hollywood wife doesn’t cover divorce, which is the way Agnes’ life is headed after she comes home one day to find her credit cards cancelled and the security passwords to get into her enormous LA home changed. Oh, and there’s a guy there whose job it is to tase her if she tries to enter…which she does. Needless to say, Agnes’ husband is dead set on making sure she loses big time, but Agnes isn’t the type to just lie down and take it. In a world of fremenies and hot nannies, personal psychics and “skinny” jello shots, Agnes may be losing her husband, but could that mean getting her own life back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Been There, Married That &lt;/i&gt;is a drop-dead hilarious battle of wills that will make you laugh out loud, cringe, and keep turning the pages to see what crazy disaster will happen to Agnes next…and how she’ll rise from the ashes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Ward Larsen's globe-trotting, hard-hitting assassin, David Slaton, returns for another breathless adventure in &lt;i&gt;Assassin's Revenge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a sunny dock in Gibraltar, Slaton returns to the sailboat he shares with his wife and young son to find them missing. The only clue to their whereabouts is a cryptic message: If he wants to see them again, he must eliminate an obscure scientist working for the International Atomic Energy Agency. Slaton races to Vienna to unravel the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half a world away, a small team of ISIS operatives arrives in North Korea. It is comprised of two suicidal jihadists, one technician, and the caliphate’s only officer with naval experience. Their mission: to reestablish the group’s relevance by undertaking a shocking strike against America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Europe to North Korea to the Pacific Ocean, Slaton finds himself entangled in a deadly nuclear game. Working against him are a band of suicidal terrorists, supported by a North Korean government that is about to implode. That slate of actors, however, face something even more lethal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devoted father and husband—one who happens to be the perfect assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Slaton Novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1&lt;i&gt; Assassin's Game&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2&lt;i&gt; Assassin's Silence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3&lt;i&gt; Assassin's Code&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;#4 Assassin's Run&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;#5 Assassin's Revenge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Diane Chamberlain comes an irresistible new novel. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina, 2018: Morgan Christopher's life has been derailed. Taking the fall for a crime she did not commit, she finds herself serving a three-year stint in the North Carolina Women's Correctional Center. Her dream of a career in art is put on hold—until a mysterious visitor makes her an offer that will see her released immediately. Her assignment: restore an old post office mural in a sleepy southern town. Morgan knows nothing about art restoration, but desperate to leave prison, she accepts. What she finds under the layers of grime is a painting that tells the story of madness, violence, and a conspiracy of small town secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina, 1940: Anna Dale, an artist from New Jersey, wins a national contest to paint a mural for the post office in Edenton, North Carolina. Alone in the world and desperate for work, she accepts. But what she doesn't expect is to find herself immersed in a town where prejudices run deep, where people are hiding secrets behind closed doors, and where the price of being different might just end in murder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to Anna Dale? Are the clues hidden in the decrepit mural? Can Morgan overcome her own demons to discover what exists beneath the layers of lies?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Offering an in-depth psychological and political portrait of what makes Donald Trump tick, Dangerous Charisma combines psychoanalysis with an investigation into the personality of the current American president. This narrative not only examines the life and psychology of Donald Trump, but will also provide an analysis of the charismatic psychological tie between Trump and his supporters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are many books on Donald Trump, there has been no rigorous psychological portrait by a psychiatrist who specializes in political personality profiling. As the founding director of the CIA’s Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, Dr. Post has created profiles of world leaders for the use of American presidents during historic events. As once stated by Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, who characterized Dr. Post as “a pioneer in the field of political personality profiling,” “he may be the only psychiatrist who has specialized in the self-esteem problems of both Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this new book, the psychiatrist who once served under five American presidents applies his expertise to profiling the current resident in the White House, with surprising and revelatory results.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Learn why President Trump is the ideal changemaker that can put an end to America's uncontrollable and corrupt system of government ruled by special interest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still Winning&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the unlikeliest of heroes who emerged from the unlikeliest of places to take up the impossible cause of a truly forgotten people. They are people who love their country, trust their higher God, obey laws and will do anything for their family and neighbors. They are the very people the Founders envisioned when they hatched the radical idea of self-governance. &lt;br /&gt;This is the story of a Leviathan government - the most powerful political force in the history of mankind - that has become dangerously unmoored from the people it represents. It is the story of how elites and the politically comfortable controlling both parties in Washington have utterly lost touch. They don't even realize how much the people they represent despise the uncontrollable Leviathan.&lt;br /&gt;The establishment has tried their best to ignore Donald Trump-except to brand him as a racist, a xenophobe, an isolationist, and a dangerous, violence-inciting war monger. All standards of reporting vanished. In the era of Trump, no sort of criticism was off-limits. They openly mocked his looks, ridiculed his private business accomplishments, pilloried his family and children and made fun of his foreign-born wife for her accent!&lt;br /&gt;The Leviathan has grown untamable. Democrats and Republicans run for office year after year on promises they have no intention of keeping. Neither side wants to fix a single problem. The whole thing has become one giant ungovernable, corrupt Ponzi scheme that - one day - will come crashing down.&lt;br /&gt;Charles Hurt advocates for the "Nuclear Option" for dealing with this mess: just blow the whole damned thing up. Whatever is presidential or diplomatic, let's try the opposite. Whatever these people in Washington find most horrifying, let's try that. Finally, the multi-headed Leviathan swamp monster has met the perfect dragon slayer in Donald Trump. &lt;i&gt;Still Winning &lt;/i&gt;examines each corrupt head of this Leviathan, and why Donald Trump is the only good answer to fixing it.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The One Man&lt;/i&gt; Andrew Gross once again delivers a tense, stirring thriller of a family torn apart set against the backdrop of a nation plunged into war.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;February, 1939. Europe teeters on the brink of war. In New York City, twenty-two thousand cheering Nazi supporters pack Madison Square Garden for a raucous, hate-filled rally. In a Hell’s Kitchen bar, Charles Mossman is reeling from the loss of his job and the demise of his marriage when a group draped in Nazi flags barges in. Drunk, Charlie takes a swing at one with tragic results and a torrent of unintended consequences follows.&lt;p&gt;Two years later. America is wrestling with whether to enter the growing war. Charles’s estranged wife and six-year-old daughter, Emma, now live in a quiet brownstone in the German-speaking New York City neighborhood of Yorkville, where support for Hitler is common. Charles, just out of prison, struggles to put his life back together, while across the hall from his family, a kindly Swiss couple, Trudi and Willi Bauer, have taken a liking to Emma. But Charles begins to suspect that they might not be who they say they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the threat of war grows, and fears of a “fifth column”—German spies embedded into everyday life—are everywhere, Charles puts together that the seemingly amiable Bauers may be part of a sinister conspiracy. When Pearl Harbor is attacked and America can no longer sit on the sideline, that conspiracy turns into a deadly threat with Charles the only one who can see it and Emma, an innocent pawn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Nantucket shopkeeper discovers that Christmas is the perfect occasion to make unexpected friendships, to warm the coldest of hearts--and maybe even to find love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christina Antonioni is preparing for the holidays at her Nantucket toy shop, unpacking last-minute shipments and decorating for her loyal Christmas shoppers. But when her Scrooge of a landlord, Oscar Bittlesman, raises her rent, it seems nearly impossible for Christina to continue business on the wharf. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, Christina firmly believes there may be a warm heart underneath Oscar's steely exterior. When she bonds with Wink, his sweet, young granddaughter who frequents the shop, it becomes clear that perhaps he isn't so cold after all. And with the help of Wink's uncle, who happens to be a charming (and extremely wealthy) bachelor, this may be the best Christmas any of them could have ever imagined. Nancy Thayer's enchanting Nantucket setting provides the perfect backdrop for this holiday love story.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wrexford and Sloane must unravel secrets within secrets—including a few that entangle their own hearts—when they reunite to solve a string of shocking murders that have horrified Regency London...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Though Charlotte Sloane’s secret identity as the controversial satirical cartoonist A.J. Quill is safe with the Earl of Wrexford, she’s ill prepared for the rippling effects sharing the truth about her background has cast over their relationship. She thought a bit of space might improve the situation. But when her cousin is murdered and his twin brother is accused of the gruesome crime, Charlotte immediately turns to Wrexford for help in proving the young man’s innocence. Though she finds the brooding scientist just as enigmatic and intense as ever, their partnership is now marked by an unfamiliar tension that seems to complicate every encounter.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite this newfound complexity, Wrexford and Charlotte are determined to track down the real killer. Their investigation leads them on a dangerous chase through Mayfair’s glittering ballrooms and opulent drawing rooms, where gossip and rumors swirl to confuse the facts. Was her cousin murdered over a romantic rivalry . . . or staggering gambling debts? Or could the motive be far darker and involve the clandestine scientific society that claimed both brothers as members? The more Charlotte and Wrexford try to unknot the truth, the more tangled it becomes. But they must solve the case soon, before the killer’s madness seizes another victim...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The return of the cutting-edge thriller series &lt;i&gt;Net Force&lt;/i&gt;, created by Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenik and written by Jerome Preisler.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one threat to our nation’s security is in cyberspace. The new US president wants to tackle the urgent problem head-on and launches a top secret line of defense: Net Force. But before the organization can be announced, the country is hit by an unprecedented, two-pronged terror attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not yet empowered by Congress nor embraced by a dubious intelligence community, still untested, unproven and officially unnamed, Net Force’s elite group of cyber experts and field operatives must lead the fight against the ongoing waves of hacks while tracking down the mastermind. Their failure could mean global catastrophe. Success may lead them to become the highest-level security agency in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story that seems ripped from tomorrow’s headlines, &lt;i&gt;Net Force: Dark Web&lt;/i&gt; relaunches one of the most prescient thriller series at a time when cybersecurity is more vital than ever.</description>

  <description>Someone, or some&lt;i&gt;thing, &lt;/i&gt;is haunting the &lt;b&gt;Titanic&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only way to explain the series of misfortunes that have plagued the passengers of the ship from the moment they set sail: mysterious disappearances, sudden deaths. Now suspended in an eerie, unsettling twilight zone during the four days of the liner's illustrious maiden voyage, a number of the passengers - including millionaires &lt;b&gt;Madeleine Astor&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Benjamin Guggenheim&lt;/b&gt;, the maid &lt;b&gt;Annie Hebbley&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Mark Fletcher - &lt;/b&gt;are convinced that something sinister is going on . . . And then, as the world knows, disaster strikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later and the world is at war. And a survivor of that fateful night, Annie, is working as a nurse on the sixth voyage of the Titanic's sister ship, the &lt;b&gt;Britannic&lt;/b&gt;, now refitted as a hospital ship. Plagued by the demons of her doomed first and near fatal journey across the Atlantic, Annie comes across an unconscious soldier she recognises while doing her rounds. It is the young man Mark. And she is convinced that he did not - could not - have survived the sinking of the Titanic . . . &lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly combining fact and fiction, the historical and the horrific, &lt;i&gt;The Deep &lt;/i&gt;reveals a chilling truth in an unputdownable narrative full of unnerving moments and with a growing, inexorable sense of foreboding.</description>

  <description>In this follow-up to The Tattooist of Auschwitz, the author tells the story, based on a true one, of a woman who survives Auschwitz, only to find herself locked away again. Cilka Klein is 18 years old when Auschwitz-Birkenau is liberated by Soviet soldiers. But Cilka is one of the many women who is sentenced to a labor camp on charges of having helped the Nazis--with no consideration of the circumstances Cilka and women like her found themselves in as they struggled to survive. Once at the Vorkuta gulag in Sibera, where she is to serve her 15-year sentence, Cilka uses her wits, charm, and beauty to survive.</description>

  <description>Perfect wife. Perfect life. Perfect crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony is not the man everyone believes him to be. And Emelia is not the woman he wants her to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theirs was a whirlwind romance, Anthony was the doting boyfriend, the charismatic and successful career man who swept her off her feet. But now Emelia is trapped in a marriage of dark secrets and obsession. She is no more than something Anthony wants to 'fix', one of his pet projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emelia has no escape from the life that Anthony insists on controlling, so she shares her story through the only means she can – her blog. Yet Anthony can never find out. Forced to hide behind a false name, Emelia knows the only way that Anthony will allow her to leave him, is death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped with a man she knows is trying to kill her, Emelia is determined that someone will hear her story and Anthony will meet his ends. That everyone will discover the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of My Lovely Wife, Liane Moriarty and The Mother in Law.</description>

  <description>In the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;Wonder&lt;/i&gt;, readers were introduced to memorable English teacher Mr. Browne and his love of precepts. This companion book features conversations between Mr. Browne and Auggie, Julian, Summer, Jack Will, and others, giving readers a special peek at their lives after &lt;i&gt;Wonder&lt;/i&gt; ends. Mr. Browne's essays and correspondence are rounded out by a precept for each day of the year—drawn from popular songs to children’s books to inscriptions on Egyptian tombstones to fortune cookies. His selections celebrate the goodness of human beings, the strength of people’s hearts, and the power of people’s wills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something for everyone here, with words of wisdom from such noteworthy people as Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., Confucius, Goethe, Sappho—and over 100 readers of &lt;i&gt;Wonder&lt;/i&gt; who sent R. J. Palacio their own precepts.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Tubes&lt;/em&gt;, a lively and surprising tour of the infrastructure behind the weather forecast, the people who built it, and what it reveals about our climate and our planet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is the foundation of our daily lives. It’s a staple of small talk, the app on our smartphones, and often the first thing we check each morning. Yet behind these quotidian interactions is one of the most expansive machines human beings have ever constructed—a triumph of science, technology and global cooperation. But what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;this ‘weather machine’ and who created it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Weather Machine&lt;/em&gt;, Andrew Blum takes readers on a fascinating journey through an everyday miracle. In a quest to understand how the forecast works, he visits old weather stations and watches new satellites blast off. He follows the dogged efforts of scientists to create a supercomputer model of the atmosphere and traces the surprising history of the algorithms that power their work. He discovers that we have quietly entered a golden age of meteorology—our tools allow us to predict weather more accurately than ever, and yet we haven’t learned to trust them, nor can we guarantee the fragile international alliances that allow our modern weather machine to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with the sharp wit and infectious curiosity Andrew Blum is known for, &lt;em&gt;The Weather Machine&lt;/em&gt; pulls back the curtain on a universal part of our everyday lives, illuminating our relationships with technology, the planet, and the global community. </description>

  <description>New friends can be found in unexpected places. For Bridget and Amy, that place was the cancer ward of an Anchorage hospital. Now, as each struggles to overcome loss, they lean on each other for support—sharing suppers, laughter and tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridget and Amy aren’t about to let hardship knock them down—Bridget plans to return to her veterinarian school studies, Amy to her position as a second-grade teacher—but neither feels quite ready. And so the Sunday Potluck Club is born, a way for Bridget, Amy, and other women who have lost a loved one to find solace and understanding. Savoring favorite dishes while sharing memories and the comfort of connection, the members of the Sunday Potluck Club nourish body and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As weeks go by and the group grows in unforeseen ways, both Bridget and Amy are inspired to find greater purpose. Amy reaches out to a student whose father bravely faces his own struggle. Bridget volunteers at the local animal shelter, rehabilitating dogs whose unconditional love will bring others a chance to heal. And with the help of a very special man, Amy is realizing that there’s always room at the table for love and rekindled joy . . .</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Mrs. Miracle shows an ordinary family that they are blessed beyond belief in this uplifting holiday tale from #1 &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author Debbie Macomber.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the holiday season begins, Laurel McCullough could use some good news. She and her husband, Zach, have been praying for a baby that seems more and more like an impossible dream, and they've had to move in with her beloved grandmother, Helen, who's having trouble taking care of herself. But when Laurel contacts a local home care organization for help, there are no caregivers available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Mrs. Miracle appears at her door. No stranger to lending a helping hand to a family in need, Mrs. Miracle reveals herself to be nothing short of a godsend. Helen's even convinced she's an angel! Still, Laurel has to admit that Helen has become noticeably happier and more engaged, decorating the family Christmas tree and revisiting old hobbies with Mrs. Miracle's companionship. In the meantime, Laurel and Zach begin to encounter curious signs, all pointing toward the arrival of a special baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Christmas approaching, there appears to be even more to Mrs. Miracle than meets the eye. In a classic turn of Debbie Macomber's signature seasonal magic, Laurel, Zach, and Helen experience a holiday of heavenly proportions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling FBI Thriller series returns with another tour de force in which agents Savich and Sherlock stumble into a bizarre case that’s more complicated and twisted than any they’ve ever encountered. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a Tuesday afternoon, Agent Sherlock is driving in downtown Washington when her Volvo is suddenly T-boned at an intersection. As her car spins out of control, a man’s body slams against her windshield and then—blackness. When she finally regains consciousness in the hospital, she’s told about the accident and the man she struck. No one knows yet who he is or where he is because he ran away. From DNA, they discover his name is Justice Cummings and he’s a CIA analyst at Langley…and he’s still missing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in the small town of Gaffer’s Ridge, Virginia, Special Agent Griffin Hammersmith rescues a kidnapped woman claiming her captor had probably murdered three missing teenage girls. However, the man she accuses is the local sheriff’s nephew and a member of a very powerful family, reputed to have psychic powers. When the sheriff arrests Griffin and the rescued woman, Carson DaSilva, he calls Savich for help. Together they have to weave their way through a labyrinth of lies to find the truth of a terrible secret.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“If there’s one thing that readers can count on in a Coulter novel it is that she always delivers amazingly eerie and complex thrillers” (&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;Labyrinth &lt;/i&gt;is no different. With white-knuckled pacing and shocking twists and turns, this is another electrifying novel that will sink its teeth in you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Liza Palmer's voice is fresh, exciting, and necessary. She's a must-read author." --Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; the Six&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;If there's one thing Joan Dixon knows about herself, it's that she is a damn good journalist. But when she is laid off from yet another soon-to-be-shuttered newspaper, and even the soulless, listicle-writing online jobs have dried up, she is left with few options. Closer to 40 than 30, single, living with her parents again, Joan decides she needs to reinvent herself. She goes to work as a junior copywriter at Bloom, a Los Angeles startup where her bosses are all a decade younger and snacks and cans of fizzy water flow freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once, Joan has a steady paycheck and a stable job. She befriends a group of misfit coworkers and even begins a real relationship, after years of false starts. But once a journalist, always a journalist, and as Joan starts to poke beneath Bloom's bright surface, she realizes that she may have accidentally stumbled onto the scoop of her lifetime. Is it worth risking everything for the sake of the story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charmingly candid, hilarious, and deeply moving, &lt;i&gt;The Nobodies &lt;/i&gt;is a novel about failing but never losing the core of yourself, from a beloved writer at the top of her game.</description>

  <description>It should have been just a mid-life fling. A guilty indiscretion that Neve Connolly could have weathered. An escape from twenty years of routine marriage to her overworked husband, and from her increasingly distant children. But when Neve pays a morning-after visit to her lover, Saul, and finds him brutally murdered, their pied-à-terre still heady with her perfume, all the lies she has so painstakingly stitched together threaten to unravel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After scrubbing clean every trace of her existence from Saul’s life—and death—Neve believes she can return to normal, shaken but intact. But she can’t get out of her head the one tormenting question: what was she forgetting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An investigation into the slaying could provide the answer. It’s brought Detective Chief Inspector Alastair Hitching, and Neve’s worst fears, to her door. But with every new lie, every new misdirection to save herself, Neve descends further into the darkness of her betrayal—and into more danger than she ever imagined. Because Hitching isn’t the only one watching Neve. So is a determined killer who’s about to make the next terrifying move in a deadly affair….</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dear Edie, I wanted you to know so many things. I wanted to tell you them in person, as you grew. But it wasn’t to be.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jess never imagined she’d be navigating single motherhood, let alone while facing breast cancer. A life that should be just beginning is interrupted by worried looks, heavy conversations, and the possibility of leaving her daughter to grow up without her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Propelled by a ticking clock, Jess knows what she has to do: tell her daughter everything. How to love, how to lose, how to forgive, and, most importantly, how to live when you never know how long you have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From best-selling author Laura Pearson comes her most devastating book yet. Honest, heart-wrenching, and emotionally raw, &lt;i&gt;I Wanted You To Know&lt;/i&gt; is a true love letter to life: to all its heartache and beauty, to the people we have and lose, to the memories and moments that define us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Wanted You To Know&lt;/i&gt; is Laura Pearson's third novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the second novel in the Wildflower House series, the author of &lt;i&gt;The Memory of Butterflies&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that to achieve our dreams, we must first open our hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kara Hart suffered overwhelming heartache when she lost her mother and husband, and her father’s sudden death might be the blow that breaks her—unless she turns her grief into purpose. She’ll finish renovating his Victorian mansion in rural Virginia, but with her own twist. She’ll turn the old house into a creative retreat for artists and writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kara has never tackled a project this big alone, and she’s not ready to open her heart to others for help. But the locals open their hearts to her—including two who have the potential to be more than friends. She tells herself she doesn’t need romance or distractions, but maybe that’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what she needs. When her former best friend reenters Kara’s life, it could be the distraction that finally destroys her—or heals her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedies in Kara’s life have damaged her self-confidence, but she presses forward, gradually lowering her protective walls and allowing others in little by little. Will bringing Wildflower House back to life and freeing her own creative spirit also allow her to open her heart to hope and happiness—and maybe even love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One woman's reappearance throws her family into turmoil, exposing dark secrets and the hidden, often devastating truth of family relationships.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Bennett vanished from a parking lot eleven years ago, leaving behind her husband and young daughter. When she shows up at a Montana gas station, clutching an infant and screaming for help, investigators believe she may have been abducted by a cult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate's return flips her family's world upside down--her husband is remarried, and her daughter barely remembers her. Kate herself doesn't look or act like she did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the family tries to help Kate reintegrate into society, they discover truths they've been hiding from each other about their own relationships. But they aren't the only ones with secrets. As the family unravels what happened to Kate, a series of shocking revelations shows that Kate's return is more sinister than any of them could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Deeply moving, this is the most authentic book I've read for a long time. Simon Dawson's honesty and humour shine through to make this a wonderful must-read. A surefire bestseller.' – &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;VERONICA HENRY, bestselling novelist and scriptwriter (The Archers, Holby City)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;This is a warts-and-all celebration of mothers (human and animal) everywhere, from the popular author of &lt;em&gt;The Sty's the Limit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pigs in Clover&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Dawson is a broadcaster, smallholder and author of several books including humorous life-on-a-farm memoirs. However, his cheery exterior masks a very unhappy past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother did not love him, and informed him of this fact often. She spent most of his childhood trying to find someone to give him away to, played him off against various gangster lovers and abusive boyfriends, failed to feed him and overtly taunted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon, meanwhile, lost his virginity to a much older woman, failed spectacularly at school, and took the blame for their house burning down. But eventually he found a soul mate and together they now care for a menagerie of animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new book he decides not just to face up to the emotional damage his mother inflicted on him, but to try to understand her and achieve some kind of reconciliation before she dies. Was it his innate unloveableness, or was it something that would now be called postnatal depression?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm, witty and honest, the book charts the humour, the anger, the confusion, the hurt, the hate and the desperation of a mother who can't give love and a son longing for it. All of this is set against the backdrop of present-day life on the farm where some animals also mysteriously reject their young.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Praise for Simon Dawson:&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;'A treasure-trove' –&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; Adam Henson, Countryfile (BBC 1)&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;'Enchanting' –&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;'Inspirational' – &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'One of the most amusing writers I know' –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Country Smallholding Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing Ventured &lt;/i&gt;heralds the start of a brand new series in the style of Jeffrey Archer’s #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling &lt;i&gt;Clifton Chronicles&lt;/i&gt;: introducing Detective William Warwick. &lt;i&gt;But t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;his is not a detective story, &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;this is a story about the making of a detective . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Warwick has always wanted to be a detective, and decides, much to his father’s dismay, that rather than become a lawyer like his father, Sir Julian Warwick QC, and his sister Grace, he will join London’s Metropolitan Police Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After graduating from university, William begins a career that will define his life: from his early months on the beat under the watchful eye of his first mentor, Constable Fred Yates, to his first high-stakes case as a fledgling detective in Scotland Yard’s arts and antiquities squad. Investigating the theft of a priceless Rembrandt painting from the Fitzmolean Museum, he meets Beth Rainsford, a research assistant at the gallery who he falls hopelessly in love with, even as Beth guards a secret of her own that she’s terrified will come to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While William follows the trail of the missing masterpiece, he comes up against suave art collector Miles Faulkner and his brilliant lawyer, Booth Watson QC, who are willing to bend the law to breaking point to stay one step ahead of William. Meanwhile, Miles Faulkner’s wife, Christina, befriends William, but whose side is she really on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new series introduces William Warwick, a family man and a detective who will battle throughout his career against a powerful criminal nemesis. Through twists, triumph and tragedy, this series will show that William Warwick is destined to become one of Jeffrey Archer’s most enduring legacies.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Internationally renowned Bible teacher Joyce Meyer offers encouragement and practical insight for overcoming life's problems and challenges by dealing with them according to God's Word.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever felt you tried every solution on earth to solve a problem, but nothing worked? Have you ever wondered where the difficulties you face are coming from? Joyce Meyer has answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Your Battles Belong to the Lord&lt;/i&gt;, Meyer explains that once you recognize the devil--who is real and active in the world today--as your true enemy and the source of many of your struggles, you can overcome them and live a life of peace, freedom, faith and victory. When facing life's battles, there are certain things you must do for yourself, such as being diligent to study and apply God's Word, trusting Him, praying, helping others, and maintaining a positive attitude and a thankful heart. But there are other things only God can do. When you do your part, God does His-and He is always ready and eager to defend you and help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fresh approach to the subject of spiritual warfare, Meyer focuses not only on the nature and strategies of the enemy, but also on the power and love of God, who always defeats the enemy and leads you to triumph. No matter how difficult your challenges are, if you have God with you, you have all you need to win every battle.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author David Baldacci introduces an unforgettable new character: Archer, a straight-talking former World War II soldier fresh out of prison for a crime he didn't commit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1949. When war veteran Aloysius Archer is released from Carderock Prison, he is sent to Poca City on parole with a short list of &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;'s and a much longer list of &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt;s: &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; report regularly to his parole officer, &lt;i&gt;don't &lt;/i&gt;go to bars, certainly &lt;i&gt;don't &lt;/i&gt;drink alcohol, &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; get a job--and &lt;i&gt;don't &lt;/i&gt;ever associate with loose women. The small town quickly proves more complicated and dangerous than Archer's years serving in the war or his time in jail. Within a single night, his search for gainful employment - and a stiff drink - leads him to a local bar, where he is hired for what seems like a simple job: to collect a debt owed to a powerful local businessman, Hank Pittleman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Archer discovers that recovering the debt won't be so easy. The indebted man has a furious grudge against Hank and refuses to pay; Hank's clever mistress has her own designs on Archer; and both Hank and Archer's stern parole officer, Miss Crabtree, are keeping a sharp eye on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a murder takes place right under Archer's nose, police suspicions rise against the ex-convict, and Archer realizes that the crime could send him right back to prison . . . if he doesn't use every skill in his arsenal to track down the real killer.</description>
