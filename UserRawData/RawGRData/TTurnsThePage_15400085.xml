  <description>DI Helen Grace returns in &lt;i&gt;Pop Goes the Weasel&lt;/i&gt;, the electrifying new thriller from M. J. Arlidge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of a middle-aged man is discovered in Southampton's red-light district - horrifically mutilated, with his heart removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later - and barely cold - the heart arrives with his wife and children by courier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pattern emerges when another male victim is found dead and eviscerated, his heart delivered soon afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The media call it Jack the Ripper in reverse; revenge against the men who lead sordid double lives visiting prostitutes. For Grace, only one thing is certain: there's a vicious serial-killer at large who must be halted at all costs . . .</description>

  <description>Eleanor Oliphant has learned how to survive - but not how to live. Eleanor Oliphant leads a simple life. She wears the same clothes to work every day, eats the same meal deal for lunch every day and buys the same two bottles of vodka to drink every weekend. Eleanor Oliphant is happy. Nothing is missing from her carefully timetabled life. Except, sometimes, everything. One simple act of kindness is about to shatter the walls Eleanor has built around herself. Now she must learn how to navigate the world that everyone else seems to take for granted - while searching for the courage to face the dark corners she's avoided all her life. Change can be good. Change can be bad. But surely any change is better than. . . fine?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Featuring Mattie Cobb and her K-9 partner Robo, &lt;i&gt;Burning Ridge&lt;/i&gt; by critically acclaimed author Margaret Mizushima is just the treat for fans of Alex Kava. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On a rugged Colorado mountain ridge, Mattie Cobb and her police dog partner Robo make a grisly discovery—and become the targets of a ruthless killer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colorado’s Redstone Ridge is a place of extraordinary beauty, but this rugged mountain wilderness harbors a horrifying secret. When a charred body is discovered in a shallow grave on the ridge, officer Mattie Cobb and her K-9 partner Robo are called in to spearhead the investigation. But this is no ordinary crime—and it soon becomes clear that Mattie has a close personal connection to the dead man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joined by local veterinarian Cole Walker, the pair scours the mountaintop for evidence and makes another gruesome discovery: the skeletonized remains of two adults and a child. And then, the unthinkable happens. Could Mattie become the next victim in the murderer’s deadly game? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deranged killer torments Mattie with a litany of dark secrets that call into question her very identity. As a towering blaze races across the ridge, Cole and Robo search desperately for her—but time is running out in Margaret Mizushima’s fourth spine-tingling Timber Creek K-9 mystery, &lt;i&gt;Burning Ridge&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>The men on board HMS Terror have every expectation of triumph. As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape.</description>

  <description>For readers of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade's most anticipated debuts, to be published in thirty-five languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: a twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;It isn't paranoia if it's really happening . . . &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Fox lives alone--a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn't, her world begins to crumble?and its shocking secrets are laid bare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one--and nothing--is what it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisty and powerful, ingenious, and moving, &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.</description>

  <description>The heart-pounding debut from the creator of the hit Scandinavian television show The Killing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find one, he’s already found you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A psychopath is terrorizing Copenhagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His calling card is a “chestnut man”—a handmade doll made of matchsticks and two chestnuts—which he leaves at each bloody crime scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examining the dolls, forensics makes a shocking discovery—a fingerprint belonging to a young girl, a government minister’s daughter who had been kidnapped and murdered a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tragic coincidence—or something more twisted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save innocent lives, a pair of detectives must put aside their differences to piece together the Chestnut Man’s gruesome clues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it’s clear that the madman is on a mission that is far from over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no one is safe.</description>

      <![CDATA[Favorite October spooky read... This book right here is why I love Scandi-Nordic Noir! I can not believe this is a debut novel. The Chestnut Man is very intense, eerie, full of twist and turns and yes, at times gory. There was also so much character depth and a very well developed plot.<br /><br...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this magical debut -- a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize -- a couple's lives are changed forever by the arrival of a little girl, wild and secretive, on their snowy doorstep. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alaska, 1920: a brutal place to homestead, and especially tough for recent arrivals Jack and Mabel. Childless, they are drifting apart--he breaking under the weight of the work of the farm; she crumbling from loneliness and despair. In a moment of levity during the season's first snowfall, they build a child out of snow. The next morning the snow child is gone--but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness. As Jack and Mabel struggle to understand this child who could have stepped from the pages of a fairy tale, they come to love her as their own daughter. But in this beautiful, violent place things are rarely as they appear, and what they eventually learn about Faina will transform all of them.</description>

  <description>FROM THE AUTHOR OF 'THE ART OF INHERITING SECRETS' COMES AN EMOTIONAL NEW TALE OF TWO SISTERS, AN OCEAN OF LIES, AND A SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her sister has been dead for fifteen years when she sees her on the TV news. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie Bianci was killed years ago on a train during a terrorist attack. Gone forever. It's what her sister, Kit, an ER doctor in Santa Cruz, has always believed. Yet all it takes is a few heart-wrenching seconds to upend Kit's world. Live coverage of a club fire in Auckland has captured the image of a woman stumbling through the smoke and debris. Her resemblance to Josie is unbelievable. And unmistakable. With it comes a flood of emotions - grief, loss and anger - that Kit finally has a chance to put to rest: by finding the sister who's been living a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After arriving in New Zealand, Kit begins her journey with the memories of the past: of days spent on the beach with Josie. Of a lost teenage boy who'd become part of their family. And of a trauma that has haunted Kit and Josie their entire lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if two sisters are to reunite, it can only be by unearthing long-buried secrets and facing a devastating truth that has kept them apart far too long. To regain their relationship, they may have to lose everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2019 Barbara Samuel (P)2019 Brilliance Publishing, Inc., all rights reserved.</description>

  <description>The master of historical fiction presents the iconic story of King Alfred and the making of a nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alfred, the great king, is said to be dying. Rivals for his succession are poised to tear the kingdom apart. The country Alfred has worked thirty years to build is about to disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uhtred, the King’s warrior, Viking born but Saxon bred, wants more than anything else to go and fight to reclaim his stolen Northumbrian inheritance. But he knows that if he deserts the King’s cause, Alfred’s dream – and indeed the very future of the English nation – will very likely vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death of Kings is an outstanding novel by a master storyteller of how England was made – and very nearly lost.</description>

  <description>The endgame is at hand for Penn Cage, his family, and the enemies bent on destroying them in this revelatory volume in the epic trilogy set in modern-day Natchez, Mississippi—Greg Iles’s epic tale of love and honor, hatred and revenge that explores how the sins of the past continue to haunt the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shattered by grief and dreaming of vengeance, Penn Cage sees his family and his world collapsing around him. The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn's experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations--preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others.  Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner.  It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son--Penn's half-brother--who sets in motion the murder case against his father.  The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi's violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to trust anyone around him--not even his own mother--Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father's case. Together, Penn and Serenity battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble: their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mississippi Blood&lt;/em&gt; is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making--one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats. With piercing insight, narrative prowess, and a masterful ability to blend history and imagination, Greg Iles illuminates the brutal history of the American South in a highly atmospheric and suspenseful novel that delivers the shocking resolution his fans have eagerly awaited. </description>

  <description>The fifth installment of Bernard Cornwell’s bestselling Saxon Tales chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, “like Game of Thrones, but real” (&lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;, London)—the basis for &lt;em&gt;The Last Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, the hit BBC America television series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the ninth century, King Alfred of Wessex is in ill health; his heir, an untested youth. His enemy, the Danes, having failed to conquer Wessex, now see their chance for victory. Led by the sword of savage warrior Harald Bloodhair, the Viking hordes attack. But Uhtred, Alfred’s reluctant warlord, proves his worth, outwitting Harald and handing the Vikings one of their greatest defeats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Uhtred, the sweetness of victory is soon overshadowed by tragedy. Breaking with Alfred, he joins the Vikings, swearing never again to serve the Saxon king. Instead, he will reclaim his ancestral fortress on the Northumbrian coast. Allied with his old friend Ragnar-and his old foe Haesten-he aims to invade and conquer Wessex itself.  But fate has different plans . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Burning Land&lt;/em&gt;, Bernard Cornwell, “the reigning king of historical fiction” (&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;), delivers a rousing saga of Anglo-Saxon England-an irresistible new chapter in his thrilling Saxon Tales, the epic story of the birth of England and the legendary king who made it possible.</description>

  <description>Fleeing an abusive marriage and tormented by her past, Alexandra Turner finds solace in a small coastal town on Puget Sound and a job with a local marine biologist studying orcas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After befriending a group of locals, Alex learns that she has moved to a place that has a reputation of being the “most haunted town in Washington.” Such superstitions would be easy to dismiss…if Alex wasn’t already on edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by shreds of memories of her days with her husband, Alex can’t keep from looking over her shoulder. As unexplained sounds and scents accumulate and unnerving forces seem to take hold, Alex is beginning to believe that she’s not escaping her ghosts, after all. In fact, she might finally be inviting them in.</description>

  <description>When an infected bolt of cloth carries plague from London to an isolated village, a housemaid named Anna Frith emerges as an unlikely heroine and healer. Through Anna's eyes we follow the story of the fateful year of 1666, as she and her fellow villagers confront the spread of disease and superstition. As death reaches into every household and villagers turn from prayers to murderous witch-hunting, Anna must find the strength to confront the disintegration of her community and the lure of illicit love. As she struggles to survive and grow, a year of catastrophe becomes instead annus mirabilis, a "year of wonders."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the true story of Eyam, a village in the rugged hill country of England, &lt;i&gt;Year of Wonders&lt;/i&gt; is a richly detailed evocation of a singular moment in history.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The fourth installment of Bernard Cornwell’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling series chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, “like Game of Thrones, but real” (&lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;, London)—the basis for &lt;em&gt;The Last Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, the hit television series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 885, and England is at peace, divided between the Danish kingdom to the north and the Saxon kingdom of Wessex in the south. Uhtred, the dispossessed son of a Northumbrian lord—warrior by instinct, Viking by nature—has finally settled down. He has land, a wife and two children, and a duty given to him by King Alfred to hold the frontier on the Thames. But then trouble stirs: a dead man has risen, and new Vikings have arrived to occupy the decayed Roman city of London. Their dream is to conquer Wessex, and to do it they need Uhtred’s help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alfred has other ideas. He wants Uhtred to expel the Viking raiders from London. Uhtred must weigh his oath to the king against the dangerous turning tide of shifting allegiances and deadly power struggles. And other storm clouds are gathering: Alfred’s daughter is newly married, but by a cruel twist of fate, her very existence now threatens Alfred’s kingdom. It is Uhtred—half Saxon, half Dane—whose uncertain loyalties must now decide England’s future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sword Song&lt;/em&gt; is Cornwell’s finest work yet—vivid with period detail, this breathtaking adventure throroughly reimagines one of the most fascinating tales in all of history—the birth of England—and breathes life into the brilliant king who made it possible: Alfred the Great.</description>

  <description>Clayton Burroughs comes from a long line of outlaws. For generations, the Burroughs clan has made its home on Bull Mountain in North Georgia, running shine, pot, and meth over six state lines, virtually untouched by the rule of law. To distance himself from his family’s criminal empire, Clayton took the job of sheriff in a neighboring community to keep what peace he can. But when a federal agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms shows up at Clayton’s office with a plan to shut down the mountain, his hidden agenda will pit brother against brother, test loyalties, and could lead Clayton down a path to self-destruction.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Investigator Will Trent and medical examiner Sara Linton must stop a mysterious group of domestic terrorists planning to unleash a deadly epidemic in this electrifying and all too plausible thriller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a serene summer Sunday, a routine admission for a run-of-the-mill surgery at Atlanta’s Emory Hospital goes tragically wrong, setting off a catastrophic wave of destruction that sends the facility and the surrounding area into lockdown. One of the city’s largest and most prestigious institutions, Emory is situated near the Centers for Disease Control, the FBI counter-terrorism headquarters, and a large children’s hospital. Anything that happens there has repercussions for the entire city, the state of Georgia, and possibly the entire nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few miles away, medical examiner Sara Linton is enduring an awkward lunch with her mother, her aunt, and her boyfriend Will Trent, an agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. But the sudden wail of sirens blaring in the distance cuts the uncomfortable get-together short, drawing her and Will to the scene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Sara and Will are seasoned public servants trained to help in an emergency. Dedicated and courageous, they run towards a crisis while others are running away. But on this warm summer day, that instinct will lead them into lethal danger. Within an hour the situation at Emory has spiraled out of control—Sara has been taken prisoner and Will forced undercover, on a case in which thousands of lives are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That “routine admission” at Emory was the opening maneuver in a perilous game of hunter and prey that leads him out of Atlanta into the Appalachians, to a remote compound where a radical group has hatched a diabolical plan for murder on a massive scale that will rock the nation if it isn’t stopped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The third installment of Bernard Cornwell’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling series chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, “like Game of Thrones, but real” (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, London)—the basis for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Last Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, the hit television series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 878. Uhtred, the dispossessed son of a Northumbrian lord, has helped the Saxons of Wessex defeat the invading Danes. Now, finally free of his allegiance to the victorious, ungrateful King Alfred, he is heading home to rescue his stepsister, a prisoner of Kjartan the Cruel in the formidable Danish stronghold of Dunholm. Uhtred’s best hope is his sword, Serpent-Breath, for his only allies are Hild, a West Saxon nun fleeing her calling, and Guthred, a slave who believes himself king. Rebellion, chaos, fear, and betrayal await them in the north, forcing Uhtred to turn once more, reluctantly, to the liege he formerly served in battle and blood: Alfred the Great.</description>

  <description>"She'll have to go back." Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert had decided to adopt an orphan. They wanted a nice sturdy boy to help Matthew with the farm chores. The orphanage sent a girl instead - a mischievous, talkative redhead who the Cuthberts thought would be no use at all. But as soon as Anne arrived at the snug, white farmhouse called Green Gables, she knew she wanted to stay forever.

  <description>The second installment of Bernard Cornwell’s New York Times bestselling series chronicling the epic saga of the making of England, “like Game of Thrones, but real” (The Observer, London)—the basis for The Last Kingdom, the hit television series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the exciting—yet little known—story of the making of England in the 9th and 10th centuries, the years in which King Alfred the Great, his son and grandson defeated the Danish Vikings who had invaded and occupied three of England’s four kingdoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of The Last Kingdom, The Danes had been defeated at Cynuit, but the triumph of the English is not fated to last long. The Danish Vikings quickly invade and occupy three of England’s four kingdoms—and all that remains of the once proud country is a small piece of marshland, where Alfred and his family live with a few soldiers and retainers, including Uhtred, the dispossessed English nobleman who was raised by the Danes. Uhtred has always been a Dane at heart, and has always believed that given the chance, he would fight for the men who raised him and taught him the Viking ways. But when Iseult, a powerful sorceress, enters Uhtred’s life, he is forced to consider feelings he’s never confronted before—and Uhtred discovers, in his moment of greatest peril, a new-found loyalty and love for his native country and ruler.</description>

  <description>The hardscrabble folks of Troublesome Creek have to scrap for everything--everything except books, that is. Thanks to Roosevelt's Kentucky Pack Horse Library Project, Troublesome's got its very own traveling librarian, Cussy Mary Carter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cussy's not only a book woman, however, she's also the last of her kind, her skin a shade of blue unlike most anyone else. Not everyone is keen on Cussy's family or the Library Project, and a Blue is often blamed for any whiff of trouble. If Cussy wants to bring the joy of books to the hill folks, she's going to have to confront prejudice as old as the Appalachias and suspicion as deep as the holler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the true blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the brave and dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse library service of the 1930s, &lt;em&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek&lt;/em&gt; is a story of raw courage, fierce strength, and one woman's belief that books can carry us anywhere--even back home.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;Greg Iles continues the electrifying story begun in his smash &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Natchez Burning&lt;/i&gt; in this highly anticipated second installment of an epic trilogy of blood and race, family and justice, featuring Southern lawyer Penn Cage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Former prosecutor Penn Cage and his fiancée, reporter and publisher Caitlin Masters, have barely escaped with their lives after being attacked by wealthy businessman Brody Royal and his Double Eagles, a KKK sect with ties to some of Mississippi’s most powerful men. But the real danger has only begun as FBI Special Agent John Kaiser warns Penn that Brody wasn’t the true leader of the Double Eagles. The puppeteer who actually controls the terrorist group is a man far more fearsome: the chief of the state police’s Criminal Investigations Bureau, Forrest Knox.&lt;p&gt;The only way Penn can save his father, Dr. Tom Cage—who is fleeing a murder charge as well as corrupt cops bent on killing him—is either to make a devil’s bargain with Knox or destroy him. While Penn desperately pursues both options, Caitlin uncovers the real story behind a series of unsolved civil rights murders that may hold the key to the Double Eagles’ downfall. The trail leads her deep into the past, into the black backwaters of the Mississippi River, to a secret killing ground used by slave owners and the Klan for over two hundred years . . . a place of terrifying evil known only as “the bone tree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bone Tree&lt;/em&gt; is an explosive, action-packed thriller full of twisting intrigue and deadly secrets, a tale that explores the conflicts and casualties that result when the darkest truths of American history come to light. It puts us inside the skin of a noble man who has always fought for justice—now finally pushed beyond his limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how far will Penn Cage, the hero we thought we knew, go to protect those he loves?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The legendary Johnny Cash's remarkable story is captured in this exclusive authorized biography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Master of Life's been good to me. He has given me strength to face past illnesses, and victory in the face of defeat. He has given me life and joy where others saw oblivion...Life and love go on. Let the music play.-Johnny Cash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most influential figures in American music and pop culture, Johnny Cash is an icon to people of all ages. In Cash's first-ever authorized biography, author Steve Turner sifts the man from the legend and presents a picture of the often contradictory figure with unflinching honesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poor sharecropper's son from Arkansas, Cash embarked in the 1950s on a music career that took him to the heights of fame and wealth but also to the depths of addiction and despair. From these tensions Johnny Cash created a haunting music, exploring the dark side of himself, and others, in a voice that sometimes sounded as old as the Grand Canyon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man Called Cash chronicles his career, his love for June Carter Cash, his struggles, and his triumphs. Johnny Cash put his soul into his music, drawing on his demons, his faith, his pain, and his joy to become, to many, the voice of truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From ​the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author comes a breathtaking fantasy of a cursed kingdom, warring clans, and unexpected salvation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayr of Saylok, bastard son of a powerful and jealous chieftain, is haunted by the curse once leveled by his dying mother. Bartered, abandoned, and rarely loved, she plagued the land with her words: &lt;i&gt;From this day forward, there will be no daughters in Saylok.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised among the Keepers at Temple Hill, Bayr is gifted with inhuman strength. But he’s also blessed with an all-too-human heart that beats with one purpose: to protect Alba, the first girl child born in nearly two decades and the salvation for a country at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the fate of Saylok lies with Alba and Bayr, whose bond grows deeper with every whisper of coming chaos. Charged with battling the enemies of their people, both within and without, Bayr is fueled further by the love of a girl who has defied the scourge of Saylok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Bayr and Alba don’t know is that they each threaten the king, a greedy man who built his throne on lies, murder, and betrayal. There is only one way to defend their land from the corruption that has overtaken it. By breaking the curse, they could defeat the king…but they could also destroy themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Everyone's invited...everyone's a suspect...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans of Ruth Ware and Tana French, a shivery, atmospheric, page-turning novel of psychological suspense in the tradition of Agatha Christie, in which a group of old college friends are snowed in at a hunting lodge . . . and murder and mayhem ensue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of them are friends. One of them is a killer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands—the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They arrive on December 30th, just before a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, on New Year’s Day, one of them is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip began innocently enough: admiring the stunning if foreboding scenery, champagne in front of a crackling fire, and reminiscences about the past. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group’s tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year’s Eve, the cord holding them together snaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now one of them is dead . . . and another of them did it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your friends close, the old adage goes. But just how close is too close? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Raised in the southern splendor of Natchez, Mississippi, Penn Cage learned all he knows of duty from his father, Dr. Tom Cage. But now the beloved family doctor has been accused of murdering the African American nurse with whom he worked in the dark days of the 1960s. Once a crusading prosecutor, Penn is determined to save his father, but Tom, stubbornly invoking doctor-patient privilege, refuses even to speak in his own defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penn's quest for the truth sends him deep into his father's past, where a sexually charged secret lies. More chilling, this long-buried sin is only one thread in a conspiracy of greed and murder involving the vicious Double Eagles, an offshoot of the KKK controlled by some of the most powerful men in the state. Aided by a dedicated reporter privy to Natchez's oldest secrets and by his fiancée, Caitlin Masters, Penn uncovers a trail of corruption and brutality that places his family squarely in the Double Eagles' crosshairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every step costing blood and faith, Penn is forced to confront the most wrenching dilemma of his life: Does a man of honor choose his father or the truth?</description>

  <description>Menaced by Vikings and enemies at court, Queen Emma defends her children and her crown in a riveting medieval adventure Readers first met Emma of Normandy in Patricia Bracewell's gripping debut novel, Shadow on the Crown. Unwillingly thrust into marriage to England's King AEthelred, Emma has given the king a son and heir, but theirs has never been a happy marriage. In The Price of Blood, Bracewell returns to 1006 when a beleaguered AEthelred, still haunted by his brother's ghost, governs with an iron fist and a royal policy that embraces murder. As tensions escalate and enmities solidify, Emma forges alliances to protect her young son from ambitious men--even from the man she loves. In the north there is treachery brewing, and when Viking armies ravage England, loyalties are shattered and no one is safe from the sword. Rich with intrigue, compelling personalities, and fascinating detail about a little-known period in history, The Price of Blood will captivate fans of both historical fiction and fantasy novels such as George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones series.</description>

  <description>A brooding and atmospheric Scottish tale from a RITA and RT Reviewers Choice Award-winning and New York Times and USA Today best-selling author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The invincible ninth Roman Legion marches from York to fight the Northern tribes, and then vanishes from the pages of history. When Verity Grey goes looking for them, she may find more than she bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archaeologist Verity Grey has been drawn to the dark legends of the Scottish Borderlands in search of the truth buried in a rocky field by the sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her eccentric boss has spent his whole life searching for the resting place of the lost Ninth Roman Legion and is convinced he's finally found it - not because of any scientific evidence, but because a local boy has "seen" a Roman soldier walking in the fields, a ghostly sentinel who guards the bodies of his long-dead comrades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here on the windswept shores, Verity may find the answer to one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time. Or she may uncover secrets someone buried for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A modern gothic historical fiction with elements of mystery, ghosts, and romance from New York Times and USA Today best-selling author Susanna Kearsley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Diana Gabaldon, Mary Stewart, Kate Morton, and Daphne Du Maurier will want to join Julia and Mariana on their journeys to love, past and present.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eccentric wallflower…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most debutantes dream of finding a husband. Lady Pandora Ravenel has different plans. The ambitious young beauty would much rather stay at home and plot out her new board game business than take part in the London Season. But one night at a glittering society ball, she’s ensnared in a scandal with a wickedly handsome stranger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A cynical rake…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of evading marital traps with ease, Gabriel, Lord St. Vincent, has finally been caught-by a rebellious girl who couldn’t be less suitable. In fact, she wants nothing to do with him. But Gabriel finds the high-spirited Pandora irresistible. He’ll do whatever it takes to possess her, even if their marriage of convenience turns out to be the devil’s own bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A perilous plot…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After succumbing to Gabriel’s skilled and sensuous persuasion, Pandora agrees to become his bride. But soon she discovers that her entrepreneurial endeavors have accidentally involved her in a dangerous conspiracy—and only her husband can keep her safe. As Gabriel protects her from their unknown adversaries, they realize their devil’s bargain may just turn out to be a match made in heaven...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Can there be any greater challenge to London’s Ambitious Mamas than an unmarried duke?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Lady Whistledown’s Society Papers, April 1813&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all accounts, &lt;b&gt;Simon Basset&lt;/b&gt; is on the verge of proposing to his best friend’s sister, the lovely—and almost-on-the-shelf—&lt;b&gt;Daphne Bridgerton&lt;/b&gt;. But the two of them know the truth—it’s all an elaborate plan to keep Simon free from marriage-minded society mothers. And as for Daphne, surely she will attract some worthy suitors now that it seems a duke has declared her desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Daphne waltzes across ballroom after ballroom with Simon, it’s hard to remember that their courtship is a complete sham. Maybe it’s his devilish smile, certainly it’s the way his eyes seem to burn every time he looks at her… but somehow Daphne is falling for the dashing duke… for real! And now she must do the impossible and convince the handsome rogue that their clever little scheme deserves a slight alteration, and that nothing makes quite as much sense as falling in love…</description>

  <description>This is Simon de Montfort's story—and the story of King Henry III, as weak and changeable as Montfort was brash and unbending. It is a saga of two opposing wills that would later clash in a storm of violence and betrayal, a story straight from the pages of history that brings the world of the thirteenth century completely, provocatively, and magnificently alive. Above all, this is a story of conflict and treachery, of human frailty and broken legends, a tale of pageantry and grandeur that is as unforgettable as it is real....</description>

  <description>When the Black Death enters England through the port in Dorsetshire in June 1348, no one knows what manner of sickness it is—or how it spreads and kills so quickly. The Church cites God as the cause, and fear grips the people as they come to believe that the plague is a punishment for wickedness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lady Anne of Develish has her own ideas. Educated by nuns, Anne is a rarity among women, being both literate and knowledgeable. With her brutal husband absent from the manor when news of this pestilence reaches her, she looks for more sensible ways to protect her people than daily confessions of sin. She decides to bring her serfs inside the safety of the moat that surrounds her manor house, then refuses entry to anyone else, even her husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Anne makes an enemy of her daughter and her husband’s steward by doing so, but her resolve is strengthened by the support of her leading serfs...until food stocks run low. The nerves of all are tested by continued confinement and ignorance of what is happening in the world outside. The people of Develish are alive. But for how long? And what will they discover when the time comes for them to cross the moat again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compelling and suspenseful, The Last Hours is a riveting tale of human ingenuity and endurance set against the worst pandemic in history. In Lady Anne of Develish—leader, savior, heretic—Walters has created her most memorable heroine to date.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes &lt;i&gt;The Pillars of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ISBN13 9780330450867 &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25248019-the-pillars-of-the-earth" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The American classic about a young girl's coming-of-age at the turn of the century.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A profoundly moving novel, and an honest and true one. It cuts right to the heart of life... If you miss &lt;i&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt; you will deny yourself a rich experience... It is a poignant and deeply understanding story of childhood and family relationships. The Nolans lived in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn from 1902 until 1919... Their daughter, Francie, and their son, Neely, know more than their fair share of the privations and sufferings that are the lot of a great city's poor. Primarily this is Francie's book. She is a superb feat of characterization, an imaginative, alert, resourceful child. And Francie's growing up and beginnings of wisdom are the substance of &lt;i&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt;." - &lt;b&gt;Orville Prescott&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[&lt;i&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt;] is that rare and enduring thing, a book in which, no matter our backgrounds, we recognize ourselves." - &lt;b&gt;Anna Quindlen&lt;/b&gt;, from her Foreword&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</description>

  <description>A 14-year-old boy vanishes on his way home from school. His frantic mother receives a disturbing ransom call. It's only hours before the deadline, and the police have no leads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Timothy Blake, codename Hangman. Blake is a genius, known for solving impossible cases. He's also a sociopath - the FBI's last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time Blake might have met his match. The kidnapper is more cunning and ruthless than anyone he's faced before. And Blake has been assigned a new partner, a woman linked to the past he's so desperate to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timothy Blake has a secret, one so dark he will do anything to keep it hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he also has a price. Every time he saves a life, he takes one…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already sold into five territories, Hangman is a mesmerising dissection of the criminal mind and a bulletproof thriller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Jack Heath’s Hangman is a perverse, twisted take on a crime novel—and I loved every page of it. What a rarity to find a thriller as dark as a Palahniuk and as compulsively readable as a Patterson. Two well-chewed thumbs up for Hangman.’ —Gregg Hurwitz, NYT-Bestselling author of Hellbent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Jack Heath’s writing grabs you by the throat, gnaws on your bones, and washes it all down with a hefty dose of funny. Sick, twisted, violent, and oh so good. In Timothy Blake, Heath has created a one-of-a-kind character. I hope.’ —Emma Viskic, internationally bestselling author of And Fire Came Down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Wild and original, HANGMAN stamps a high and bloodied mark on this dark genre. Hannibal Lecter will be adding Jack Heath to his reading list.’ —Ben Sanders, internationally bestselling author of American Blood</description>

  <description>Thirteenth-century Wales is a divided country, ever at the mercy of England's ruthless, power-hungry King John. Then Llewelyn, Prince of North Wales, secures an uneasy truce with England by marrying the English king's beloved, illegitimate daughter, Joanna. Reluctant to wed her father's bitter enemy, Joanna slowly grows to love her charismatic and courageous husband who dreams of uniting Wales. But as John's attentions turn again and again to subduing Wales--and Llewelyn--Joanna must decide to which of these powerful men she owes her loyalty and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping novel of power and passion, loyalty and lives, this is the book that began the trilogy that includes FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes, when you open the door to the past, what you confront is your destiny.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reclusive author Vida Winter, famous for her collection of twelve enchanting stories, has spent the past six decades penning a series of alternate lives for herself. Now old and ailing, she is ready to reveal the truth about her extraordinary existence and the violent and tragic past she has kept secret for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calling on Margaret Lea, a young biographer troubled by her own painful history, Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good. Margaret is mesmerized by the author’s tale of gothic strangeness—featuring the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Margaret and Vida confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.</description>

  <description>This beloved book by E. B. White, author of Stuart Little and The Trumpet of the Swan, is a classic of children's literature that is "just about perfect." This high-quality paperback features vibrant illustrations colorized by Rosemary Wells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Pig. Humble. Radiant. These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high up in Zuckerman's barn. Charlotte's spiderweb tells of her feelings for a little pig named Wilbur, who simply wants a friend. They also express the love of a girl named Fern, who saved Wilbur's life when he was born the runt of his litter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. B. White's Newbery Honor Book is a tender novel of friendship, love, life, and death that will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come. This edition contains newly color illustrations by Garth Williams, the acclaimed illustrator of E. B. White's Stuart Little and Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series, among many other books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--harpercollins.com</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;First they were &lt;i&gt;Left Behind&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;Then they formed the &lt;i&gt;Tribulation Force&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Now they must face &lt;i&gt;Nicolae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Nicolae&lt;/i&gt;, the most explosive of the three books thus far, the seven-year tribulation is nearing the end of its first quarter, when prophecy says that "the wrath of the Lamb" will be poured out upon the earth. Rayford Steele becomes the ears of the tribulation saints at the highest levels of the Carpathia regime. Meanwhile, Buck Williams attempts a dramatic all-night rescue run from Israel through the Sinai that will hold you breathless to the end.</description>

Odds are even worse for enemies of the Antichrist and his new world order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, Bruce Barnes, and Chloe Steele band together to form the Tribulation Force. Their task is clear, and their goal is nothing less than to stand and fight the enemies of God during the seven most chaotic years the planet will ever see.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;an alternate cover edition can be found &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8949711-the-clan-of-the-cave-bear" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novel of awesome beauty and power is a moving saga about people, relationships, and the boundaries of love. Through Jean M. Auel’s magnificent storytelling we are taken back to the dawn of modern humans, and with a girl named Ayla we are swept up in the harsh and beautiful Ice Age world they shared with the ones who called themselves The Clan of the Cave Bear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A natural disaster leaves the young girl wandering alone in an unfamiliar and dangerous land until she is found by a woman of the Clan, people very different from her own kind. To them, blond, blue-eyed Ayla looks peculiar and ugly--she is one of the Others, those who have moved into their ancient homeland; but Iza cannot leave the girl to die and takes her with them. Iza and Creb, the old Mog-ur, grow to love her, and as Ayla learns the ways of the Clan and Iza’s way of healing, most come to accept her. But the brutal and proud youth who is destined to become their next leader sees her differences as a threat to his authority. He develops a deep and abiding hatred for the strange girl of the Others who lives in their midst, and is determined to get his revenge.</description>

  <description>The year is 1945. Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is just back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an “outlander”—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of Our Lord...1743.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life, and shatter her heart. For here James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire—and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.</description>

  <description>When Victoria Langford got engaged, she told herself to give love a chance. Six months later, she's on the run from her angry, abusive ex-fiancé with her four-year-old daughter and nowhere to go.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seventy miles north of Dallas, the Iron River Ranch is pretty much nowhere. That’s what its new owner, Josh Cain, wanted when he came back from Afghanistan. Big skies, quiet nights, no trouble.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One look tells Josh the pretty redhead with the adorable little girl will give him trouble of the most personal kind. But he’s seen trouble before, and he doesn't scare easy. Not when “accidents” start happening around the ranch. Not when Tory’s best friend back in Phoenix is abducted and brutalized. Not even when it looks like their current problems are only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if he gets too close to fierce, determined Tory, Josh knows his nights are going to be anything but quiet. And that’s one possibility no amount of training can prepare him for . . .</description>

      <![CDATA[Thank you NetGalley, Kensington and the author for a free advanced copy. <br /><br />I absolutely take no joy in giving bad reviews. While I love suspending reality, this bordered on the ridiculous. I will say, I truly enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times &lt;i&gt;bestselling author Kat Martin brings page-turning suspense to a tale of secrets and passions turned deadly . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Texas mogul Beau Reese is furious. All six feet three obscenely wealthy, good-looking inches of him. His sixty-year-old father, Stewart, a former state senator no less, has impregnated a &lt;i&gt;teenager.&lt;/i&gt; Barely able to contain his anger, Beau is in for another surprise. It appears that Stewart has moved an entirely different woman into the house . . .&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Beau assumes that stunning Cassidy Jones is his father’s mistress. At least she’s of age. But those concerns take a sudden backseat when he finds Stewart in a pool of blood on the floor of his study—and Cassidy walks in to find Beau with his hand on the murder weapon.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The shocks just keep coming. Someone was following Stewart, and Cassidy is the detective hired to find out who and why. Now she’ll have to find his killer instead. Her gut tells her it wasn’t Beau. And Beau’s instincts tell him it wasn’t Cassidy. Determined to track down the truth, they form an uneasy alliance—one that will bring them closer to each other—closer to danger and beyond . . .</description>

  <description>Five weeks ago Carly Drake stood at her grandfather’s grave. Now she’s burying Drake Trucking’s top driver, and the cops have no leads on the hijacking or murder. Faced with bankruptcy, phone threats and the fear of failure, Carly has to team up with the last man she wants to owe—Lincoln Cain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cain is magnetic, powerful, controlling—and hiding more than one secret. He promised Carly’s granddad he’d protect her. The old man took a chance on him when he was nothing but a kid with a record, and now he’s the multi-millionaire owner of a rival firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Linc’s money can’t protect Carly from the men who’ll do anything to shut her down, or the secrets behind Drake Trucking. If she won’t sell out, the only way to keep her safe is to keep her close . . . and fight like hell.</description>

  <description>My family has secrets. I’m always the good girl, doing what’s necessary to keep my loved ones safe. I've kept the darkest secrets from everyone I know. As painful as it is to hold them all inside where they live and gnaw away at me, that’s where they must stay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven't seen my closest childhood friend, Christian Bear, since I was a teenager—he hasn't changed a bit. He’s still temperamental and plays by his own rules with the law following two steps behind him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian remembers me. But he doesn’t know the first thing about me anymore. I should've shared my feelings with him the day before I moved away with my family, promising him I'd stay in touch. It broke my heart when he didn't keep his end of the bargain. As a consequence, we haven't spoken in years. Even though Christian and I have always had undeniable chemistry, I won't let him shatter my heart a second time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian has shown up in my life again with secrets of his own, and demanding answers. That doesn't mean I'm willing to give them. He'll know my secrets when I’m ready. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our secrets, the risks we’re taking, and the danger he imposes make it impossible to know what our future holds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either our tethered souls will bind back together, or our secrets will separate us forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tethered Souls is the second spin-off novel from The Nine Minutes Trilogy. It can be read as a standalone, but would most likely be more enjoyable if read after Nine Minutes, Out of Time, and A Gift of Time. It contains major spoilers from the trilogy, and although not necessary, the reader might benefit by understanding the background stories of the main characters that are described in the series. There are many twists and turns in all my books that can best be connected if read consecutively. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love, loss, friendship, and the betrayals of the past all collide in this first women’s fiction novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 international bestselling author Christina Lauren (&lt;i&gt;Autoboyography, Dating You / Hating You&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the heart can never be unwritten.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macy Sorensen is settling into an ambitious if emotionally tepid routine: work hard as a new pediatrics resident, plan her wedding to an older, financially secure man, keep her head down and heart tucked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she runs into Elliot Petropoulos—the first and only love of her life—the careful bubble she’s constructed begins to dissolve. Once upon a time, Elliot was Macy’s entire world—growing from her gangly bookish friend into the man who coaxed her heart open again after the loss of her mother...only to break it on the very night he declared his love for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating timelines between Then and Now, teenage Elliot and Macy grow from friends to much more—spending weekends and lazy summers together in a house outside of San Francisco devouring books, sharing favorite words, and talking through their growing pains and triumphs. As adults, they have become strangers to one another until their chance reunion. Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy’s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tatjana Soli, an expansive and transfixing new novel set on the American frontier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning the years of the first great settlement of the west, &lt;i&gt;The Removes&lt;/i&gt; tells the intertwining stories of fifteen-year-old Anne Cummins, frontierswoman Libbie Custer, and Libbie’s husband, the Civil War hero George Armstrong Custer. When Anne survives a surprise attack on her family’s homestead, she is thrust into a difficult life she never anticipated—living among the Sioux as both a captive and, eventually, a member of the tribe. Libbie, too, is thrown into a brutal, unexpected life when she marries Custer. They move out to the territories with the U.S. Army, where Libbie is challenged daily and her worldview expanded: the pampered daughter of a small-town judge, she transforms into a daring camp follower. But when what Anne and Libbie have come to know—self-reliance, freedom, danger—is suddenly altered through tragedy and loss, they realize how indelibly shaped they are by life on the treacherous, extraordinary American plains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With taut, suspenseful writing, Tatjana Soli tells the exhilarating stories of Libbie and Anne, who have grown like weeds into women unwilling to be restrained by the strictures governing nineteenth-century society. &lt;i&gt;The Removes&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, transporting novel about the addictive intensity and freedom of the American frontier.</description>

  <description>Author Callie Logan never expected to swap her life in London for one in rural Suffolk but, after the breakdown of her marriage, she decides that a fresh start is just what she needs. Finding Owl Cottage in the tiny village of Newton St Clare, Callie determines to give up on love and throw herself into her work. But fate seems to have other ideas and she soon has two very different men vying for her attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First there's Leo who likes to live on the wild side which usually means taking his dates foraging in the local woods for their supper. Then there's Sam Nightingale, owner of Nightingale’s bookshop. Sam, recovering from a divorce, has also vowed to embrace the single life. That is, until he meets Callie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But is Callie willing to risk her heart again and, if she is, will she make the right choice? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; He surfaced two years ago. Then he disappeared ... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Detective Angie Pallorino never forgot the violent rapist who left a distinctive calling card—crosses etched into the flesh of his victim’s foreheads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a comatose Jane Doe is found in a local cemetery, sexually assaulted, mutilated, and nearly drowned, Angie is struck by the eerie similarities to her earlier unsolved rapes. Could &lt;i&gt; he&lt;/i&gt; be back?&lt;br /&gt;​&lt;br /&gt;Then the body of a drowned young woman floats up in the Gorge, also bearing the marks of the serial rapist, and the hunt for a predator becomes a hunt for a killer. Assigned to the joint investigative task force, Angie is more than ready to prove that she has what it takes to break into the all-male homicide division. But her private life collides with her professional ambitions when she’s introduced to her temporary partner, James Maddocks—a man she’d met the night before in an intense, anonymous encounter.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together, Angie and Maddocks agree to put that night behind them. But as their search for the killer intensifies so does their mutual desire. And Angie’s forays into the mind of a monster shake lose some unsettling secrets about her own past . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; How can she fight for the truth when it turns out her whole life is a lie? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; </description>

  <description>From the author of the acclaimed novels The House Between Tides and Beyond the Wild River, a rich, atmospheric tale set on the sea-lashed coast of west Scotland, in which the lives of a ninth-century Norsewoman, a nineteenth-century woman, and a twenty-first-century archeologist weave together after a body is discovered in the dunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby Snow has always felt the pull of Ullanessm a lush Scottish island enshrouded in myth and deeply important to her family. Her great-great-grandmother Ellen was obsessed with the strange legend of Ulla, a Viking maiden who washed up on shore with the nearly lifeless body of her husband—and who inspired countless epic poems and the island’s name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Central to the mystery is an ornate chalice and Libby, an archaeologist, finally has permission to excavate the site where Ulla is believed to have lived. But what Libby finds in the ancient dunes is a body from the Victorian era, clearly murdered…and potentially connected to Ellen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unfolds is an epic story that spans centuries, with Libby mining Ellen and Ulla’s stories for clues about the body, and in doing so, discovering the darker threads that bind all three women together across history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infused with Sarah Maine’s signature “meticulous research and descriptive passages of lush, beautiful landscapes” (Publishers Weekly), Women of the Dunes is a beautifully told and compelling mystery for fans of Kate Morton and Beatriz Williams.</description>

  <description>Detective Josie Quinn is horrified when she’s called to the house of a mother who had her newborn baby snatched from her arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman caught fleeing the scene is Josie’s only lead, but when questioned it seems this mysterious girl doesn’t know who she is, where she’s from or why she is so terrified…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is she a witness, a suspect, or the next victim? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Josie digs deeper, a letter about a mix-up at a fertility clinic links the nameless girl and the missing child to a spate of killings across the county. Josie is faced with an impossible decision: should she risk the life of one innocent child to save many others… or can she find another way?</description>

  <description>It's 1946 and author Juliet Ashton can't think what to write next. Out of the blue, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - by chance, he's acquired a book that once belonged to her - and, spurred on by their mutual love of reading, they begin a correspondence. When Dawsey reveals that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, her curiosity is piqued and it's not long before she begins to hear from other members. As letters fly back and forth with stories of life in Guernsey under the German Occupation, Juliet soon realizes that the society is every bit as extraordinary as its name.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Tara Westover grew up preparing for the End of Days, watching for the sun to darken, for the moon to drip as if with blood. She spent her summers bottling peaches and her winters rotating emergency supplies, hoping that when the World of Men failed, her family would continue on, unaffected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in doctors or hospitals. According to the state and federal government, she didn’t exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she grew older, her father became more radical, and her brother, more violent. At sixteen Tara decided to educate herself. Her struggle for knowledge would take her far from her Idaho mountains, over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she’d travelled too far. If there was still a way home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDUCATED is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes with the severing of the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has, from her singular experience, crafted a universal coming-of-age story, one that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers – the perspective to see one’s life through new eyes, and the will to change it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2011 Coretta Scott King Author Award&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 2011 Newbery Honor Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven-year-old Delphine has it together. Even though her mother, Cecile, abandoned her and her younger sisters, Vonetta and Fern, seven years ago. Even though her father and Big Ma will send them from Brooklyn to Oakland, California, to stay with Cecile for the summer. And even though Delphine will have to take care of her sisters, as usual, and learn the truth about the missing pieces of the past. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the girls arrive in Oakland in the summer of 1968, Cecile wants nothing to do with them. She makes them eat Chinese takeout dinners, forbids them to enter her kitchen, and never explains the strange visitors with Afros and black berets who knock on her door. Rather than spend time with them, Cecile sends Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern to a summer camp sponsored by a revolutionary group, the Black Panthers, where the girls get a radical new education. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set during one of the most tumultuous years in recent American history, One Crazy Summer is the heartbreaking, funny tale of three girls in search of the mother who abandoned them-an unforgettable story told by a distinguished author of books for children and teens, Rita Williams-Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Nightingale Books, nestled on the high street in Peasebrook, a picture-postcard Cotswold town, is a dream comes true for booklovers. Everyone who enters falls in love with something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But owner Emilia Nightingale is struggling to keep the shop open and the developers are circling. The temptation to sell up is proving enormous - but what about the promise she made to her father? Not to mention her customers, for whom the shop is a comfort, a meeting place, a lifeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's Gary, a stable lad for a nearby trainer, who buys books to read to Nikki, who is lying in a coma. He spends every spare hour at Nikki's bedside, never giving up hope that she will come round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betty, who runs a supper club from her tiny cottage, has a huge crush on a man she met and then lost in the cookery section, somewhere Auguste Escoffier and Marco Pierre White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs Norris repeatedly 'forgets' to pay for her books - and Emilia never has the heart to remind her. But Mrs Norris isn't quite as forgetful as she pretends ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Emilia meets Dexter, local jack-the-lad, who is looking to improve his English so he can better himself. He buys all Emilia's recommendations, and together they re-discover all her favourite authors. But Dexter has a secret, and is not all he seems...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Find Love in a Bookshop&lt;/i&gt; is the delightful story of Emilia's fight to keep her bookshop alive, the customers whose lives she has touched - and the books they all love.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>The women of the Waverley family -- whether they like it or not -- are heirs to an unusual legacy, one that grows in a fenced plot behind their Queen Anne home on Pendland Street in Bascom, North Carolina. There, an apple tree bearing fruit of magical properties looms over a garden filled with herbs and edible flowers that possess the power to affect in curious ways anyone who eats them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly a decade, 34-year-old Claire Waverley, at peace with her family inheritance, has lived in the house alone, embracing the spirit of the grandmother who raised her, ruing her mother's unfortunate destiny and seemingly unconcerned about the fate of her rebellious sister, Sydney, who freed herself long ago from their small town's constraints. Using her grandmother's mystical culinary traditions, Claire has built a successful catering business -- and a carefully controlled, utterly predictable life -- upon the family's peculiar gift for making life-altering delicacies: lilac jelly to engender humility, for instance, or rose geranium wine to call up fond memories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Garden Spells&lt;/i&gt; reveals what happens when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter, turning Claire's routine existence upside down. With Sydney's homecoming, the magic that the quiet caterer has measured into recipes to shape the thoughts and moods of others begins to influence Claire's own emotions in terrifying and delightful ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sisters reconnect and learn to support one another, each finds romance where she least expects it, while Sydney's child, Bay, discovers both the safe home she has longed for and her own surprising gifts. With the help of their elderly cousin Evanelle, endowed with her own uncanny skills, the Waverley women redeem the past, embrace the present, and take a joyful leap into the future.</description>

  <description>Finn and Layla are young, in love, and on vacation. They’re driving along the highway when Finn decides to stop at a service station to use the restroom. He hops out of the car, locks the doors behind him, and goes inside. When he returns Layla is gone—never to be seen again. That is the story Finn told to the police. But it is not the whole story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later Finn is engaged to Layla’s sister, Ellen. Their shared grief over what happened to Layla drew them close and now they intend to remain together. Still, there’s something about Ellen that Finn has never fully understood. His heart wants to believe that she is the one for him...even though a sixth sense tells him not to trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, not long before he and Ellen are to be married, Finn gets a phone call. Someone from his past has seen Layla—hiding in plain sight. There are other odd occurrences: Long-lost items from Layla’s past that keep turning up around Finn and Ellen’s house. Emails from strangers who seem to know too much. Secret messages, clues, warnings. If Layla is alive—and on Finn’s trail—what does she want? And how much does she know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tour de force of psychological suspense, Bring Me Back will have you questioning everything and everyone until its stunning climax.</description>

  <description>Three generations of Irish nobles face their family secrets in this spellbinding novel from the award-winning author of the Boleyn King trilogy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Gallagher family has called Deeprath Castle home for seven hundred years. Nestled in the Wicklow Mountains of Ireland, the estate is now slated to become a public trust, and book lover and scholar Carragh Ryan is hired to take inventory of its historic library. But after meeting Aidan, the current Viscount Gallagher, and his enigmatic family, Carragh knows that her task will be more challenging than she’d thought.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Two decades before, Aidan’s parents died violently at Deeprath. The case, which was never closed, has recently been taken up by a new detective determined to find the truth. The couple’s unusual deaths harken back a century, when twenty-three-year-old Lady Jenny Gallagher also died at Deeprath under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind an infant son and her husband, a renowned writer who never published again. These incidents only fueled fantastical theories about the Darkling Bride, a local legend of a sultry and dangerous woman from long ago whose wrath continues to haunt the castle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The past catches up to the present, and odd clues in the house soon have Carragh wondering if there are unseen forces stalking the Gallagher family. As secrets emerge from the shadows and Carragh gets closer to answers—and to Aidan—could she be the Darkling Bride’s next victim?</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Secrets of a Charmed Life&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Bridge Across the Ocean&lt;/i&gt; comes a new novel set in Philadelphia during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, which tells the story of a family reborn through loss and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1918, Philadelphia was a city teeming with promise. Even as its young men went off to fight in the Great War, there were opportunities for a fresh start on its cobblestone streets. Into this bustling town, came Pauline Bright and her husband, filled with hope that they could now give their three daughters--Evelyn, Maggie, and Willa--a chance at a better life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just months after they arrive, the Spanish Flu reaches the shores of America. As the pandemic claims more than twelve thousand victims in their adopted city, they find their lives left with a world that looks nothing like the one they knew. But even as they lose loved ones, they take in a baby orphaned by the disease who becomes their single source of hope. Amidst the tragedy and challenges, they learn what they cannot live without--and what they are willing to do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As Bright as Heaven&lt;/i&gt; is the compelling story of a mother and her daughters who find themselves in a harsh world, not of their making, which will either crush their resolve to survive or purify it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: There is an updated cover for this edition with ASIN B074ZKDWT2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When newlywed Ruby Henderson Benoit arrives in Paris in 1939 with her French husband Marcel, she imagines strolling arm in arm along the grand boulevards, awash in the golden afternoon light. But war is looming on the horizon, and as France falls to the Nazis, her marriage begins to splinter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Dacher is eleven when the Germans roll into the French capital, their sinister swastika flags snapping in the breeze. After the Jewish restrictions take effect and Jews are ordered to wear the yellow star, Charlotte can’t imagine things getting much worse. But then the mass deportations begin, and her life is ripped forever apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Clarke joins the British Royal Air Force to protect his country, but when his beloved mother dies in a German bombing during the waning days of the Blitz, he wonders if he’s really making a difference. Then he finds himself in Paris, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, and he discovers a new reason to keep fighting—and an unexpected road home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fate brings them together, Ruby, Charlotte, and Thomas must summon the courage to defy the Nazis—and to open their own broken hearts—as they fight to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;"The house, when I first saw it, seemed intent on guarding what it knew; but we all learned, by the end of it, that secrets aren't such easy things to keep."&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's late summer, war is raging, and families are torn apart by divided loyalties and deadly secrets. In this complex and dangerous time, a young French Canadian lieutenant is captured and billeted with a Long Island family, an unwilling and unwelcome guest. As he begins to pitch in with the never-ending household tasks and farm chores, Jean-Philippe de Sabran finds himself drawn to the daughter of the house. Slowly, Lydia Wilde comes to lean on Jean-Philippe, true soldier and gentleman, until their lives become inextricably intertwined. Legend has it that the forbidden love between Jean-Philippe and Lydia ended tragically, but centuries later, the clues they left behind slowly unveil the true story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Part history, part romance, and all kinds of magic, Susanna Kearsley's latest masterpiece will draw you in and never let you go, even long after you've closed the last page.&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 internationally best-selling thriller from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Hypnotist&lt;/i&gt; tells the chilling story of a manipulative serial killer and the two brilliant police agents who must try to beat him at his own game.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late one night, outside Stockholm, Mikael Kohler-Frost is found wandering. Thirteen years earlier, he went missing along with his younger sister. They were long thought to have been victims of Sweden's most notorious serial killer, Jurek Walter, now serving a life sentence in a maximum security psychiatric hospital. Now Mikael tells the police that his sister is still alive and being held by someone he knows only as the Sandman. Years ago, Detective Inspector Joona Linna made an excruciating personal sacrifice to ensure Jurek's capture. He is keenly aware of what this killer is capable of, and now he is certain that Jurek has an accomplice. He knows that any chance of rescuing Mikael's sister depends on getting Jurek to talk, and that the only agent capable of this is Inspector Saga Bauer, a twenty-seven-year-old prodigy. She will have to go under deep cover in the psychiatric ward where Jurek is imprisoned, and she will have to find a way to get to the psychopath before it's too late--and before he gets inside her head.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Twenty-six years ago Hannah had her eye shot out. Now she wants justice. But is she blind to the truth?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher J. Yates’s cult hit &lt;i&gt;Black Chalk&lt;/i&gt; introduced that rare writerly talent: a literary writer who could write a plot with the intricacy of a brilliant mental puzzle, and with characters so absorbing that readers are immediately gripped. Yates’s new book does not disappoint. &lt;i&gt;Grist Mill Road&lt;/i&gt; is a dark, twisted, and expertly plotted Rashomon-style tale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 1982; the setting, an Edenic hamlet some ninety miles north of New York City. There, among the craggy rock cliffs and glacial ponds of timeworn mountains, three friends—Patrick, Matthew, and Hannah—are bound together by a terrible and seemingly senseless crime. Twenty-six years later, in New York City, living lives their younger selves never could have predicted, the three meet again—with even more devastating results.</description>

  <description>An English professor struggling for tenure discovers that her ex-fiancé has just become the president of her college—and her new boss—in this whip-smart modern retelling of Jane Austen’s classic &lt;i&gt;Persuasion&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Corey is about to get schooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An English professor in California, she’s determined to score a position on the coveted tenure track at her college. All she’s got to do is get a book deal, snag a promotion, and &lt;i&gt;boom!&lt;/i&gt; She’s in. But then Adam Martinez—her first love and ex-fiancé—shows up as the college’s new president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne should be able to keep herself distracted. After all, she’s got a book to write, an aging father to take care of, and a new romance developing with the college’s insanely hot writer-in-residence. But no matter where she turns, there’s Adam, as smart and sexy as ever. As the school year advances and her long-buried feelings begin to resurface, Anne begins to wonder whether she just might get a second chance at love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, smart, and full of heart, this modern ode to Jane Austen’s classic explores what happens when we run into the demons of our past...and when they turn out not to be so bad, after all.</description>

  <description>In bestseller Elin Hilderbrand's first Christmas novel, a family gathers on Nantucket for a holiday filled with surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelley Quinn is the owner of Nantucket's Winter Street Inn and the proud father of four, all of them grown and living in varying states of disarray. Patrick, the eldest, is a hedge fund manager with a guilty conscience. Kevin, a bartender, is secretly sleeping with a French housekeeper named Isabelle. Ava, a school teacher, is finally dating the perfect guy but can't get him to commit. And Bart, the youngest and only child of Kelley's second marriage to Mitzi, has recently shocked everyone by joining the Marines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Christmas approaches, Kelley is looking forward to getting the family together for some quality time at the inn. But when he walks in on Mitzi kissing Santa Claus (or the guy who's playing Santa at the inn's annual party), utter chaos descends. With the three older children each reeling in their own dramas and Bart unreachable in Afghanistan, it might be up to Kelley's ex-wife, nightly news anchor Margaret Quinn, to save Christmas at the Winter Street Inn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the mulled cider is gone, the delightfully dysfunctional Quinn family will survive a love triangle, an unplanned pregnancy, a federal crime, a small house fire, many shots of whiskey, and endless rounds of Christmas caroling, in this heart-warming novel about coming home for the holidays.</description>

  <description>She was close enough to see that the girl had written a word on the wall in bright, warm red blood. Not a word, actually. A name…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the small American town of Denton is searching for Isabelle Coleman, a missing seventeen-year-old girl. All they’ve found so far is her phone and another girl they didn’t even know was missing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mute and completely unresponsive to the world around her, it’s clear this mysterious girl has been damaged beyond repair. All Detective Josie Quinn can get from her is a name: Ramona.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Currently suspended from the force for misconduct, Josie takes matters into her own hands as the name leads her to evidence linking the two girls. She knows the race is on to find Isabelle alive, and she fears there may be others… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trail leads Josie to another victim, a girl who escaped but whose case was labelled a hoax by authorities. To catch this monster, Josie must confront her own nightmares and follow her instinct to the darkest of places. But can she make it out alive?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fans of Angela Marsons, Helen Fields and Robert Dugoni will be utterly gripped and sleeping with the lights on once they discover the first in this unputdownable new crime thriller series.</description>

  <description>Siglufjörður: an idyllically quiet fishing village on the northernmost tip of Iceland, accessible only via a small mountain tunnel. Ari Thór Arason: a local policeman, whose tumultuous past and uneasy relationships with the villagers continue to haunt him. The peace of this close-knit community is shattered by the murder of a policeman – shot at point-blank range in the dead of night in a deserted house. With a killer on the loose and the dark arctic winter closing in, it falls to Ari Thór to piece together a puzzle that involves tangled local politics, a compromised new mayor, and a psychiatric ward in Reykjavik, where someone is being held against their will. Then a mysterious young woman moves to the area, on the run from something she dare not reveal, and it becomes all too clear that tragic events from the past are weaving a sinister spell that may threaten them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark, chilling and complex, &lt;i&gt;Nightblind&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary thriller from an undeniable new talent.</description>

  <description>When a bookshop patron commits suicide, his favorite store clerk must unravel the puzzle he left behind. Lydia Smith lives her life hiding in plain sight. A clerk at the Bright Ideas bookstore, she keeps a meticulously crafted existence among her beloved books, eccentric colleagues, and the BookFrogs—the lost and lonely regulars who spend every day marauding the store’s overwhelmed shelves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But when Joey Molina, a young, beguiling BookFrog, kills himself in the bookstore’s upper room, Lydia’s life comes unglued. Always Joey’s favorite bookseller, Lydia has been bequeathed his meager worldly possessions. Trinkets and books; the detritus of a lonely, uncared for man. But when Lydia flips through his books she finds them defaced in ways both disturbing and inexplicable. They reveal the psyche of a young man on the verge of an emotional reckoning. And they seem to contain a hidden message. What did Joey know? And what does it have to do with Lydia?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As Lydia untangles the mystery of Joey’s suicide, she unearths a long buried memory from her own violent childhood. Details from that one bloody night begin to circle back. Her distant father returns to the fold, along with an obsessive local cop, and the Hammerman, a murderer who came into Lydia’s life long ago and, as she soon discovers, never completely left.</description>

  <description>Four sisters. One summer. A lifetime of secrets.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When fifteen-year-old Margot and her three sisters arrive at Applecote Manor in June 1959, they expect a quiet English country summer. Instead, they find their aunt and uncle still reeling from the disappearance of their daughter, Audrey, five years before. As the sisters become divided by new tensions when two handsome neighbors drop by, Margot finds herself drawn into the life Audrey left behind. When the summer takes a deadly turn, the girls must unite behind an unthinkable choice or find themselves torn apart forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifty years later, Jesse is desperate to move her family out of their London home, where signs of her widower husband’s previous wife are around every corner. Gorgeous Applecote Manor, nestled in the English countryside, seems the perfect solution. But Jesse finds herself increasingly isolated in their new sprawling home, at odds with her fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, and haunted by the strange rumors that surround the manor.</description>

      <![CDATA[I discovered Eve Chase earlier this year when I read her book “Black Rabbit Hall” which I truly enjoyed. So when I heard she had another book coming out I knew I had to read it.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As she saw his face for the first time, she knew he was going to kill her. She just didn’t know when.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the dismembered body of Lydia Steiner is found washed up in the waters of a blisteringly hot Louisiana swamp, &lt;b&gt;Detective Jess Bishop&lt;/b&gt; knows for certain this isn’t the murderer’s first kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three other dismembered bodies have been found, all bearing the same marks. Marks that strike fear into Jess’s heart. They are identical to those from a case she’s spent her entire career trying to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess and her team try to link the victims, another body is discovered and they fear the serial killer is taunting them. They know it’s only a matter of time before he kills again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises, and the hunt goes cold, Jess knows she has to confront her past in order to catch the killer, &lt;b&gt;even if that means making herself the bait...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Countless others have rendered their verdict. Now it is your turn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russia, July 17, 1918&lt;/b&gt; Under direct orders from Vladimir Lenin, Bolshevik secret police force Anastasia Romanov, along with the entire imperial family, into a damp basement in Siberia where they face a merciless firing squad. None survive. At least that is what the executioners have always claimed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Germany, February 17, 1920&lt;/b&gt; A young woman bearing an uncanny resemblance to Anastasia Romanov is pulled shivering and senseless from a canal in Berlin. Refusing to explain her presence in the freezing water, she is taken to the hospital where an examination reveals that her body is riddled with countless, horrific scars. When she finally does speak, this frightened, mysterious woman claims to be the Russian Grand Duchess Anastasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her detractors, convinced that the young woman is only after the immense Romanov fortune, insist on calling her by a different name: Anna Anderson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As rumors begin to circulate through European society that the youngest Romanov daughter has survived the massacre, old enemies and new threats are awakened.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A breakout suspense novel from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Maddy Clare&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 1950. &lt;/b&gt;There's a place for the girls whom no one wants--the troublemakers, the illegitimate, the too smart for their own good. It's called Idlewild Hall. And in the small town where it's located, there are rumors that the boarding school is haunted. Four roommates bond over their whispered fears, their budding friendship blossoming--until one of them mysteriously disappears. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 2014.&lt;/b&gt; As much as she's tried, journalist Fiona Sheridan cannot stop revisiting the events surrounding her older sister's death. Twenty years ago, her body was found lying in the overgrown fields near the ruins of Idlewild Hall. And though her sister's boyfriend was tried and convicted of murder, Fiona can't shake the suspicion that something was never right about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona discovers that Idlewild Hall is being restored by an anonymous benefactor, she decides to write a story about it. But a shocking discovery during the renovations will link the loss of her sister to secrets that were meant to stay hidden in the past--and a voice that won't be silenced. . . .</description>

  <description>Helena Pelletier has a loving husband, two beautiful daughters, and a business that fills her days. But she also has a secret: she is the product of an abduction. Her mother was kidnapped as a teenager by her father and kept in a remote cabin in the marshlands of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Helena, born two years after the abduction, loved her home in nature, and despite her father’s sometimes brutal behavior, she loved him, too…until she learned precisely how savage he could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than twenty years later, she has buried her past so soundly that even her husband doesn’t know the truth. But now her father has killed two guards, escaped from prison, and disappeared into the marsh. The police begin a manhunt, but Helena knows they don’t stand a chance. Knows that only one person has the skills to find the survivalist the world calls the Marsh King–because only one person was ever trained by him: his daughter.</description>

  <description>As an old house is demolished in a gentrifying section of London, a workman discovers a tiny skeleton, buried for years. For journalist Kate Waters, it’s a story that deserves attention. She cobbles together a piece for her newspaper, but at a loss for answers, she can only pose a question: Who is the Building Site Baby?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kate investigates, she unearths connections to a crime that rocked the city decades earlier: A newborn baby was stolen from the maternity ward in a local hospital and was never found. Her heartbroken parents were left devastated by the loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is more to the story, and Kate is drawn—house by house—into the pasts of the people who once lived in this neighborhood that has given up its greatest mystery. And she soon finds herself the keeper of unexpected secrets that erupt in the lives of three women—and torn between what she can and cannot tell…</description>

  <description>Henning Mankell's last novel about an aging man whose quiet, solitary life on an isolated island off the coast of Sweden is turned upside down when his house catches fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fredrik Welin is a former surgeon who retired in disgrace decades earlier to a tiny island on which he is the only resident. He has a daughter he rarely sees and his mailman Jansson is the closest thing he has to a friend, and to an adversary. He is perfectly content to live out his days in quiet solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One autumn evening, he is startled awake by a blinding light--only to discover that his house is on fire. With the help of Jansson, he escapes the flames just in time wearing two left boots. Dawn reveals that everything he owns is now a smoldering pile of ash and his house is destroyed--forcing him to move into an abandoned trailer on his island. A local journalist, Lisa Modin, who wants to write a story about the fire, comes into his life. In doing so, she awakens in him something that he thought was long dead. Soon after, his daughter comes to the island with surprising news of her own. Meanwhile, the police suspect Fredrik of arson because he had a sizable insurance claim on his house. When Fredrik is away from the archipelago, another house goes up in flames and the community realizes they have an arsonist in their midst. After the Fire is an intimate portrait of an elderly recluse who is forced to open himself up to a world he'd left behind.</description>

  <description>Detective Harry Hole must use his maverick methods once again as he investigates a slew of brutal bank robberies and the suspicious suicide of a female artist in this clever and harrowing installment in the Harry Hole series from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Snowman&lt;/em&gt;—soon to be a major motion picture, starring Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, and J. K. Simmons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Nesbo’s storytelling abilities are incomparable. &lt;em&gt;Nemesis&lt;/em&gt; is crime novel as art form and great entertainment.”—&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captured on closed-circuit television: A man walks into an Oslo bank, puts a gun to a cashier's head, and tells her to count to twenty-five. When he doesn't get his money fast enough, he pulls the trigger. The young woman dies—and two million Norwegian kroner disappear without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a drunken evening with former girlfriend Anna Bethsen, Police Detective Harry Hole wakes up at home with a headache, no cell phone, and no memory of the past twelve hours. The same day, Anna is found shot dead in her bedroom, making Hole a prime suspect in the investigation led by his hated adversary, Tom Waaler. Meanwhile, the bank robberies continue with unparalleled savagery, sending rogue detective Hole from the streets of Oslo to steaming Brazil in a race to close two cases and clear his name. But Waaler isn't finished with his longtime nemesis quite yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code: little chalk stick figures they leave for one another as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing is ever the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out that his friends got the same message, they think it could be a prank . . . until one of them turns up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.</description>

  <description>The Redbreast is a compelling novel of war, love, and betrayal that stretches from the waning days of the Russian Front to present-day Oslo, a city perched on top of a powder keg: a restive Muslim immigrant population and a resurgent neo-Nazi movement. The wonder of this epic is that it's written within the confines of a classic crime novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Harry Hole, a police detective best described as a brilliant burnout, accidentally shoots one of the president's secret service agents during a rehearsal for an upcoming summit meeting, he believes it's the end of his career. However, the politics of the moment demand a hero, not a fall guy, and Harry is promoted to inspector instead. He begins to piece together disparate threads: threats of violence on Norway's upcoming Independence Day, the illegal importation of a Marklin rifle (a favored weapon of assassins), and a murder committed outside a pizza parlor frequented by neo-Nazis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much more than a mystery, The Redbreast delves deeply into Norway's involvement in World War II, exposing the face-saving myth of the resistance movement and the deep-seated anger of the Russian war veterans who served as scapegoats for the national shame. A nail-bitingly suspenseful read, Nesbø's American debut is not to be missed.</description>

  <description>Black dogs. Demons. Hellhounds. Damned souls that haunt crossroads, taking the forms of hulking dogs with glowing red eyes. Legends of the Old World, but just stories meant to scare lonely wanderers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mostly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Knoxville, Tennessee boasts black dogs of its own: the mother chapter of the Lean Dogs Motorcycle Club. And like all legends, the Lean Dogs draw challengers from every corner of the underworld. War’s brewing in Tennessee, and the Dogs’ first family is about to face its biggest challenge yet: the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ghost Teague has spent the last twenty-five years transforming a once-rough club into an empire with his queen by his side, the fearless girl who turned his life around when he needed her most. This new threat is a personal one, aimed at him, at Maggie, and it’s calling into question all the decisions they’ve made thus far. With a rival club in town, and an old nemesis preying on their doubts, they’ll have to save the city, the club, and their family. And there’s only one way to do it: together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With past and present storylines, the sixth installment of the Dartmoor Series explores the king and queen like never before, an epic tale of rising, and ruling, and leaning on one another. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The Lean Dogs MC has long been a haven for the outlaws, the rebels, the ill-adjusted, and the outright monsters of Knoxville, Tennessee. They are a dark, dangerous brand of misfit, etched with ink, splattered with blood, and vilified by the town they call home. The only laws they follow are the ones set down in the club charter by their leather-clad forefathers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But some outlaws have secrets they can’t even share with their club brothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lean Dogs call him “Tango,” but once upon a time Kevin Estes went by “Loverboy.” It’s a past his club could never understand, one that’s going to kill him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loverboy is the fifth full-length installment in the Dartmoor Series and is NOT a standalone. It handles sensitive, potentially-triggering subjects, and is intended for MATURE audiences only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Copyright © 2016 by Lauren Gilley</description>

  <description>It's a profile, like all the others on the online dating site. But as NYPD Detective Kat Donovan focuses on the accompanying picture, she feels her whole world explode, as emotions she’s ignored for decades come crashing down on her. Staring back at her is her ex-fiancé Jeff, the man who shattered her heart—and who she hasn’t seen in 18 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kat feels a spark, wondering if this might be the moment when past tragedies recede and a new world opens up to her. But when she reaches out to the man in the profile, her reawakened hope quickly darkens into suspicion and then terror as an unspeakable conspiracy comes to light, in which monsters prey upon the most vulnerable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count mounts and Kat's hope for a second chance with Jeff grows more and more elusive, she is consumed by an investigation that challenges her feelings about everyone she ever loved—her former fiancé, her mother, and even her father, whose cruel murder so long ago has never been fully explained. With lives on the line, including her own, Kat must venture deeper into the darkness than she ever has before, and discover if she has the strength to survive what she finds there.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of&lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39786095-tell-no-one" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B002SXIF4A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Dr. David Beck, the loss was shattering. And every day for the past eight years, he has relived the horror of what happened. The gleaming lake. The pale moonlight. The piercing screams. The night his wife was taken. The last night he saw her alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone tells him it's time to move on, to forget the past once and for all. But for David Beck, there can be no closure. A message has appeared on his computer, a phrase only he and his dead wife know. Suddenly Beck is taunted with the impossible -- that somewhere, somehow, Elizabeth is alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beck has been warned to tell no one. And he doesn't. Instead, he runs from the people he trusts the most, plunging headlong into a search for the shadowy figure whose messages hold out a desperate hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But already Beck is being hunted down. He's headed straight into the heart of a dark and deadly secret -- and someone intends to stop him before he gets there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Gods of Howl Mountain,&lt;/i&gt; award-winning author Taylor Brown explores a world of folk healers, whiskey-runners, and dark family secrets in the high country of 1950s North Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bootlegger Rory Docherty has returned home to the fabled mountain of his childhood - a misty wilderness that holds its secrets close and keeps the outside world at gunpoint. Slowed by a wooden leg and haunted by memories of the Korean War, Rory runs bootleg whiskey for a powerful mountain clan in a retro-fitted '40 Ford coupe. Between deliveries to roadhouses, brothels, and private clients, he lives with his formidable grandmother, evades federal agents, and stokes the wrath of a rival runner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mill town at the foot of the mountains - a hotbed of violence, moonshine, and the burgeoning sport of stock-car racing - Rory is bewitched by the mysterious daughter of a snake-handling preacher. His grandmother, Maybelline “Granny May” Docherty, opposes this match for her own reasons, believing that "some things are best left buried." A folk healer whose powers are rumored to rival those of a wood witch, she concocts potions and cures for the people of the mountains while harboring an explosive secret about Rory’s mother - the truth behind her long confinement in a mental hospital, during which time she has not spoken one word. When Rory's life is threatened, Granny must decide whether to reveal what she knows...or protect her only grandson from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With gritty and atmospheric prose, Taylor Brown brings to life a perilous mountain and the family who rules it.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Madison Culver disappeared when her family was choosing a Christmas tree in Oregon’s Skookum National Forest. She would be eight years old now—if she has survived. Desperate to find their beloved daughter, certain someone took her, the Culvers turn to Naomi, a private investigator with an uncanny talent for locating the lost and missing. Known to the police and a select group of parents as &lt;i&gt;The Child Finder,&lt;/i&gt; Naomi is their last hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naomi’s methodical search takes her deep into the icy, mysterious forest in the Pacific Northwest, and into her own fragmented past. She understands children like Madison because once upon a time, she was a lost girl too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Naomi relentlessly pursues and slowly uncovers the truth behind Madison’s disappearance, shards of a dark dream pierce the defenses that have protected her, reminding her of a terrible loss she feels but cannot remember. If she finds Madison, will Naomi ultimately unlock the secrets of her own life?</description>

  <description>In an enthralling new historical novel from national bestselling author Kate Quinn, two women—a female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional American socialite searching for her cousin in 1947—are brought together in a mesmerizing story of courage and redemption. &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1947.&lt;/em&gt; In the chaotic aftermath of World War II, American college girl Charlie St. Clair is pregnant, unmarried, and on the verge of being thrown out of her very proper family. She's also nursing a desperate hope that her beloved cousin Rose, who disappeared in Nazi-occupied France during the war, might still be alive. So when Charlie's parents banish her to Europe to have her "little problem" taken care of, Charlie breaks free and heads to London, determined to find out what happened to the cousin she loves like a sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1915&lt;/em&gt;. A year into the Great War, Eve Gardiner burns to join the fight against the Germans and unexpectedly gets her chance when she's recruited to work as a spy. Sent into enemy-occupied France, she's trained by the mesmerizing Lili, the "Queen of Spies", who manages a vast network of secret agents right under the enemy's nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty years later, haunted by the betrayal that ultimately tore apart the Alice Network, Eve spends her days drunk and secluded in her crumbling London house. Until a young American barges in uttering a name Eve hasn't heard in decades, and launches them both on a mission to find the truth...no matter where it leads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The "dark, twisted, thought-provoking" (#1 New York Times bestseller Tami Hoag) international bestseller—first in the new series featuring Detective Helen Grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people are abducted, imprisoned, and left with a gun. As hunger and thirst set in, only one walks away alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a game more twisted than any Detective Helen Grace has ever seen. If she hadn’t spoken with the shattered survivors herself, she almost wouldn’t believe them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen is familiar with the dark sides of human nature, including her own, but this case—with its seemingly random victims—has her baffled. But as more people go missing, nothing will be more terrifying than when it all starts making sense....</description>

  <description>Life on his ranch could be their future. If they can overcome their past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felicity’s life story reads like the script to a bad soap opera. Girl’s high-school boyfriend becomes a drug addict. Girl falls for boyfriend’s best friend. Girl leaves them both behind only to return home years later for murdered ex-boyfriend’s funeral. Now she’s back home in Montana, ready to start fresh. She’s got a long list of amends to make and relationships to rebuild, including one with the man who has owned her heart for sixteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silas doesn’t need much. He’s got a great horse, close friends and the Lucky Heart ranch, but something has always been missing. He’s not an idiot. He knows the missing piece is Felicity. And now that she’s returned to Prescott, he’s got a second chance to win her heart. This time, the only thing standing in his way is history. Drudging up the past is going to be about as painful as playing tug of war with barbed wire. But if they can heal old wounds, he’ll get the girl he should have had all along.</description>

  <description>She took a dare and fell in love. Truth would have been the smarter choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of living under her father’s thumb, Emmeline is ready to break free. She’s abandoned her life as a New York socialite to follow her dream of becoming a kindergarten teacher in a small, wholesome town. Seeing the man that nearly broke her was absolutely not what she had hoped to find in Prescott, Montana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick hasn’t seen his Emmy in nine years, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten a thing about the woman he loves. After just one blissful night as man and wife, he gave her up, sacrificing his own happiness to keep her safe—far away from him. But the moment she walks back into his lonely life is the moment he decides never to let her go again. He won’t waste his second chance. All he has to do is win back Emmeline’s heart, keep her safe from the shadows in his past and prove to her that taking a wager on him is a sure bet.</description>

  <description>One old farmhouse brought them together. It could also tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi has just uprooted her whole world to start a new life. The unexpected gift of a farmhouse in small-town Montana is just what she and her daughter need to escape big-city loneliness. The last thing she needs is attitude from the town’s sheriff, the most perfectly attractive and ruggedly handsome man she’s ever laid eyes on—and a complete jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess knows all about women like Gigi. Beautiful. Sexy. Scheming. She’s stolen his sanctuary, the farmhouse that should have been his. But along with a face full of freckles, she’s got a sharp wit and a backbone of steel—something he doesn’t discover until after making a complete fool of himself. If he can earn back her trust and win her heart, he might just find the home he’s always needed.</description>

  <description>#1 International Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;THE FORGOTTEN GIRLS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body of an unidentified woman has been discovered in a remote forest. A large, unique scar on one side of her face should make the identification easy, but nobody has reported her missing. Louise Rick, the new commander of the Missing Persons Department, waits four long days before pulling off a risky move: releasing a photo of the victim to the media, jeopardizing the integrity of the investigation in hopes of finding anyone who knew her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The gamble pays off when a woman recognizes the victim as Lisemette, a child she cared for in the state mental institution many years ago. Lisemette was a "forgotten girl", abandoned by her family and left behind in the institution. But Louise soon discovers something even more disturbing: Lisemette had a twin, and both girls were issued death certificates more than thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Louise's investigation takes a surprising when it brings her closer to her childhood home. And as she uncovers more crimes that were committed--and hidden--in the forest, she is forced to confront a terrible link to her own past that has been carefully concealed. Set against a moody and atmospheric landscape, THE FORGOTTEN GIRLS is twisty, suspenseful, emotionally intense novel that secures Sara Blaedel's place in the pantheon of great thriller writers.</description>

  <description>Internationally acclaimed crime writer Jo Nesbø's antihero police investigator, Harry Hole, is back: in a bone-chilling thriller that will take Hole to the brink of insanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oslo in November. The first snow of the season has fallen. A boy named Jonas wakes in the night to find his mother gone. Out his window, in the cold moonlight, he sees the snowman that inexplicably appeared in the yard earlier in the day. Around its neck is his mother's pink scarf. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hole suspects a link between a menacing letter he's received and the disappearance of Jonas's mother - and of perhaps a dozen other women, all of whom went missing on the day of a first snowfall. As his investigation deepens, something else emerges: he is becoming a pawn in an increasingly terrifying game whose rules are devised - and constantly revised - by the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely suspenseful, its characters brilliantly realized, its atmosphere permeated with evil, &lt;i&gt;The Snowman&lt;/i&gt; is the electrifying work of one of the best crime writers of our time.</description>

  <description>Harlan Coben, the master of domestic suspense, returns with a standalone thriller in the vein of #1 bestsellers Hold Tight, Caught and Stay Close that explores the depth and passion of a lost love . . . and the secrets and lies at its heart. Six years have passed since Jake Fisher watched Natalie, the love of his life, marry another man. Six years of hiding a broken heart by throwing himself into his career as a college professor. Six years of keeping his promise to leave Natalie alone, and six years of tortured dreams of her life with her new husband, Todd. But six years haven’t come close to extinguishing his feelings, and when Jake comes across Todd’s obituary, he can’t keep himself away from the funeral. There he gets the glimpse of Todd’s wife he’s hoping for . . . but she is not Natalie. Whoever the mourning widow is, she’s been married to Todd for more than a decade, and with that fact everything Jake thought he knew about the best time of his life—a time he has never gotten over—is turned completely inside out. As Jake searches for the truth, his picture-perfect memories of Natalie begin to unravel. Mutual friends of the couple either can’t be found or don’t remember Jake. No one has seen Natalie in years. Jake’s search for the woman who broke his heart—and who lied to him—soon puts his very life at risk as it dawns on him that the man he has become may be based on carefully constructed fiction. Harlan Coben once again delivers a shocking page-turner that deftly explores the power of past love and the secrets and lies that such love can hide.</description>

  <description>Nurse and avid backpacker Aimee Donovan is offered the opportunity of a lifetime. She encounters a patient who tells her he can send her two hundred years into the past to spend three months in the rugged Yellowstone wilderness at the dawn of the mountain man era. The only requirement: she cannot tell anyone that she’s from the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did a white woman suddenly appear in the remote Rocky Mountain wilderness? Trapper Daniel Osborne’s first instinct is to protect this mysterious and unconventional woman from the harsh realities of his mountains. While he fights his growing attraction to her, he is left frustrated by her lies and secrecy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel shows Aimee a side of Yellowstone she’s never experienced. She is torn between her feelings for him, and exposing a secret that will destroy everything he holds as truth. As her three months come to an end, she is faced with a dilemma: return to her own time, or stay with the man who opened her eyes to a whole new world. When the decision is made for her, both their lives will be changed forever.</description>

  <description>Tracy Crosswhite has spent twenty years questioning the facts surrounding her sister Sarah’s disappearance and the murder trial that followed. She doesn’t believe that Edmund House — a convicted rapist and the man condemned for Sarah’s murder — is the guilty party. Motivated by the opportunity to obtain real justice, Tracy became a homicide detective with the Seattle PD and dedicated her life to tracking down killers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sarah’s remains are finally discovered near their hometown in the northern Cascade mountains of Washington State, Tracy is determined to get the answers she’s been seeking. As she searches for the real killer, she unearths dark, long-kept secrets that will forever change her relationship to her past — and open the door to deadly danger.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Hanover House….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychiatrist Evelyn Talbot has dedicated her life to solving the mysteries of the antisocial mind. Why do psychopaths act as they do? How do they come to be? Why don’t they feel any remorse for the suffering they cause? And are there better ways of spotting and stopping them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having been kidnapped, tortured and left for dead when she was just a teenager—by her high school boyfriend—she’s determined to understand how someone she trusted so much could turn on her. So she’s established a revolutionary new medical health center in the remote town of Hilltop, Alaska, where she studies the worst of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not everyone in Hilltop is excited to have Hanover House and its many serial killers in the area. Alaskan State Trooper, Sergeant Amarok, is one of them. And yet he can’t help feeling bad about what Evelyn has been through. He’s even attracted to her. Which is partly why he worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows what could happen if only one little thing goes wrong...</description>

  <description>In a small town in Idaho’s idyllic wine country where the past looms large, can two people realize their individual dreams for the future … together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned once too often, Brooklyn Myers never intended to return to Thunder Creek, Idaho. Her hometown holds too many memories of heartache and rejection. But when her estranged husband Chad Hallston dies and leaves his family home and acreage to her and their ten-year-old daughter Alycia, it's an opportunity to change their lives for the better—a chance Brooklyn can't pass up, for Alycia's sake if not her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derek Johnson, Chad's best friend since boyhood, isn't keen on the return of Brooklyn Myers to Thunder Creek. He still blames her for leading his friend astray. And now she has ruined his chance to buy the neighboring ten acres which would have allowed him to expand his organic farm. To add insult to injury, Chad's dying request was that Derek become the father to Alycia that Chad never was. How can he keep that promise without also spending time with the girl’s mother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought together by unexpected circumstances, Derek and Brooklyn must both confront challenges to their dreams and expectations. He must overcome long held misconceptions about Brooklyn while she must learn to trust someone other than herself. And if they can do it, they just might discover that God has something better in mind than either of them ever imagined.</description>

  <description>From Iris Johansen, the "New York Times" bestselling author of The Search and Final Target, comes a taut, fast-paced, and terrifying psychological thriller that pushes the level of suspense to the absolute limit- and beyond. This time forensic sculptor Eve Duncan finds herself matched against a killer who will challenge her skill, test her courage, and threaten her family. &lt;br /&gt;As a forensic sculptor, Eve Duncan deals in death every day of her life. It' s her job. And while it might seem macabre to some, Eve knows from personal experience that her work, giving a face and a name to the victims of violent death, helps bring closure to their families. Now that job is about to put not only her own life on the line...but the lives of everyone close to her. &lt;br /&gt;It begins with a call from a high-ranking government official. He wants Eve to drop everything and come to Baton Rouge to identify the remains of an unknown murder victim. At first, Eve wants nothing to do with the project. She has finally found peace from her own tragic past, living a quiet life in a small lakeside cottage with Atlanta detective Joe Quinn and her adopted daughter, Jane. But a stunning series of seemingly unrelated events is about to upset all that. &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Eve' s hard-won new world is turned upside down, and she flees to Baton Rouge to take on the project of identifying the skeleton. Forced to work in secrecy, given only the sketchiest of information, Eve can' t help but wonder if the high-level security that surrounds her is meant to protect her- or imprison her. &lt;br /&gt;She hasn' t even begun work on the reconstruction when the first death occurs. Someone totally ruthless, someone who can strike anywhere at any time, and with seeming immunity, is determined to put a halt to her work. Soon the questions- and the threats to her own life- begin to mount as Eve realizes she has stumbled into the heart of a chilling conspiracy. &lt;br /&gt;There is only one person who can give her the answers she needs. And that is the dead man himself. To survive, Eve must put her life on the line to uncover the deadly secret of his identity and learn the devastating truth buried beneath a body of lies.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For two single parents with bruised hearts, it’ll take more than a little courage to get back on the horse when it comes to love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly Welch lost her husband to a heart attack in the blink of an eye. But she’s losing her daughter slowly, in the day-to-day tension. In three difficult years, Kimberly has gone from Seattle socialite to Kings Meadow charity case, and her daughter is not responding well to the changes. She’s becoming a sullen, cantankerous teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chet Leonard lost his teenage son in a car accident. Then his wife abandoned him and their two remaining boys. He tries to keep his mind on the family ranch, but if the last two years have taught him anything, it’s that sometimes you just have to let the memories hurt. Let the memories hurt, and leave well enough alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Chet volunteers to help tame Kimberly’s daughter’s horse, everyone gets more than they bargained for . . . especially when eighty-four-year-old Anna McKenna shows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nana Anna has reappeared in Kings Meadow after decades away, bringing with her the magnetism and transformative joy that come from a life well lived . . . just the kind of magic that a couple of unlucky-in-love single parents need to conjure up a little courage and raise a new family from the ashes of tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Hatcher crafts a lovely installment of the Kings Meadow Romance and readers will want more of the Idaho ranchers. It takes us into the healing power of horses and God's ability to create community where it is most needed." —&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;, 4-1/2 star review</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An eccentric wallflower…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most debutantes dream of finding a husband. Lady Pandora Ravenel has different plans. The ambitious young beauty would much rather stay at home and plot out her new board game business than take part in the London Season. But one night at a glittering society ball, she’s ensnared in a scandal with a wickedly handsome stranger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A cynical rake…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of evading marital traps with ease, Gabriel, Lord St. Vincent, has finally been caught-by a rebellious girl who couldn’t be less suitable. In fact, she wants nothing to do with him. But Gabriel finds the high-spirited Pandora irresistible. He’ll do whatever it takes to possess her, even if their marriage of convenience turns out to be the devil’s own bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A perilous plot…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After succumbing to Gabriel’s skilled and sensuous persuasion, Pandora agrees to become his bride. But soon she discovers that her entrepreneurial endeavors have accidentally involved her in a dangerous conspiracy—and only her husband can keep her safe. As Gabriel protects her from their unknown adversaries, they realize their devil’s bargain may just turn out to be a match made in heaven...</description>

Now, over twenty years later, her father has passed away and she's in New Bern, North Carolina cleaning out his house when she finds evidence to the contrary. Lisa is alive. Alive and living under a new identity. But why exactly was she on the run all those years ago, and what secrets are being kept now? As Riley works to uncover the truth, her discoveries will put into question everything she thought she knew about her family. Riley must decide what the past means for her present, and what she will do with her newfound reality, in this engrossing New York Times bestselling mystery from Diane Chamberlain.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Years ago Flora fled the quiet Scottish island where she grew up-- and she hasn't looked back. What would she have done on Mure? It's a place where everyone has known her all her life, where no one will let her forget the past. In bright, bustling London, she can be anonymous, ambitious... and hopelessly in love with her boss. But when fate brings Flora back to the island, she's suddenly swept once more into life with her brothers-- all strapping, loud, and seemingly incapable of basic housework --and her father. Yet even amid the chaos of their reunion, Flora discovers a passion for cooking-- and finds herself restoring a dusty little pink-fronted shop on the harbour: a cafe by the sea.</description>

  <description>Hard-living detective-turned-P.I., Dodge Hanley tries not to dwell on the past. But when he gets a call from Caroline King, “the one” who got away, there’s no time for looking back; their daughter is in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline has told Berry that Dodge is an old friend they can rely on to prove she didn’t shoot her ex-lover, even though she’s already told the cops she saw the real culprit. It was Oren Starks, Berry insists, a former co-worker fired for stalking her. Dodge believes his daughter…and he’s pretty sure Deputy Ski Nyland does, too, considering how hard he’s working to find Starks. Berry’s told them he’s depraved, and from what they learn, she’s got him pegged. But nut jobs play by their own crazy rules. The only thing clear to Dodge is that Starks is obsessed with having Berry…or killing her, and neither is acceptable to a man who’s determined to right some old wrongs, even if he has to risk his life—not to mention his heart—to do it.</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1974.&lt;br /&gt;Unpredictable. Unforgiving. Untamed.&lt;br /&gt;For a family in crisis, the ultimate test of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernt Allbright, a former POW, comes home from the Vietnam war a changed and volatile man. When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and danger. The &lt;i&gt;Great Alone&lt;/i&gt; is a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival, and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Anthony Bear and Christy Chapman are from two completely different worlds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony's the leader of a motorcycle gang that terrorizes Florida’s West Coast. As a child, he ran away from his family and the Cherokee Indian Reservation to enter a life of crime. As an adult, he leads a multifaceted life managing his two businesses—his legitimate landscaping venture, and his loan shark and underworld dealings. Driven by anger and betrayal, Anthony begins the hunt for Christy’s father, Van Chapman, after he runs out on a loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christy’s privileged life is not as it seems. She has kept painful family secrets and hidden some of her own. She’s determined to find out the truth and expose Van, but her search delivers her right into Anthony Bear’s hands, adding kidnapping to his list of crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their worlds are as contrasting as the color of their skin. The only thing they seem to have in common is their mutual disdain for Van Chapman…and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They couldn’t be more wrong.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iron Tiara is a spin-off novel from The Minutes Trilogy. It can be read as a standalone, and does not contain a cliffhanger.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Easy Targets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Chief Deputy Ken Brody’s sweetheart goes missing in the mountains outside Timber Creek, Mattie Cobb and her K-9 partner, Robo, are called to search. But it’s mid-October and a dark snowstorm is brewing over the high country. And they’re already too late. By the time they find her body, the storm has broken and the snow is coming down hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Brody hikes down to bring back the forensics team, and veterinarian Cole Walker gathers supplies to protect them from the storm, Mattie and Robo find themselves alone, guarding the gravesite overnight in the early winter. And it’s only the first in a series of long, dark nights. As their investigation develops, Mattie, Robo, Brody and Cole find themselves in the middle of the killer’s stalking ground—where the hunters have just become the hunted.</description>

But more terror lies ahead when she accepts work from billionaire John Logan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beneath her gifted hands a face emerges from the skull he has given her to reconstruct—a face no one was ever meant to see. Now Eve is trapped in a frightening web of murder and deceit. Powerful enemies are determined to cover up the truth, and they will make certain that truth goes to the grave...even if Eve gets buried with it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book #3 of the bestselling Consequences series:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Aleatha Romig comes the shocking third book of the Consequences series and the long-awaited, action-packed conclusion of Claire and Tony’s tumultuous relationship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stick to your convictions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Claire and Tony have found their way back to one another, but it doesn’t mean a happy ever after. Not even close. Just when they seemed to have it all—love, respect, and the promise of a family—the game master exposes the truth and Claire’s world once again unravels. With old convictions wavering and past transgressions coming to light, the cards have changed and luck is not in the deck for Claire and Tony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abandon all assumptions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost in a constant nightmare, who will save Claire from her past? From herself? Everyone has a hand to play, and now they’re playing for keeps. Everything known to be true is questioned. Motives are explained. The past is once again unearthed, and this time, secrets lurk between dreams and reality, between the past and the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The clock is ticking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time is running out on Claire…on Tony…on their happy ever after. When the final cards are played, will their unconventional love trump the opposition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, some will discover their bets were too high, and all will learn the most crucial lesson—there are always consequences for the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You must stick to your conviction, but be ready to abandon your assumptions.&lt;/i&gt; –Denis Waitley</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;USA Today&lt;/b&gt; bestselling author &lt;b&gt;Aleatha Romig&lt;/b&gt; comes the thrilling sequel in the &lt;b&gt;Consequences&lt;/b&gt; series: &lt;b&gt;Truth&lt;/b&gt;, a game of deception, intrigue, and conspiracy where losing can be deadly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Claire survived the consequences. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through strength and compartmentalization, Claire Nichols captivated her captor. Though Anthony Rawlings thought he taught Claire to behave, his domination became desire, and his obsession morphed into love. Or was it? When her choices pushed Anthony's relentless vendetta too far, Claire barely survived the consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover the truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, armed with new information and more questions than answers, Claire works to uncover the truth behind the dangerous game at play. As she begins anew, she must decide whom she can truly trust, especially with a new set of players on the move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;New set of rules.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything to lose and a manipulative game master controlling the board, Claire and Tony duel by a new set of rules. When thrust together once again, can they learn to trust each other to overcome new dangers? Or will this be Tony's second attempt at domination? Can Claire resist the man she'd never before been able to resist? Hatred and love. Deception and truth. Old habits and new beginnings. As this real-life game of chess plays out, past sins will come to light and new secrets will be revealed. With so much riding on each move, the stakes have never been higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered. The trick is to discover them. &lt;b&gt;- Galileo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Deputy Mattie Cobb is in a dark place and has withdrawn from Cole Walker and his family to work on issues from her past. When she and her K-9 partner, Robo, get called to track a missing junior high student, they find the girl dead on Smoker's Hill behind the high school and Mattie must head to the Walker home to break the bad news. But that's only the start of trouble in Timber Creek, because soon another girl goes missing--and this time it's one of Cole's daughters.Knowing that each hour a child remains missing lessens the probability of finding her alive, Mattie and Robo lead the hunt while Cole and community volunteers join in to search everywhere, but to no avail. It seems that someone has snatched all trace of the Walker girl from their midst, including her scent. Grasping at straws, Mattie and Robo follow a phoned-in tip into the dense forest, where they hope to find a trace of the girl's scent and to rescue her alive. But when Robo does catch her scent, it leads them to information that challenges everything they thought they knew about the case.Mattie and Robo must rush to hunt down the kidnapper before they're too late in Hunting Hour, the third installment in critically acclaimed author Margaret Mizushima's exhilarating mystery series.</description>

  <description>The highly anticipated sequel to #1 New York Times bestselling author Robyn Carr's What We Find transports readers back to Sullivan's Crossing. The rustic campground at the crossroads of the Colorado and Continental Divide trails welcomes everyone—whether you're looking for a relaxing weekend getaway or a whole new lease on life. It's a wonderful place where good people face their challenges with humor, strength and love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Sierra Jones, Sullivan's Crossing is meant to be a brief stopover. She's put her troubled past behind her but the path forward isn't yet clear. A visit with her big brother Cal and his new bride, Maggie, seems to be the best option to help her get back on her feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to burden or depend on anyone, Sierra is surprised to find the Crossing offers so much more than a place to rest her head. Cal and Maggie welcome her into their busy lives and she quickly finds herself bonding with Sully, the quirky campground owner who is the father figure she's always wanted. But when her past catches up with her, it's a special man and an adorable puppy who give her the strength to face the truth and fight for a brighter future. In Sullivan's Crossing Sierra learns to cherish the family you are given and the family you choose.</description>

  <description>After years spent living on the run, Samuel Hawley moves with his teenage daughter, Loo, to Olympus, Massachusetts. There, in his late wife’s hometown, Hawley finds work as a fisherman, while Loo struggles to fit in at school and grows curious about her mother’s mysterious death. Haunting them both are twelve scars Hawley carries on his body, from twelve bullets in his criminal past—a past that eventually spills over into his daughter’s present, until together they must face a reckoning yet to come. This father-daughter epic weaves back and forth through time and across America, from Alaska to the Adirondacks. Both a coming-of-age novel and a literary thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley&lt;/i&gt; explores what it means to be a hero, and the cost we pay to protect the people we love most.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cass is having a hard time since the night she saw the car in the woods, on the winding rural road, in the middle of a downpour, with the woman sitting inside—the woman who was killed. She’s been trying to put the crime out of her mind; what could she have done, really? It’s a dangerous road to be on in the middle of a storm. Her husband would be furious if he knew she’d broken her promise not to take that shortcut home. And she probably would only have been hurt herself if she’d stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since then, she’s been forgetting every little thing: where she left the car, if she took her pills, the alarm code, why she ordered a pram when she doesn’t have a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing she can’t forget is that woman, the woman she might have saved, and the terrible nagging guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or the silent calls she’s receiving, or the feeling that someone’s watching her…</description>

  <description>Following the twists and turns of an unimaginable crime, &lt;i&gt;The Widow &lt;/i&gt;is an electrifying debut thriller that will take you into the dark spaces that exist between a husband and a wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a lot Jean hasn't said over the years about the crime her husband was suspected of committing. She was too busy being the perfect wife, standing by her man while living with the accusing glares and the anonymous harassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now her husband is dead, and there's no reason to stay quiet. There are people who want to hear her story. They want to know what it was like living with that man. She can tell them that there were secrets. There always are in a marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth--that's all anyone wants. But the one lesson Jean has learned in the last few years is that she can make people believe anything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An NPR Best Book of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;'s 5 "Killer Books" of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; Best Book of the Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes a Readers Guide and an excerpt of Fiona Barton's &lt;i&gt;The Child&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Marriage can be a real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.&lt;br /&gt;Source: gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Unger "brings her trademark of intense suspense, believable characters and sharp plotting" (&lt;i&gt;Sun-Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;) to this heart-stopping new psychological thriller, and proves once again why she is regarded as "one of today's best thriller writers, period." (&lt;i&gt;Literary Hub&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the difference between justice and revenge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia Bishop's perfect life fell apart when the aftermath of a brutal assault left her with a crumbling marriage, a newborn daughter, and a constant sense of anxiety about the world around her. Now, looking for a fresh start with a home restoration project and growing blog, Claudia takes on a crumbling old house--one that unbeknownst to her has an ugly history and may hide long buried secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Zoey Drake the defining moment of her childhood was the horrific murder of her parents. Years later, she has embraced the rage that fuels her. Training in the martial arts has made her strong and ready to face the demons from the past--and within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangers to each other, and walking very different paths in the wake of trauma, these two women are on a collision course--because Zoey's past nightmare and Claudia's dreams for her future take place in the same house. As Zoey seeks justice, and Claudia seeks peace, both will confront the terrifying monsters at the door.</description>

  <description>Aurora "Roe" Teagarden had always worked for a living, until an unexpected legacy gave her the money to quit her librarian job. Now, with time on her hands, she decides to try selling real estate. Her mother, after all, is Lawrenceton's premier real estate agent, giving Roe a head start on this new career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at her first house showing, Roe discovers the naked corpse of a rival broker in the master bedroom. To make matters worse, one of her mother's colleagues has fallen under suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roe, a natural-born sleuth, is determined to find out who is responsible. And when a second body is found in another house for sale, it becomes obvious that there is a very cool killer at large in Lawrenceton, one who knows a great deal about real estate - and maybe too much about Roe...</description>

  <description>In a career spanning more than thirty years, Patrick Swayze has made a name for himself on the stage, the screen, and television. Known for his versatility, passion and fearlessness, he's become one of our most beloved actors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in February 2008, Patrick announced he had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Always a fighter, he refused to let the disease bring him to his knees, and his bravery has inspired both his legion of fans and cancer patients everywhere. Yet this memoir, written with wisdom and heart, recounts much more than his bout with cancer. In vivid detail, Patrick describes his Texas upbringing, his personal struggles, his rise to fame with North and South, his commercial breakthroughs in Dirty Dancing and Ghost, and the soul mate who's stood by his side through it all: his wife, writer and director Lisa Niemi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A behind-the-scenes look at a Hollywood life and a remarkable love, this memoir is both entertainment and inspiration. Patrick and Lisa's marriage is a journey of two lives intertwined and lived as one--throughout their years in Hollywood and at home on their working ranch outside Los Angeles, and culminating in the hope and wisdom they've imparted to all who know them. This book will open the door for families, individuals, and husbands and wives to grow, bond and discover entirely new levels of love and sharing, proving that life shouldn't be lived as a series of endings, but rather as the beginning of greater strength and love.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;"That's when I saw him—the cowboy—across the smoky room."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'll never forget that night. It was like a romance novel, an old Broadway musical, and a John Wayne western rolled into one. Out for a quick drink with friends, I wasn't looking to meet anyone, let alone a tall, rugged cowboy who lived on a cattle ranch miles away from my cultured, corporate hometown. But before I knew it, I'd been struck with a lightning bolt . . . and I was completely powerless to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read along as I recount the rip-roaring details of my unlikely romance with a chaps-wearing cowboy, from the early days of our courtship (complete with cows, horses, prairie fire, and passion) all the way through the first year of our marriage, which would be filled with more challenge and strife—and manure—than I ever could have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't just my love story; it's a universal tale of passion, romance, and all-encompassing love that sweeps us off our feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the story of a cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Wranglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And chaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the girl who fell in love with them.</description>

  <description>Since he was a small boy, Mosab Hassan Yousef has had an inside view of the deadly terrorist group Hamas. The oldest son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef, a founding member of Hamas and its most popular leader, young Mosab assisted his father for years in his political activities while being groomed to assume his legacy, politics, status . . . and power. But everything changed when Mosab turned away from terror and violence, and embraced instead the teachings of another famous Middle East leader. In &lt;i&gt;Son of Hamas&lt;/i&gt;, Mosab Yousef—now called “Joseph”—reveals new information about the world’s most dangerous terrorist organization and unveils the truth about his own role, his agonizing separation from family and homeland, the dangerous decision to make his newfound faith public, and his belief that the Christian mandate to “love your enemies” is the only way to peace in the Middle East.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of&lt;br /&gt; Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41596321-unseen" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B00AXIZ3HE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karin Slaughter’s novels featuring detective Will Trent are utterly riveting and masterfully drawn. Her latest thriller, Unseen, pits detectives, lovers, and enemies against one another in an unforgettable standoff between righteous courage and deepest evil.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Trent is a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent whose latest case has him posing as Bill Black, a scary ex-con who rides a motorcycle around Macon, Georgia, and trails an air of violence wherever he goes. The cover has worked and he has caught the eye of a wiry little drug dealer who thinks he might be a useful ally. But undercover and cut off from the support of the woman he loves, Sara Linton, Will finds his demons catching up with him.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although she has no idea where Will has gone, or why, Sara herself has come to Macon because of a cop shooting: Her stepson, Jared, has been gunned down in his own home. Sara holds Lena, Jared’s wife, responsible: Lena, a detective, has been a magnet for trouble all her life, and Jared’s shooting is not the first time someone Sara loved got caught in the crossfire. Furious, Sara finds herself involved in the same case that Will is working without even knowing it, and soon danger is swirling around both of them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a novel of fierce intensity, shifting allegiances, and shocking twists, two investigations collide with a conspiracy straddling both sides of the law. Karin Slaughter’s latest is both an electrifying thriller and a piercing study of human nature: what happens when good people face the unseen evils in their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Karin Slaughter comes a fast and furious tale in which no one is quite who they seem. This electrifying eBook novella featuring Will Trent is a prequel to Slaughter’s upcoming novel, &lt;i&gt;Unseen&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Detective Will Trent is standing in a Georgia convenience store, waiting on an obstinate Icee frozen drink machine. To the surveillance cameras and bored staff of the Lil’ Dixie Gas-n-Go, however, Will appears to be someone very different—the menacing ex-con Bill Black. Going undercover as Bill, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent is about to infiltrate the most corrupt town in the most corrupt county in the new American South. But first: his Icee.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Everything changes in one horrific instant, as all hell breaks loose at the Lil’ Dixie. A cop is shot. A bag of cash goes flying across the floor. A young woman disappears while a killer takes off in a battered pick-up truck. Within seconds, Will is in pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes an exclusive preview of Karin Slaughter’s thrilling new novel of suspense, &lt;i&gt;Unseen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A gripping, action-packed short story available only as an eBook—from a master of character, crime, and urgent suspense.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Trent, a dedicated agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for fifteen years, knows that there’s definitely such a thing as a cop’s intuition. Which is why he should have listened to his own.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While in an airport restroom at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, Will overhears a girl’s pleading, plaintive voice: “Please, I wanna go home.” Something isn’t right here, thinks Will. He feels it in his gut. But he waits too long to act, and now the girl and the anxious, angry man she’s with have disappeared into the crowds at the busiest passenger airport in the world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a desperate search and with time running out, Will makes a call to his supervisor, Amanda Wagner. Will’s partner, Faith Mitchell, immediately sends out an abducted child alert. The entire airport will soon be grinding to a halt: Eighty-nine million passengers a year. Five runways. Seven concourses. Six million square feet of space that sprawled across two counties, three cities, and five jurisdictions. All shut down on a dime because Will has a hunch that he is certain is true: a girl, maybe six or seven years old, has been snatched from God knows where. And he intends to bring her back—no matter what it takes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Includes an exclusive excerpt from Karin Slaughter’s thrilling new novel of suspense, Criminal.</description>

  <description>Karin Slaughter's new novel is an epic tale of love, loyalty, and murder that encompasses forty years, two chillingly similar murder cases, and a good man's deepest secrets. &lt;br /&gt; Will Trent is a brilliant agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Newly in love, he is beginning to put a difficult past behind him. Then a local college student goes missing, and Will is inexplicably kept off the case by his supervisor and mentor, deputy director Amanda Wagner. Will cannot fathom Amanda's motivation until the two of them literally collide in an abandoned orphanage they have both been drawn to for different reasons. Decades before--when Will's father was imprisoned for murder--this was his home. . . . &lt;br /&gt; Flash back nearly forty years. In the summer Will Trent was born, Amanda Wagner is going to college, making Sunday dinners for her father, taking her first steps in the boys' club that is the Atlanta Police Department. One of her first cases is to investigate a brutal crime in one of the city's worst neighborhoods. Amanda and her partner, Evelyn, are the only ones who seem to care if an arrest is ever made. &lt;br /&gt; Now the case that launched Amanda's career has suddenly come back to life, intertwined with the long-held mystery of Will's birth and parentage. And these two dauntless investigators will each need to face down demons from the past if they are to prevent an even greater terror from being unleashed. &lt;br /&gt; A masterpiece of character, atmosphere, and riveting suspense, "Criminal" is the most powerful and moving novel yet from one of our most gifted storytellers at work today. &lt;br /&gt;Advance praise for "Criminal" &lt;br /&gt;"Karin Slaughter's best yet by far: All her signature strengths are amplified a hundredfold by the past explaining the present. Reading this book was like watching a great athlete having a career year."--Lee Child &lt;br /&gt;"Fascinating . . . Slaughter delivers another riveting, pulse-pounding crime novel."--"Booklist "(starred review)</description>

  <description>As a boy, Will Klein had a hero: his older brother, Ken. Then, on a warm suburban night in the Kleins’ affluent New Jersey neighborhood, a young woman—a girl Will had once loved—was found brutally murdered in her family’s basement. The prime suspect: Ken Klein. With the evidence against him overwhelming, Ken simply vanished. And when his shattered family never heard from Ken again, they were sure he was gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now eleven years have passed. Will has found proof that Ken is alive. And this is just the first in a series of stunning revelations as Will is forced to confront startling truths about his brother—and himself. As a violent mystery unwinds around him, Will knows that he must press his search all the way to the end. Because the most powerful surprises are yet to come.</description>

  <description>In 2060 New York, some murders still get more attention than others, especially those in which the victim is a prominent businessman, found in his Park Avenue apartment, tied to the bed—and strangled with cords of black velvet. Fortunately, homicide cop Lieutenant Eve Dallas's billionaire husband, Roarke, happens to own the prime real estate where Thomas Anders's sporting-goods firm is headquartered, giving her some help with access. Before long, she's knocking on doors—and barging through them—to look for the answers she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some things don't add up—and everyone's alibi checks out, from the wife who was off in the tropics to the nephew who stood to inherit millions. Was this a crime of passion—or a carefully planned execution? It's up to Dallas to solve this sensational case in which those who seem to be intimates sometimes guard secrets from each other—and strangers may be connected in unexpected, and deadly, ways. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two girls are forced into the woods at gunpoint. One runs for her life. One is left behind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years ago, Charlotte and Samantha Quinn's happy small-town family life was torn apart by a terrifying attack on their family home. It left their mother dead. It left their father—Pikeville's notorious defense attorney—devastated. And it left the family fractured beyond repair, consumed by secrets from that terrible night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-eight years later, Charlotte has followed in her father's footsteps to become a lawyer herself—the ideal good daughter. But when violence comes to Pikeville again, and a shocking tragedy leaves the whole town traumatized, Charlotte is plunged into a nightmare. Not only is she the first witness on the scene, but it's a case that unleashes the terrible memories she's spent so long trying to suppress--because the shocking truth about the crime that destroyed her family nearly thirty years ago won't stay buried forever. Packed with twists and turns, brimming with emotion and heart, &lt;i&gt;The Good Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is fiction at its most thrilling.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of &lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41596447-fallen" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B004J4WN12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There’s no police training stronger than a cop’s instinct. Faith Mitchell’s mother isn’t answering her phone. Her front door is open. There’s a bloodstain above the knob. Everything Faith learned in the academy goes out the window when she charges into her mother’s house, gun drawn. She sees a man dead in the laundry room, a hostage situation in the bedroom. What she doesn’t see is her mother. When the hostage situation turns deadly, Faith is left with too many questions. She’ll need the help of her partner, Will Trent, and trauma doctor Sara Linton to get some answers. But Faith isn’t just a cop anymore, she’s a witness—and a suspect. To find her mother, Faith will have to cross the thin blue line and bring the truth to light—or bury it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from Karin Slaughter's &lt;i&gt;Unseen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of &lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33396635-broken" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B0036S4A0Y&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Special Agent Will Trent arrives in Grant County, he finds a police department determined to protect its own and far too many unanswered questions about a prisoner’s death. He doesn’t understand why Officer Lena Adams is hiding secrets from him. He doesn’t understand her role in the death of Grant County’s popular police chief. He doesn’t understand why that man’s widow, Dr. Sara Linton, needs him now more than ever to help her crack this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the police force investigates the murder of a young woman pulled from a frigid lake, Trent investigates the police force, putting pressure on Adams just when she’s already about to crack. Caught between two complicated and determined women, trying to understand Linton’s passionate distrust of Adams, the facts surrounding Chief Tolliver’s death, and the complexities of this insular town, Trent will unleash a case filled with explosive secrets—and encounter a thin blue line that could be murderous if crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spellbinding and keenly paced, Broken is Karin Slaughter at her best. Here is an unforgettable story of raw emotions, dangerous assumptions, the deadly and layered game of betrayal, and a man’s determination to expose the most painful of human truths—no matter how deeply they’re hidden . . . or how devastating.</description>

  <description>Kerra Bailey is a television journalist on the rise, and she's hot on the trail of a story guaranteed to skyrocket her career to even greater heights: an interview with the legendary Major Trapper. Twenty-five years ago, The Major emerged a hero from the bombing of the Pegasus Hotel in downtown Dallas when he was photographed leading a handful of survivors out of the collapsing building. The iconic picture transformed him into a beloved national icon, in constant demand for speeches and interviews--until he suddenly dropped out of the public eye, shunning all members of the media. However, Kerra is willing to use any means necessary to get to The Major--even if she has to wrangle an introduction from his estranged son, former ATF agent John Trapper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still seething over his break with both the ATF and his father, John Trapper wants no association with the hotel bombing or his hero father, and spurns the meddling reporters determined to drag them back into the limelight. Yet Kerra's sheer audacity and tantalizing hints that there's more to the story rouse Trapper's interest despite himself. And when her interview of a lifetime goes catastrophically awry--with unknown assailants targeting not only The Major, but also Kerra--Trapper realizes he needs her under wraps if he's going to track down the gunmen before they strike again . . . as well as discover, finally, who was responsible for the Pegasus bombing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kerra is wary of a man so charming one moment and dangerous the next, and she knows Trapper is withholding evidence collected during his ATF investigation into the bombing. But having no one else to trust and enemies lurking closer than they know, Kerra and Trapper join forces and risk their very lives to expose a sinuous network of lies and conspiracy running deep through Texas--and uncover who would want a national hero dead.</description>

You won’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of Rules of Civility—a transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of &lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36311264-fractured" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B0011UJMMK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ansley Park is one of Atlanta’s most upscale neighborhoods—but in one gleaming mansion, in a teenager’s lavish bedroom, a girl has been savagely murdered. And in the hallway, her mother stands amid shattered glass, having killed her daughter’s attacker with her bare hands. Detective Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is one of the first on the scene. Trent soon sees something that the Atlanta cops are missing, something in the trail of blood, in a matrix of forensic evidence, and in the eyes of the stunned mother. When another teenage girl goes missing, Trent knows that this case, which started in the best of homes, is about to cut quick and deep through the ruins of perfect lives broken wide-open: where human demons emerge with a vengeance.</description>

And of all London's ladies, he wanted the tender obedience of only one--Caroline Richmond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was a ravishing beauty from Boston, with a mysterious past and a fiery spirit. Drawn to the powerful duke, undeterred by his presumptuous airs, Caroline was determined to win his lasting love. But Bradford would bend to no woman--until a deadly intrigue drew them enticingly close. Now, united against a common enemy, they would discover the power of the magnificent attraction that brought them together...a desire born in danger, but destined to flame into love!</description>

  <description>The greater the Evil, the more deadly the game…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a rapist is found mutilated in a brutal attack, Detective Kim Stone and her team are called in to bring a swift resolution. But, as more vengeful killings come to light, it soon becomes clear that there is someone far more sinister at work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the investigation quickly gathering momentum, Kim finds herself exposed to great danger and in the sights of a lethal individual undertaking their own twisted experiment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up against a sociopath who seems to know her every weakness, for Detective Stone, each move she makes could be deadly. As the body count starts to mount, Kim will have to dig deeper than ever before to stop the killing. And this time - it’s personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rising star of the British thriller scene returns with a novel that enthrall fans of Rachel Abbott, Val McDermid and Mark Billingham.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the darkest secrets can't stay buried forever ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five figures gather round a shallow grave. They had all taken turns to dig. An adult sized hole would have taken longer. An innocent life had been taken but the pact had been made.

Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt; fast realises she's on the hunt for a twisted individual whose killing spree spans decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises, Kim needs to stop the murderer before they strike again. But to catch the killer, can Kim confront the demons of her own past before it's too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Love. Lies. Murder. A lot can happen... COME SUNDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodine Longbow loves to rise with the dawn. As the manager of her family's resort in Western Montana, there just aren't enough hours in the day - for life, for work, for loved ones. She certainly doesn't have time for love, not even in the gorgeous shape of her childhood crush Callen Skinner, all grown up and returned to the ranch. Then again, maybe Callen can change her mind, given time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a young woman's body is discovered on resort land, everything changes. Callen falls under the suspicion of a deputy sheriff with a grudge. And for Bodine's family, the murder is a shocking reminder of an old loss. Twenty-five years ago, Bodine's Aunt Alice vanished, never to be heard of again. Could this new tragedy be connected to Alice's mysterious disappearance? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As events take a dramatic and deadly turn, Bodine and Callen must race to uncover the truth - before the sun sets on their future together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Three modern sisters bound by the timeless beauty of Ireland...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the harsh storms of winter descended upon western Ireland, the locals stayed indoors - and visitors stayed away. Brianna Concannon's bed-and-breakfast became a cold and empty place. But that was fine with Brianna. She enjoyed the peace and quiet, even when the icy winds howled at her window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, cool, capable and thoroughly domestic Brianna is expecting an unusual guest - mystery writer Grayson Thane, from America. A restless wanderer with a painful past, he plans to spend the cold winter alone. But sometimes fate has a plan of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a fire can be born in ice...</description>

  <description>Listening length: 10 hours, 34 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Harper has always lived at Harper House, the centuries-old mansion just outside of Memphis. And for as long as anyone alive remembers, the ghostly Harper Bride has walked the halls, singing lullabies at night...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayley Phillips came to Memphis hoping for a new start, for herself and her unborn child. She wasn't looking for a handout from her distant cousin Roz, just a job at her thriving In the Garden nursery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she found was a home surrounded by beauty and the best friends she's ever had — including Roz's son Harper. To Hayley's delight, her new daughter Lily has really taken to him. But to Hayley's chagrin, she has begun to dream about Harper — as much more than a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Hayley gives in to her desire, she's afraid the foundation she's built with Harper will come tumbling down. Especially since she's begun to suspect that her feelings are no longer completely her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flashes of the past and erratic behavior make Hayley believe that the Harper Bride has found a way inside of her mind and body. It's time to put the Bride to rest once and for all, so Hayley can know her own heart again — and whether she's willing to risk it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unabridged recording (10 hours, 43 minutes).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

And for as long as anyone alive remembers, the ghostly Harper Bride has walked the halls, singing lullabies at night...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At forty-seven, Rosalind Harper is a woman whose experiences have made her strong enough to bend without breaking--and weather any storm. A widow with three grown sons, she survived a disastrous second marriage and built her In The Garden nursery from the ground up. Through the years, In The Garden has become more than just a thriving business--it is a symbol of hope and independence to Roz, and to the two women she shares it with.

  <description>The first suspenseful thriller in the Midnight series from Wall Street Journal bestselling author Melinda Leigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point, click, die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two hikers disappear, their hometown in Maine blames the blinding storms. But the truth is far more sinister. Unaware of the danger, tabloid photographer Jayne Sullivan follows an anonymous tip to find the most reclusive sculptor in the art world. Instead, she finds sexy handyman Reed Kimball—and a small town full of fatal secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, Reed buried his homicide detective career along with his wife. But when a hiker is found dead, the local police chief asks Reed for help. Why was a Celtic coin found under the body? And where is the second hiker? Avoiding the media, Reed doesn’t need a murder, a missing person, or a nosey photographer. Then Jayne is attacked, and her courage is his undoing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed must risk everything to protect her - and find a cunning killer.</description>

  <description>What do you do when your murder victim is found in your ex-girlfriend’s riding arena? For homicide detective Ben Haley, the answer is automatic: take the case. He’s spent the past five years dodging her phone calls and keeping his kid at arm’s length, but when Jade finds a body on her farm, Ben rushes to the scene. Eleven-year-old Heidi Latham, dumped at Jade’s doorstep, is a painful reminder that his girls live in a dangerous world… and that their pull on him is absolute. Ben’s charged with finding Heidi’s killer, and keeping his relationship with Jade a secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jade Donovan has spent the past five years teaching lessons and training horses, leaning on the unswerving support of gay best friend, Jeremy, as she raises her daughter, Clara, alone. When she finds Heidi' body, Ben crashes back into her life, and she’s too rattled to steel herself against his dark, stern magnetism. She needs him, she realizes, to hold at bay the terrifying evil that lurks in the shadows, claiming the lives of little girls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the dark nights close in around them, they cling to the tatters of their relationship; Ben risks his job, and Jade risks her heart in the search for justice, keeping the daughter they both love safe.</description>

  <description>With over one million novels in print, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Joel C. Rosenberg has been called "eerily prophetic" and a "modern Nostradamus" for his uncanny ability to write political thrillers that come true. In his first &lt;i&gt;nonfiction&lt;/i&gt; book, this evangelical Christian from an Orthodox Jewish heritage takes readers on an unforgettable journey through prophecy and current events into the future of Iraq after Saddam, Russia after Communism, Israel after Arafat, and Christianity after radical Islam. You won't want to miss Joel's exclusive interviews with Israeli, Palestinian, and Russian leaders, and previously classified CIA and White House documents. Similar to the approach Joel takes in his novels, his desire is to draw readers into stories, anecdotes, and predictions in a way that builds confidence that allows Joel to share his faith in Jesus Christ and the reliability of Scripture as a guide to understanding the past and the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on his experience in Washington, his own exclusive interviews with world leaders, and his astute political acumen, Joel makes sense of the events surrounding the Middle East. He connects information in a way that will make you understand and really care about the world's most important events and how they impact your life--from gas prices to your bank account. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Epicenter&lt;/i&gt; is about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Change&lt;/b&gt;--big changes, dramatic changes, changes that will transform the world as we know it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Answers&lt;/b&gt;--what the changes are underway in the world's most important countries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insight&lt;/b&gt;--readers will understand the trajectory of world events by being taken inside the governments of Iran, Iraq, Russia, China, and more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessibility&lt;/b&gt;--aimed for a wide audience in both the general and Christian markets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faith&lt;/b&gt;--Joel shares his faith in Jesus Christ and the reliability of Scripture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Epicenter&lt;/i&gt; will answer questions like:&lt;br /&gt;Will Iraq go from bad to worse? Will Israel and her Arab neighbors find peace, or is another major Middle East war just around the corner? If the new, post-Soviet Russia is our friend, why is the Kremlin creating a new class of thermonuclear weapons and building an alliance with radical Islam?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of &lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36311231-triptych" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B000JMKRAW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Karin Slaughter's &lt;i&gt;Fallen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the city of Atlanta, women are dying—at the hands of a killer who signs his work with a single, chilling act of mutilation. Leaving behind enough evidence to fuel a frenzied police hunt, this cunning madman is bringing together dozens of lives, crossing the boundaries of wealth and race. And the people who are chasing him must cross those boundaries too. Among them is Michael Ormewood, a veteran detective whose marriage is hanging by a thread—and whose arrogance and explosive temper are threatening his career. And Angie Polaski, a beautiful vice cop who was once Michael's lover before she became his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But another player has entered the game: a loser ex-con who has stumbled upon the killer's trail in the most coincidental of ways—someone who may be the key to breaking the case wide open...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Husbands and wives. Mothers and daughters. The past and the future. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Secrets bind them. And secrets can destroy them. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The author of &lt;em&gt;Pretty Girls&lt;/em&gt; returns with an electrifying, emotionally complex thriller that plunges its fascinating protagonist into the darkest depths of a mystery that just might destroy him. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the discovery of a murder at an abandoned construction site, Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is brought in on a case that becomes much more dangerous when the dead man is identified as an ex-cop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studying the body, Sara Linton—the GBI’s newest medical examiner and Will’s lover—realizes that the extensive blood loss didn't belong to the corpse. Sure enough, bloody footprints leading away from the scene indicate there is another victim—a woman—who has vanished . . . and who will die soon if she isn’t found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will is already compromised, because the site belongs to the city’s most popular citizen: a wealthy, powerful, and politically connected athlete protected by the world’s most expensive lawyers—a man who’s already gotten away with rape, despite Will’s exhaustive efforts to put him away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the worst is yet to come. Evidence soon links Will’s troubled past to the case . . . and the consequences will tear through his life with the force of a tornado, wreaking havoc for Will and everyone around him, including his colleagues, family, friends—and even the suspects he pursues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relentlessly suspenseful and furiously paced, peopled with conflicted, fallible characters who leap from the page, &lt;em&gt;The Kept Woman&lt;/em&gt; is a seamless blend of twisty police procedural and ingenious psychological thriller -- a searing, unforgettable novel of love, loss, and redemption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Iris Johansen, an explosive thriller featuring fan favorite Margaret Douglas, an animal psychic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ON THE RUN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Margaret Douglas has worked hard to put her painful past behind her. Raised off the grid in an abusive home, her only escape was the nearby forest where she sought refuge whenever she could. There, in the peaceful woods, she discovered a strange gift: the ability to understand animals and to communicate with them. Now, Margaret wants nothing more than to live a quiet life, close to the animals and under the radar. But her abilities have not gone unnoticed...and there are those who would use them for their own purposes. Determined not to be a pawn in anyone's game, every time someone gets too close, Margaret uproots her life and outruns them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;INTO THE LINE OF FIRE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When CIA operative John Lassiter breaks into Margaret's apartment, she vanishes again. Still, Lassiter has good reason to be persistent: one of his men is being held captive by an unrelenting enemy--someone who has set his sights on Margaret. Which means that Lassiter must control her to use her as bait...With danger in hot pursuit, Margaret finds herself matching wits with a man who refuses to stop or be stopped. Turning from the hunted to the hunter, Margaret must use everything she has ever learned to not only survive, but to defeat a great evil. And to prove once and for all that she's no easy target. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Three women, haunted by the past and the secrets they hold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set at the end of World War II, in a crumbling Bavarian castle that once played host to all of German high society, a powerful and propulsive story of three widows whose lives and fates become intertwined—an affecting, shocking, and ultimately redemptive novel from the author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Notable Book &lt;em&gt;The Hazards of Good Breeding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amid the ashes of Nazi Germany’s defeat, Marianne von Lingenfels returns to the once-grand castle of her husband’s ancestors, an imposing stone fortress now fallen into ruin following years of war. The widow of a resister murdered in the failed July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Marianne plans to uphold the promise she made to her husband’s brave conspirators: to find and protect their wives, her fellow resistance widows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Marianne rescues six-year-old Martin, the son of her dearest childhood friend, from a Nazi reeducation home. Together, they make their way across the smoldering wreckage of their homeland to Berlin, where Martin’s mother, the beautiful and naive Benita, has fallen into the hands of occupying Red Army soldiers. Then she locates Ania, another resister’s wife, and her two boys, now refugees languishing in one of the many camps that house the millions displaced by the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marianne assembles this makeshift family from the ruins of her husband’s resistance movement, she is certain their shared pain and circumstances will hold them together. But she quickly discovers that the black-and-white, highly principled world of her privileged past has become infinitely more complicated, filled with secrets and dark passions that threaten to tear them apart. Eventually, all three women must come to terms with the choices that have defined their lives before, during, and after the war—each with their own unique share of challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with the devastating emotional power of &lt;em&gt;The Nightingale, Sarah’s Key&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Light Between Oceans&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Shattuck’s evocative and utterly enthralling novel offers a fresh perspective on one of the most tumultuous periods in history. Combining piercing social insight and vivid historical atmosphere, &lt;em&gt;The Women in the Castle&lt;/em&gt; is a dramatic yet nuanced portrait of war and its repercussions that explores what it means to survive, love, and, ultimately, to forgive in the wake of unimaginable hardship. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of FEARLESS, the first in a new Dartmoor spinoff series: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Colin O’Donnell grew up in a lie, believing the man who raised him was his father, stirring up hell in the Louisiana bayous. A shocking revelation about his parentage led him to his half-brother…and his half-brother’s motorcycle club. Now Colin is a prospect for the Lean Dogs MC, and he’s just been transferred from his home town of New Orleans to Amarillo, Texas, where Vice President Candyman runs a tight ship, and holds tight secrets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jenny Snow has spent the last seven years in limbo, waiting for the pain to recede, when she unwittingly catches the eye of the club’s newest prospect. She doesn’t have the time or patience for a biker in her life. If only she can convince herself she truly believes that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;SNOW IN TEXAS is the first installment of Lauren Gilley’s new Lean Dogs Legacy Series, and features characters first introduced in her Dartmoor Series. Be sure to look for the Dartmoor novels FEARLESS, PRICE OF ANGELS, HALF MY BLOOD, THE SKELETON KING, and SECONDHAND SMOKE.</description>

  <description>Real life. It isn’t sexy. Isn’t pretty. There are no alpha bad boys. No easy outs. No Hollywood soundtrack. Real life hurts like hell and tastes like the grit between your teeth. And love…love always bears a hefty price. This isn’t a biker romance. This is love and war in the world of the Lean Dogs MC. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aidan Teague was born into the Lean Dogs Motorcycle Club, a third generation outlaw with big biker boots to fill. A perpetual screw-up and playboy, he’s never taken life seriously. Until now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If his accident a year ago was a wakeup call, then a jolting revelation from his latest lover is a life-altering shock. It won’t be simple, but it’s high time Aidan came into his own. With the club on the brink of a new war, beset by enemies old and new, Aidan must find the strength to lead, or risk everyone he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secondhand Smoke is the fourth full-length installment in the Dartmoor Series, and is NOT a standalone. This is a work of literary fiction, so readers should expect lyrical prose and an emphasis on character development and realism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for the first four volumes: Fearless, Price of Angels, Half My Blood (A Dartmoor Novella), and The Skeleton King.</description>

  <description>It’s summer in Knoxville, and if the outlaw crew at Dartmoor Inc. thought they were getting a respite from the drama…they were kidding themselves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Almost a year ago, Mercy’s dying mother claimed he had a half-brother, sired by the beloved father he’d always thought infallible, raised by another man as his own. He’s been in denial ever since, but when Colin O’Donnell arrives, it’s time to face facts. Turns out his family isn’t lost – he only wishes this member of it was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly McCall is determined to prove her worth to the other old ladies – Maggie, specifically. She never dreamed of a life like this, and as she searches for self-worth and acceptance, she is wrapped step-by-step in the gentlest love of the fiercest man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Aidan and Tango, this summer is a season for realizations. For waking to a vision of the future. And for drowning in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this Dartmoor Series novella, readers will spend time with the entire club, meet new voices, and fall deeper into the world of the Lean Dogs MC. Not a stand-alone romance, Half My Blood balances several central storylines with delicacy and passion. Brimming with emotion, spotlighting secondary characters, Dartmoor fans won’t want to miss this bridge between novels two and three in the series. Book three, The Skeleton King, releases September 2015. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Each winter the crew at the Shackleton South Pole Research Facility faces nine months of isolation, round-the-clock darkness, and one of the most extreme climates on the planet. For thirty-something mechanical engineer Cass Jennings, Antarctica offers an opportunity to finally escape the guilt of her troubled past and to rebuild her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the death of a colleague triggers a series of mysterious incidents that push Cass and the rest of the forty-four-person crew to the limits of their sanity and endurance. Confined and cut off from the outside world, will they work together or turn against one another? As the tension escalates, Cass must find the strength to survive not only a punishing landscape but also an unrelenting menace determined to destroy the station—and everyone in it.</description>

  <description>Book II in the Dartmoor Series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holly Jessup came to Knoxville in search of the Lean Dogs MC, hoping to find a killer among them. She’s spent four months cozying up to Sgt. at Arms Michael, and it’s time to make her move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael McCall isn’t in the habit of accepting contract hits, but Holly isn’t the kind of girl who chases after Dogs. She’s petrified, and infatuated, and she might be the first woman to see him for the man he is, rather than the outlaw he seems. Maybe, for Holly, he can become St. Michael at last. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the events of FEARLESS, the Lean Dogs can’t afford any more scandals. Michael never expected he’d be the one to bend the rules. And no one thought his feelings for one woman could shake the balance of the Tennessee underworld. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be sure to look for Book I in the Dartmoor Series, FEARLESS, and be on the lookout for Book III, coming Summer 2015.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Librarian’s note: This is a previously-published edition of&lt;br /&gt;Kindle &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40017404-pretty-girls" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B00VES8D6K&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this electrifying new stand-alone thriller, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Karin Slaughter—“one of the best crime novelists in America” (&lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;)—delivers a chilling jolt of suspense. With a missing girl in the news, Claire Scott can’t help but be reminded of her sister, who disappeared twenty years ago in a mystery that was never solved. But when Claire begins to learn the truth about her sister, nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>RECOMMENDED FOR READERS 18 AND OLDER DUE TO STRONG LANGUAGE, SEXUAL SITUATIONS AND VIOLENCE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 of 3 in the Nine Minutes Trilogy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A Gift of Time is the third installment in the Nine Minutes Trilogy. It is not intended to be a stand-alone novel, but could be read as one. Still, I highly recommend that you read my first two novels, Nine Minutes and Out of Time, to be able to understand the background stories of the main characters. There are many twists and turns in both books that can best be connected if read consecutively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are some secrets meant to stay buried? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three months have passed since Jason “Grizz” Talbot was put to death by lethal injection for crimes he committed. His former wife, Ginny, whom he had abducted from a convenience store when she was a teenager and became the love obsession of his life, has spent more than the last decade trying to carve out a life of normalcy in the bustling suburbs of Fort Lauderdale—including a thriving and happy marriage to Tommy "Grunt" Dillon, a former member of Grizz’s gang. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tired of the secrets and the lies, Ginny and Tommy thought the final piece of their past could be left behind forever with Grizz’s execution. However, the past comes crashing around Ginny and Tommy when a newly discovered secret threatens to destroy their marriage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When tragedy strikes, Ginny is forced to reach into her heart and decide, once and for all, what she really wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this third book in the Nine Minutes trilogy, A Gift of Time takes readers from the busy tropical metropolis of South Florida into the serenity of the North Carolina Blue Ridge mountains as Ginny chases down the answers she needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she have the strength to confront the secrets of her past…and her heart?</description>

  <description>Annie Parker came to Silver Mesa, Arizona, because it was the only place she'd found where folks thought a woman doctor was better than no doctor at all. Her lonely life became harder still on the winter night Rafe McCay broke into her office with a bullet in his side and a bounty hunter at his back. With a gun aimed at her heart, he led her deep into the Arizona mountains, and into a world of danger and passion, for Annie discovered in Rafe not only a wounded man, but a soul betrayed...and Rafe, healed by her skill and the magic in her hands, awakened in Annie a woman's tender longing and hungry desire. Pursued by dangerous secrets of the past, they are swept into a thrilling odyssey of the heart -- a bold, exhilarating journey that rekindles Rafe's lost hope and transforms Annie's healing gift into a deep, enduring love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;THE PAST PROVED DEADLY...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows the dangers of getting close to legendary CIA Black Ops specialist John Medina better than communications expert Niema Burdock. Five years ago, she and her husband worked with Medina on an explosive mission that ended in a tragedy. Although she has slowly recovered from her terrible loss, Niema planned never to see Medina again. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;HISTORY IS ABOUT TO REPEAT ITSELF...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A French arms dealer is supplying international terrorists, and only Niema can plant the bugs needed to crack the deadly ring. Against her best instincts, she infiltrates the dealer's glamorous world. But when the plan goes awry, Niema and Medina must take flight in a strange land--and soon find their partnership sparked by an erotic charge. In a world of deception. John Medina has once again set Niema on a free fall into danger...and into desire like she's never known.</description>

  <description>Night Wing — the revolutionary test plane with a top secret weapons system — was Colonel Joe "Breed" Mackenzie's number-one priority. And weapons expert Caroline Evans was his number-one distraction. True, the stubborn blonde was giving him the cold shoulder, but Joe hadn't become the best of the best by giving up. Then he discovered someone on the inside was sabotaging Night Wing, and with her late hours and specialized expertise, Caroline seemed the obvious choice. Now Joe had to choose between allegiance to his country and love for his prime suspect...</description>

  <description>Detective Dane Hollister of the Orlando police department has never met anyone quite like Marlie Keen. While he has doubts about her supposed clairvoyant powers, she sees crimes as they're being committed, there is no doubt about how much he desires her. To Marlie, Dane is all heat and hard muscle, and he makes her body come alive as it never has before. But not even she can foresee that their passion will lead them on a dangerous journey into the twisted mind of a madman who will threaten their happiness and their lives.</description>

  <description>"Of all of my novels, After the Night remains one of my personal favorites – and Faith Devlin and Gray Rouillard are two of my favorite characters. Faith is strong, proud, and fearless, and Gray – well, he’s just downright sexy. Faith’s search for the truth about the devastating scandal surrounding her mother and Gray’s father blazes with intrigue. Add some sultry Southern hear, and you’ve got a real scorcher of a listen." (Linda Howard)</description>

  <description>Roanna Davenport was raised a wealthy orphan on her grandmother's magnificent Alabama estate, Davencourt, where she had a passion for horses, a genius for trouble, and a deep love for her cousin, Webb. But everyone expected Webb to marry their ravishing cousin, Jessie. When he did, Roanna's desire became no more than the stuff of dreams -- until the night Jessie was found bludgeoned to death. &lt;br /&gt; After the shocking murder of his wife, Webb left for Arizona, abandoning the legacy that he had once believed was all he wanted. But then an all-grown-up Roanna walked into a dingy bar in Nogales to bring him home; the mischievous sprite he had known ten years earlier was no more. Gone, too, was her fire. In its place was ice that melted at his touch. Webb is drawn back to Davencourt, to Roanna, and to the killer that once destroyed his life and waits only for the chance to finish the job....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;2018 Finalist IAN Book of the Year Awards for Historical Fiction and a Bronze Medal Winner for Historical Romance Readers' Favorite Book Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves a good love story. The stories that make you feel warm all over. The kind that leaves you the slightest bit envious because the story belongs to someone else and not you. The stories that make your heart race and on the edge of pain and pleasure. Pain because your heart hurts and pleasure because your heart hurts. An unlikely combination, yet, that’s the stuff good love stories are made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ours could have been like that. We could have made a beautiful love story. But when he was ready for that epic love story, I was afraid to fall in love, too hurt by my past to trust anyone. Then, when I was ready for the epic love story, he was gone. And I was alone. And the only thing I got was the pain. It was time I told him the things that were in my heart but too afraid to say out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the letter I needed to write and prayed it wasn't too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Charlie,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You were right. I was wrong. I've never been more wrong in my life. There - I said it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll say it a million times if you just come back to me. Come back to me. Please! I was so wrong. I do love you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>RECOMMENDED FOR READERS 18 AND OLDER DUE TO &lt;br /&gt;STRONG LANGUAGE, SEXUAL SITUATIONS AND VIOLENCE &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Out of Time is book two in a series. It is not a standalone novel. I highly recommend that you read my first novel, Nine Minutes, to be able to understand the background stories of the main characters. There are many twists and turns in both books that can best be connected if read consecutively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I do answer the outstanding questions from Nine Minutes, there is more to this story, and some readers may consider it a cliffhanger. If you do not like cliffhangers, you may want to wait until the third novel is released in 2016. Other readers may be satisfied with the answers and the ending. Regardless of which category you fall into, I hope you enjoy the story. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They thought with his execution it would all be over. &lt;br /&gt;They were wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The leader of one of South Florida’s most notorious and brutal motorcycle gangs has been put to death by lethal injection. Days later, his family and friends should have been picking up the pieces, moving on. Instead, they’ve been catapulted into a world so twisted and dangerous even the most ruthless among them would be stunned to discover the tangled web of deception, not only on the dangerous streets of South Florida but all the way to the top. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this gripping follow-up novel to Nine Minutes, Out of Time takes readers from the sun-drenched flatlands of 1950s Central Florida to the vivid tropical heat of Fort Lauderdale to the halls of Florida’s Death Row as we finally learn the gritty backstory of Jason “Grizz” Talbot and the secret he spent his life trying to conceal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not even Grizz’s inner circle knows his full story—the tragedy that enveloped his early life, the surprise discovery that made him the government’s most wanted and most feared, and the depths of his love for Ginny, the tenderhearted innocent he’d once abducted and later made his wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once Grizz’s obsession and now the mother of his child, Ginny has spent years grieving the man she’d first resisted and then came to love. Now remarried to Tommy, a former member of the gang, the pair have spent more than a decade trying desperately to live a normal existence far from the violent, crime-ridden world they’d once carved out on the edge of the Florida Everglades. For Tommy, especially, the stakes are high. Desperately in love with Ginny for years, he’s finally living his dream: married to the woman he never thought he could have. But even with the façade of normalcy—thriving careers, two beautiful children, and a genuinely happy and loving marriage—they can’t seem to put the past behind them. Every time they turn around, another secret is revealed, unraveling the very bonds that hold them together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And with Grizz finally put to death, now Ginny has learned secrets so dark, so evil she’s not even sure she can go on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will these secrets tear their love to pieces? And how far will Grizz go to protect what he still considers his, even from beyond the grave?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22839067-nine-minutes" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 15, 1975, fifteen-year-old Ginny Lemon is abducted from a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale by a member of one of the most notorious and brutal motorcycle gangs in South Florida. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that moment on, her life is forever changed. She gets a new name, a new identity and a new life in the midst of the gang’s base on the edge of the Florida Everglades—a frightening, rough and violent world much like the swamps themselves, where everyone has an alias and loyalty is tantamount to survival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And at the center of it all is the gang’s leader, Grizz: massive, ruggedly handsome, terrifying and somehow, when it comes to Ginny, tender. She becomes his obsession and the one true love of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So begins a tale of emotional obsession and manipulation, of a young woman ripped from everything she knows and forced to lean on the one person who provides attention, affection and care: her captor. Precocious and intelligent, but still very much a teenager, Ginny struggles to adapt to her existence, initially fighting and then coming to terms with her captivity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she be rescued? Will she escape? Will she get out alive—or get out at all? Part psychological thriller, part coming-of-age novel, filled with mystery, romance and unexpected turns, Nine Minutes takes readers into the world of one motorcycle gang and inside the heart of a young girl, whose abduction brought about its fall.</description>

  <description>Paris, July 1942: Ten-year-old Sarah is brutally arrested with her family in the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup, the most notorious act of French collaboration with the Nazis. but before the police come to take them, Sarah locks her younger brother, Michel, in their favorite hiding place, a cupboard in the family's apartment. She keeps the key, thinking that she will be back within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, May 2002: On Vel' d'Hiv's sixtieth anniversary, Julia Jarmond, an American journalist, is asked by her Paris-based American magazine to write an article about this black day in France's past. Julia has lived in Paris for nearly twenty-five years, married a Frenchman, and she is shocked both by her ignorance about the event and the silence that still surrounds it. In the course of her investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connects her to Sarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl's ordeal, from the terrible days spent shut in at the Vel' d'Hiv' to the camps and beyond. As she probes into Sarah's past, she begins to question her own place in France and to reevaluate her marriage and her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing about the fate of her country with a pitiless clarity, Tatiana de Rosnay offers us a brilliantly subtle, compelling portrait of France under occupation and reveals the taboos and denial surrounding this painful episode in French history.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>A thirteen-year-old Welsh boy enters a man's world in the mining pits; an American law student rejected by love finds a surprising new career in Woodrow Wilson's White House; a housekeeper for the aristocratic Fitzherberts takes a fateful step above her station, while Lady Maud Fitzherbert herself crosses deep into forbidden territory when she falls in love with a German spy; and two orphaned Russian brothers embark on radically different paths when their plan to emigrate to America falls afoul of war, conscription, and revolution.From the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering chandeliers of a palace, from the corridors of power to the bedrooms of the mighty, &lt;i&gt;Fall of Giants&lt;/i&gt; takes readers into the inextricably entangled fates of five families-and into a century that we thought we knew, but that now will never seem the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of &lt;i&gt;Between Shades of Gray&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt;, international bestselling author Ruta Sepetys returns to WWII in this epic novel that&lt;/b&gt; shines a light on one of the war's most devastating—yet unknown—tragedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World War II is drawing to a close in East Prussia, and thousands of refugees are on a desperate trek toward freedom, almost all of them with something to hide. Among them are Joana, Emilia, and Florian, whose paths converge en route to the ship that promises salvation, the &lt;i&gt;Wilhelm Gustloff.&lt;/i&gt; Forced by circumstance to unite, the three find their strength, courage, and trust in one another tested with each step closer toward safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just when it seems freedom is within their grasp, tragedy strikes. Not country, nor culture, nor status matter as all ten thousand people aboard must fight for the same thing: survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating points of view, and perfect for fans of Anthony Doerr's Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt;, Erik Larson's #1 NYT bestseller &lt;i&gt;Dead Wake&lt;/i&gt;, and Elizabeth Wein's Printz Honor Book &lt;i&gt;Code Name Verity&lt;/i&gt;, this masterful work of historical fiction is inspired by the real-life tragedy that was the sinking of the&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Wilhelm Gustloff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;the greatest maritime disaster in history. As she did in &lt;i&gt;Between Shades of Gray&lt;/i&gt;, Ruta Sepetys unearths a shockingly little-known casualty of a gruesome war, and proves that humanity can prevail, even in the darkest of hours.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Can Lady Sophia seduce the most eligible man in London?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Sophia Sydney would do anything to ensnare the unattainable Sir Ross Cannon. Her goal is to ruin his reputation and cause a scandal that would be the talk of all London. So, she charms her way into his life by gaining his trust and living in his house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning, her lush presence tempts him beyond all reason and every night she promises with her eyes - and her body - that the hours before dawn could be spent in unbridled passion instead of restless sleep - if only he'd let her share his bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows he is falling more in love with her each day. But she never counted on falling in love with him. And she never dreamed he might, very respectably, ask for her hand in marriage . . .</description>

  <description>Best Friends Forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of children on Hill Street, but no little girls Betsy's age. So when a new family moves into the house across the street, Betsy hopes they will have a little girl she can play with. Sure enough, they do—a little girl named Tacy. And from the moment they meet at Betsy's fifth birthday party, Betsy and Tacy become such good friends that everyone starts to think of them as one person—Betsy-Tacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betsy and Tacy have lots of fun together. They make a playhouse from a piano box, have a sand store, and dress up and go calling. And one day, they come home to a wonderful surprise—a new friend named Tib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since their first publication in the 1940's, the Betsy-Tacy stories have been loved by each generation of young readers.</description>

  <description>Madelaine Hillyard is a world-famous heart surgeon at the top of her game. Her personal life is far less successful. A loving but overworked single mom, she is constantly at odds with her teenage daughter. At sixteen, Lina is confused, angry, and fast becoming a stranger to her mother—a rebel desperate to find the father who walked away before she was born. Complicating matters for Madelaine are the vastly different DeMarco brothers: While priest Francis DeMarco is always ready to lend a helping hand, his brother, Angel, long ago took on the role of bad boy. Years earlier Angel abandoned Madelaine—and fatherhood—to go in search of fame and fortune. His departure left Madelaine devastated, but now he reappears and seeks help from the very people he betrayed—as a patient in dire need. With Home Again, New York Times bestselling author Kristin Hannah has written a moving, powerful novel about the fragile threads that bind together our lives and the astonishing possibility of second chances.</description>
