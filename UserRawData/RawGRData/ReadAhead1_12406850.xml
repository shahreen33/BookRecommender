  <description>Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring was first published in three serialized excerpts in the New Yorker in June of 1962. The book appeared in September of that year and the outcry that followed its publication forced the banning of DDT and spurred revolutionary changes in the laws affecting our air, land, and water. Carson’s passionate concern for the future of our planet reverberated powerfully throughout the world, and her eloquent book was instrumental in launching the environmental movement. It is without question one of the landmark books of the twentieth century.</description>

  <description>For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future -- to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire -- both scientists and scholars -- and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for a future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. Mankind's last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and be overrun -- or fight them and be destroyed.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Frank Herbert's Final Novel in the Magnificent Dune Chronicles--the Bestselling Science Fiction Adventure of All Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed. The remnants of the Old Empire have been consumed by the violent matriarchal cult known as the Honored Matres. Only one faction remains a viable threat to their total conquest--the Bene Gesserit, heirs to Dune's power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the leadership of Mother Superior Darwi Odrade, the Bene Gesserit have colonized a green world on the planet Chapterhouse and are turning it into a desert, mile by scorched mile. And once they've mastered breeding sandworms, the Sisterhood will control the production of the greatest commodity in the known galaxy--the spice melange. But their true weapon remains a man who has lived countless lifetimes--a man who served under the God Emperor Paul Muad'Dib....</description>

  <description>Jesmyn Ward’s first novel since her National Book Award–winning &lt;i&gt;Salvage the Bones&lt;/i&gt;, this singular American writer brings the archetypal road novel into rural twenty-first-century America. An intimate portrait of a family and an epic tale of hope and struggle, &lt;i&gt;Sing, Unburied, Sing&lt;/i&gt; journeys through Mississippi’s past and present, examining the ugly truths at the heart of the American story and the power—and limitations—of family bonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jojo is thirteen years old and trying to understand what it means to be a man. He doesn’t lack in fathers to study, chief among them his Black grandfather, Pop. But there are other men who complicate his understanding: his absent White father, Michael, who is being released from prison; his absent White grandfather, Big Joseph, who won’t acknowledge his existence; and the memories of his dead uncle, Given, who died as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; His mother, Leonie, is an inconsistent presence in his and his toddler sister’s lives. She is an imperfect mother in constant conflict with herself and those around her. She is Black and her children’s father is White. She wants to be a better mother but can’t put her children above her own needs, especially her drug use. Simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she’s high, Leonie is embattled in ways that reflect the brutal reality of her circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When the children’s father is released from prison, Leonie packs her kids and a friend into her car and drives north to the heart of Mississippi and Parchman Farm, the State Penitentiary. At Parchman, there is another thirteen-year-old boy, the ghost of a dead inmate who carries all of the ugly history of the South with him in his wandering. He too has something to teach Jojo about fathers and sons, about legacies, about violence, about love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book five in Frank Herbert's magnificent Dune Chronicles--one of the most significant sagas in the history of literary science fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leto Atreides, the God Emperor of Dune, is dead. In the fifteen hundred years since his passing, the Empire has fallen into ruin. The great Scattering saw millions abandon the crumbling civilization and spread out beyond the reaches of known space. The planet Arrakis-now called Rakis-has reverted to its desert climate, and its great sandworms are dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Lost Ones are returning home in pursuit of power. And as factions vie for control over the remnants of the Empire, a girl named Sheeana rises to prominence in the wastelands of Rakis, sending religious fervor throughout the galaxy. For she possesses the abilities of the Fremen sandriders-fulfilling a prophecy foretold by the late God Emperor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Includes an introduction by Brian Herbert&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An Indie Next Selection for July 2019&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Indies Introduce Selection for Summer/Fall 2019&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; opinion writer Margaret Renkl comes an unusual, captivating portrait of a family--and of the cycles of joy and grief that inscribe human lives within the natural world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in Alabama, Renkl was a devoted reader, an explorer of riverbeds and red-dirt roads, and a fiercely loved daughter. Here, in brief essays, she traces a tender and honest portrait of her complicated parents--her exuberant, creative mother; her steady, supportive father--and of the bittersweet moments that accompany a child's transition to caregiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here, braided into the overall narrative, Renkl offers observations on the world surrounding her suburban Nashville home. Ringing with rapture and heartache, these essays convey the dignity of bluebirds and rat snakes, monarch butterflies and native bees. As these two threads haunt and harmonize with each other, Renkl suggests that there is astonishment to be found in common things: in what seems ordinary, in what we all share. For in both worlds--the natural one and our own--"the shadow side of love is always loss, and grief is only love's own twin."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeously illustrated by the author's brother, Billy Renkl, &lt;i&gt;Late Migrations&lt;/i&gt; is an assured and memorable debut.</description>

  <description>More than three thousand years have passed since the first events recorded in DUNE. Only one link survives with those tumultuous times: the grotesque figure of Leto Atreides, son of the prophet Paul Muad'Dib, and now the virtually immortal God Emperor of Dune. He alone understands the future, and he knows with a terrible certainty that the evolution of his race is at an end unless he can breed new qualities into his species. But to achieve his final victory, Leto Atreides must also bring about his own downfall...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book three in Frank Herbert's magnificent Dune Chronicles--one of the most significant sagas in the history of literary science fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Children of Dune are twin siblings Leto and Ghanima Atreides, whose father, the Emperor Paul Muad'Dib, disappeared in the desert wastelands of Arrakis nine years ago. Like their father, the twins possess supernormal abilities--making them valuable to their manipulative aunt Alia, who rules the Empire in the name of House Atreides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facing treason and rebellion on two fronts, Alia's rule is not absolute. The displaced House Corrino is plotting to regain the throne while the fanatical Fremen are being provoked into open revolt by the enigmatic figure known only as The Preacher. Alia believes that by obtaining the secrets of the twins' prophetic visions, she can maintain control over her dynasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Leto and Ghanima have their own plans for their visions--and their destinies....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Includes an introduction by Brian Herbert&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Explores protesting as an act of faith . . . &lt;i&gt;How to Read a Protest&lt;/i&gt; argues that the women's marches of 2017 didn't just help shape and fuel a moment--they actually created one."--Masha Gessen, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;O, the Oprah Magazine's &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;"14 Best Political Books to Read Before the 2018 Midterm Election"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A fascinating and detailed history of American mass demonstrations."--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When millions of people took to the streets for the 2017 Women's Marches, there was an unmistakable air of uprising, a sense that these marches were launching a powerful new movement to resist a dangerous presidency. But the work that protests do often can't be seen in the moment. It feels empowering to march, and record numbers of Americans have joined anti-Trump demonstrations, but when and why does marching matter? What exactly do protests do, and how do they help movements win?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In this original and richly illustrated account, organizer and journalist L.A. Kauffman delves into the history of America's major demonstrations, beginning with the legendary 1963 March on Washington, to reveal the ways protests work and how their character has shifted over time. Using the signs that demonstrators carry as clues to how protests are organized, Kauffman explores the nuanced relationship between the way movements are made and the impact they have. &lt;i&gt;How to Read a Protest&lt;/i&gt; sheds new light on the catalytic power of collective action and the decentralized, bottom-up, women-led model for organizing that has transformed what movements look like and what they can accomplish.</description>

  <description>The past thirty years have seen dozens of otherwise successful investors try to improve education through the application of market principles. They have funneled billions of dollars into alternative schools, online education, and textbook publishing, and they have, with surprising regularity, lost their shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Class Clowns&lt;/i&gt;, professor and investment banker Jonathan A. Knee dissects what drives investors' efforts to improve education and why they consistently fail. Knee takes readers inside four spectacular financial failures in education: Rupert Murdoch's billion-dollar effort to reshape elementary education through technology; the unhappy investors--including hedge fund titan John Paulson--who lost billions in textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin; the abandonment of Knowledge Universe, Michael Milken's twenty-year mission to revolutionize the global education industry; and a look at Chris Whittle, founder of EdisonLearning and a pioneer of large-scale transformational educational ventures, who continues to attract investment despite decades of financial and operational disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although deep belief in the curative powers of the market drove these initiatives, it was the investors' failure to appreciate market structure that doomed them. Knee asks: What makes a good education business? By contrasting rare successes, he finds a dozen broad lessons at the heart of these cautionary case studies. &lt;i&gt;Class Clowns&lt;/i&gt; offers an important guide for public policy makers and guardrails for future investors, as well as an intelligent expos' for activists and teachers frustrated with the repeated underperformance of these attempts to shake up education.</description>

  <description>Object Lessons is a series of short, beautifully designed books about the hidden lives of ordinary things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric candle and faux fur, coffee substitutes and meat analogues, Obama impersonators, prosthetics. Imitation this, false that. Humans have been replacing and improving upon the real thing for millennia – from wooden toes found on Egyptian mummies to the Luxor pyramid in Las Vegas. So why do people have such disdain for so-called “fakes”?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kati Stevens's &lt;i&gt;Fake&lt;/i&gt; discusses the strange history of imitations, as well as our ever-changing psychological and socioeconomic relationships with them. After all, fakes aren't going anywhere; they seem to be going everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Object Lessons is published in partnership with an essay series in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An epic tale of a father and two sons, of betrayals and loyalties, of a family unraveling in the wake of Ethiopia’s revolution.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This memorable, heartbreaking story opens in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1974, on the eve of a revolution. Yonas kneels in his mother’s prayer room, pleading to his god for an end to the violence that has wracked his family and country. His father, Hailu, a prominent doctor, has been ordered to report to jail after helping a victim of state-sanctioned torture to die. And Dawit, Hailu’s youngest son, has joined an underground resistance movement—a choice that will lead to more upheaval and bloodshed across a ravaged Ethiopia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Beneath the Lion’s Gaze&lt;/em&gt; tells a gripping story of family, of the bonds of love and friendship set in a time and place that has rarely been explored in fiction. It is a story about the lengths human beings will go in pursuit of freedom and the human price of a national revolution. Emotionally gripping, poetic, and indelibly tragic, &lt;em&gt;Beneath The Lion’s Gaze&lt;/em&gt; is a transcendent and powerful debut. .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsgård, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, and Charlotte Rampling. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.</description>

  <description>Finally, a novel that puts the "pissed" back into "epistolary."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Fitger is a beleaguered professor of creative writing and literature at Payne University, a small and not very distinguished liberal arts college in the midwest. His department is facing draconian cuts and squalid quarters, while one floor above them the Economics Department is getting lavishly remodeled offices. His once-promising writing career is in the doldrums, as is his romantic life, in part as the result of his unwise use of his private affairs for his novels. His star (he thinks) student can't catch a break with his brilliant (he thinks) work &lt;i&gt;Accountant in a Bordello&lt;/i&gt;, based on Melville's &lt;i&gt;Bartleby&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, his life is a tale of woe, and the vehicle this droll and inventive novel uses to tell that tale is a series of hilarious letters of recommendation that Fitger is endlessly called upon by his students and colleagues to produce, each one of which is a small masterpiece of high dudgeon, low spirits, and passive-aggressive strategies. We recommend &lt;i&gt;Dear Committee Members&lt;/i&gt; to you in the strongest possible terms.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Teaching to Transgress&lt;/i&gt;, bell hooks--writer, teacher, and insurgent black intellectual--writes about a new kind of education, educations as the practice of freedom. Teaching students to "transgress" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom is, for hooks, the teacher's most important goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bell hooks speaks to the heart of education today: how can we rethink teaching practices in the age of multiculturalism? What do we do about teachers who do not want to teach, and students who do not want to learn? How should we deal with racism and sexism in the classroom?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of passion and politics, &lt;i&gt;Teaching to Transgress&lt;/i&gt; combines practical knowledge of the classroom with a deeply felt connection to the world of emotions and feelings. This is the rare book about teachers and students that dares to raise critical questions about eros and rage, grief and reconciliation, and the future o teaching its self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"To educate as the practice of freedom," writes bell hooks, "is a way of teaching that any one can learn." &lt;i&gt;Teaching to Transgress&lt;/i&gt; is the record of one gifted teacher's struggle to make classrooms work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-from the back of the book</description>

  <description>First published in Portuguese in 1968, &lt;i&gt;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&lt;/i&gt; was translated and published in English in 1970. The methodology of the late Paulo Freire has helped to empower countless impoverished and illiterate people throughout the world. Freire's work has taken on especial urgency in the United States and Western Europe, where the creation of a permanent underclass among the underprivileged and minorities in cities and urban centers is increasingly accepted as the norm. With a substantive new introduction on Freire's life and the remarkable impact of this book by writer and Freire confidant and authority Donaldo Macedo, this anniversary edition of &lt;i&gt;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&lt;/i&gt; will inspire a new generation of educators, students, and general readers for years to come.</description>

  <description>A ferociously intimate memoir by a devout woman from a modest family in Saudi Arabia who became the unexpected leader of a courageous movement to support women’s right to drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manal al-Sharif grew up in Mecca the second daughter of a taxi driver, born the year fundamentalism took hold. In her adolescence, she was a religious radical, melting her brother’s boy band cassettes in the oven because music was &lt;i&gt;haram&lt;/i&gt;: forbidden by Islamic law. But what a difference an education can make. By her twenties she was a computer security engineer, one of few women working in a desert compound that resembled suburban America. That’s when the Saudi kingdom’s contradictions became too much to bear: she was labeled a slut for chatting with male colleagues, her teenage brother chaperoned her on a business trip, and while she kept a car in her garage, she was forbidden from driving down city streets behind the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daring to Drive&lt;/i&gt; is the fiercely intimate memoir of an accidental activist, a powerfully vivid story of a young Muslim woman who stood up to a kingdom of men—and won. Writing on the cusp of history, Manal offers a rare glimpse into the lives of women in Saudi Arabia today. Her memoir is a remarkable celebration of resilience in the face of tyranny, the extraordinary power of education and female solidarity, and the difficulties, absurdities, and joys of making your voice heard.</description>

  <description>The Overlords appeared suddenly over every city--intellectually, technologically, and militarily superior to humankind. Benevolent, they made few demands: unify earth, eliminate poverty, and end war. With little rebellion, humankind agreed, and a golden age began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at what cost? With the advent of peace, man ceases to strive for creative greatness, and a malaise settles over the human race. To those who resist, it becomes evident that the Overlords have an agenda of their own. As civilization approaches the crossroads, will the Overlords spell the end for humankind . . . or the beginning?</description>

      <![CDATA[I think Neil Gaiman talked me into reading this book. I ordered it for my husband after finding out he’d never read it but that it was considered a sci-fi classic. Then decided to just see if I’d like it. I did! What a great introduction for me to Clarke who has earned such well-deserved supersta...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Southern fare with a Mexican flair, by the chef/co-owner of the restaurant empire that &lt;i&gt;Bon Appétit&lt;/i&gt; called a “Top American Restaurant”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;called Taqueria del Sol “a runaway success.” &lt;i&gt;Bon Appétit&lt;/i&gt; wrote: “Move over, Chipotle!” The fast-casual food of Eddie Hernandez, the James Beard-nominated chef/co-owner of the restaurant, lands on the commonalities of Southern and Mexican food, with dishes like Memphis barbecue pork tacos, chicken pot pie served in a “bowl” of a puffed tortilla, turnip greens in “pot likker” spiked with chiles, or the “Eddie Palmer,” sweet tea with a jab of tequila. Eddie never hesitates to break with purists to make food taste better, adding sugar to creamy grits to balance the jalapeños, or substituting tomatillos in fried green tomatoes for a more delicate texture. Throughout, “Eddie’s Way” sidebars show how to make each dish even more special.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Four centuries ago, a Muslim woman ruled an empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to hunting, she was a master shot. As a dress designer, few could compare. An ingenious architect, she innovated the use of marble in her parents’ mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna River that inspired her stepson’s Taj Mahal. And she was both celebrated and reviled for her political acumen and diplomatic skill, which rivaled those of her female counterparts in Europe and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1611, thirty-four-year-old Nur Jahan, daughter of a Persian noble and widow of a subversive official, became the twentieth and most cherished wife of the Emperor Jahangir. While other wives were secluded behind walls, Nur ruled the vast Mughal Empire alongside her husband, and governed in his stead as his health failed and his attentions wandered from matters of state. An astute politician and devoted partner, Nur led troops into battle to free Jahangir when he was imprisoned by one of his own officers. She signed and issued imperial orders, and coins of the realm bore her name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acclaimed historian Ruby Lal uncovers the rich life and world of Nur Jahan, rescuing this dazzling figure from patriarchal and Orientalist clichés of romance and intrigue, and giving new insight into the lives of women and girls in the Mughal Empire, even where scholars claim there are no sources. Nur’s confident assertion of authority and talent is revelatory. In &lt;em&gt;Empress&lt;/em&gt;, she finally receives her due in a deeply researched and evocative biography that awakens us to a fascinating history.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />I’ll be thinking of Nur Jahan for a very long time. How could the twentieth wife of a Mughal Emperor rise to such power? Even this book does not explain it. It mostly sets about to prove it- the most pressing task of a feminist historian claiming a woman held ultimate power in an Islamic regime....]]>

  <description>A haunting memoir of teaching English to the sons of North Korea's ruling class during the last six months of Kim Jong-il's reign&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, three times a day, the students march in two straight lines, singing praises to Kim Jong-il and North Korea: Without you, there is no motherland. Without you, there is no us. It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has accepted a job teaching English. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them to write, all under the watchful eye of the regime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. She is mystified by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them, everything in North Korea is the best, the tallest, the most delicious, the envy of all nations. Still, she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm, their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the weeks pass, she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing glimpses into their lives, from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins. Then Kim Jong-il dies, leaving the students devastated, and leading Suki to question whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without You, There Is No Us offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the world's most unknowable country, and at the privileged young men she calls "soldiers and slaves."</description>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author of The Interestings, comes an electric novel not just about who we want to be with, but who we want to be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To be admired by someone we admire—we all yearn for this: the private, electrifying pleasure of being singled out by someone of esteem. But sometimes it can also mean entry to a new kind of life, a bigger world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greer Kadetsky is a shy college freshman when she meets the woman she hopes will change her life. Faith Frank, dazzlingly persuasive and elegant at sixty-three, has been a central pillar of the women’s movement for decades, a figure who inspires others to influence the world. Upon hearing Faith speak for the first time, Greer—madly in love with her boyfriend, Cory, but still full of longing for an ambition that she can’t quite place—feels her inner world light up. And then, astonishingly, Faith invites Greer to make something out of that sense of purpose, leading Greer down the most exciting path of her life as it winds toward and away from her meant-to-be love story with Cory and the future she’d always imagined.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charming and wise, knowing and witty, Meg Wolitzer delivers a novel about power and influence, ego and loyalty, womanhood and ambition. At its heart,&lt;i&gt; The Female Persuasion&lt;/i&gt; is about the flame we all believe is flickering inside of us, waiting to be seen and fanned by the right person at the right time. It’s a story about the people who guide and the people who follow (and how those roles evolve over time), and the desire within all of us to be pulled into the light.</description>

  <description>From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa See, “one of those special writers capable of delivering both poetry and plot” (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;), a moving novel about tradition, tea farming, and the bonds between mothers and daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their remote mountain village, Li-yan and her family align their lives around the seasons and the farming of tea. For the Akha people, ensconced in ritual and routine, life goes on as it has for generations—until a stranger appears at the village gate in a jeep, the first automobile any of the villagers has ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The stranger’s arrival marks the first entrance of the modern world in the lives of the Akha people. Slowly, Li-yan, one of the few educated girls on her mountain, begins to reject the customs that shaped her early life. When she has a baby out of wedlock—conceived with a man her parents consider a poor choice—she rejects the tradition that would compel her to give the child over to be killed, and instead leaves her, wrapped in a blanket with a tea cake tucked in its folds, near an orphanage in a nearby city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As Li-yan comes into herself, leaving her insular village for an education, a business, and city life, her daughter, Haley, is raised in California by loving adoptive parents. Despite her privileged childhood, Haley wonders about her origins. Across the ocean Li-yan longs for her lost daughter. Over the course of years, each searches for meaning in the study of Pu’er, the tea that has shaped their family’s destiny for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful story about circumstances, culture, and distance, &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane&lt;/i&gt; paints an unforgettable portrait of a little known region and its people and celebrates the bond of family.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who says you can't run away from your problems?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are a failed novelist about to turn fifty. A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can't say yes--it would be too awkward--and you can't say no--it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;QUESTION&lt;/b&gt;: How do you arrange to skip town?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ANSWER&lt;/b&gt;: You accept them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What would possibly go wrong?&lt;/i&gt; Arthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: he will turn fifty. Through it all, there is his first love. And there is his last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings and mistakes, LESS is, above all, a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author The New York Times has hailed as "inspired, lyrical," "elegiac," "ingenious," as well as "too sappy by half," LESS shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From a powerful new voice on racial justice, an eye-opening account of growing up Black, Christian, and female in middle-class white America. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin Channing Brown's first encounter with a racialized America came at age 7, when she discovered her parents named her Austin to deceive future employers into thinking she was a white man. Growing up in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches, Austin writes, "I had to learn what it means to love blackness," a journey that led to a lifetime spent navigating America's racial divide as a writer, speaker and expert who helps organizations practice genuine inclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a time when nearly all institutions (schools, churches, universities, businesses) claim to value "diversity" in their mission statements, &lt;i&gt;I'm Still Here&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful account of how and why our actions so often fall short of our words. Austin writes in breathtaking detail about her journey to self-worth and the pitfalls that kill our attempts at racial justice, in stories that bear witness to the complexity of America's social fabric--from Black Cleveland neighborhoods to private schools in the middle-class suburbs, from prison walls to the boardrooms at majority-white organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For readers who have engaged with America's legacy on race through the writing of Ta-Nehisi Coates and Michael Eric Dyson, &lt;i&gt;I'm Still Here&lt;/i&gt; is an illuminating look at how white, middle-class, Evangelicalism has participated in an era of rising racial hostility, inviting the reader to confront apathy, recognize God's ongoing work in the world, and discover how blackness--if we let it--can save us all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A wry, cutting deconstruction of the Communist empire by one of Eastern Europe's exceptional authors. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Called "a perceptive and amusing social critic, with a wonderful eye for detail" by &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, Slavenka Drakulic-a native of Croatia-has emerged as one of the most popular and respected critics of Communism to come out of the former Eastern Bloc. In &lt;i&gt;A Guided Tour Through the Museum of Communism&lt;/i&gt;, she offers a eight-part exploration of Communism by way of an unusual cast of narrators, each from a different country, who reflect on the fall of Communism. Together they constitute an Orwellian send-up of absurdities during the final years of European Communism that showcase this author's tremendous talent.</description>

  <description>Two young girls sneak onto the grounds of a hospital, where they find a disturbing moment of silence in a rose garden. A couple grows a plant that blooms underground, invisibly, to their long-time neighbor's consternation. A cat worries about its sleepwalking owner, who receives a mysterious visitor while he's asleep. After a ten-year absence, a young man visits his uncle, on the twenty-fourth floor of a high-rise that is floating in the air, while his ugly cousin hesitates on the stairs . . .&lt;p&gt; Can Xue is a master of the dreamscape, crafting stories that inhabit the space where fantasy and reality, time and timelessness, the quotidian and the extraordinary, meet. The stories in this striking and lyrical new collection-- populated by old married couples, children, cats, and nosy neighbors, the entire menagerie of the everyday-- reaffirm Can Xue's reputation as one of the most innovative Chinese writers in a generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this remarkably nuanced novel, both a gripping detective story and a passionate, devastating tale of eros and insanity in Colombia, internationally acclaimed author Laura Restrepo delves into the minds of four characters. There's Agustina, a beautiful woman from an upper-class family who is caught in the throes of madness; her husband Aguilar, a man passionately in love with his wife and determined to rescue her from insanity; Agustina's former lover Midas, a drug-trafficker and money-launderer; and Nicolás, Agustina's grandfather. Through the blend of these distinct voices, Restrepo creates a searing portrait of a society battered by war and corruption, as well as an intimate look at the daily lives of people struggling to stay sane in an unstable reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Kweku Sai is dead. A renowned surgeon and failed husband, he succumbs suddenly at dawn outside his home in suburban Accra. The news of Kweku’s death sends a ripple around the world, bringing together the family he abandoned years before. &lt;i&gt;Ghana Must Go&lt;/i&gt; is their story. Electric, exhilarating, beautifully crafted, Ghana Must Go is a testament to the transformative power of unconditional love, from a debut novelist of extraordinary talent.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving with great elegance through time and place, &lt;i&gt;Ghana Must Go &lt;/i&gt;charts the Sais’ circuitous journey to one another. In the wake of Kweku’s death, his children gather in Ghana at their enigmatic mother’s new home. The eldest son and his wife; the mysterious, beautiful twins; the baby sister, now a young woman: each carries secrets of his own. What is revealed in their coming together is the story of how they came apart: the hearts broken, the lies told, the crimes committed in the name of love. Splintered, alone, each navigates his pain, believing that what has been lost can never be recovered—until, in Ghana, a new way forward, a new family, begins to emerge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ghana Must Go &lt;/i&gt;is at once a portrait of a modern family, and an exploration of the importance of where we come from to who we are. In a sweeping narrative that takes us from Accra to Lagos to London to New York, &lt;i&gt;Ghana Must Go&lt;/i&gt; teaches that the truths we speak can heal the wounds we hide.</description>

  <description>The first edition of &lt;i&gt;Becoming a Literacy Leader&lt;/i&gt; chronicled Jennifer’s work as she moved to a new school and a new job as a literacy specialist and found herself tackling everything from teacher study groups to state-mandated assessment plans.&lt;br /&gt; The new edition of her book is a thoughtful, reflective evolution of her work as she rethinks how her identity and role as a literacy leader have evolved in the ten years since she wrote the first edition. She focuses on three ideas to describe her work: the concept of layered leadership, shared experiences in making meaning together, and the importance of rowing in the same direction as a school community.&lt;br /&gt; Jennifer firmly believes that teachers know what they need when it comes to professional development, and she describes the layers of support that coaches can implement within a school, including in-class support, curriculum support and assessment, study group facilitation, and the cultivation of teacher leadership. She provides an explicit framework for implementing these layers of coaching and explains how administrators can use the literacy leader position to build and sustain change within their schools.&lt;br /&gt; Literacy leaders and coaches can use this book as a road map for how to approach their work with purpose and intention. Online videos that accompany the book bring the text alive by showing readers what coaching looks and sounds like.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller that is a must-read for any parent!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Beth Kobliner, the author of the bestselling personal finance bible &lt;i&gt;Get a Financial Life&lt;/i&gt;—a new, must-have guide showing parents how to teach their children (from toddlers to young adults) to manage money in a smart way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us think we can have the “money talk” when our kids are old enough to get it…which won’t be for years, right? But get this: Research shows that even preschoolers can understand basic money concepts, and a study from Cambridge University confirmed that basic money habits are formed by the age of seven. Oh, and research shows the number one influence on kids’ financial behaviors is mom and dad. Clearly, we can’t afford to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make Your Kid a Money Genius (Even If You’re Not)&lt;/i&gt; is a jargon-free, step-by-step guide to help parents of all income levels teach their kids—from ages three to twenty-three—about money. It turns out the key to raising a money genius isn’t to teach that four quarters equal a dollar or how to pick a stock. Instead, it’s about instilling values that have been proven to make people successful—not just financially, but in life: delaying gratification, working hard, living within your means, getting a good education, and acting generously toward others. More specifically, you’ll learn why allowance isn’t the Holy Grail when teaching your kid to handle money, and why after-school jobs aren’t always the answer either. You’ll discover the right age to give your kid a credit card, and learn why doling out a wad of cash can actually be a good parenting move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don’t need to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a money genius to make your kid a money genius. Regardless of your comfort level with finance—or your family’s income—this charming and fun book is an essential guide for passing along enduring financial principles, making your kids wise beyond their years—and peers—when it comes to money.</description>

  <description>James T. Costa takes readers on a journey from Darwin’s childhood through his voyage on the HMS &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; where his ideas on evolution began. We then follow Darwin to Down House, his bustling home of forty years, where he kept porcupine quills at his desk to dissect barnacles, maintained a flock of sixteen pigeon breeds in the dovecote, and cultivated climbing plants in the study, and to Bournemouth, where on one memorable family vacation he fed carnivorous plants in the soup dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using his garden and greenhouse, the surrounding meadows and woodlands, and even taking over the cellar, study, and hallways of his home-turned-field-station, Darwin tested ideas of his landmark theory of evolution with an astonishing array of hands-on experiments that could be done on the fly, without specialized equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He engaged naturalists, friends, neighbors, family servants, and even his children, nieces, nephews, and cousins as assistants in these experiments, which involved everything from chasing bees and tempting fish to eat seeds to serenading earthworms. From the experiments’ results, he plumbed the laws of nature and evidence for the revolutionary arguments of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; and his other watershed works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Darwin at work, we accompany him against the backdrop of his enduring marriage, chronic illness, grief at the loss of three children, and joy in scientific revelation. This unique glimpse of Darwin’s life introduces us to an enthusiastic correspondent, crowd-sourcer, family man, and, most of all, an incorrigible observer and experimenter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes directions for eighteen hands-on experiments, for home, school, yard, or garden.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;McSweeney’s&lt;/i&gt; began in 1998 as a literary journal, edited by Dave Eggers, that published only works rejected by other magazines. But after the first issue, the journal began to publish pieces primarily written with &lt;i&gt;McSweeney’s&lt;/i&gt; in mind. Since then, it has attracted works from some of the finest writers in the country, including Denis Johnson, William T. Vollmann, Rick Moody, Joyce Carol Oates, Heidi Julavits, Jonathan Lethem, Michael Chabon, Ben Marcus, Susan Straight, Roddy Doyle, T. C. Boyle, Steven Millhauser, Gabe Hudson, Robert Coover, Ann Beattie, and many others. Today, &lt;i&gt;McSweeney’s&lt;/i&gt; has grown to be one of the country’s best-read and most-widely circulated literary journals, with an expanding, loyal subscriber base and strong independent bookstore following. As a small publishing house, McSweeney’s is committed to finding new voices � Gabe Hudson, Paul Collins, Neal Pollack, J. T. Leroy, John Hodgman, Amy Fusselman, Salvador Plascencia, and Sean Wilsey are among those whose early work appeared in &lt;i&gt;McSweeney’s&lt;/i&gt; � and promoting the work of gifted but underappreciated writers, such as Lydia Davis and Stephen Dixon. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this intimate memoir of survival, a former captive of the Islamic State tells her harrowing and ultimately inspiring story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nadia Murad was born and raised in Kocho, a small village of farmers and shepherds in northern Iraq. A member of the Yazidi community, she and her brothers and sisters lived a quiet life. Nadia had dreams of becoming a history teacher or opening her own beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On August 15th, 2014, when Nadia was just twenty-one years old, this life ended. Islamic State militants massacred the people of her village, executing men who refused to convert to Islam and women too old to become sex slaves. Six of Nadia's brothers were killed, and her mother soon after, their bodies swept into mass graves. Nadia was taken to Mosul and forced, along with thousands of other Yazidi girls, into the ISIS slave trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadia would be held captive by several militants and repeatedly raped and beaten. Finally, she managed a narrow escape through the streets of Mosul, finding shelter in the home of a Sunni Muslim family whose eldest son risked his life to smuggle her to safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Nadia's story--as a witness to the Islamic State's brutality, a survivor of rape, a refugee, a Yazidi--has forced the world to pay attention to an ongoing genocide. It is a call to action, a testament to the human will to survive, and a love letter to a lost country, a fragile community, and a family torn apart by war.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The star of &lt;i&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jane the Virgin&lt;/i&gt; presents her personal story of the real plight of undocumented immigrants in this country.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane Guerrero, the television actress from the megahit &lt;i&gt;Orange is the New Black&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jane the Virgin&lt;/i&gt;, was just fourteen years old on the day her parents and brother were arrested and deported while she was at school. Born in the U.S., Guerrero was able to remain in the country and continue her education, depending on the kindness of family friends who took her in and helped her build a life and a successful acting career for herself, without the support system of her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Country We Love &lt;/i&gt;is a moving, heartbreaking story of one woman's extraordinary resilience in the face of the nightmarish struggles of undocumented residents in this country. There are over 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, many of whom have citizen children, whose lives here are just as precarious, and whose stories haven't been told. Written with Michelle Burford, this memoir is a tale of personal triumph that also casts a much-needed light on the fears that haunt the daily existence of families likes the author's and on a system that fails them over and over.</description>

  <description>From prizewinning Bangladeshi novelist Tahmima Anam comes her deeply moving second novel about the rise of Islamic radicalism in Bangladesh, seen through the intimate lens of a family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pankaj Mishra praised &lt;em&gt;A Golden Age&lt;/em&gt;, Tahmima Anam's debut novel, as a "startlingly accomplished and gripping novel that describes not only the tumult of a great historical event . . . but also the small but heroic struggles of individuals living in the shadow of revolution and war." In her new novel, &lt;em&gt;The Good Muslim&lt;/em&gt;, Anam again deftly weaves the personal and the political, evoking with great skill and urgency the lasting ravages of war and the competing loyalties of love and belief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dying days of a brutal civil war, Sohail Haque stumbles upon an abandoned building. Inside he finds a young woman whose story will haunt him for a lifetime to come. . . . Almost a decade later, Sohail's sister, Maya, returns home after a long absence to find her beloved brother transformed. While Maya has stuck to her revolutionary ideals, Sohail has shunned his old life to become a charismatic religious leader. And when Sohail decides to send his son to a madrasa, the conflict between brother and sister comes to a devastating climax. Set in Bangladesh at a time when religious fundamentalism is on the rise, &lt;em&gt;The Good Muslim&lt;/em&gt; is an epic story about faith, family, and the long shadow of war.</description>

I wish I had known the book was the 2nd in a trilogy. Though it stands on its own as a full story, the narrative does seem to assume the reade...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;-I can't really think of another writer who so consistently and bravely keeps thinking and talking and learning and trying to make the world better.- --Caitlin Moran&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart and provocative, witty and uncompromising, this collection of Laurie Penny's celebrated essays establishes her as one of the most important and vibrant feminist voices of our time. From the shock of Donald Trump's election and the victories of the far right to online harassment and the transgender rights movement, this darkly humorous collection is an unflinching look at the definitive issues of our age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny is lyrical and passionate in her desire to confront injustice; she writes at the raw edge of the zeitgeist at a time when it has never been more vital to challenge social norms. This revelatory, revolutionary collection will give readers hope and tools for change from a bitch who wants to get stuff done.</description>

  <description>From the winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature—and one of our most beloved writers—a new selection of her peerless short fiction, gathered from the collections of the last two decades, a companion volume to Selected Stories (1968-1994).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family Furnishings brings us twenty-four of Alice Munro’s most accomplished, most powerfully affecting stories, many of them set in the territory she has so brilliantly made her own: the small towns and flatlands of southwestern Ontario. Subtly honed with her hallmark precision, grace, and compassion, these stories illuminate the quotidian yet extraordinary particularity in the lives of men and women, parents and children, friends and lovers as they discover sex, fall in love, part, quarrel, suffer defeat, set off into the unknown, or find a way to be in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peopled with characters as real to us as we are to ourselves, Munro’s stories encompass the fullness of human experience—from the wild exhilaration of first love, in “Passion,” to the lengths a once-straying husband will go to make his wife happy as her memory fades, in “The Bear Came Over the Mountain.” Other stories suggest the punishing consequences of leaving home (“Runaway”) or leaving a marriage (“The Children Stay”). The part romantic love plays in one’s existence is explored in “Too Much Happiness,” based on the life of the noted nineteenth-century mathematician, Sophia Kovalevsky. And in stories that Munro has described as “closer to the truth than usual”—“Dear Life,” “Working for a Living,” and “Home” among them—we glimpse the author’s own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Nobel Prize presentation speech says in part: “Reading one of Alice Munro’s texts is like watching a cat walk across a laid dinner table. A brief short story can often cover decades, summarizing a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in thirty pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in three hundred. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and the master of the contemporary short story.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An eye-opening collection of clandestine poems by Afghan women&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my love’s American,&lt;br /&gt;blisters blossom on my heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afghans revere poetry, particularly the high literary forms that derive from Persian or Arabic. But the poem above is a folk couplet—a &lt;i&gt;landay&lt;/i&gt;, an ancient oral and anonymous form created by and for mostly illiterate people: the more than 20 million Pashtun women who span the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. War, separation, homeland, love—these are the subjects of &lt;i&gt;landays&lt;/i&gt;, which are brutal and spare, can be remixed like rap, and are powerful in that they make no attempts to be literary. From Facebook to drone strikes to the songs of the ancient caravans that first brought these poems to Afghanistan thousands of years ago, &lt;i&gt;landays&lt;/i&gt; reflect contemporary Pashtun life and the impact of three decades of war. With the U.S. withdrawal in 2014 looming, these are the voices of protest most at risk of being lost when the Americans leave.&lt;br /&gt;     After learning the story of a teenage girl who was forbidden to write poems and set herself on fire in protest, the poet Eliza Griswold and the photographer Seamus Murphy journeyed to Afghanistan to learn about these women and to collect their &lt;i&gt;landays&lt;/i&gt;. The poems gathered in &lt;i&gt;I Am the Beggar of the World&lt;/i&gt; express a collective rage, a lament, a filthy joke, a love of homeland, an aching longing, a call to arms, all of which belie any facile image of a Pashtun woman as nothing but a mute ghost beneath a blue burqa.</description>

  <description>Ifemelu and Obinze are young and in love when they depart military-ruled Nigeria for the West. Beautiful, self-assured Ifemelu heads for America, where despite her academic success, she is forced to grapple with what it means to be black for the first time. Quiet, thoughtful Obinze had hoped to join her, but with post-9/11 America closed to him, he instead plunges into a dangerous, undocumented life in London. Fifteen years later, they reunite in a newly democratic Nigeria, and reignite their passion—for each other and for their homeland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: chimamanda.com</description>

  <description>From the former Secretary of State and bestselling author -- a sweeping look at the global struggle for democracy and why America must continue to support the cause of human freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union to the ongoing struggle for human rights in the Middle East, Condoleezza Rice has served on the front lines of history. As a child, she was an eyewitness to a third awakening of freedom, when her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, became the epicenter of the civil rights movement for black Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Rice explains what these epochal events teach us about democracy. At a time when people around the world are wondering whether democracy is in decline, Rice shares insights from her experiences as a policymaker, scholar, and citizen, in order to put democracy's challenges into perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the United States was founded, it was the only attempt at self-government in the world. Today more than half of all countries qualify as democracies, and in the long run that number will continue to grow. Yet nothing worthwhile ever comes easily. Using America's long struggle as a template, Rice draws lessons for democracy around the world -- from Russia, Poland, and Ukraine, to Kenya, Colombia, and the Middle East. She finds that no transitions to democracy are the same because every country starts in a different place. Pathways diverge and sometimes circle backward. Time frames for success vary dramatically, and countries often suffer false starts before getting it right. But, Rice argues, that does not mean they should not try. While the ideal conditions for democracy are well known in academia, they never exist in the real world. The question is not how to create perfect circumstances but how to move forward under difficult ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These same insights apply in overcoming the challenges faced by governments today. The pursuit of democracy is a continuing struggle shared by people around the world, whether they are opposing authoritarian regimes, establishing new democratic institutions, or reforming mature democracies to better live up to their ideals. The work of securing it is never finished.</description>

  <description>A dazzling new collection of short stories--the first major new work of fiction from the beloved, internationally acclaimed, Haruki Murakami since his #1 best-selling Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across seven tales, Haruki Murakami brings his powers of observation to bear on the lives of men who, in their own ways, find themselves alone. Here are vanishing cats and smoky bars, lonely hearts and mysterious women, baseball and the Beatles, woven together to tell stories that speak to us all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marked by the same wry humor that has defined his entire body of work, in this collection Murakami has crafted another contemporary classic.</description>

  <description>An inquisitive observer, thoughtful commentator, and assiduous craftsman, Neil Gaiman has long been celebrated for the sharp intellect and startling imagination that informs his bestselling fiction. Now, The View from the Cheap Seats brings together for the first time ever more than sixty pieces of his outstanding nonfiction. Analytical yet playful, erudite yet accessible, this cornucopia explores a broad range of interests and topics, including (but not limited to): authors past and present; music; storytelling; comics; bookshops; travel; fairy tales; America; inspiration; libraries; ghosts; and the title piece, at turns touching and self-deprecating, which recounts the author’s experiences at the 2010 Academy Awards in Hollywood.</description>

  <description>For Kylene Beers, the question of what to do when kids can't read surfaced abruptly in 1979 when she began teaching. That year, she discovered that some of the students in her seventh-grade language arts classes could pronounce all the words, but couldn't make any sense of the text. Others couldn't even pronounce the words. And that was the year she met a boy named George.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George couldn't read. When George's parents asked her to explain what their son's reading difficulties were and what she was going to do to help, Kylene, a secondary certified English teacher with no background in reading, realized she had little to offer the parents, even less to offer their son. That defining moment sent her on a twenty-three-year search for answers to that original question: how do we help middle and high schoolers who can't read?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in her critical and practical text "When Kids Can't Read - What Teachers Can Do: A Guide for Teachers 6-12," Kylene shares what she has learned and shows teachers how to help struggling readers with comprehension vocabulary fluency word recognition motivation Here, Kylene offers teachers the comprehensive handbook they've needed to help readers improve their skills, their attitudes, and their confidence. Filled with student transcripts, detailed strategies, reproducible material, and extensive booklists, this much-anticipated guide to teaching reading both instructs and inspires.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Prize&lt;/i&gt; recounts the panoramic history of oil -- and the struggle for wealth and power that has always surrounded oil. This struggle has shaken the world economy, dictated the outcome of wars, and transformed the destiny of men and nations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Prize&lt;/i&gt; is as much a history of the twentieth century as of the oil industry itself. The canvas of history is enormous -- from the drilling of the first well in Pennsylvania through two great world wars to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Operation Desert Storm.</description>

  <description>In her comic, scathing essay “Men Explain Things to Me,” Rebecca Solnit took on what often goes wrong in conversations between men and women. She wrote about men who wrongly assume they know things and wrongly assume women don’t, about why this arises, and how this aspect of the gender wars works, airing some of her own hilariously awful encounters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She ends on a serious note— because the ultimate problem is the silencing of women who have something to say, including those saying things like, “He’s trying to kill me!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book features that now-classic essay with six perfect complements, including an examination of the writer Virginia Woolf ’s embrace of mystery, of not knowing, of doubt and ambiguity, a highly original inquiry into marriage equality, and a terrifying survey of the scope of contemporary violence against women.</description>

  <description>The stunning popularity of the "New Atheist" movement--whose most famous spokesmen include Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and the late Christopher Hitchens--speaks to both the growing ranks of atheists as well as their vehement disdain for religion. In &lt;i&gt;Faitheist&lt;/i&gt;, Chris Stedman challenges the orthodoxies of this movement and makes a passionate argument that atheists should learn to respect religious identity while remaining secular. Stedman draws on his work organizing interfaith and secular communities, his academic study of religion, and his experiences as a former born-again Christian who struggled with his homosexuality and became, for a time, a New Atheist--until he saw its shortcomings. As someone who has stood on both sides of the divide, Stedman is uniquely positioned to present a way for atheists and the religious to find common ground.</description>

  <description>Filled with wry logic and a magical, unpredictable musicality, Kay Ryan's poems continue to generate excitement with their frequent appearances in The New Yorker and other leading periodicals. Say Uncle, Ryan's fifth collection, is filled with the same hidden connections, the same slyness and almost gleeful detachment that has delighted readers of her earlier books. Compact, searching, and oddly beautiful, these poems, in the words of Dana Gioia, "take the shape of an idea clarifying itself." "A poetry collection that marries wit and wisdom more brilliantly than any I know.... Poetry as statement and aphorism is rarely heartbreaking, but reading these poems I find myself continually ambushed by a fundamental sorrow, one that hides behind a surface that interweaves sound and sense in immaculately interesting ways." -- Jane Hirshfield, Common Boundary; "The first thing you notice about her poems is an elbow-to-the-ribs playfulness." -- Patricia Holt, San Francisco Chronicle.</description>

  <description>Kay Ryan—"a classic American poet" (John Freeman)—is acclaimed for her highly intelligible, deeply insightful poems. &lt;i&gt;Erratic Facts&lt;/i&gt; is her first new collection since the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;The Best of It&lt;/i&gt;, and it is animated with her signature swift, lucid, lyrical style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once witty and melancholy, playful and heartfelt, Ryan examines enormous subjects—existence, consciousness, love, loss—in compact poems that have immensely powerful resonance. Sly rhymes and strong cadences lend remarkable musicality to her incisive wisdom. While these pieces are composed of the same brevity and vitality that has characterized her singular voice over the course of more than 20 years, her mind is sharper than ever, her imagination more eccentric and daring. &lt;i&gt;Erratic Facts&lt;/i&gt; solidifies Ryan’s place at the pinnacle of American poetry, and proves that she will remain among the leading innovators in literary history.</description>

  <description>Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.</description>

  <description>The images and stories captured in &lt;i&gt;The Human Face of Big Data&lt;/i&gt; are the result of an extraordinary artistic, technical, and logistical juggling act aimed at capturing the human face of the Big Data Revolution. Big Data is defined as the real time collection, analyses, and visualization of vast amounts of the information.  In the hands of Data Scientists this raw information is fueling a revolution which many people believe may have as big an impact on humanity going forward as the Internet has over the past two decades. Its enable us to sense, measure, and understand aspects of our existence in ways never before possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Human Face of Big Data&lt;/i&gt; captures, in glorious photographs and moving essays, an extraordinary revolution sweeping, almost invisibly, through business, academia, government, healthcare, and everyday life. It's already enabling us to provide a healthier life for our children. To provide our seniors with independence while keeping them safe. To help us conserve precious resources like water and energy. To alert us to tiny changes in our health, weeks or years before we develop a life-threatening illness. To peer into our own individual genetic makeup. To create new forms of life.  And soon, as many predict, to re-engineer our own species. And we've barely scratched the surface . . . Over the past decade, Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt, co-founders of Against All Odds Productions, have produced a series of ambitious global projects in collaboration with hundreds of the world's leading photographers, writers, and graphic designers. Their &lt;i&gt;Day in the Life&lt;/i&gt; projects were credited for creating a mass market for large-format illustrated books (rare was the coffee table book without one).  Today their projects aim at sparking global conversations about emerging topics ranging from the Internet (&lt;i&gt;24 Hours in Cyberspace&lt;/i&gt;), to Microprocessors (&lt;i&gt;One Digital Day&lt;/i&gt;), to how the human race is learning to heal itself, (&lt;i&gt;The Power to Heal&lt;/i&gt;) to the global water crisis (&lt;i&gt;Blue Planet Run&lt;/i&gt;). This year Smolan and Erwitt dispatched photographers and writers in every corner of the globe to explore the world of “Big Data” and to determine if it truly does, as many in the field claim, represent a brand new toolset for humanity, helping address the biggest challenges facing our species. The book features 10 essays by noted writers:Introduction: OCEANS OF DATA by Dan Gardner&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 1: REFLECTIONS IN A DIGITAL MIRROR by Juan Enriquez, CEO, Biotechnomomy&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 2: OUR DATA OURSELVES by Kate Green, the Economist&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 3: QUANTIFYING MYSELF by AJ Jacobs, Esquire&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 4: DARK DATA by Marc Goodman, Future Crime Institute&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 5:  THE SENTIENT SENSOR MESH by Susan Karlin, Fast Company&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 6: TAKING THE PULSE OF THE PLANET by Esther Dyson, EDventure&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 7: CITIZEN SCIENCE by Gareth Cook, the Boston Globe&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 8: A DEMOGRAPH OF ONE by Michael Malone, Forbes magazine&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 9: THE ART OF DATA by Aaron Koblin, Google Artist in Residence&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 10: DATA DRIVEN by Jonathan Harris, Cowbird The book will also feature stunning info graphics from NIGEL HOLMES.1) GOOGLING GOOGLE: all the ways Google uses Data to help humanity&lt;br /&gt;2) DATA IS THE NEW OIL&lt;br /&gt;3) THE WORLD ACCORDING TO TWITTER&lt;br /&gt;4) AUCTIONING EYEBALLS: The world of Internet advertising&lt;br /&gt;5) FACEBOOK: A Billion Friends</description>

  <description>Sometime about 30,000 years ago, somebody stuck a sharp rock into a split stick—and presto! The axe was born. Our inquisitive species just loves tinkering, testing, and pushing the limits, and this delightfully different book is a freewheeling reference to hundreds of customs, notions, and inventions that reflect human ingenuity throughout history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From hand tools to holidays to weapons to washing machines, &lt;i&gt;An Uncommon History of Common Things&lt;/i&gt; features hundreds of colorful illustrations, timelines, sidebars, and more as it explores just about every subject under the sun. Who knew that indoor plumbing has been around for 4,600 years, but punctuation, capital letters, and the handy spaces between written words only date back to the Dark Ages? Or that ancient soldiers baked a kind of pizza on their shields—when they weren’t busy flying kites to frighten their foes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every page of this quirky compendium catalogs something fascinating, surprising, or serendipitous. A lively, incomparably browsable read for history buffs, pop culture lovers, and anyone who relishes the odd and extraordinary details hidden in the everyday, it will inform, amuse, astonish—and alter the way you think about the clever creatures we call humans.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A revolutionary reappraisal of how to educate our children and young people by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Element&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Finding Your Element&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Ken Robinson is one of the world’s most influential voices in education, and his 2006 TED Talk on the subject is the most viewed in the organization’s history. Now, the internationally recognized leader on creativity and human potential focuses on one of the most critical issues of our time: how to transform the nation’s troubled educational system. At a time when standardized testing businesses are raking in huge profits, when many schools are struggling, and students and educators everywhere are suffering under the strain, Robinson points the way forward. He argues for an end to our outmoded industrial educational system and proposes a highly personalized, organic approach that draws on today’s unprecedented technological and professional resources to engage all students, develop their love of learning, and enable them to face the real challenges of the twenty-first century. Filled with anecdotes, observations and recommendations from professionals on the front line of transformative education, case histories, and groundbreaking research—and written with Robinson’s trademark wit and engaging style—&lt;i&gt;Creative Schools&lt;/i&gt; will inspire teachers, parents, and policy makers alike to rethink the real nature and purpose of education.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>New York City, 1976. Meet Regan and William Hamilton-Sweeney, estranged heirs to one of the city's great fortunes; Keith and Mercer, the men who, for better or worse, love them; Charlie and Samantha, two suburban teenagers seduced by downtown's punk scene; an obsessive magazine reporter, Richard, and his idealistic neighbor, Jenny, - and the detective trying to figure out what any of them have to do with a shooting in Central Park on New Year's Eve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mystery, as it reverberates through families, friendships, and the corridors of power, will open up even the loneliest-seeming corners of the crowded city. And when the blackout of July 13, 1977, plunges this world into darkness, each of these lives with be changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;City on Fire&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable novel about love and betrayal and forgiveness, about art and truth and rock 'n' roll, about what people need from each other in order to live... and about what makes the living worth doing in the first place.</description>

  <description>“Like his literary ancestor Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut’s crankiness is good-humored and sharp-witted.”&lt;br /&gt;—A.O. Scott in The New York Times Book Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Master storyteller and satirist Kurt Vonnegut was one of the most in-demand commencement speakers of his time. For each occasion, Vonnegut's words were unfailingly unique, insightful, and witty, and they stayed with audience members long after graduation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This expanded second edition includes more than sixty pages of further thoughts from Kurt (whose good advice wasn’t limited to graduation speeches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As edited by Dan Wakefield, this book reads like a narrative in the unique voice that made Vonnegut a hero to readers of all ages. At times hilarious, razor-sharp, freewheeling, and deeply serious, these reflections are ideal for anyone undergoing what Vonnegut would call their “long-delayed puberty ceremony”—marking the passage from student to full-time adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book makes the perfect gift for people on the precipice of change/growth—from high school students to college graduates—or for anyone who will appreciate Vonnegut’s playful, profound wisdom.</description>

  <description>Don't take this personally*, but assholes seem to be everywhere lately, and we need a rigorous theory to account for and deal with them. In the spirit of the mega-selling On Bullshit, philosopher Aaron James has done just that, providing us all** (in Aristotelian terms) with some much-needed catharsis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Unless you happen to be Donald Trump or Kanye West or Dick Cheney, in which case you may take it personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Unless you are a real asshole yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Poet's Guide to Poetry&lt;/i&gt; brings Mary Kinzie's expertise as poet, critic, and director of the creative writing program at Northwestern University to bear in a comprehensive reference work for any writer wishing to better understand poetry. Detailing the formal concepts of poetry and methods of poetic analysis, she shows how the craft of writing can guide the art of reading poems. Using examples from the major traditions of lyric and meditative poetry in English from the medieval period to the present, Kinzie considers the sounds and rhythms of poetry along with the ideas and thought-units within poems. Kinzie shares her own successful classroom tactics—encouraging readers to approach a poem as if it were provisional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three parts of &lt;i&gt;A Poet's Guide to Poetry&lt;/i&gt; lead the reader through a carefully planned introduction to the ways we understand poetry. The first section provides careful, step-by-step instruction to familiarize students with the formal elements of poems, from the most obvious feature through the most devious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part I presents the style, grammar, and rhetoric of poems with a wealth of examples from various literary periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part II discusses the way the elements of a poem are controlled in time through a careful explanation and exploration of meter and rhythm. The "four freedoms" of free verse are also examined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part III closes the book with helpful practicum chapters on writing in form. Included here are writing exercises for beginning as well as advanced writers, a dictionary of poetic terms replete with poetry examples, and an annotated bibliography for further explanatory reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This useful handbook is an ideal reference for literature and writing students as well as practicing poets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;We in the west share a common narrative of world history. But our story largely omits a whole civilization whose citizens shared an entirely different narrative for a thousand years.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Destiny Disrupted&lt;/i&gt;, Tamim Ansary tells the rich story of world history as the Islamic world saw it, from the time of Mohammed to the fall of the Ottoman Empire and beyond. He clarifies why our civilizations grew up oblivious to each other, what happened when they intersected, and how the Islamic world was affected by its slow recognition that Europe-a place it long perceived as primitive and disorganized-had somehow hijacked destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>A dazzling new anthology of 180 contemporary poems, selected and introduced by America’s Poet Laureate, Billy Collins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by Billy Collins’s poem-a-day program with the Library of Congress, Poetry 180 is the perfect anthology for readers who appreciate engaging, thoughtful poems that are an immediate pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 180-degree turn implies a turning back—in this case, to poetry. A collection of 180 poems by the most exciting poets at work today, Poetry 180 represents the richness and diversity of the form, and is designed to beckon readers with a selection of poems that are impossible not to love at first glance. Open the anthology to any page and discover a new poem to cherish, or savor all the poems, one at a time, to feel the full measure of contemporary poetry’s vibrance and abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With poems by Catherine Bowman, Lucille Clifton, Billy Collins, Dana Gioia, Edward Hirsch, Galway Kinnell, Kenneth Koch, Philip Levine, Thomas Lux, William Matthews, Frances Mayes, Paul Muldoon, Naomi Shihab Nye, Sharon Olds, Katha Pollitt, Mary Jo Salter, Charles Simic, David Wojahn, Paul Zimmer, and many more.</description>

  <description>Since his first recordings in 1955, Johnny Cash has been an icon in the music world. In his newly discovered poems and song lyrics, we see the world through his eyes. The poetry reveals his depth of understanding, both of the world around him and within - his frailties and his strengths alike. He pens verses in his hallmark voice, reflecting upon love, pain, freedom, fame and mortality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illustrated with facsimile reproductions of Cash's own handwritten pages, Forever Words is a remarkable new addition to the canon of one of America's heroes. His music is a part of our collective history, but here he demonstrates the depth of his talent as a writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited and with an introduction by Paul Muldoon, as well as a preface by John Carter Cash, this is a book sure to delight and surprise fans the world over.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All the beauty of modern physics in fewer than a hundred pages.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a book about the joy of discovery. A playful, entertaining, and mind-bending introduction to modern physics, it's already a major bestseller in Italy and the United Kingdom. Carlo Rovelli offers surprising—and surprisingly easy to grasp—explanations of general relativity, quantum mechanics, elementary particles, gravity, black holes, the complex architecture of the universe, and the role humans play in this weird and wonderful world. He takes us to the frontiers of our knowledge: to the most minute reaches of the fabric of space, back to the origins of the cosmos, and into the workings of our minds. “Here, on the edge of what we know, in contact with the ocean of the unknown, shines the mystery and the beauty of the world,” Rovelli writes. “And it’s breathtaking.”</description>

  <description>E.E. Cummings is without question one of the major poets of this century, and this volume, first published in 1959, is indispensable for every lover of modern lyrical verse. It contains one hundred of Cummings’s wittiest and most profound poems, harvested from thirty-five of the most radically creative years in contemporary American poetry. These poems exhibit all the extraordinary lyricism, playfulness, technical ingenuity, and compassion for which Cummings is famous. They demonstrate beautifully his extrapolations from traditional poetic structures and his departures from them, as well as the unique synthesis of lavish imagery and acute artistic precision that has won him the adulation and respect of critics and poetry lovers everywhere.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump has a plan to make America great again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Obama has been a disaster for this country. He's wrecked our economy, saddled our children with debt, and gone around the world &lt;i&gt;apologizing&lt;/i&gt; for America--as if the greatest nation in the world needed to apologize for being the land of opportunity and freedom that we were before Obama became president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, America looks like a broken country--stripped of jobs, stripped of wealth, stripped of respect. And what does President Obama do about it? He plays nice with the very same foreign governments who are eager to watch America burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can't go on. And if Donald J. Trump has anything to say about it, it won't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his blockbuster book, &lt;i&gt;Time to Get Tough&lt;/i&gt;, Trump has the answers America has been looking for, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to &lt;b&gt;finally&lt;/b&gt; secure our border and fix our immigration overflow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to create American jobs by forcing Communist China into truly fair trade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to retire our debt without endangering long-established programs--like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--that millions of Americans depend on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to undo the fraud of Obamanomics and the disaster of Obamacare&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blunt, straightforward, and honest, it's all trademark Trump, setting out a common sense agenda to restore American prosperity and make our nation respected once again.</description>

  <description>For a reader unaccustomed to reading poetry, or who has fallen away from the custom, this collection offers an inviting way into the art, or back into it. For readers devoted to poetry, it offers illuminating examples of the infinitely various ways a poem reaches a reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both the book and the videos on the accompanying DVD, poems by Sappho, Shakespeare, Keats, Whitman, and Dickinson as well as contemporary poets are introduced by people from across the United States—a construction worker, a Supreme Court justice, a glassblower, a marine—each of whom speaks about his or her connection to the poem. Their comments are variously poignant, funny, heartening, tart, penetrating, and eccentric, showing some of the ways poetry is alive for American readers. An &lt;em&gt;Invitation to Poetry&lt;/em&gt; will inspire a fresh experience of poetry's pleasure and insight.</description>

  <description>This epic work tells the story of the Hemingses, whose close blood ties to our third president had been systematically expunged from American history until very recently. Now, historian and legal scholar Annette Gordon-Reed traces the Hemings family from its origins in Virginia in the 1700s to the family’s dispersal after Jefferson’s death in 1826.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mid-1700s the English captain of a trading ship that made runs between England and the Virginia colony fathered a child by an enslaved woman living near Williamsburg. The woman, whose name is unknown and who is believed to have been born in Africa, was owned by the Eppeses, a prominent Virginia family. The captain, whose surname was Hemings, and the woman had a daughter. They named her Elizabeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins &lt;em&gt;The Hemingses of Monticello&lt;/em&gt;, Annette Gordon-Reed’s “riveting history” of the Hemings family, whose story comes to vivid life in this brilliantly researched and deeply moving work. Gordon-Reed, author of the highly acclaimed historiography &lt;em&gt;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy&lt;/em&gt;, unearths startling new information about the Hemingses, Jefferson, and his white family. Although the book presents the most detailed and richly drawn portrait ever written of Sarah Hemings, better known by her nickname Sally, who bore seven children by Jefferson over the course of their thirty-eight-year liaison, &lt;em&gt;The Hemingses of Monticello&lt;/em&gt; tells more than the story of her life with Jefferson and their children. The Hemingses as a whole take their rightful place in the narrative of the family’s extraordinary engagement with one of history’s most important figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do we meet Elizabeth Hemings—the family matriarch and mother to twelve children, six by John Wayles, a poor English immigrant who rose to great wealth in the Virginia colony—but we follow the Hemings family as they become the property of Jefferson through his marriage to Martha Wayles. The Hemings-Wayles children, siblings to Martha, played pivotal roles in the life at Jefferson’s estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We follow the Hemingses to Paris, where James Hemings trained as a chef in one of the most prestigious kitchens in France and where Sally arrived as a fourteen-year-old chaperone for Jefferson’s daughter Polly; to Philadelphia, where James Hemings acted as the major domo to the newly appointed secretary of state; to Charlottesville, where Mary Hemings lived with her partner, a prosperous white merchant who left her and their children a home and property; to Richmond, where Robert Hemings engineered a plan for his freedom; and finally to Monticello, that iconic home on the mountain, from where most of Jefferson’s slaves, many of them Hemings family members, were sold at auction six months after his death in 1826.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Hemingses of Monticello&lt;/em&gt; makes vividly clear, Monticello can no longer be known only as the home of a remarkable American leader, the author of the Declaration of Independence; nor can the story of the Hemingses, whose close blood ties to our third president have been expunged from history until very recently, be left out of the telling of America’s story. With its empathetic and insightful consideration of human beings acting in almost unimaginably difficult and complicated family circumstances, &lt;em&gt;The Hemingses of Monticello&lt;/em&gt; is history as great literature. It is a remarkable achievement.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gorgeously unique, fully illustrated exploration into the phenomenology of reading-how we visualize images from reading works of literature, from one of our very best book jacket designers, himself a passionate reader. A VINTAGE ORIGINAL.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do we see when we read? Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collection of fragmented images on a page - a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so - and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved - or reviled - literary figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this remarkable work of nonfiction, Knopf's Associate Art Director Peter Mendelsund combines his profession, as an award-winning designer; his first career, as a classically trained pianist; and his first love, literature - he thinks of himself first, and foremost, as a reader - into what is sure to be one of the most provocative and unusual investigations into how we understand the act of reading.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington forever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.</description>

  <description>Thomas Jefferson is often portrayed as a hopelessly enigmatic figure—a riddle—a man so riven with contradictions that he is almost impossible to know. Lauded as the most articulate voice of American freedom and equality, even as he held people—including his own family—in bondage, Jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite, an atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of limited government who expected all Americans to be farmers forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Annette Gordon-Reed teams up with America's leading Jefferson scholar, Peter S. Onuf, to present an absorbing and revealing character study that dispels the many clichés that have accrued over the years about our third president. Challenging the widely prevalent belief that Jefferson remains so opaque as to be unknowable, the authors—through their careful analysis, painstaking research, and vivid prose—create a portrait of Jefferson, as he might have painted himself, one "comprised of equal parts sun and shadow" (Jane Kamensky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracing Jefferson's philosophical development from youth to old age, the authors explore what they call the "empire" of Jefferson's imagination—an expansive state of mind born of his origins in a slave society, his intellectual influences, and the vaulting ambition that propelled him into public life as a modern avatar of the Enlightenment who, at the same time, likened himself to a figure of old—"the most blessed of the patriarchs." Indeed, Jefferson saw himself as a "patriarch," not just to his country and mountain-like home at Monticello but also to his family, the white half that he loved so publicly, as well as to the black side that he claimed to love, a contradiction of extraordinary historical magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divided into three sections, &lt;em&gt;"Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"&lt;/em&gt; reveals a striking personal dimension to his life. Part I, "Patriarch," explores Jeffersons's origins in Virgina; Part II, " 'Traveller,' " covers his five-year sojourn to Paris; and Part III, "Enthusiast," delves insightfully into the Virginian's views on Christianity, slavery, and race. We see not just his ideas and vision of America but come to know him in an almost familial way, such as through the importance of music in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"&lt;/em&gt; fundamentally challenges much of what we’ve come to accept about Jefferson, neither hypocrite nor saint, atheist nor fundamentalist. Gordon-Reed and Onuf, through a close reading of Jefferson’s own words, reintroduce us all to our most influential founding father: a man more gifted than most, but complicated in just the ways we all are.</description>

  <description>You can't spell truth without Ruth.&lt;br /&gt;Only Ruth Bader Ginsburg can judge me.&lt;br /&gt;The Ruth will set you free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg never asked for fame she was just trying to make the world a little better and a little freer. But along the way, the feminist pioneer's searing dissents and steely strength have inspired millions. Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, created by the young lawyer who began the Internet sensation and an award-winning journalist, takes you behind the myth for an intimate, irreverent look at the justice's life and work. As America struggles with the unfinished business of gender equality and civil rights, Ginsburg stays fierce. And if you don't know, now you know.</description>

  <description>On a hazy November afternoon in Rangoon, 1862, a shrouded corpse was escorted by a small group of British soldiers to an anonymous grave in a prison enclosure. As the British Commissioner in charge insisted, “No vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bahadur Shah Zafar II, the last Mughal Emperor, was a mystic, an accomplished poet and a skilled calligrapher. But while his Mughal ancestors had controlled most of India, the aged Zafar was king in name only. Deprived of real political power by the East India Company, he nevertheless succeeded in creating a court of great brilliance, and presided over one of the great cultural renaissances of Indian history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, in 1857, Zafar gave his blessing to a rebellion among the Company’s own Indian troops, thereby transforming an army mutiny into the largest uprising any empire had to face in the entire course of the nineteenth century. The Siege of Delhi was the Raj’s Stalingrad: one of the most horrific events in the history of Empire, in which thousands on both sides died. And when the British took the city—securing their hold on the subcontinent for the next ninety years—tens of thousands more Indians were executed, including all but two of Zafar’s sixteen sons. By the end of the four-month siege, Delhi was reduced to a battered, empty ruin, and Zafar was sentenced to exile in Burma. There he died, the last Mughal ruler in a line that stretched back to the sixteenth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning historian and travel writer William Dalrymple shapes his powerful retelling of this fateful course of events from groundbreaking material: previously unexamined Urdu and Persian manuscripts that include Indian eyewitness accounts and records of the Delhi courts, police and administration during the siege. &lt;i&gt;The Last Mughal&lt;/i&gt; is a revelatory work—the first to present the Indian perspective on the fall of Delhi—and has as its heart both the dazzling capital personified by Zafar and the stories of the individuals tragically caught up in one of the bloodiest upheavals in history.</description>

  <description>Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell.</description>

  <description>In the highly anticipated &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt;, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt; will transform the way you think about thinking.</description>

  <description>Selling is really about people skills - to be successful in sales, you must be able to cooperate, have good listening skills, and be willing to put others' needs before your own. With selling skills in your arsenal, you'll be happier in a lot of areas of your life, not just in your career (although that will certainly benefit too). But this guide is not only for traditional salespeople who want career enhancement. It's for all people, because everybody can use selling skills to change or improve their lives. This book is for you if&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're beginning a sales career, or just looking to brush up your skills. You're unemployed and want a job, or you're employed and want a promotion. You're a teen wanting to impress adults, or an adult wanting to succeed at negotiation. You're a teacher searching for better ways to get through to your students, or a parent wanting to communicate more effectively with your children. You've got an idea that can help others, or you want to improve your personal relationships. &lt;i&gt;Selling For Dummies&lt;/i&gt; is divided into sections so you can easily turn to the part that interests you most. You'll find out how to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Define what sales is and what it isn't. Prepare for a sale - everything from knowing your clients to knowing your products - to set you apart from average persuaders and help you hear more &lt;i&gt;yeses&lt;/i&gt; in your life. Say the right words - and avoid the wrong ones - in each stage of the selling process. Separate yourself from the average salesperson by staying in touch with your clients. Cope with rejection, a natural part of life, no matter how skilled you become. Whether you're starting out in sales or have been at it since the beginning of time, this guide offers great information to keep you upbeat and moving forward, allowing you to treat selling with the same joy as you treat your hobbies and pastimes.</description>

  <description>Through elegiac verse that honors her mother and tells of her own fraught childhood, Natasha Trethewey confronts the racial legacy of her native Deep South -- where one of the first black regiments, the Louisiana Native Guards, was called into service during the Civil War. Trethewey's resonant and beguiling collection is a haunting conversation between personal experience and national history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Joby Warrick reveals how the strain of militant Islam now raising its banner across Iraq and Syria spread from a remote Jordanian prison with the unwitting aid of American military intervention.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     When he succeeded his father in 1999, King Abdullah of Jordan released a batch of political prisoners in the hopes of smoothing his transition to power. Little did he know that among those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East.&lt;br /&gt;     Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike.&lt;br /&gt;     But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping, ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate. &lt;br /&gt;     Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It is April 1975, and Saigon is in chaos. At his villa, a general of the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights out of the country. The general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles, unaware that one among their number, the captain, is secretly observing and reporting on the group to a higher-up in the Viet Cong. &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; is the story of this captain: a man brought up by an absent French father and a poor Vietnamese mother, a man who went to university in America, but returned to Vietnam to fight for the Communist cause. A gripping spy novel, an astute exploration of extreme politics, and a moving love story, &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; explores a life between two worlds and examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the wars we fight today.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;from "Ozone Journal"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Bach’s cantata in B-flat minor in the cassette,&lt;br /&gt; we lounged under the greenhouse-sky, the UVBs hacking&lt;br /&gt; at the acids and oxides and then I could hear the difference&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; between an oboe and a bassoon&lt;br /&gt; at the river’s edge under cover—&lt;br /&gt; trees breathed in our respiration;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; there was something on the other side of the river,&lt;br /&gt; something both of us were itching toward—&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; radical bonds were broken, history became science.&lt;br /&gt; We were never the same.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The title poem of Peter Balakian's &lt;i&gt;Ozone Journal&lt;/i&gt; is a sequence of fifty-four short sections, each a poem in itself, recounting the speaker's memory of excavating the bones of Armenian genocide victims in the Syrian desert with a crew of television journalists in 2009. These memories spark others—the dissolution of his marriage, his life as a young single parent in Manhattan in the nineties, visits and conversations with a cousin dying of AIDS—creating a montage that has the feel of history as lived experience. Bookending this sequence are shorter lyrics that span times and locations, from Nairobi to the Native American villages of New Mexico. In the dynamic, sensual language of these poems, we are reminded that the history of atrocity, trauma, and forgetting is both global and ancient; but we are reminded, too, of the beauty and richness of culture and the resilience of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first volume of New and Selected poetry in twelve years from the two-time Poet Laureate of the United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aimless Love gives the reader an opportunity to assess the rich scope of Collins' gifts. Containing more than fifty new poems and a generous gathering from his collections of the past decade-Horoscopes for the Dead, Ballistics, The Trouble with Poetry, and Nine Horses-Aimless Love showcases the best of his poetic maneuvers: the everyday ends in the infinite, playfulness is paired with empathy, irony gives way to wonder. Possessed of a unique voice that is at once plain and melodic, Billy Collins has managed to enrich American poetry while greatly widening the circle of its audience.</description>

  <description>The Cage-Busting Teacher adopts the logic of Cage-Busting Leadership and applies it to the unique challenges and opportunities of classroom teachers. Detailed, accessible, and thoroughly engaging, it uncovers the many ways in which teachers can break out of familiar constraints in order to influence school and classroom practice, education policy, and school reform. "Cage-busting is concrete, precise, and practical," writes Frederick M. Hess. This invaluable book helps teachers understand why and how to revisit their assumptions and enables them to have greater impacts upon their schools and beyond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on interviews with hundreds of teachers, teacher advocates, union leaders, and others, Hess identifies the challenges teachers face, seeks concrete and workable solutions, and offers recommendations to put those solutions in place. A uniquely practical and inspiring book, The Cage-Busting Teacher is for educators who want to shape the schools and systems in which they work.</description>

  <description>David Abram draws on sources as diverse as the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Balinese shamanism, Apache storytelling, and his own experience as an accomplished sleight-of-hand magician to reveal the subtle dependence of human cognition on the natural environment. He explores the character of perception and excavates the sensual foundations of language, which--even at its most abstract--echoes the calls and cries of the earth. On every page of this lyrical work, Abram weaves his arguments with passion and intellectual daring.&lt;br /&gt;"Long awaited, revolutionary...This book ponders the violent disconnection of the body from the natural world and what this means about how we live and die in it."--Los Angeles Times</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A thought-provoking and wide-ranging exploration of machine learning and the race to build computer intelligences as flexible as our own&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world's top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything we want, before we even ask. In &lt;i&gt;The Master Algorithm&lt;/i&gt;, Pedro Domingos lifts the veil to give us a peek inside the learning machines that power Google, Amazon, and your smartphone. He assembles a blueprint for the future universal learner--the Master Algorithm--and discusses what it will mean for business, science, and society. If data-ism is today's philosophy, this book is its bible.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER • Includes two new essays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY MICHIKO KAKUTANI, &lt;i&gt;THE NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;• &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY &lt;i&gt;BUZZFEED, THE GLOBE AND MAIL, &lt;/i&gt;AND&lt;i&gt; LIBRARY JOURNAL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For readers of Nora Ephron, Tina Fey, and David Sedaris, this hilarious, wise, and fiercely candid collection of personal essays establishes Lena Dunham—the acclaimed creator, producer, and star of HBO’s &lt;i&gt;Girls&lt;/i&gt;—as one of the most original young talents writing today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl,&lt;/i&gt; Dunham illuminates the experiences that are part of making one’s way in the world: falling in love, feeling alone, being ten pounds overweight despite eating only health food, having to prove yourself in a room full of men twice your age, finding true love, and most of all, having the guts to believe that your story is one that deserves to be told.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Take My Virginity (No Really, Take It)” is the account of Dunham’s first time, and how her expectations of sex didn’t quite live up to the actual event (“No floodgate had been opened, no vault of true womanhood unlocked”); “Girls &amp;amp; Jerks” explores her former attraction to less-than-nice guys—guys who had perfected the “dynamic of disrespect” she found so intriguing; “Is This Even Real?” is a meditation on her lifelong obsession with death and dying—what she calls her “genetically predestined morbidity.” And in “I Didn’t F*** Them, but They Yelled at Me,” she imagines the tell-all she will write when she is eighty and past caring, able to reflect honestly on the sexism and condescension she has encountered in Hollywood, where women are “treated like the paper thingies that protect glasses in hotel bathrooms—necessary but infinitely disposable.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Exuberant, moving, and keenly observed, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt; is a series of dispatches from the frontlines of the struggle that is growing up. “I’m already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you,” Dunham writes. “But if I can take what I’ve learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine will have been worthwhile.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The gifted Ms. Dunham not only writes with observant precision, but also brings a measure of perspective, nostalgia and an older person’s sort of wisdom to her portrait of her (not all that much) younger self and her world. . . . As acute and heartfelt as it is funny.”&lt;b&gt;—Michiko Kakutani, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “It’s not Lena Dunham’s candor that makes me gasp. Rather, it’s her writing—which is full of surprises where you least expect them. A fine, subversive book.”&lt;b&gt;—David Sedaris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “This book should be required reading for anyone who thinks they understand the experience of being a young woman in our culture. I thought I knew the author rather well, and I found many (not altogether welcome) surprises.”&lt;b&gt;—Carroll Dunham&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Witty, illuminating, maddening, bracingly bleak . . . [Dunham] is a genuine artist, and a disturber of the order.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>In a rising Saudi Arabian city, far from weary, recession-scarred America, a struggling businessman pursues a last-ditch attempt to stave off foreclosure, pay his daughter’s college tuition, and finally do something great. In &lt;i&gt;A Hologram for the King&lt;/i&gt;, Dave Eggers takes us around the world to show how one man fights to hold himself and his splintering family together in the face of the global economy’s gale-force winds. This taut, richly layered, and elegiac novel is a powerful evocation of our contemporary moment — and a moving story of how we got here.</description>

  <description>"There is nothing gutsier to me than a person announcing that their story is one that deserves to be told," writes Lena Dunham, and it certainly takes guts to share the stories that make up her first book, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt;. These are stories about getting your butt touched by your boss, about friendship and dieting (kind of) and having two existential crises before the age of 20. Stories about travel, both successful and less so, and about having the kind of sex where you feel like keeping your sneakers on in case you have to run away during the act. Stories about proving yourself to a room of 50-year-old men in Hollywood and showing up to "an outlandishly high-fashion event with the crustiest red nose you ever saw." Fearless, smart, and as heartbreakingly honest as ever, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt; establishes Lena Dunham as more than a hugely talented director, actress and producer-it announces her as a fresh and vibrant new literary voice.</description>

  <description>Naguib Mahfouz’s magnificent epic trilogy of colonial Egypt appears here in one volume for the first time. The Nobel Prize-winning writer's masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain's occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novels of &lt;i&gt;The Cairo Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. &lt;i&gt;Palace Walk&lt;/i&gt; introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons–the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad’s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in &lt;i&gt;Palace of Desire&lt;/i&gt;, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. &lt;i&gt;Sugar Street&lt;/i&gt; brings Mahfouz’s vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the trilogy, the family's trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries. Filled with compelling drama, earthy humor, and remarkable insight, &lt;i&gt;The Cairo Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; is the achievement of a master storyteller.</description>

  <description>The story of a violent, war-haunted, alcoholic father and a strong-willed, loving mother who struggled to protect her three sons from the effects of poverty and ignorance that had tainted her own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extraordinary gifts for evocation and insight and the stunning talent for storytelling that earned Rick Bragg a Pulitzer Prize for feature writing in 1996 are here brought to bear on the wrenching story of his own family's life. It is the story of a violent, war-haunted, alcoholic father and a strong-willed, loving mother who struggled to protect her three sons from the effects of poverty and ignorance that had tainted her own life. It is the story of the life Bragg was able to carve out for himself on the strength of his mother's encouragement and belief.</description>

  <description>Why did Gandhi hate iodine (I, 53)? Why did the Japanese kill Godzilla with missiles made of cadmium (Cd, 48)? How did radium (Ra, 88) nearly ruin Marie Curie's reputation? And why did tellurium (Te, 52) lead to the most bizarre gold rush in history?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The periodic table is one of our crowning scientific achievements, but it's also a treasure trove of passion, adventure, betrayal and obsession. The fascinating tales in &lt;i&gt;The Disappearing Spoon&lt;/i&gt; follow carbon, neon, silicon, gold and every single element on the table as they play out their parts in human history, finance, mythology, conflict, the arts, medicine and the lives of the (frequently) mad scientists who discovered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did a little lithium (Li, 3) help cure poet Robert Lowell of his madness? And how did gallium (Ga, 31) become the go-to element for laboratory pranksters? &lt;i&gt;The Disappearing Spoon&lt;/i&gt; has the answers, fusing science with the classic lore of invention, investigation, discovery and alchemy, from the big bang through to the end of time.</description>

  <description>An awe-inspiring, often hilarious, and unerringly honest story of one mother's exercise in extreme parenting, revealing the rewards—and the costs—of raising her children the Chinese way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This is a story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs. This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old." —Amy Chua&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All decent parents want to do what's best for their children. What &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt; reveals is that the Chinese just have a totally different idea of how to do that. Western parents try to respect their children's individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions and providing a nurturing environment. The Chinese believe that the best way to protect your children is by preparing them for the future and arming them with skills, strong work habits, and inner confidence. &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Chua's iron-willed decision to raise her daughters, Sophia and Lulu, her way—the Chinese way—and the remarkable results her choice inspires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things Amy Chua would never allow her daughters to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- have a playdate&lt;br /&gt;- be in a school play&lt;br /&gt;- complain about not being in a school play&lt;br /&gt;- not be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama&lt;br /&gt;- play any instrument other than the piano or violin&lt;br /&gt;- not play the piano or violin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is Lulu and Sophia would never have had time for a playdate. They were too busy practicing their instruments (two to three hours a day and double sessions on the weekend) and perfecting their Mandarin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course no one is perfect, including Chua herself. Witness this scene:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"According to Sophia, here are three things I actually said to her at the piano as I supervised her practicing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Oh my God, you're just getting worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;- I'm going to count to three, then I want musicality.&lt;br /&gt;- If the next time's not PERFECT, I'm going to take all your stuffed animals and burn them!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Chua demands as much of herself as she does of her daughters. And in her sacrifices—the exacting attention spent studying her daughters' performances, the office hours lost shuttling the girls to lessons—the depth of her love for her children becomes clear. &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt; is an eye-opening exploration of the differences in Eastern and Western parenting—and the lessons parents and children everywhere teach one another.</description>

  <description>In She Walks in Beauty, Caroline Kennedy has once again marshaled the gifts of our greatest poets to pay a very personal tribute to the human experience, this time to the complex and fascinating subject of womanhood. Inspired by her own reflections on more than fifty years of life as a young girl, a woman, a wife, and a mother, She Walks in Beauty draws on poetry's eloquent wisdom to ponder the many joys and challenges of being a woman. Kennedy has divided the collection into sections that signify to her the most notable milestones, passages, and universal experiences in a woman's life, and she begins each of these sections with an introduction in which she explores and celebrates the most important elements of life's journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collection includes works by Elizabeth Bishop, Sharon Olds, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mary Oliver, Pablo Neruda, W. H. Auden, Adrienne Rich, Sandra Cisneros, Anne Sexton, W. S. Merwin, Dorothy Parker, Queen Elizabeth I, Lucille Clifton, Naomi Shahib Nye, and W.&lt;br /&gt;B. Yeats. Whether it's falling in love, breaking up, friendship, marriage, motherhood, or growing old, She Walks in Beauty is a priceless resource for anyone, male or female, who wants a deeper understanding and appreciation of what it means to be a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She walks in beauty&lt;br /&gt;George Gordon, Lord Byron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I She walks in beauty, like the night&lt;br /&gt;Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet in her aspect and her eyes:&lt;br /&gt;Thus mellow'd to that tender light&lt;br /&gt;Which heaven to gaudy day denies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II One shade the more, one ray the less,&lt;br /&gt;Had half impair'd the nameless grace&lt;br /&gt;Which waves in every raven tress,&lt;br /&gt;Or softly lightens o'er her face;&lt;br /&gt;Where thoughts serenely sweet express&lt;br /&gt;How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;III And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,&lt;br /&gt;So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,&lt;br /&gt;The smiles that win, the tints that glow,&lt;br /&gt;But tell of days in goodness spent,&lt;br /&gt;A mind at peace with all below,&lt;br /&gt;A heart whose love is innocent!</description>

  <description>A fresh, seasonal take on vegetarian cooking—for the whole family. When David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl became a couple, they decided to make a concerted effort to cook truly healthy food in their home together. When their daughter came along, this became even more important. They knew they wanted to stick to vegetarian, but they also knew the food had to be delicious, enticing, and wholesome. In this book they share recipes for families that they have developed in the past four years. &lt;i&gt;Vegetarian Everyday&lt;/i&gt; is filled with innovative ideas for using nutritious whole ingredients in new ways. For instance, the authors use broccoli to create pesto, make a pie crust from ground almonds, and brighten up mushroom burgers with grilled peaches. Some of their most beloved recipes are Watermelon Gazpacho, Quinoa &amp;amp; Vegetable Chorizo Salad, Beet Bourginon, Zucchini Noodles with Marinated Mushrooms, and Frozen Strawberry Cheesecake. Because the recipes generally avoid dairy, refined flour, and sugar, this book provides plenty of inspired dishes for those with gluten and other allergies. Bursting with color and flavor, this is vegetarian cooking that the whole family can love.</description>

  <description>Most business books give you the same old advice: Write a business plan, study the competition, seek investors, yadda yadda. If you're looking for a book like that, put this one back on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rework &lt;/i&gt;shows you a better, faster, easier way to succeed in business. Read it and you'll know why plans are actually harmful, why you don't need outside investors, and why you're better off ignoring the competition. The truth is, you need less than you think. You don't need to be a workaholic. You don't need to staff up. You don't need to waste time on paperwork or meetings. You don't even need an office. Those are all just excuses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What you really need to do is stop talking and start working. This book shows you the way. You'll learn how to be more productive, how to get exposure without breaking the bank, and tons more counterintuitive ideas that will inspire and provoke you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, &lt;i&gt;Rework &lt;/i&gt;is the perfect playbook for anyone who’s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs they hate, victims of "downsizing," and artists who don’t want to starve anymore will all find valuable guidance in these pages.</description>

Competition is fierce, and only the most viable businesses--and expert fundraising--will reap the capital necessary to drive continuous growth. Packed with tools for building business plans, preparing loan proposals, drafting offering materials, and more, &lt;i&gt;Raising Capital&lt;/i&gt; covers every phase of the growth cycle and helps readers navigate the murky waters of capital formation. Containing checklists, charts, and sample forms, the third edition provides insights on the latest trends in the domestic and global capital markets, an overview of recent developments in federal and state securities laws, and strategies for borrowing money from commercial banks in today's credit-tightened markets. Whether one's business is a fledgling start-up, a rapid growth company, or a more established organization, this insider's guide offers readers the strategies they need to take their business to the next level.</description>

  <description>If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The real story of what it takes to risk it all and go for broke.&lt;/b&gt; Conventional wisdom says most startups need to be in Silicon Valley, started by young engineers around a sexy new idea, and backed by VC funding. But as Mikkel Svane reveals in &lt;i&gt;Startupland, &lt;/i&gt; the story of founding Zendesk was anything but conventional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founded in a Copenhagen loft by three thirty-something friends looking to break free from corporate doldrums, Zendesk Inc. is now one of the hottest enterprise software companies, still rapidly growing with customers in 150 countries. But its success was anything but predestined. With revealing stories both funny and frank, Mikkel shares how he and his friends bravely left secure jobs to start something on their own, how he almost went broke several times, how they picked up themselves and their families to travel across the world to California and the unknown, and how the three friends were miraculously still together for Zendesk's IPO and (still growing) success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like Zendesk's mission itself--to remove friction, barriers, and mystery in order to make customer service easier and more approachable--&lt;i&gt;Startupland&lt;/i&gt; removes some of the myths about startups and startup founders. Mikkel's advice, hard-won through experience, often bucks conventional wisdom and entrepreneurial tropes. He shares why failure (whether fast or slow) is awful, why a seemingly boring product or idea can be the most exciting, why giving back to the community is as important as the bottom line. From how to hire right (look for people who are not offended by swearing) to which personas generate the highest response rates, Mikkel answers the most pressing questions from the perspective of someone still in the trenches and willing to share the hard truth, warts and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are books by consultants who tell you how to build businesses, or by entrepreneurs now running billion-dollar businesses, there are few books from people still in the trenches who acutely remember the difficult daily decisions, the thrill (and fears) of the early days, the problems that scale with growing a business, and the reason why they all went on the adventure in the first place. &lt;i&gt;Startupland&lt;/i&gt; is indispensable reading for all entrepreneurs who want to make their ideas the next big thing. The book will inspire and empower you to follow your own dream and create your own story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?&lt;br /&gt;Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hooked&lt;/i&gt; is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. &lt;i&gt;Hooked&lt;/i&gt; is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyal provides readers with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.&lt;br /&gt;• Actionable steps for building products people love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25210408-all-the-light-we-cannot-see" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the stunningly beautiful instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featured on NPR's "Fresh Air" and "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" on PBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honored as one of the "Best Books of the Year" from &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In his personal anonymity, his strict individuated manner, his defense of the earth, and his heartache at time's passing, Merwin has become instantly recognizable on the page; he has made for himself that most difficult of creations, an accomplished style." —Helen Vendler, &lt;i&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Merwin is one of the great poets of our age.”—&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times Book&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[The Shadow of Sirius is] the very best of all Merwin: I have been reading William since 1952, and always with joy." —Harold Bloom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[Merwin's] best book in a decade—and one of the best outright... The poems... feel fresh and awake with a simplicity that can only be called wisdom." —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Merwin's gentle wisdom and attentiveness to the world are alive as ever. These deeply reflective meditations move through light and darkness, old love and turning seasons to probe the core of human existence." —&lt;i&gt;Orion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[The Shadow of Sirius] shows the earthly possibilities of simple completeness in a writer's mature work. More than an achievement in poetry, this is an achievement in writing." —&lt;i&gt;Harvard Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nuanced mysteries of light, darkness, presence, and memory are central themes in W.S. Merwin’s new book of poems. “I have only what I remember,” Merwin admits, and his memories are focused and profound—the distinct qualities of autumn light, a conversation with a boyhood teacher, well-cultivated loves, and “our long evenings and astonishment.” In “Photographer,” Merwin presents the scene where armloads of antique glass negatives are saved from a dumpcart by “someone who understood.” In “Empty Lot,” Merwin evokes a child lying in bed at night, listening to the muffled dynamite blasts of coal mining near his home, and we can’t help but ask: How shall we mine our lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;somewhere the Perseids are falling&lt;br /&gt;toward us already at a speed that would&lt;br /&gt;burn us alive if we could believe it&lt;br /&gt;but in the stillness after the rain ends&lt;br /&gt;nothing is to be heard but the drops falling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;W.S. Merwin&lt;/b&gt;, author of over fifty books, is America’s foremost poet. His last two books were honored with major literary awards: &lt;i&gt;Migration &lt;/i&gt;won the National Book Award, and &lt;i&gt;Present Company &lt;/i&gt;received the Bobbitt Prize from the Library of Congress.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (2010)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award (2009)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rae Armantrout has always organized her collections of poetry as though they were works in themselves. Versed brings two of these sequences together, offering readers an expanded view of the arc of her writing. The poems in the first section, Versed, play with vice and versa, the perversity of human consciousness. They flirt with error and delusion, skating on a thin ice that inevitably cracks: "Metaphor forms / a crust / beneath which / the crevasse of each experience." Dark Matter, the second section, alludes to more than the unseen substance thought to make up the majority of mass in the universe. The invisible and unknowable are confronted directly as Armantrout's experience with cancer marks these poems with a new austerity, shot through with her signature wit and stark unsentimental thinking. Together, the poems of Versed part us from our assumptions about reality, revealing the gaps and fissures in our emotional and linguistic constructs, showing us ourselves where we are most exposed.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You lie there kicking like a baby, waiting for God himself &lt;br /&gt;To lift you past the rungs of your crib. What &lt;br /&gt;Would your life say if it could talk? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                                           —from “No Fly Zone”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With allusions to David Bowie and interplanetary travel, &lt;i&gt;Life on Mars &lt;/i&gt;imagines a soundtrack for the universe to accompany the discoveries, failures, and oddities of human existence. In these new poems, Tracy K. Smith envisions a sci-fi future sucked clean of any real dangers, contemplates the dark matter that keeps people both close and distant, and revisits the kitschy concepts like “love” and “illness” now relegated to the Museum of Obsolescence. These poems reveal the realities of life lived here, on the ground, where a daughter is imprisoned in the basement by her own father, where celebrities and pop stars walk among us, and where the poet herself loses her father, one of the engineers who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope.</description>

  <description>          &lt;br /&gt;                       &lt;br /&gt; The path to success is rarely easy or direct, and good mentors are hard to find. In &lt;i&gt;Getting There&lt;/i&gt;, thirty leaders in diverse fields share their secrets to navigating the rocky road to the top. In an honest, direct, and engaging way, these role models describe the obstacles they faced, the setbacks they endured, and the vital lessons they learned. They dispense not only essential and practical career advice, but also priceless wisdom applicable to life in general. &lt;i&gt;Getting There&lt;/i&gt; is for everyone—from students contemplating their futures to the vast majority of us facing challenges or seeking to reach our potential.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stag’s Leap&lt;/i&gt; is stunningly poignant sequence of poems that tells the story of a divorce, embracing strands of love, sex, sorrow, memory, and new freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this wise and intimate telling—which carries us through the seasons when her marriage was ending—Sharon Olds opens her heart to the reader, sharing the feeling of invisibility that comes when we are no longer standing in love’s sight; the surprising physical bond that still exists between a couple during parting; the loss of everything from her husband’s smile to the set of his hip. Olds is naked before us, curious and brave and even generous toward the man who was her mate for thirty years and who now loves another woman. As she writes in the remarkable “Stag’s Leap,” “When anyone escapes, my heart / leaps up.  Even when it’s I who am escaped from, / I am half on the side of the leaver.” Olds’s propulsive poetic line and the magic of her imagery are as lively as ever, and there is a new range to the music—sometimes headlong, sometimes contemplative and deep. Her unsparing approach to both pain and love makes this one of the finest, most powerful books of poetry Olds has yet given us.</description>

  <description>Filled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, &lt;i&gt;Battle Cry of Freedom&lt;/i&gt; will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This "new birth of freedom," as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing "second American Revolution" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.</description>

  <description>Poetry's Ingredients: Mark Strand and Eavan Boland Explore Form&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explaining beauty is hard work. But distinguished poets Mark Strand and Eavan Boland have produced a clear, super-helpful book that unravels part of the mystery of great poems through an engaging exploration of poetic structure. Strand and Boland begin by promising to "look squarely at some of the headaches" of poetic form: the building blocks of poetry. &lt;i&gt;The Making of a Poem&lt;/i&gt; gradually cures many of those headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strand, who's won the Pulitzer Prize and a MacArthur Fellowship and has served as U.S. Poet Laureate, and Boland, an abundantly talented Irish poet who has also written a beautiful book of essays on writing and womanhood, are both accustomed to teaching. Strand, now at the University of Chicago, and Boland, a Stanford professor, draw upon decades in the classroom to anticipate most questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever wonder what a pantoum is? A villanelle? A sestina? With humor, patience, and personal anecdotes, Strand and Boland offer answers. But the &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; they answer is what makes this book stand out. The forms are divided into three overarching categories: metrical forms, shaping forms, and open forms. "Metrical forms" include the sonnet, pantoum, and heroic couplet. "Shaping forms" explains broader categories, like the elegy, ode, and pastoral poem. And "open forms" offers new takes on the traditional blueprints, exploring poems like Allen Ginsberg's "America."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each established form is then approached in three ways, followed by several pages of outstanding poems in that form. First, the editors offer a "page at a glance" guide, with five or six characteristics of that specific form presented in a brief outline. For example, the pantoum is defined like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   1) Each pantoum stanza must be four lines long.&lt;br /&gt;   2) The length is unspecified but the pantoum must begin and end with the &lt;br /&gt;same line.&lt;br /&gt;   3) The second and fourth lines of the first quatrain become the first and third line of the next, and so on with succeeding quatrains.&lt;br /&gt;   4) The rhyming of each quatrain is abab.&lt;br /&gt;   5) The final quatrain changes this pattern.&lt;br /&gt;   6) In the final quatrain the unrepeated first and third lines are used &lt;br /&gt;in reverse as second and fourth lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this outline, it's easy to identify the looping pantoum. In the second piece of the pantoum section, Strand and Boland include a "History of the Form" section, again condensed to one page. Here, we learn that the pantoum is "Malayan in origin and came into English, as so many other strict forms have, through France." Indeed, both Victor Hugo and Charles Baudelaire tried their hands at the pantoum. As always, Strand and Boland offer some comparison to the other forms, which helps explain why a poet might choose to write a pantoum over, say, a sonnet or a sestina:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Of all verse forms the pantoum is the slowest. The reader takes four steps forward, then two steps back. It is the perfect form for the evocation of a past time." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the editors include "The Contemporary Context," which introduces several of the pantoums of this century. Finally, in what may be the book's best feature, they provide a close-up of a pantoum, an approach they repeat for each form discussed. In this case, it's the "Pantoum of the Great Depression" by Donald Justice. The editors offer some biographical information on Justice, and then they map out how that specific poem gets its power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This "poet's explanation" of the workings of a poem is invaluable, especially when it comes from leading poets such as Stand and Boland. What's more, these remarks are transferable. Reading how Strand and Boland view a dozen poems transforms the way one reads. With any future poem, you can look for what Strand and Boland have found in the greats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The editors offer their readers a great start, with a list for further reading and a helpful glossary. If anything can get a person excited about poetry, this selection of poems can -- though the editors, as working poets, readily admit their choices are idiosyncratic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gems here include the best work of lesser-known poets, including several "poets' poets." For example, Edward Thomas, a prominent reviewer in his day and a close friend of Robert Frost's, is represented by "Rain," an absolutely brilliant blank-verse poem which begins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Rain, midnight rain, nothing but wild rain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Remembering again that I shall die&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      For washing me cleaner than I have been &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Since I was born into this solitude. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas's poem -- and other treasures here -- introduces readers to what and how poets read to learn to make poems. Of course, many of the usual suspects are found here, but the surprises are exciting, and even the old favorites seem new when the editors explain why and how a particular poem seems beautiful. This is particularly evident in their discussion of Edna St. Vincent Millay's rushing, initially breathless sonnet "What Lips My Lips Have Kissed, and Where, and How, " which reads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      I have forgotten, and what arms have lain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Under my head till morning, but the rain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Upon the glass and listen for reply, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      For unremembered lads that not again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Nor knows what birds have vanquished one by one,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      I cannot say what loves have come and gone, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      I only know that summer sang in me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      A little while, that in me sings no more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the "close-up" section, Strand and Boland offer an biographical paragraph that mentions that in 1923, Millay became the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize in Poetry. They then discuss Millay's "distinctive and unusual" approach to the sonnet form: "Instead of taking the more leisurely pace of the public sonnet that had been the 19th-century model, she drove her sonnets forward with a powerful lyric music and personal emphasis."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The editors point out Millay's heavy reliance on assonance and alliteration, and then note how she takes advantage of the different tempos the sonnet offers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Here she uses her distinctive music and high diction to produce an unusually quick-paced poem in the first octave and then a slower, more reflective septet where the abandoned lover becomes a winter tree. This ability of the sonnet, to accommodate both lyric and reflective time, made it a perfect vehicle for highly intuitive twentieth-century poets like Millay."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That simple explanation of the sonnet as a form able to "accommodate both lyric and reflective time" helps clarify most sonnets. But Strand and Boland are careful not to explain everything. The deepest beauty, as they explain in their introductory essays on their attraction to form, is built on mystery. And it is that attempt to understand the greatest mysteries that defines the greatest poems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, mystery often drives poets to write, as Strand explains in his essay on Archibald MacLeish's "You, Andrew Marvell," which Strand describes as the first poem he wished he had written himself in his early years as a poet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Although I no longer wish I had written 'You, Andrew Marvell,' I wish, however, that I could write something like it, something with its sweep, its sensuousness, its sad crepuscular beauty, something capable of carving out such a large psychic space for itself&amp;amp;. There is something about it that moves me in ways I don't quite understand, as it were communicating more than what it actually says. This is often the case with good poems -- they have a lyric identity that goes beyond whatever their subject happens to be."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this book, Strand and Boland help quantify the explicable parts of a "lyric identity." Understanding form, the editors believe, is one way to begin understanding a poem's beauty. This lucid, useful book is a wonderful guide to that mysterious music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Aviya Kushner&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jimmy Carter, thirty-ninth President, Nobel Peace Prize winner, international humanitarian, fisherman, reflects on his full and happy life with pride, humor, and a few second thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At ninety, Jimmy Carter reflects on his public and private life with a frankness that is disarming. He adds detail and emotion about his youth in rural Georgia that he described in his magnificent &lt;i&gt;An Hour Before Daylight&lt;/i&gt;. He writes about racism and the isolation of the Carters. He describes the brutality of the hazing regimen at Annapolis, and how he nearly lost his life twice serving on submarines and his amazing interview with Admiral Rickover. He describes the profound influence his mother had on him, and how he admired his father even though he didn't emulate him. He admits that he decided to quit the Navy and later enter politics without consulting his wife, Rosalynn, and how appalled he is in retrospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Full Life&lt;/i&gt;, Carter tells what he is proud of and what he might do differently. He discusses his regret at losing his re-election, but how he and Rosalynn pushed on and made a new life and second and third rewarding careers. He is frank about the presidents who have succeeded him, world leaders, and his passions for the causes he cares most about, particularly the condition of women and the deprived people of the developing world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wise and moving look back from this remarkable man. Jimmy Carter has lived one of our great American lives -- from rural obscurity to world fame, universal respect, and contentment. &lt;i&gt;A Full Life&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary read.</description>

  <description>Kay Ryan's recent appointment as the Library of Congress's sixteenth poet laureate is just the latest in an amazing array of accolades for this wonderfully accessible, widely loved poet. Salon has compared her poems to "Faberge eggs, tiny, ingenious devices that inevitably conceal some hidden wonder." The two hundred poems in Ryan's The Best of It offer a stunning retrospective of her work, as well as a swath of never-before-published poems of which are sure to appeal equally to longtime fans and general readers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited third poetry book by Vijay Seshadri, “one of the most respected poets working in America today” (&lt;i&gt;Time Out New York&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I had three&lt;br /&gt;apocalyptic visions, each more terrible than the last.&lt;br /&gt;The graves open, and the sea rises to kill us all.&lt;br /&gt;Then the doorbell rang, and I went downstairs and signed for two packages—&lt;br /&gt;            —from “This Morning”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vijay Seshadri’s new poetry is assured and expert, his line as canny as ever. In an array of poetic forms from the rhyming lyric to the philosophical meditation to the prose essay, &lt;i&gt;3 Sections&lt;/i&gt; confronts perplexing divisions of contemporary life—a wayward history, an indeterminate future, and a present condition of wanting to outthink time. This is an extraordinary book, witty and vivacious, by one of America’s best poets.</description>

  <description>From Epicurus to Sam Cook, the Daily News to Roots, Digest draws from the present and the past to form an intellectual, American identity. In poems that forge their own styles and strategies, we experience dialogues between the written word and other art forms. Within this dialogue we hear Ben Jonson, we meet police K-9s, and we find children negotiating a sense of the world through a father's eyes and through their own.</description>

  <description>The celebrated Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of America. With a breadth and depth matched by no other one-volume life, he carries the reader through Washington's troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French and Indian Wars, his creation of Mount Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presiding over the Constitutional Convention and his magnificent performance as America's first president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the reverence his name inspires Washington remains a waxwork to many readers, worthy but dull, a laconic man of remarkable self-control. But in this groundbreaking work Chernow revises forever the uninspiring stereotype. He portrays Washington as a strapping, celebrated horseman, elegant dancer and tireless hunter, who guarded his emotional life with intriguing ferocity. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, he orchestrated their actions to help realise his vision for the new federal government, define the separation of powers, and establish the office of the presidency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Chernow takes us on a page-turning journey through all the formative events of America's founding. This is a magisterial work from one of America's foremost writers and historians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Washington: A Life&lt;/i&gt; biographer Ron Chernow provides a richly nuanced portrait of the father of our nation. With a breadth &amp;amp; depth matched by no other one-volume life, this crisply paced narrative carries readers thru his troubled boyhood, his precocious feats in the French &amp;amp; Indian War, his creation of Mt Vernon, his heroic exploits with the Continental Army, his presiding over the Constitutional Convention &amp;amp; his performance as the 1st president. Despite the reverence his name inspires, Washington remains a lifeless waxwork for many, worthy but dull. A laconic man of granite self-control, he often arouses more respect than affection. This work, based on massive research, dashes the stereotype of a stolid, unemotional man. A strapping 6', Washington was a celebrated horseman, elegant dancer &amp;amp; tireless hunter, with a fiercely guarded emotional life. Chernow brings to vivid life a dashing, passionate man of fiery opinions &amp;amp; many moods. Probing his private life, he explores his fraught relationship with his crusty mother, his youthful infatuation with the married Sally Fairfax &amp;amp; his often conflicted feelings toward his adopted children &amp;amp; grandchildren. He also provides a portrait of his marriage to Martha &amp;amp; his complex behavior as a slave master. At the same time this is an astute portrait of a canny politician who knew how to inspire people. Not only did Washington gather around himself the foremost figures of the age, including Madison, Hamilton, Adams &amp;amp; Jefferson, but he also orchestrated their actions to shape the new federal government, define the separation of powers &amp;amp; establish the office of the presidency. This biography takes us on a page-turning journey thru the formative events of America's founding. With a dramatic sweep worthy of its subject, this is a magisterial work from an elegant storyteller.</description>

  <description>Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are you often busy but not productive?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the &lt;i&gt;Way of the Essentialist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting &lt;i&gt;only the right things&lt;/i&gt; done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a &lt;i&gt;systematic discipline&lt;/i&gt; for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything. A must-read for any leader, manager, or individual who wants to learn who to do less, but better, in every area of their lives, Essentialism  is a movement whose time has come.</description>

  <description>Many think of 1776 as the defining year of American history, when we became a nation devoted to the pursuit of happiness through self- government. In &lt;i&gt;Unfamiliar Fishes,&lt;/i&gt; Sarah Vowell argues that 1898 might be a year just as defining, when, in an orgy of imperialism, the United States annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded first Cuba, then the Philippines, becoming an international superpower practically overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the developments in these outposts of 1898, Vowell considers the Americanization of Hawaii the most intriguing. From the arrival of New England missionaries in 1820, their goal to Christianize the local heathen, to the coup d'état of the missionaries' sons in 1893, which overthrew the Hawaiian queen, the events leading up to American annexation feature a cast of beguiling, and often appealing or tragic, characters: whalers who fired cannons at the Bible-thumpers denying them their God-given right to whores, an incestuous princess pulled between her new god and her brother-husband, sugar barons, lepers, con men, Theodore Roosevelt, and the last Hawaiian queen, a songwriter whose sentimental ode "Aloha 'Oe" serenaded the first Hawaiian president of the United States during his 2009 inaugural parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her trademark smart-alecky insights and reporting, Vowell lights out to discover the off, emblematic, and exceptional history of the fiftieth state, and in so doing finds America, warts and all.</description>

  <description>The Pulitzer Prize–winning biography of Harry S. Truman, whose presidency included momentous events from the atomic bombing of Japan to the outbreak of the Cold War and the Korean War, told by America’s beloved and distinguished historian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters—Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson—and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man—a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined—but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman’s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman’s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary “man from Missouri” who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history.</description>

  <description>This work, based on FitzGerald's own research &amp;amp; travels, takes us inside Vietnam into the traditional, ancestor-worshiping villages &amp;amp; the corrupt crowded cities, into the conflicts between Communists &amp;amp; anti-Communists, Catholics &amp;amp; Buddhists, generals &amp;amp; monks &amp;amp; reveals the country as seen thru Vietnamese eyes. With a clear authority unrivaled by other books, Fire in the Lake shows how America tragically misinterpreted the realities of Vietnam. Fire in the Lake received the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs, an American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Letters award, a Nat'l Institute for Arts &amp;amp; Letters award, the Front Page Award, the Christopher Book Award, the Washington Monthly Political Book Award, the Sidney Hillman Award &amp;amp; the Bancroft Prize. Since initial publication, Fire in the Lake has achieved classic status. An essential text for students of Asian-American relations. FitzGerald's new writings on Vietnam appear, along with photos by Mary Cross, in Vietnam: Spirits of the Earth, published by Bulfinch in 11/2001.&lt;br /&gt;Note on the Title&lt;br /&gt;Preface&lt;br /&gt;Abbreviations&lt;br /&gt;1.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sailing Alone Around the Room&lt;/b&gt;, by America’s Poet Laureate, Billy Collins, contains both new poems and a generous gathering from his earlier collections &lt;b&gt;The Apple That Astonished Paris&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Questions About Angels&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;The Art of Drowning&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Picnic, Lightning&lt;/b&gt;. These poems show Collins at his best, performing the kinds of distinctive poetic maneuvers that have delighted and fascinated so many readers. They may begin in curiosity and end in grief; they may start with irony and end with lyric transformation; they may, and often do, begin with the everyday and end in the infinite. Possessed of a unique voice that is at once plain and melodic, Billy Collins has managed to enrich American poetry while greatly widening the circle of its audience.</description>

  <description>In her fourth volume of poetry, Twelve Moons, Pulitzer Prize-winning Mary Oliver continues to explore the alluring, yet well-nigh inaccessible kingdoms of nature and human relationships, and man's profound, persistent desire for a joyous union with them. these vibrant, magical poems pulse with an aching awareness of nature's unaffected beauty. Her absorbing intimate vision leads us into the natural and human kingdoms we only fleetingly grasp.</description>

  <description>Every day people tune in to &lt;i&gt;The Writer's Almanac&lt;/i&gt; on public radio and hear Garrison Keillor read them a poem. And here, for the first time, is an anthology of poems from the show, chosen by Keillor for their wit, their frankness, their passion, their "utter clarity in the face of everything else a person has to deal with at 7 a.m." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good Poems&lt;/i&gt; includes verse about lovers, children, failure, everyday life, death, and transcendance. It features the work of classic poets, such as Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Robert Frost, as well as the work of contemporary greats such as Howard Nemerov, Charles Bukowski, Donald Hall, Billy Collins, Robert Bly, and Sharon Olds. It's a book of poems for anybody who loves poetry whether they know it or not.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“When it comes to growing revenues, not all dollars are equal.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In company after company that Sanjay Khosla and Mohanbir Sawhney worked for or researched, they saw businesses taking on more products, more markets, more people, more acquisitions—adding more of everything except what really mattered: sustainable and profitable growth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And in many of these companies — large or small, from America to Europe to Asia — every quarter became a mad dash to find yet another short-term revenue boost. There had to be a better way — an alternative to the scramble for mindless expansion.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The answer lies in &lt;i&gt;Fewer, Bigger, Bolder,&lt;/i&gt; a market-proven, step-by-step program to achieve sustained growth with rising profits and lower costs. The authors prove that given the right incentives, managers using this program can produce astonishing results in amazingly short time frames.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That’s exactly what Khosla accomplished as President of Kraft’s developing markets, which enjoyed eye-popping revenue growth from $5 billion to $16 billion in just six years, while profitability increased 50%. Sawhney, a professor at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management, discovered a similar formula for stellar results when advising a portfolio of businesses, from Fortune 500 giants to technology start-ups.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No matter how big the company or how difficult the economic environment, managers who use this seven-step program (“Focus7”) will learn how to make fewer but bigger bets and to create a virtuous cycle of growth. &lt;i&gt;Fewer, Bigger, Bolder &lt;/i&gt;crosses the usual boundaries of strategy, execution, people and organization. Its framework shows how you can drive growth by targeting resources against priorities, simplifying your operations, and unleashing the potential of your people.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By challenging the conventional wisdom about growth, &lt;i&gt;Fewer, Bigger, Bolder &lt;/i&gt;is likely to ignite a vigorous debate throughout the business community.  It’s a game-changing book that couldn’t be more timely. Or more needed.</description>

  <description>To find the keys to greatness, Collins's 21-person research team read and coded 6,000 articles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Challenge&lt;br /&gt;Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Study&lt;br /&gt;For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Standards&lt;br /&gt;Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Comparisons&lt;br /&gt;The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Findings&lt;br /&gt;The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:&lt;br /&gt;Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.</description>

  <description>Sheryl Sandberg’s &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt; is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</description>

  <description>This is the first volume of distinguished historian Dumas Malone's Pulitzer Prize-winning six-volume work on the life and times of Thomas Jefferson. Based on vast sources, it covers Jefferson's ancestry, youth, education, and legal career; his marriage and the building of Monticello; the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the Notes on Virginia; his rich, fruitful legislative career; his highly controversial governorship; and his early services to the development of the West.</description>

  <description>E-Myth \ 'e-,'mith\ n 1: the entrepreneurial myth: the myth that most people who start small businesses are entrepreneurs 2: the fatal assumption that an individual who understands the technical work of a business can successfully run a business that does that technical work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voted #1 business book by &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; 500 CEOs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An instant classic, this revised and updated edition of the phenomenal bestseller dispels the myths about starting your own business. Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business—from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed—and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; your business and working &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The E-Myth Revisited&lt;/em&gt; will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.</description>

  <description>An exhilarating meditation on nature and its seasons—a personal narrative highlighting one year's exploration on foot in the author's own neighborhood in Tinker Creek, Virginia. In the summer, Dillard stalks muskrats in the creek and contemplates wave mechanics; in the fall she watches a monarch butterfly migration and dreams of Arctic caribou. She tries to con a coot; she collects pond water and examines it under a microscope. She unties a snake skin, witnesses a flood, and plays 'King of the Meadow' with a field of grasshoppers.</description>

  <description>In a masterly work, Garry Wills shows how Lincoln reached back to the Declaration of Independence to write the greatest speech in the nation’s history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation “a new birth of freedom” in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.</description>

  <description>Learn which steps to take at the right time to grow your small business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the deal: small businesses - including microbusinesses - have a lifecycle that's different than the lifecycles of other kinds of businesses. If you're a small business owner, you probably started your business because there was some particular product you wanted to build or service you wanted to provide and you've probably figured out that having a successful small business takes more than having a great product or great service. Growing a small business requires knowing which steps to take at the right time; if you take those steps out of order and you can waste a lot of time, money, and momentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are five stages to the small business lifecycle, each of which have different strengths, challenges, inconvenient truths, and ways forward. This guide shows you what each of those stages are and will show you where to focus your resources so you can grow your business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've been thinking about starting your own business, it'll help you figure where to start and get a foothold in a market. While there are some differences in starting an online business versus starting a traditional small businesses, both of them share the same business lifecycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you've been in business for a while, you'll have a better gauge to evaluate where you are and what you need to do next. If you're growing fast and want to keep growing, it'll show you how to do it strategically. If you're stuck and don't know what to do, it'll show you what you have to get in place to get unstuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some specific topics we'll cover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions to ask before you start your own small business&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to get a foothold in the market and why you should be marketing fewer things to fewer audiences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why some "successful" products and services will cause you to get stuck and lose momentum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where your small businesses might get stuck and what four things must be in place to get it going and growing again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How not to break a successful, scalable small business once you've got it there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this guide won't give you a specific business strategy, it'll show you what needs to be done so you can determine the right strategy for your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guide is succinct and very accessible; you don't need another longer, hard-to-understand business book. No prior business education or experience is required to understand it, though prior education and experience will give you a deeper understanding of the insights in this book. You've got a business to grow, and this book is written to get you realigned, focused, and gaining momentum.</description>

  <description>From Dave Eggers, best-selling author of The Circle, a tightly controlled, emotionally searching novel. Your Fathers, Where Are They? And the Prophets, Do They Live Forever? is the formally daring, brilliantly executed story of one man struggling to make sense of his country, seeking answers the only way he knows how.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a barracks on an abandoned military base, miles from the nearest road, Thomas watches as the man he has brought wakes up. Kev, a NASA astronaut, doesn't recognize his captor, though Thomas remembers him. Kev cries for help. He pulls at his chain. But the ocean is close by, and nobody can hear him over the waves and wind. Thomas apologizes. He didn't want to have to resort to this. But they really needed to have a conversation, and Kev didn't answer his messages. And now, if Kev can just stop yelling, Thomas has a few questions.</description>

  <description>With this bundle, collect all four editions of Keri Smith’s &lt;i&gt;Wreck This Journal&lt;/i&gt;, including the classic black, as well as three special limited edition covers: duct-tape, red mesh, and paper bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In these updated editions, &lt;i&gt;Wreck This Journal &lt;/i&gt;asks readers to muster up their best mistake and mess-making abilities and to fill the pages of the book (or destroy them). Through a series of creatively and quirkily illustrated prompts, acclaimed artist Keri Smith encourages journalers to engage in "destructive" acts--poking holes through pages, adding photos and defacing them, painting pages with coffee, coloring outside the lines, and more--in order to experience the true creative process. With Smith's unique sensibility, readers are introduced to a new way of art and journal making, discovering novel ways to escape the fear of the blank page and fully engage in the creative process..&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Goldfinch&lt;/i&gt; combines vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.</description>

  <description>Wonder Woman goes to hell! After playing Poseidon, Hades, and Hera against each other, Hades strikes back by kidnapping Zola and trapping her in the Underworld. It's up to Wonder Woman — with a little help from the God of Love and the God of Smiths — to break Zola out. But what is Hades' real game, and once you get into the land of the dead, how exactly do you get out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/i&gt; 7-12</description>

  <description>The most riveting political biography of our time, Robert A. Caro’s life of Lyndon B. Johnson, continues. &lt;b&gt;Master of the Senate&lt;/b&gt; takes Johnson’s story through one of its most remarkable periods: his twelve years, from 1949 through 1960, in the United States Senate. Once the most august and revered body in politics, by the time Johnson arrived the Senate had become a parody of itself and an obstacle that for decades had blocked desperately needed liberal legislation. Caro shows how Johnson’s brilliance, charm, and ruthlessness enabled him to become the youngest and most powerful Majority Leader in history and how he used his incomparable legislative genius--seducing both Northern liberals and Southern conservatives--to pass the first Civil Rights legislation since Reconstruction. Brilliantly weaving rich detail into a gripping narrative, Caro gives us both a galvanizing portrait of Johnson himself and a definitive and revelatory study of the workings of legislative power.</description>

  <description>Products, technologies, and workplaces change so quickly today that everyone is continually learning. Many of us are also teaching, even when it's not in our job descriptions. Whether it's giving a presentation, writing documentation, or creating a website or blog, we need and want to share our knowledge with other people. But if you've ever fallen asleep over a boring textbook, or fast-forwarded through a tedious e-learning exercise, you know that creating a great learning experience is harder than it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Design For How People Learn&lt;/i&gt;, you'll discover how to use the key principles behind learning, memory, and attention to create materials that enable your audience to both gain and retain the knowledge and skills you're sharing. Using accessible visual metaphors and concrete methods and examples, &lt;i&gt;Design For How People Learn&lt;/i&gt; will teach you how to leverage the fundamental concepts of instructional design both to improve your own learning and to engage your audience.</description>

  <description>Historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Barbara Tuchman has brought to life again the people and events that led up to World War I. With attention to fascinating detail, and an intense knowledge of her subject and its characters, Ms. Tuchman reveals, for the first time, just how the war started, why, and how it could have been stopped but wasn't. A classic historical survey of a time and a people we all need to know more about, THE GUNS OF AUGUST will not be forgotten.</description>

  <description>The autobiography every true American has been waiting for: a shockingly candid and raw confessional from a national treasure.&lt;br /&gt;From his humble beginnings in a desolate Iowa coal mining town, his years at Our Lady Queen of Chewbacca High School to his odds-defying climb to the dizzying heights of becoming America’s most trusted and beloved television News Anchor, Ron Burgundy pulls no punches in Let Me Off at the Top! &lt;br /&gt;In his very own words Burgundy reveals his most private thoughts, his triumphs and his disappointments. His life reads like an adventure story complete with knock down fights, beautiful women and double-fisted excitement on every page. He has hunted jackalopes with Bobby Kennedy and Peter Lawford, had more than his share of his amorous exploits, and formed the greatest on-air team in the history of televised news. Along the way, he hobnobbed with people you wish you knew and some you honestly wish you didn't -- celebrities, presidents, presidents' wives, celebrities' wives, dogs, and, of course Veronica Corningstone, the love of his life. Walter Cronkite, Barbra Streisand, Katie Couric, the list goes on. Who didn’t Mr. Burgundy, or “Ron” as he is known to his friends, rub elbows with in the course of his colorful and often criminal life? &lt;br /&gt;This may well be the most thrilling book ever written, by a man of great physical, moral and spiritual strength and not surprisingly a great literary talent as well. This book deserves a real shot at a Pulitzer Prize. In fact if it doesn’t win one then we will finally have proof that the Pulitzer is rigged. &lt;br /&gt;Ron Burgundy has taken the time to write a book. We owe it to him, as honest Americans, to read it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Thirst,&lt;/i&gt; a collection of forty-three new poems from the Pulitzer Prize-winner Mary Oliver, introduces two new directions in the poet's work. Grappling with grief at the death of the love of her life and partner of over forty years, the remarkable photographer Molly Malone Cook, she strives to experience sorrow as a path to spiritual progress, grief as part of loving and not its end. And within these pages she chronicles for the first time her discovery of faith, without abandoning the love of the physical world that has been a hallmark of her work for four decades. In three stunning long poems, Oliver explores the dimensions and tests the parameters of religious doctrine, asking of being good, for example, "To what purpose? / Hope of Heaven? Not that. But to enter / the other kingdom: grace, and imagination, / and the multiple sympathies: to be as a leaf, a rose,/ a dolphin."</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Devil in the Grove&lt;/em&gt; is the winner of the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century, Thurgood Marshall was on the verge of bringing the landmark suit &lt;em&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/em&gt; before the U.S. Supreme Court when he became embroiled in an explosive and deadly case that threatened to change the course of the civil rights movement and cost him his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1949, Florida’s orange industry was booming, and citrus barons got rich on the backs of cheap Jim Crow labor. To maintain order and profits, they turned to Willis V. McCall, a violent sheriff who ruled Lake County with murderous resolve. When a white seventeen-year-old Groveland girl cried rape, McCall was fast on the trail of four young blacks who dared to envision a future for themselves beyond the citrus groves. By day’s end, the Ku Klux Klan had rolled into town, burning the homes of blacks to the ground and chasing hundreds into the swamps, hell-bent on lynching the young men who came to be known as “the Groveland Boys.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so began the chain of events that would bring Thurgood Marshall, the man known as “Mr. Civil Rights,” into the deadly fray. Associates thought it was suicidal for him to wade into the “Florida Terror” at a time when he was irreplaceable to the burgeoning civil rights movement, but the lawyer would not shrink from the fight—not after the Klan had murdered one of Marshall’s NAACP associates involved with the case and Marshall had endured continual threats that he would be next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on a wealth of never-before-published material, including the FBI’s unredacted Groveland case files, as well as unprecedented access to the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund files, King shines new light on this remarkable civil rights crusader, setting his rich and driving narrative against the heroic backdrop of a case that U.S. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson decried as “one of the best examples of one of the worst menaces to American justice.”</description>

  <description>Young for his class and small for his age, Porter Osborne, Jr., leaves his rural Georgia home in 1938 to meet the world at Willingham University, armed with the knowledge that he has been "Raised Right" in the best Baptist tradition. What happens over the next four years will challenge the things he holds infallible: his faith, his heritage, and his parents' omniscience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we follow Porter's college career, full of outrageous pranks and ribald humor, we sense a quiet, constant flow toward maturity.</description>

  <description>What is the value of a college degree if it leaves you with few job prospects in a tough economy and buried in debt? &lt;i&gt;College (Un)bound&lt;/i&gt; asks the burning question on every prospective student, parent, and new grad’s mind. Student-loan debt in the United States crossed the $1 trillion mark in 2011. To say that the cost of a four-year college education is inflated on many campuses would be an understatement—and that education bubble is about to burst. Jeffrey J. Selingo, editor at large for &lt;i&gt;The Chronicle for Higher Education&lt;/i&gt; and senior fellow at Education Sector, argues that America’s higher education system is broken and that the great credential race has transformed universities into big business. In the wake of the 2008 recession, colleges can no longer sell a degree at any price as the ticket to success in life. Brand-name universities like Harvard, Yale, Cornell, and Stanford will always find students and families willing to pay the sticker price because of their institution’s global prestige, influential alumni networks, and considerable endowments. But the campuses that the vast majority of Americans attend, where some students go into tens of thousands of dollars in debt for degrees with little payoff, will need to adapt fast to the changing job market and new technological breakthroughs. As an industry insider who has covered higher education for more than 15 years, Selingo offers a critical examination of the current state of affairs and the pressing issues faced by students and parents. He also seeks out institutions like Arizona State University and the University of Central Florida that are leading the way into the future. Selingo predicts that the class of 2020 will have a college experience that is radically different from the one their parents had, and the college of the future will be personalized, leaner, and better able to arm students with the hard skills they need to enter the workforce of tomorrow. &lt;i&gt;College (Un)bound&lt;/i&gt; will be a great resource for prospective students, but more important, it will change the way you think about higher education.</description>

  <description>An epic novel and a thrilling literary discovery, The Orphan Master's Son follows a young man's journey through the icy waters, dark tunnels, and eerie spy chambers of the world's most mysterious dictatorship, North Korea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pak Jun Do is the haunted son of a lost mother - a singer "stolen" to Pyongyang - and an influential father who runs Long Tomorrows, a work camp for orphans. There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering himself "a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world," Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress "so pure, she didn't know what starving people looked like." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, The Orphan Master's Son is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love. A towering literary achievement, The Orphan Master's Son ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today's greatest writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--jacket description</description>

  <description>"Sometimes the greatest things are the most embarrassing." Ellen Degeneres' winning, upbeat candor has made her show one of the most popular, resilient and honored daytime shows on the air. (To date, it has won no fewer than 31 Emmys.) &lt;i&gt;Seriously... I'm Kidding&lt;/i&gt;, Degeneres' first book in eight years, brings us up to date about the life of a kindhearted woman who bowed out of &lt;i&gt;American Idol&lt;/i&gt; because she didn't want to be mean. Lively; hilarious; often sweetly poignant.</description>

  <description>It's first the story of two women in the 1980s, of gray-headed Mrs. Threadgoode telling her life story to Evelyn, who is in the sad slump of middle age. The tale she tells is &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; of two women—of the irrepressibly daredevilish tomboy Idgie and her friend Ruth, who back in the thirties ran a little place in Whistle Stop, Alabama, a Southern kind of Cafe Wobegon offering good barbecue and good coffee and all kinds of love and laughter, even an occasional murder.</description>

  <description>In Fannie Flagg’s high-spirited first novel, we meet Daisy Fay Harper in the spring of 1952, where she’s “not doing much except sitting around waiting for the sixth grade.” When she leaves Shell Beach, Mississippi, in September 1959, she is packed up and ready for the Miss America Pageant, vowing “I won’t come back until I’m somebody.” But in our hearts she already is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sassy and irreverent from the get-go, Daisy Fay takes us on a rollicking journey through her formative years on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. There, at The End of the Road of the South, the family malt shop freezer holds unspeakable things, society maven Mrs. Dot hosts Junior Debutante meetings and shares inspired thoughts for the week (such as “sincerity is as valuable as radium”), and Daisy Fay’s Daddy hatches a quick-cash scheme that involves resurrecting his daughter from the dead in a carefully orchestrated miracle. Along the way, Daisy Fay does a lot of growing up, emerging as one of the most hilarious, appealing, and prized characters in modern fiction.</description>

  <description>Wolves have a reputation for ferocity and cunning that is unique in the animal world. This book shows just how exaggerated the wolf's reputation really is. Drawing on the latest scientific research, this fascinating portrait of wolves in the wild describes the social lives of wolves and the strong family ties that bind together the members of a pack as they share the work of hunting, maintaining territory, and raising young.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hot guys, horses, and high school hijinks in adventure number seven!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy and Olivia are super excited—their aunt on their mother's side has invited them to stay at her ranch, to get to know them. But she's not in on the vampire thing, and when Ivy scares off her favorite horse, Lucky, the girls have to find him—or risk blowing the coffin lid off the secret. Meanwhile the school is putting on a production of Romeo and Juliet—and the casting is not to Olivia's liking.</description>

  <description>For over three decades, Ray Kurzweil has been one of the most respected and provocative advocates of the role of technology in our future. In his classic &lt;i&gt;The Age of Spiritual Machines&lt;/i&gt;, he argued that computers would soon rival the full range of human intelligence at its best. Now he examines the next step in this inexorable evolutionary process: the union of human and machine, in which the knowledge and skills embedded in our brains will be combined with the vastly greater capacity, speed, and knowledge-sharing ability of our creations.</description>

  <description>The hilarious #1 New York Times bestseller: Erma Bombeck’s take on marriage and family life is “fun from cover to cover” (Hartford Courant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since she was a child, Erma Bombeck has been an expert worrier, and married life has only honed that skill. She gets anxious about running out of ball bearings; about snakes sneaking in through the pipes; about making meaningful conversation on New Year’s Eve. Married life, she realizes, is an unpredictable saga even when you know exactly how loud your husband snores every night—and she wouldn’t have it any other way. In this crisp collection of essays, Bombeck shows off the irresistible style that made her one of America’s favorite humorists for more than three decades. When she sharpens her wit, no family member is sacred and no self-help fad is safe.</description>

  <description>Interest in India has never been greater. Here Shashi Tharoor, one of the subcontinent's most respected writers and diplomats, offers precious insights into this complex, multifaceted land, which despite its dazzling diversity of languages, customs, and cultures remains more than 60 years after its founding the world's largest democracy. He describes the vast changes that have transformed this once sleeping giant into a world leader in science and technology, a nation once poverty-stricken that now boasts a middle class of over 300 million people, as large as the entire population of the United States! Artfully combining hard facts and statistics with opinion and observation, Tharoor discusses the strengths and weaknesses of his rapidly evolving homeland in five areas: politics, economics, culture, society, and sports and takes a fresh look at the world's second most populous country.</description>

  <description>Touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared "light-skinned" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician and son, explores his mother's past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in "orchestrated chaos" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. "Mommy," a fiercely protective woman with "dark eyes full of pep and fire," herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all-black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. "God is the color of water," Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life's blessings and life's values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth's determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interspersed throughout his mother's compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self-realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.</description>

  <description>Smart, likable, Bernie Fine was the wonder boy of  Wolff's, New York's most glamorous department  store. A senior VP moving up, he arrives in San  Fransisco to open a West Coast store. His career is  skyrocketing, but his life is lacking a center.  When he looks into the wide, innocent eyes of  five-year-old Jane O'Reilly, and then into the equally  enchanting eyes of her mother, Liz, Bernie knows  he has found what he has been looking for. Bernie  thought he had found love to last a lifetime, but  when Liz is stricken with cancer shortly after the birth of  their first child, time becomes  painfully short. Alone with two children, Bernie  must face the loss and learn how to move on. New  people, new experiences, a new life alone with two  kids. He meets it with courage and humor, and  learns some of life's hard but precious lessons as he  does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution and World War I Europe, Zoya, young cousin to the Tsar, flees St. Petersburg to Paris to find safety. Her entire world forever changed, she faces hard times and joins the Ballet Russe in Paris. And then, when life is kind to her, Zoya moves on to a new and glittering life in New York. The days of ease are all too brief as the Depression strikes, and she loses everything yet again. It is her career, and the man she meets in the course of it, which ultimately save her, as she rebuilds her life through the war years and beyond. And it is her family that comes to mean everything to her. From the roaring twenties to the 1980's, Zoya remains a rare and spirited woman whose legacy will live on.</description>

  <description>There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it’s haunting Harry Pottter’s dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named---a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His fate depends on them all.</description>

  <description>A garden of delights for the word obsessed: a funny, amazing, and even profound world tour of the best of all those strange words that don't have a precise English equivalent, the ones that tell us so much about other cultures' priorities and preoccupations and expand our minds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Did you know that people in Bolivia have a word that means "I was rather too drunk last night and it's all their fault"? That there's no Italian equivalent for the word "blue"? That the Dutch word for skimming stones is "plimpplamppletteren"? This delightful book, which draws on the collective wisdom of more than 254 languages, includes not only those words for which there is no direct counterpart in English ("pana po'o" in Hawaiian means to scratch your head in order to remember something important), but also a frank discussion of exactly how many Eskimo words there are for snow and the longest known palindrome in any language ("saippuakivikauppias"--Finland). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And all right, what in fact is "tingo"? In the Pascuense language of Easter Island, it's to take all the objects one desires from the house of a friend, one at a time, by asking to borrow them. Well, of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; it is. Enhanced by its ingenious and irresistible little &lt;i&gt;Schott's Miscellany/Eats Shoots and Leaves&lt;/i&gt; package and piquant black-and-white illustrations throughout, &lt;i&gt;The Meaning of Tingo&lt;/i&gt; is a heady feast for word lovers of all persuasions. Viva Tingo!</description>

  <description>Four mothers, four daughters, four families, whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who's telling the stories. In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives – until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.</description>

  <description>On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt; is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.</description>

  <description>Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>The setting is Atlanta, Georgia — a racially mixed, late-century boomtown full of fresh wealth and wily politicians. The protagonist is Charles Croker, once a college football star, now a late-middle-aged Atlanta conglomerate king whose outsize ego has at last hit up against reality. Charlie has a 29,000 acre quail-shooting plantation, a young and demanding second wife, and a half-empty office complex with a staggering load of debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Conrad Hensley, idealistic young father of two, is laid off from his job at the Croker Global Foods warehouse near Oakland and finds himself spiraling into the lower depths of the American legal system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And back in Atlanta, when star Georgia Tech running back Fareek “the Canon” Fanon, a homegrown product of the city’s slums, is accused of date-raping the daughter of a pillar of the white establishment, upscale black lawyer Roger White II is asked to represent Fanon and help keep the city’s delicate racial balance from blowing sky-high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Networks of illegal Asian immigrants crisscrossing the continent, daily life behind bars, shady real estate syndicates — Wolfe shows us contemporary America with all the verve, wit, and insight that have made him our most admired novelist. Charlie Croker’s deliverance from his tribulations provides an unforgettable denouement to the most widely awaited, hilarious and telling novel America has seen in ages — Tom Wolfe’s most outstanding achievement to date.</description>

  <description>Why do our headaches persist after taking a one-cent aspirin but disappear when we take a 50-cent aspirin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does recalling the Ten Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save twenty-five cents on a can of soup?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same "types" of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us "predictably" irrational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. "Predictably Irrational" will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time.</description>

  <description>For nearly a hundred years, the state of Utah has played host to scores of Hollywood films, from potboilers on lean budgets to some of the most memorable films ever made, including The Searchers, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Footloose, and Thelma &amp;amp;book gives readers the inside scoop, telling how these films were made, what happened on and off set, and more. As one Utah rancher memorably said, Hollywood moviemakers "don't take anything but pictures and don't leave anything but money."</description>

  <description>Now available in paperback, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller. When John F. Kennedy called America "the land we love" more than 42 years ago, he was reminding us of the lofty ideals on which our country was founded. But what are those ideals, and how have Americans defined them Is America the land of George Washington and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who rallied the country's spirits for unity in wartime, or is it a land of dissent, a land in which Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Martin Luther King, Jr. remind us of our duty to protect our most fundamental freedoms? Are we defined by the speeches of Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan or by the humor of H.L. Mencken and Mark Twain? Caroline Kennedy's answer in &lt;em&gt;A Patriot's Handbook&lt;/em&gt; is that we are all of those things and more. The poems, songs, speeches, letters, and historical documents that Caroline Kennedy has chosen for this remarkable collection remind us of the foundations on which America was built. But they also ask us to examine what it truly means to be a "patriot," even if our assumptions are challenged along the way, because it is only by doing so that America can "truly be our own." Voices as diverse as the nation itself:&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Jefferson Cole Porter Chief Red Jacket Amy Tan Betty Friedan Albert Einstein George W. Bush Loretta Lynn John F. Kennedy Martin Luther King, Jr. Bob Dylan Cesar Chavez Toni Morrison Groucho Marx and many more</description>

  <description>"For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/i&gt; has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/i&gt; is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/i&gt; that can keep boys and old men happy.'</description>

  <description>"Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the famous opening words of a treatise that has not ceased to stir vigorous debate since its first publication in 1762. Rejecting the view that anyone has a natural right to wield authority over others, Rousseau argues instead for a pact, or ‘social contract’, that should exist between all the citizens of a state and that should be the source of sovereign power. From this fundamental premise, he goes on to consider issues of liberty and law, freedom and justice, arriving at a view of society that has seemed to some a blueprint for totalitarianism, to others a declaration of democratic principles.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Candide&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a gentle man who, though pummeled and slapped in every direction by fate, clings desperately to the belief that he lives in "the best of all possible worlds." On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan. Fast, funny, often outrageous, the French philosopher's immortal narrative takes Candide around the world to discover that -- contrary to the teachings of his distinguished tutor Dr. Pangloss -- all is not always for the best. Alive with wit, brilliance, and graceful storytelling, &lt;i&gt;Candide&lt;/i&gt; has become Voltaire's most celebrated work.</description>

  <description>The curse placed on Oedipus lingers and haunts a younger generation in this new and brilliant translation of Sophocles' classic drama. The daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta, Antigone is an unconventional heroine who pits her beliefs against the King of Thebes in a bloody test of wills that leaves few unharmed. Emotions fly as she challenges the king for the right to bury her own brother. Determined but doomed, Antigone shows her inner strength throughout the play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antigone raises issues of law and morality that are just as relevant today as they were more than two thousand years ago. Whether this is your first reading or your twentieth, Antigone will move you as few pieces of literature can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this quintessential Greek drama more accessible to the modern reader, this Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Edition includes a glossary of difficult terms, a list of vocabulary words, and convenient sidebar notes. By providing these, it is our intention that readers will more fully enjoy the beauty, wisdom, and intent of the play.</description>

  <description>"...what man wins more happiness than just its shape and the ruin when that shape collapses?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophocles' Oedipus Rex has never been surpassed for the raw and terrible power with which its hero struggles to answer the eternal question, "Who am I?" The play, a story of a king who acting entirely in ignorance kills his father and marries his mother, unfolds with shattering power; we are helplessly carried along with Oedipus towards the final, horrific truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make Oedipus more accessible for the modern reader, our Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Classics includes a glossary of the more difficult words, as well as convenient sidebar notes to enlighten the reader on aspects that may be confusing or overlooked. We hope that the reader may, through this edition, more fully enjoy the beauty of the verse, the wisdom of the insights, and the impact of the drama.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns&lt;br /&gt;driven time and again off course, once he had plundered&lt;br /&gt;the hallowed heights of Troy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt;, which Jasper Griffin in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Review of Books&lt;/i&gt; hails as "a distinguished achievement."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt; is the world's greatest war epic, then the &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an &lt;i&gt;Odyssey&lt;/i&gt; to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&lt;/i&gt; is an illustrated collection of poems by William Blake. It appeared in two phases. A few first copies were printed and illuminated by William Blake himself in 1789; five years later he bound these poems with a set of new poems in a volume titled &lt;i&gt;Songs of Innocence and of Experience Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/i&gt; describes Dante's descent into Hell with Virgil as a guide; his ascent of Mount Purgatory and encounter with his dead love, Beatrice; and finally, his arrival in Heaven. Examining questions of faith, desire and enlightenment, the poem is a brilliantly nuanced and moving allegory of human redemption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dante Alighieri was born in Florence in 1265 and belonged to a noble but impoverished family. His life was divided by political duties and poetry, the most of famous of which was inspired by his meeting with Bice Portinari, whom he called Beatrice,including &lt;i&gt;La Vita Nuova&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/i&gt;. He died in Ravenna in 1321.</description>

  <description>Shirley Temple did a lot to make Rebecca famous when she won the world's heart in the movie we all remember. But the story is more than Temple, the film, or our memory of it: this is the tale of the little showgirl who, sent to the country to live with prim and proper relatives, is forbidden to do anything, well, showy. But Rebecca has other ideas, of course, and you know she'll win over the hearts and minds of everyone who'll see her show. . . . Certainly she won over Jack London. In 1904 he wrote to Wiggin herself: -May I thank you for Rebecca. . . ? I would have quested the wide world over to make her mine, only I was born too long ago and she was born but yesterday.... Why could she not have been my daughter? Why couldn't it have been I who bought the three hundred cakes of soap? Why, O, why?- And Mark Twain, too: he described Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm as -beautiful and warm and satisfying.-</description>
