  <description>Marjorie Glatt feels like a ghost. A practical thirteen year old in charge of the family laundry business, her daily routine features unforgiving customers, unbearable P.E. classes, and the fastidious Mr. Saubertuck who is committed to destroying everything she’s worked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendell is a ghost. A boy who lost his life much too young, his daily routine features ineffective death therapy, a sheet-dependent identity, and a dangerous need to seek purpose in the forbidden human world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their worlds collide, Marjorie is confronted by unexplainable disasters as Wendell transforms Glatt’s Laundry into his midnight playground, appearing as a mere sheet during the day. While Wendell attempts to create a new afterlife for himself, he unknowingly sabotages the life that Marjorie is struggling to maintain.</description>

      <![CDATA[*NEW FAVOURITE ALERT* If I can encourage you to pick up a book right now, please let it be this one. I'm still swimming in the illustrations, they were so unbelievably beautiful. I'm sort of considering buying a second copy so that I can cut out some of my favourite pages to hang them in my room?...]]>

  <description>Isabel has one rule: no dating.&lt;br /&gt;It's easier--&lt;br /&gt;It's safer--&lt;br /&gt;It's better--&lt;br /&gt;--for the other person.&lt;br /&gt;She's got issues. She's got secrets. She's got rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets another sick kid.&lt;br /&gt;He's got a chronic illness Isabel's never heard of, something she can't even pronounce. He understands what it means to be sick. He understands her more than her healthy friends. He understands her more than her own father who's a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;He's gorgeous, fun, and foul-mouthed. And totally into her.&lt;br /&gt;Isabel has one rule: no dating.&lt;br /&gt;It's complicated--&lt;br /&gt;It's dangerous--&lt;br /&gt;It's never felt better--&lt;br /&gt;--to consider breaking that rule for him.</description>

      <![CDATA[It's spooky to read about a character who has such a similar illness to me but also really powerful. It's nice to feel seen! Overall this was very cute and the main thing that propelled me forward was reading about how the couple navigated chronic illness. Always great to read new perspectives.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut from &lt;i&gt;Forbes'&lt;/i&gt; third most powerful woman in the world, Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women's empowerment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last twenty years, Melinda Gates has been on a mission. Her goal, as co-chair of the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, has been to find solutions for people with the most urgent needs, wherever they live. Throughout this journey, one thing has become increasingly clear to her: If you want to lift a society up, invest in women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and inspiring book, Gates traces her awakening to the link between women's empowerment and the health of societies. She shows some of the tremendous opportunities that exist right now to “turbo-charge" change. And she provides simple and effective ways each one of us can make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that all women should be free to decide whether and when to have children, Gates took her first step onto the global stage to make a stand for family planning. That step launched her into further efforts: to ensure women everywhere have access to every kind of job; to encourage men around the globe to share equally in the burdens of household work; to advocate for paid family leave for everyone; to eliminate gender bias in all its forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Gates introduces us to her heroes in the movement towards equality, offers startling data, shares moving conversations she's had with women from all over the world—and shows how we can all get involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal statement of passionate conviction, this book tells of Gates' journey from a partner working behind the scenes to one of the world's foremost advocates for women, driven by the belief that no one should be excluded, all lives have equal value, and gender equity is the lever that lifts everything.</description>

  <description>Deja and Josiah are seasonal best friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every autumn, all through high school, they’ve worked together at the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world. (Not many people know that the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world is in Omaha, Nebraska, but it definitely is.) They say good-bye every Halloween, and they’re reunited every September 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Halloween is different—Josiah and Deja are finally seniors, and this is their last season at the pumpkin patch. Their last shift together. Their last good-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josiah’s ready to spend the whole night feeling melancholy about it. Deja isn’t ready to let him. She’s got a&lt;i&gt; plan&lt;/i&gt;: What if—instead of moping and the usual slinging lima beans down at the Succotash Hut—they went out with a bang? They could see all the sights! Taste all the snacks! And Josiah could finally talk to that cute girl he’s been mooning over for three years . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if their last shift was an adventure?</description>

  <description>In this brilliant sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale, &lt;/i&gt;acclaimed author Margaret Atwood answers the questions that have tantalized readers for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the van door slammed on Offred's future at the end of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;, readers had no way of telling what lay ahead for her--freedom, prison or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Testaments&lt;/i&gt;, the wait is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margaret Atwood's sequel picks up the story more than fifteen years after Offred stepped into the unknown, with the explosive testaments of three female narrators from Gilead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in." --Margaret Atwood</description>

But I loved that there was this exciting plot that was pushing the momentum forwards and that we were learning more about Gilead and the world outside and the way it came to be.

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...&lt;br /&gt;--back cover</description>

  <description>Second only to Slaughterhouse-Five of Vonnegut's canon in its prominence and influence, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965) presents Eliot Rosewater, an itinerant, semi-crazed millionaire wandering the country in search of heritage and philanthropic outcome, introducing the science fiction writer Kilgore Trout to the world and Vonnegut to the collegiate audience which would soon make him a cult writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trout, modeled according to Vonnegut on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (with whom Vonnegut had an occasional relationship) is a desperate, impoverished but visionary hack writer who functions for Eliot Rosewater as both conscience and horrid example. Rosewater, seeking to put his inheritance to some meaningful use (his father was an entrepreneur), tries to do good within the context of almost illimitable cynicism and corruption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in this novel that Rosewater wanders into a science fiction conference--an actual annual event in Milford, Pennsylvania--and at the motel delivers his famous monologue evoked by science fiction writers and critics for almost half a century: "None of you can write for sour apples... but you're the only people trying to come to terms with the really terrific things which are happening today." Money does not drive Mr. Rosewater (or the corrupt lawyer who tries to shape the Rosewater fortune) so much as outrage at the human condition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The novel was adapted for a 1979 Alan Menken musical. The novel is told mostly thru a collection of short stories dealing with Eliot's interactions with the citizens of Rosewater County, usually with the last sentence serving as a punch line. The antagonist's tale, Mushari's, is told in a similar short essay fashion. The stories reveal different hypocrisies of humankind in a darkly humorous fashion.</description>

  <description>A morally outraged sweetcorn kernel, some wrestlers going for a wander before their big finale, a rabbit, a monkey nut, bread, bhajis. Intricately drawn, quirky, surreal and very funny, this text introduces two comic artists, Gauld and Lia.</description>

  <description>Helloooo, Internet Land. Bitty here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y’all... I &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;not be ready for this. I may be a former junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;talented amateur pâtissier, but being a freshman on the Samwell University hockey team is a whole new challenge. It’s nothing like co-ed club hockey back in Georgia! First of all? There’s &lt;em&gt;checking.&lt;/em&gt; And then, there is Jack—our very attractive but moody captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of the first half of the megapopular webcomic series of the same name, &lt;i&gt;Check, Please!: #Hockey&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of a hilarious and stirring two-volume coming-of-age story about hockey, bros, and trying to find yourself during the best four years of your life.</description>

  <description>Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s secret weapon (and best friend) is the brilliant dressmaker Frances―one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect a friend? Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, &lt;i&gt;The Prince and the Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; will steal your heart.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Keep Working. Keep Playing. Keep Creating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his previous books &lt;i&gt;Steal Like an Artist &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Show Your Work!&lt;/i&gt;, both &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestsellers, Austin Kleon gave readers the keys to unlock their creativity and showed them how to become known. Now he offers his most inspiring work yet, with ten simple rules for how to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself—for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The creative life is not a linear journey to a finish line, it’s a loop—so find a daily routine, because today is the only day that matters. Disconnect from the world to connect with yourself—sometimes you just have to switch into airplane mode. &lt;i&gt;Keep Going&lt;/i&gt; celebrates getting outdoors and taking a walk (as director Ingmar Bergman told his daughter, ”The demons hate fresh air”). Pay attention, and especially pay attention to what you pay attention to. Worry less about getting things done, and more about the worth of what you’re doing. Instead of focusing on making your mark, work to leave things better than you found them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keep Going&lt;/i&gt; and its timeless, practical, and ethical principles are for anyone trying to sustain a meaningful and productive life.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Keiko Furukura had always been considered a strange child, and her parents always worried how she would get on in the real world, so when she takes on a job in a convenience store while at university, they are delighted for her. For her part, in the convenience store she finds a predictable world mandated by the store manual, which dictates how the workers should act and what they should say, and she copies her coworkers' style of dress and speech patterns so she can play the part of a normal person. However, eighteen years later, at age 36, she is still in the same job, has never had a boyfriend, and has only few friends. She feels comfortable in her life but is aware that she is not living up to society's expectations and causing her family to worry about her. When a similarly alienated but cynical and bitter young man comes to work in the store, he will upset Keiko's contented stasis—but will it be for the better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sayaka Murata brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience store that is so much part of life in Japan. With some laugh-out-loud moments prompted by the disconnect between Keiko's thoughts and those of the people around her, she provides a sharp look at Japanese society and the pressure to conform, as well as penetrating insights into the female mind. &lt;i&gt;Convenience Store Woman&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh, charming portrait of an unforgettable heroine that recalls Banana Yoshimoto, Han Kang, and &lt;i&gt;Amelie&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Ghost World&lt;/em&gt; has become a cultural and generational touchstone, and continues to enthrall and inspire readers over a decade after its original release as a graphic novel. Originally serialized in the pages of the seminal comic book &lt;em&gt;Eightball&lt;/em&gt; throughout the mid-1990s, this quasi-autobiographical story (the name of one of the protagonists is famously an anagram of the author's name) follows the adventures of two teenage girls, Enid and Becky, two best friends facing the prospect of growing up, and more importantly, apart. Daniel Clowes is one of the most respected cartoonists of his generation, and &lt;em&gt;Ghost World&lt;/em&gt; is his magnum opus. Adapted into a major motion picture directed by Terry Zwigoff (director of the acclaimed documentary &lt;em&gt;Crumb&lt;/em&gt;), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. This graphic novel is a must for any self-respecting comics fan's library.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Other Country&lt;/i&gt; was Carol Ann Duffy’s third collection, and as with her later books, takes its readers on journeys that seem initially similar – but soon prove anything but. This book leads our imagination to places our minds could not have suspected were there, or would not have dared to go alone. Some of its voices are disarmingly direct, while others blur the lines between fantasy and reality, confession and self-delusion, forcing us to re-examine everything we thought we knew about some of our most basic human drives and emotions. Deeply intelligent, unflinchingly honest, with a deftness of touch and tone, and openness all the more moving for its lack of sentimentality, &lt;i&gt;The Other Country&lt;/i&gt; is as remarkable a collection today as it was on its first publication.</description>

  <description>In this stunning collection of new poems, Mary Oliver returns to the imagery that has defined her life’s work, describing with wonder both the everyday and the unaffected beauty of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herons, sparrows, owls, and kingfishers flit across the page in meditations on love, artistry, and impermanence. Whether considering a bird’s nest, the seeming patience of oak trees, or the artworks of Franz Marc, Oliver reminds us of the transformative power of attention and how much can be contained within the smallest moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its heart, &lt;i&gt;Blue Horses&lt;/i&gt; asks what it means to truly belong to this world, to live in it attuned to all its changes. Humorous, gentle, and always honest, Oliver is a visionary of the natural world.</description>

  <description>In a London flat, two young boys face the unbearable sadness of their mother's sudden death. Their father, a Ted Hughes scholar and scruffy romantic, imagines a future of well-meaning visitors and emptiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this moment of despair they are visited by Crow - antagonist, trickster, healer, babysitter. This self-described sentimental bird is attracted to the grieving family and threatens to stay until they no longer need him. As weeks turn to months and physical pain of loss gives way to memories, this little unit of three begin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this extraordinary debut - part novella, part polyphonic fable, part essay on grief, Max Porter's compassion and bravura style combine to dazzling effect. Full of unexpected humour and profound emotional truth, &lt;i&gt;Grief is the Thing with Feathers&lt;/i&gt; marks the arrival of a thrilling new talent.</description>

  <description>Rock star, crowdfunding pioneer, and TED speaker Amanda Palmer knows all about asking. Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and practical aspects of &lt;i&gt;The Art Of Asking&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part manifesto, part revelation, this is the story of an artist struggling with the new rules of exchange in the twenty-first century, both on and off the Internet. &lt;i&gt;The Art Of Asking&lt;/i&gt; will inspire readers to rethink their own ideas about asking, giving, art, and love.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When I was younger, thinking about whether I wanted children, I always came back to this formula: If no one had told me anything about the world, I would have invented boyfriends. I'd have invented sex, friendships, art. I would not have invented child-rearing. I would have had to invent those other things to fulfil real longings in me, but if no one had ever told me that a person could create a person, and raise them into a citizen, it wouldn't have occurred to me as something to do. In fact, it would have sounded like a task to very much avoid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After the tumult of her 20s, the narrator of Sheila Heti's new novel finds herself living a life into which she could bring a child. She's with a man who has promised his support if she decides she wants to be a mother, "but you have to be sure." &lt;i&gt;Motherhood&lt;/i&gt; chronicles her struggle, under pressure from friends, culture and time, and seeking answers from family, strangers, mysticism and chance, to make a wise and moral choice, and to truly understand what is gained, and what is lost, when a woman becomes a mother. &lt;br /&gt; Heti treats the most universal and consequential decision of early to mid-adulthood--whether to have kids--with the candour and originality that have won her international acclaim, and that made &lt;i&gt;How Should a Person Be?&lt;/i&gt; required reading for a generation of young women. The result is a courageous, funny and ultimately moving novel about motherhood, selfhood, and how--and for whom--to live.</description>

  <description>‘Poetry meets mental health in Charly Cox’s brave and beautiful &lt;em&gt;She Must Be Mad&lt;/em&gt;.’ &lt;em&gt;Stylist Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‘Reading this book made me feel less alone.’ &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;She Must be Mad&lt;/em&gt; explores coming-of-age: the pain and beauty of love, the relief and the agony of turning from girl to woman, the isolation of an untethered mind and the power and subjugation of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charly captures the formative experiences of today’s young women from the poignant to the prosaic in writing that is at once witty, wry and heartfelt. Wayward nights out that don’t go as planned; the righteous anger at those men with no talent or skill or smarts who occupy the most powerful positions in the world; the strange banality of madness and, of course, the hurt and indecision of unrequited love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every woman surviving and thriving in today’s world, for every girl who feels too much; this is a call for communion, and you are not alone.</description>

  <description>Nectar is the second collection of poetry and prose by Malawian storyteller Upile Chisala. In this book, Upile guides through a beautiful process of blooming starting with some poems on self love then words on our roots followed by acknowledging all the fruit of these experiences. The storyteller's hope is that these poems on growth encourage the reader to sow and to make changes in the lives of others. Born in 1994 and raised in Zomba, Upile's hope is to tell stories from the margins and through her work help others and herself come to terms with pasts, celebrate presents and confidently dream beautiful futures.</description>

  <description>Have you taken children to a gallery recently? Did you struggle to explain the work to them in plain, simple English? With this new Dung Beetle book by artist Miriam Elia – a tribute to and a parody of the much-loved British Ladybird early learning children's books of the 1960s – anyone can learn about contemporary art and understand many of its key themes. Join John and Susan on their exciting journey through the art exhibition, where, with Mummy's help, they will discover the real meaning of all the contemporary artworks, from empty rooms to vagina paintings or giant inflatable dogs.&lt;br /&gt;The 2014 limited edition of "We Go to the Gallery" was threatened with a lawsuit by Penguin UK (owners of the Ladybird imprint), which was withdrawn following a recent change in UK copyright law allowing for parody and satire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Novelist and poet Ben Lerner argues that our hatred of poetry is ultimately a sign of its continued relevance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poetry. Perhaps Marianne Moore said it best: "I, too, dislike it." What other art takes its marginality as a given, and is so widely bemoaned even by its practitioners? Ben Lerner writes, "Many more people agree they hate poetry than can agree what poetry is. I, too, dislike it and have largely organized my life around it and do not experience that as a contradiction because poetry and the hatred of poetry are inextricable in ways it is my purpose to explore."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this inventive and plain-spoken essay, Lerner takes the hatred of poetry as the starting point of his defence of the art. He examines both poetry's greatest haters (beginning with Plato, who famously claimed that an ideal city had no place for poets, who would only corrupt and mislead the young) and its greatest practitioners, providing inspired close-readings of Keats, Dickinson, Whitman, and others. Throughout, he attempts to explain the noble failure at the heart of every poem: the impulse to launch the experience of an individual into a timeless, communal existence. In &lt;i&gt;The Hatred of Poetry&lt;/i&gt;, Lerner has crafted an entertaining, personal, and entirely original examination of a vocation no less essential for being impossible.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Packed with tested strategies and practical tips, this book is the essential, life-changing guide for everyone who owns a smartphone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Is your phone the first thing you reach for in the morning and the last thing you touch before bed? Do you frequently pick it up "just to check," only to look up forty-five minutes later wondering where the time has gone? Do you say you want to spend less time on your phone--but have no idea how to do so without giving it up completely? If so, this book is your solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning journalist Catherine Price presents a practical, hands-on plan to break up--and then make up--with your phone. The goal? A long-term relationship that actually feels &lt;i&gt;good. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'll discover how phones and apps are designed to be addictive, and learn how the time we spend on them damages our abilities to focus, think deeply, and form new memories. You'll then make customized changes to your settings, apps, environment, and mindset that will ultimately enable you to take back control of your life.</description>

  <description>One of the classics of English children's literature, and one of the earliest books written specifically for boys, this novel's steady popularity has given it an influence well beyond the upper middle-class world that it describes. It tells a story central to an understanding of Victorian life, but its freshness helps to distinguish it from the narrow schoolboy adventures that it later inspired. The book includes an introduction and notes by Andrew Sanders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Series: &lt;/strong&gt;For over 100 years &lt;strong&gt;Oxford World's Classics &lt;/strong&gt;has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1950, photographer Gisèle Freund embarked on a two-week trip to Mexico, but she wouldn’t leave until two years later. There she met the legendary couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Welcomed into their home, she immersed herself in their private lives and the cultural and artistic diversity of the country, taking hundreds of photographs. These powerful photographs, among the last taken before Kahlo’s death, bear poignant witness to Frida’s beauty and talent.&lt;br /&gt; Showcasing more than 100 of these rare images, many of which have never been published before, the book also includes previously unpublished commentary by Gisèle Freund about Frida Kahlo, texts by Kahlo’s biographer Gérard de Cortanze and art historian Lorraine Audric, as well as a link to a previously unreleased color film, shot by Freund, showing Diego Rivera at work.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>At long last, Mary Beard addresses in one brave book the misogynists and trolls who mercilessly attack and demean women the world over, including, very often, Mary herself. In &lt;em&gt;Women &amp;amp; Power&lt;/em&gt;, she traces the origins of this misogyny to its ancient roots, examining the pitfalls of gender and the ways that history has mistreated strong women since time immemorial. As far back as Homer’s &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, Beard shows, women have been prohibited from leadership roles in civic life, public speech being defined as inherently male. From Medusa to Philomela (whose tongue was cut out), from Hillary Clinton to Elizabeth Warren (who was told to sit down), Beard draws illuminating parallels between our cultural assumptions about women’s relationship to power—and how powerful women provide a necessary example for all women who must resist being vacuumed into a male template. With personal reflections on her own online experiences with sexism, Beard asks: If women aren’t perceived to be within the structure of power, isn’t it power itself we need to redefine? And how many more centuries should we be expected to wait?</description>

  <description>This brilliant graphic novel artfully depicts the life and passions of Frida Kahlo, one of the 20th century's most enigmatic artists. The perfect subject for a graphic novel, Frida Kahlo's brief life was dramatic and romantic, tragic and painful. In this illustrated -biography-, Vanna Vinci captures the spirit of Kahlo's world in boldly colored, minutely detailed illustrations. Blending facts and history with dreamlike and surreal sequences, Vinci creates an intimate portrayal of an artist who incorporated her life experiences into her art. Burning love and crushing loss, incredible joy and deep despair--these were all part of Kahlo's life and part of the paintings that are some of the most celebrated art of all time. Filled with images that populated Kahlo's work--monkeys and parrots, traditional clothing and lush gardens--Vinci imbues her text and drawings with an artist's perception and sensitivity. The result is an evocative, fittingly passionate tribute to a legendary figure.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;This is an alternate cover edition - ISBN: 9781782390695&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life can be hard: your lover cheats on you; you lose a family member; you can’t pay the bills—and it can be great: you’ve had the hottest sex of your life; you get that plum job; you muster the courage to write your novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sugar—the once-anonymous online columnist at &lt;i&gt;The Rumpus, &lt;/i&gt;now revealed as Cheryl Strayed, author of the bestselling memoir &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt;—is the person thousands turn to for advice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tiny Beautiful Things&lt;/i&gt; brings the best of Dear Sugar in one place and includes never-before-published columns and a new introduction by Steve Almond.  Rich with humor, insight, compassion—and absolute honesty—this book&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is a balm for everything life throws our way.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A Connecticut Yankee&lt;/i&gt; is Mark Twain’s most ambitious work, a tour de force with a science-fiction plot told in the racy slang of a Hartford workingman, sparkling with literary hijinks as well as social and political satire. Mark Twain characterized his novel as "one vast sardonic laugh at the trivialities, the servilities of our poor human race." The Yankee, suddenly transported from his native nineteenth-century America to the sleepy sixth-century Britain of King Arthur and the Round Table, vows brashly to "boss the whole country inside of three weeks." And so he does. Emerging as "The Boss," he embarks on an ambitious plan to modernize Camelot—with unexpected results.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green--cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow--spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--everywhere from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity, and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring from the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Girl Online&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt; in this emotionally charged story of girl who takes to the wilderness to rediscover herself and escape the superficial persona she created on social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mari Turner’s life is perfect. That is, at least to her thousands of followers who have helped her become an internet starlet. But when she breaks down and posts a video confessing she’s been living a lie—that she isn’t the happy, in-love, inspirational online personality she’s been trying so hard to portray—it goes viral and she receives major backlash. To get away from it all, she makes an impulsive decision: to hike the entire John Muir trail. Mari and her late cousin, Bri, were supposed to do it together, to celebrate their shared eighteenth birthday. But that was before Mari got so wrapped up in her online world that she shut anyone out who questioned its worth—like Bri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Bri’s boots and trail diary, a heart full of regret, and a group of strangers that she meets along the way, Mari tries to navigate the difficult terrain of the hike. But the true challenge lies within, as she searches for the way back to the girl she fears may be too lost to find: herself.</description>

  <description>Farouk’s country has been torn apart by war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lampy’s heart has been laid waste by Chloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John’s past torments him as he nears his end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refugee. The dreamer. The penitent. From war-torn Syria to small-town Ireland, three men, scarred by all they have loved and lost, are searching for some version of home. Each is drawn towards a powerful reckoning, one that will bring them together in the most unexpected of ways.</description>

  <description>"Long live the King" hailed &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt; upon publication of Stephen King's &lt;i&gt;On Writing&lt;/i&gt;. Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999--and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, &lt;i&gt;On Writing&lt;/i&gt; will empower and entertain everyone who reads it--fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</description>

  <description>One of Canada’s most accomplished authors combines the best qualities of both the short story and the novel to create a lyrical evocation of the beauty, pain, and wonder of growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In eight interconnected, finely wrought stories, Margaret Laurence recreates the world of Vanessa MacLeod – a world of scrub-oak, willow, and chokecherry bushes; of family love and conflict; and of a girl’s growing awareness of and passage into womanhood. The stories blend into one masterly and moving whole: poignant, compassionate, and profound in emotional impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fourth book of the five-volume Manawaka series, Vanessa MacLeod takes her rightful place alongside the other unforgettable heroines of Manawaka: Hagar Shipley in &lt;i&gt;The Stone Angel&lt;/i&gt;, Rachel Cameron in &lt;i&gt;A Jest of God&lt;/i&gt;, Stacey MacAindra in &lt;i&gt;The Fire-Dwellers&lt;/i&gt;, and Morag Gunn in &lt;i&gt;The Diviners&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

  <description>David Hume's &lt;em&gt;Enquiry concerning Human Understanding&lt;/em&gt; is the definitive statement of the greatest philosopher in the English language. His arguments in support of reasoning from experience, and against the "sophistry and illusion"of religiously inspired philosophical fantasies, caused controversy in the eighteenth century and are strikingly relevant today, when faith and science continue to clash.&lt;br /&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt; considers the origin and processes of human thought, reaching the stark conclusion that we can have no ultimate understanding of the physical world, or indeed our own minds. In either sphere we must depend on instinctive learning from experience, recognizing our animal nature and the limits of reason. Hume's calm and open-minded skepticism thus aims to provide a new basis for science, liberating us from the "superstition" of false metaphysics and religion. His &lt;em&gt;Enquiry&lt;/em&gt; remains one of the best introductions to the study of philosophy, and his edition places it in its historical and philosophical context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Series: &lt;/strong&gt;For over 100 years &lt;strong&gt;Oxford World's Classics &lt;/strong&gt;has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.</description>

  <description>Corrina Park used to have big plans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studying English literature in college, she imagined writing a successful novel and leading the idealized life of an author. But she’s been working at the same advertising agency for the past five years and the only thing she’s written is . . . copy. Corrina knows there must be more to life, but and she faces the same question as does everyone in her generation: how to find it?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here is the brilliant debut graphic novel about a young woman’s search for happiness and self-fulfillment in the big city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(With two-color illustrations throughout.)</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now Simon is actually being blackmailed: if he doesn’t play wingman for class clown Martin, his sexual identity will become everyone’s business. Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he’s been emailing, will be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon’s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated. Now, change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out—without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"My painting carries within it the message of pain"&lt;/i&gt;. Frida Kahlo—born in 1907 near Mexico City—learned about pain at a very early age. She contracted polio at six, and then at eighteen suffered serious and permanent injury to her right leg and pelvis in a terrible bus accident. Young and undaunted, she went on to fall in love with the great mural painter Diego Rivera at a time when their native Mexico was going through a period of thrilling political and cultural upheaval. Rivera and Kahlo were a legendary couple—both were impassioned, lifelong communists while fervently attached to traditional Mexican Indian culture, and both were driven by a relentless artistic ambition that surmounted all the dramas that plagued their marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, Frida became the friend and lover of Leon Trotsky. She was greatly admired by the Surrealists and sat for some of the greatest photographers of her day. Her art largely consisted of self-portraits, like the famous paintings &lt;i&gt;The Two Fridas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Broken Column&lt;/i&gt;, though she also left many striking still-lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Frida Kahlo: Painting Her Own Reality&lt;/i&gt;, Christina Burrus assesses Frida Kahlo’s extraordinary work—a maelstrom of cruelty, humor, candor, and insolence reflecting the essence of a free, beautiful, courageous woman who concealed her physical pain behind peals of infectious laughter.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A writer’s search for inspiration, beauty, and solace leads her to birds in this meditation on creativity and life – a field guide to things small and significant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012, Kyo Maclear met a musician with a passion for birds. Curious about what had prompted a young urban artist to suddenly embrace nature she decided to follow him for a year to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observing two artists through seasonal shifts and migrations, &lt;i&gt;Birds Art Life Death&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the particular madness of chasing after birds in a big city, and explores what happens when the principles of birdwatching are applied to other aspects of art and life. It looks at the ecology of urban spaces and the creative and liberating effects of keeping your eyes and ears wide open. Far from seeking the exotic, Kyo discovers joy in the birds she spots in city parks and harbours, along eaves and on wires. In a world that values big and fast, Kyo begins to look to the small, steady, slow accumulations of knowledge, and the lulls that give way to contemplation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving between the granular and the grand, peering into the inner landscape as much as the outer one, &lt;i&gt;Birds Art Life Death&lt;/i&gt; asks how we are shaped and nurtured by our passions, and how we might come to love and protect not only the world’s natural places but also the challenging urban spaces where so many of us live.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It's hard to keep close a person everyone keeps telling you is gone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been sixty-five painful days since the death of Juniper's big sister, Camilla. On her first day back at school, bracing herself for the stares and whispers, Juniper borrows Camie's handbag for luck - and discovers an unsent break-up letter inside. It's mysteriously addressed to 'You' and dated July 4th - the day of Camie's accident. Desperate to learn the identity of Camie's secret love, Juniper starts to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she loses something herself. A card from her daily ritual, The Happiness Index: little notecards on which she rates the day. The Index has been holding Juniper together since Camie's death - but without this card, there's a hole. And this particular card contains Juniper's own secret: a memory that she can't let anyone else find out.</description>

  <description>Are you a special snowflake? &lt;br /&gt;Do you enjoy networking to advance your career? &lt;br /&gt;Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh. Please go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is for the rest of us. These comics document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet, the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas, and wondering when, exactly, this adulthood thing begins. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life.</description>

  <description>In this masterful novel by the acclaimed Indian writer Vivek Shanbhag, a close-knit family is delivered from near-destitution to sudden wealth after the narrator's uncle founds a successful spice company. As the narrator - a sensitive young man who is never named - along with his sister, his parents, and his uncle move from a cramped, ant-infested shack to a larger house and encounter newfound wealth, the family dynamics begin to shift. Allegiances and desires realign; marriages are arranged and begin to falter; and conflict brews ominously in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their world becomes 'ghachar ghochar' - a nonsense phrase that, to the narrator, comes to mean something entangled beyond repair. Told in clean, urgent prose, and punctuated by moments of unexpected warmth and humour, &lt;i&gt;Ghachar Ghochar&lt;/i&gt; is a quietly enthralling, deeply unsettling novel about the shifting meanings - and consequences - of financial gain in contemporary India.</description>

  <description>"Living on the moon . . . Whatever were we thinking? . . . It seems so silly now."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lunar colony is slowly winding down, like a small town circumvented by a new super highway. As our hero, the Mooncop, makes his daily rounds, his beat grows ever smaller, the population dwindles. A young girl runs away, a dog breaks off his leash, an automaton wanders off from the Museum of the Moon.</description>

  <description>One overcast weekend in October 1974, Georges Perec set out in quest of the "infraordinary": the humdrum, the non-event, the everyday--"what happens," as he put it, "when nothing happens." His choice of locale was Place Saint-Sulpice, where, ensconced behind first one cafe window, then another, he spent three days recording everything to pass through his field of vision: the people walking by; the buses and driving-school cars caught in their routes; the pigeons moving suddenly en masse; a wedding (and then a funeral) at the church in the center of the square; the signs, symbols and slogans littering everything; and the darkness that finally absorbs it all. In &lt;i&gt;An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris&lt;/i&gt;, Perec compiled a melancholic, slightly eerie and oddly touching document in which existence boils down to rhythm, writing turns into time and the line between the empirical and the surreal grows surprisingly thin.</description>

  <description>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive love affair and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exit West&lt;/i&gt; follows these characters as they emerge into an alien and uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely of our time and for all time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt; is a work of children's literature by the English mathematician and author, the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, written under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy realm populated by grotesque figures like talking playing cards and anthropomorphic creatures. The Wonderland described in the tale plays with logic in ways that have made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of literary nonsense.</description>

  <description>The Penguin Modern Poets are succinct guides to the richness and diversity of contemporary poetry. Every volume brings together representative selections from the work of three poets now writing, allowing the curious reader and the seasoned lover of poetry to encounter the most exciting voices of our moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;". . . And I was grown up, with your face on,&lt;br /&gt;heating spice after spice to smoke out the smell of books, to burn&lt;br /&gt;the taste buds off this bitten tongue, avoid ever speaking of you."&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Emily Berry, 'Her Inheritance'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If you are not the free person you want to be you must find a place to tell the truth about that. To tell how things go for you."&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Anne Carson, 'Candor'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I had a moment there&lt;br /&gt;among the balustrades&lt;br /&gt;and once that moment had expired&lt;br /&gt;it graduated&lt;br /&gt;from a moment to a life"&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Sophie Collins, 'Dear No. 24601'&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Julia finds a slur about her best friend scrawled across the back of the Kingston School for the Deaf, she covers it up with a beautiful (albeit illegal) graffiti mural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her supposed best friend snitches, the principal expels her, and her two mothers set Julia up with a one-way ticket to a “mainstream” school in the suburbs, where she’s treated like an outcast as the only deaf student. The last thing she has left is her art, and not even Banksy himself could convince her to give that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out in the ’burbs, Julia paints anywhere she can, eager to claim some turf of her own. But Julia soon learns that she might not be the only vandal in town. Someone is adding to her tags, making them better, showing off—and showing Julia up in the process. She expected her art might get painted over by cops. But she never imagined getting dragged into a full-blown graffiti war.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Americanah &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;We Should All Be Feminists&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful new statement about feminism today--written as a letter to a friend. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele &lt;/i&gt;is Adichie's letter of response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions--compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive--for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can "allow" women to have full careers, &lt;i&gt;Dear Ijeawele&lt;/i&gt; goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.</description>

  <description>Although a very prolific poet—and arguably America’s greatest—Emily Dickinson (1830–1886) published fewer than a dozen of her eighteen hundred poems. Instead, she created at home small handmade books. When, in her later years, she stopped producing these, she was still writing a great deal, and at her death she left behind many poems, drafts, and letters. It is among the makeshift and fragile manuscripts of Dickinson’s later writings that we find the envelope poems gathered here. These manuscripts on envelopes (recycled by the poet with marked New England thrift) were written with the full powers of her late, most radical period. Intensely alive, these envelope poems are charged with a special poignancy—addressed to no one and everyone at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full-color facsimiles are accompanied by Marta L. Werner and Jen Bervin’s pioneering transcriptions of Dickinson’s handwriting. Their transcriptions allow us to read the texts, while the facsimiles let us see exactly what Dickinson wrote (the variant words, crossings-out, dashes, directional fields, spaces, columns, and overlapping planes).</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You probably think that Aled Last and I are going to fall in love or something. Since he is a boy and I am a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to say—we don’t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Janvier spends most of her time studying. When she’s not studying, she’s up in her room making fan art for her favorite podcast, &lt;i&gt;Universe City&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows Aled Last as that quiet boy who gets straight As. But no one knows he’s the creator of &lt;i&gt;Universe City&lt;/i&gt;, who goes by the name Radio Silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Frances gets a message from Radio Silence asking if she’ll collaborate with him, everything changes. Frances and Aled spend an entire summer working together and becoming best friends. They get each other when no one else does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Aled’s identity as Radio Silence is revealed, Frances fears that the future of &lt;i&gt;Universe City&lt;/i&gt;—and their friendship—is at risk. Aled helped her find her voice. Without him, will she have the courage to show the world who she really is? Or will she be met with radio silence?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You go through life thinking there’s so much you need…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until you leave with only your phone, your wallet, and a picture of your mother.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marin hasn’t spoken to anyone from her old life since the day she left everything behind. No one knows the truth about those final weeks. Not even her best friend, Mabel. But even thousands of miles away from the California coast, at college in New York, Marin still feels the pull of the life and tragedy she’s tried to outrun. Now, months later, alone in an emptied dorm for winter break, Marin waits. Mabel is coming to visit, and Marin will be forced to face everything that’s been left unsaid and finally confront the loneliness that has made a home in her heart.</description>

  <description>An intimate look at writing, running, and the incredible way they intersect, from the incomparable, bestselling author Haruki Murakami.While simply training for New York City Marathon would be enough for most people, Haruki Murakami's decided to write about it as well. The result is a beautiful memoir about his intertwined obsessions with running and writing, full of vivid memories and insights, including the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, &lt;b&gt;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in athletic pursuit.</description>

  <description>In this madcap journey, a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.</description>

  <description>Milk and honey' is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. 'milk and honey' takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;E. E. Cummings’s erotic poems and drawings gathered in a single volume.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago the prodigious and famously prolific E. E. Cummings sat in his study writing and thinking about sex. His private brooding gave way to poems and drawings of sexual and romantic love that delight and provoke. Here, collected for this first time in a single volume, are those erotic poems and sketches, culled from Cummings’s original manuscripts by the distinguished editor George James Firmage.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;em&gt;from “16”&lt;br /&gt; may i feel said he&lt;br /&gt; (i’ll squeal said she&lt;br /&gt; just once said he)&lt;br /&gt; it’s fun said she&lt;br /&gt; (may i touch said he&lt;br /&gt; how much said she&lt;br /&gt; a lot said he)&lt;br /&gt; why not said she&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 12 drawings.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now a  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;  bestseller and from the author of The Psychopath Test, a captivating and brilliant exploration of one of our world's most underappreciated forces: shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'It's about the terror, isn't it?'&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'The terror of what?' I said.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'The terror of being found out.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the past three years, Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us - people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they're being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people's faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Simultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be, &lt;i&gt;So You've Been Publicly Shamed&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws - and the very scary part we all play in it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Martin Toppy is the son of a famous Traveller and the father of my unborn child. He’s seventeen, I'm thirty-three. I was his teacher. I’d have killed myself by now if I was brave enough. I don’t think it would hurt the baby. His little heart would stop with mine. He wouldn't feel himself leaving one world of darkness for another, his spirit untangling itself from me.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melody Shee is alone and in trouble. Her husband doesn't take her news too well. She doesn't want to tell her father yet because he’s a good man and this could break him. She’s trying to stay in the moment, but the future is looming – larger by the day – while the past won’t let her go. What she did to Breedie Flynn all those years ago still haunts her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a good thing that she meets Mary Crothery when she does. Mary is a young Traveller woman, and she knows more about Melody than she lets on. She might just save Melody’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donal Ryan’s new novel is breathtaking, vivid, moving and redemptive.</description>

  <description>Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings.</description>

      <![CDATA[Absolutely delightful. I really wish I'd read this when I was a kid - I would have related to and loved Matilda so much! I like that this is a book for children that doesn't cater to them - it treats them like intelligent beings. The plot was exciting, the characters fun, and the themes interesti...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Modern Love&lt;/i&gt; is a unique crowdsourced book of letters, stories, and photographs about the state of modern romance by YouTuber Will Darbyshire. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Question 1. What would you say to your ex, without judgement?’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking closure after a tough break-up, Will Darbyshire was driven to strike up an intimate conversation with his online audience. Posting a series of questions via his YouTube, Twitter and Instagram channels, Will asked his followers to share their innermost thoughts about their relationship experiences, in the form of hand-written letters, poems, photographs, and emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months and over 15,000 heartfelt submissions later, from over 100 countries, &lt;i&gt;This Modern Love &lt;/i&gt;collects these letters together to form a compendium of 21st century love, structured into the beginning, middle and end of a relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tender, funny and cathartic, &lt;i&gt;This Modern Love&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling portrait of individual desires, resentments and fears that reminds us that, whether we're in or out of love, we're not alone.</description>

  <description>The acclaimed Pelican Shakespeare series, now in a dazzling new series design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This edition of Romeo and Juliet is edited with an introduction by Peter Holland and was recently repackaged with cover art by Manuja Waldia. Waldia received a Gold Medal from the Society of Illustrators for the Pelican Shakespeare series.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The legendary Pelican Shakespeare series features authoritative and meticulously researched texts paired with scholarship by renowned Shakespeareans. Each book includes an essay on the theatrical world of Shakespeare’s time, an introduction to the individual play, and a detailed note on the text used. Updated by general editors Stephen Orgel and A. R. Braunmuller, these easy-to-read editions incorporate over thirty years of Shakespeare scholarship undertaken since the original series, edited by Alfred Harbage, appeared between 1956 and 1967. With stunning new covers, definitive texts, and illuminating essays, the Pelican Shakespeare will remain a valued resource for students, teachers, and theater professionals for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

  <description>Savannah Brown's first collection of poetry is a vulnerable account of adolescence from someone in the thick of it. Written between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, with examinations of anxiety, death, first loves, and first lusts, GRAFFITI extends a hand to those undergoing the trials and uncertainty of teenagehood, and assures them they're not alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It was the perfect trip…until it wasn’t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen-year-old Jill Charron wakes up in a hospital room, leg in a cast, stitches in her face and a big blank canvas where the last six weeks should be. She discovers she was involved in a fatal car accident while on a school trip in Italy. A trip she doesn’t even remember taking. She was jetted home by her affluent father in order to receive quality care. Care that includes a lawyer. And a press team. Because maybe the accident…wasn’t an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the accident makes national headlines, Jill finds herself at the center of a murder investigation. It doesn’t help that the media is portraying her as a sociopath who killed her bubbly best friend, Simone, in a jealous rage. With the evidence mounting against her, there’s only one thing Jill knows for sure: She would never hurt Simone. But what really happened? Questioning who she can trust and what she’s capable of, Jill desperately tries to piece together the events of the past six weeks before she loses her thin hold on her once-perfect life.</description>

  <description>It was Sloane who yanked Emily out of her shell and made life 100% interesting. But right before what should have been the most epic summer, Sloane just…disappears. All she leaves behind is a to-do list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On it, thirteen Sloane-inspired tasks that Emily would normally never try. But what if they could bring her best friend back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apple picking at night?&lt;/i&gt; Okay, easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dance until dawn?&lt;/i&gt; Sure. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiss a stranger?&lt;/i&gt; Um... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily now has this unexpected summer, and the help of Frank Porter (&lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; unexpected), to check things off Sloane's list. Who knows what she’ll find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Go skinny-dipping?&lt;/i&gt; Wait...what?</description>

      <![CDATA[Morgan Matson is the epitome of YA contemporary. While I did have some minor issues with this book (it felt too long to me! and at the end that type of silly conflict happened that can be solved with just a 10 second conversation!), overall it's that summery joy that you sometimes crave.<br /><br...]]>

  <description>Though they have the vote and the Pill and haven't been burned as witches since 1727, life isn't exactly a stroll down the catwalk for modern women. They are beset by uncertainties and questions: Why are they supposed to get Brazilians? Why do bras hurt? Why the incessant talk about babies? And do men secretly hate them? Caitlin Moran interweaves provocative observations on women's lives with laugh-out-loud funny scenes from her own, from adolescence to her development as a writer, wife, and mother.</description>

  <description>Heartbreakingly funny, moving and vibrantly drawn, &lt;i&gt;Skim&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary book—a smart and sensitive graphic novel of the highest literary and artistic quality, by and about young women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Skim" is Kimberly Keiko Cameron, a not-slim, would-be Wiccan goth who goes to a private girls' school. When Skim's classmate Katie Matthews is dumped by her boyfriend, who then kills himself, the entire school goes into mourning overdrive. As concerned guidance counselors provide lectures on the "cycle of grief," and the popular clique starts a new club (Girls Celebrate Life!) to bolster school spirit, Skim sinks into an ever-deepening depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And falling in love only makes things worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suicide, depression, love, being gay or not, crushes, cliques, and finding a way to be your own fully human self—are all explored in this brilliant collaboration by cousins Mariko and Jillian Tamaki. An edgy, keenly observed and poignant glimpse into the heartache of being young.</description>

  <description>Katie’s got it pretty good. She’s a talented young chef, she runs a successful restaurant, and she has big plans to open an even better one. Then, all at once, progress on the new location bogs down, her charming ex-boyfriend pops up, her fling with another chef goes sour, and her best waitress gets badly hurt. And just like that, Katie’s life goes from pretty good to not so much. What she needs is a second chance. Everybody deserves one, after all—but they don’t come easy. Luckily for Katie, a mysterious girl appears in the middle of the night with simple instructions for a do-it-yourself do-over:&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; 1. &lt;i&gt;Write your mistake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. &lt;i&gt;Ingest one mushroom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 3. &lt;i&gt;Go to sleep&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 4. &lt;i&gt;Wake anew&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; And just like that, all the bad stuff never happened, and Katie is given another chance to get things right. She’s also got a dresser drawer full of magical mushrooms—and an irresistible urge to make her life not just good, but perfect. Too bad it’s against the rules. But Katie doesn’t care about the rules—and she’s about to discover the unintended consequences of the best intentions.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; From the mind and pen behind the acclaimed Scott Pilgrim series comes a madcap new tale of existential angst, everyday obstacles, young love, and ancient spirits that’s sharp-witted and tenderhearted, whimsical and wise.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover for this isbn can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3480930-the-catcher-in-the-rye" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his debut in 1951 as &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt;, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Magical realism, lyrical prose, and the pain and passion of human love haunt this hypnotic generational saga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foolish love appears to be the Roux family birthright, an ominous forecast for its most recent progeny, Ava Lavender. Ava—in all other ways a normal girl—is born with the wings of a bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest to understand her peculiar disposition and a growing desire to fit in with her peers, sixteen-year old Ava ventures into the wider world, ill-prepared for what she might discover and naïve to the twisted motives of others. Others like the pious Nathaniel Sorrows, who mistakes Ava for an angel and whose obsession with her grows until the night of the Summer Solstice celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, the skies open up, rain and feathers fill the air, and Ava’s quest and her family’s saga build to a devastating crescendo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First-time author Leslye Walton has constructed a layered and unforgettable mythology of what it means to be born with hearts that are tragically, exquisitely human.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;True love isn’t always about the big romantic gestures.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it’s about sympathizing with someone whose tea has gone cold or reading together and sharing a quilt. When two people move in together, it soon becomes apparent that the little things mean an awful lot. The throwaway moments in life become meaningful when you spend them in the company of someone you love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;SOPPY&lt;/i&gt; is Philippa Rice’s collection of comics and illustrations based on real-life moments with her boyfriend. From grocery shopping to silly arguments and snuggling in front of the television, &lt;i&gt;SOPPY&lt;/i&gt; captures the universal experience of sharing a life together, and celebrates the beauty of finding romance all around us.</description>

  <description>The unforgettable first novel that established Isabel Allende as one of the world’s most gifted and imaginative storytellers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The House of the Spirits brings to life the triumphs and tragedies of three generations of the Trueba family. The patriarch Esteban is a volatile, proud man whose voracious pursuit of political power is tempered only by his love for his delicate wife, Clara, a woman with a mystical connection to the spirit world. When their daughter Blanca embarks on a forbidden love affair in defiance of her implacable father, the result is an unexpected gift to Esteban: his adored granddaughter Alba, a beautiful and strong-willed child who will lead her family and her country into a revolutionary future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most important novels of the twentieth century, The House of the Spirits is an enthralling epic that spans decades and lives, weaving the personal and the political into a universal story of love, magic, and fate.</description>

  <description>Gaspereau Press' best-selling title, &lt;i&gt;Execution Poems&lt;/i&gt;, is George Elliott Clarke's complex lament for his late cousins, George and Rue – two Black men who were hanged for the murder of a taxi driver. After the overwhelming interest generated by the original limited letterpress edition of &lt;i&gt;Execution Poems&lt;/i&gt;, Gaspereau Press released this trade edition which went on to win Canada's highest literary honour in 2001. The jurors of the Governor General's Literary Award called this book "raging, gristly, public — and unflinchingly beautiful," and remarked on Clarke's "explosive, original language."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1949, George and Rufus Hamilton were hanged for the murder of a taxi driver in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Fifty years later, Clarke has written, in his abundant style, a series of poems that embody both damnation and redemption, offering convoluted triumphs alongside tragedy and blurring the line between perpetrator and victim. What Clarke presents in &lt;i&gt;Execution Poems&lt;/i&gt; is uncomfortable. He reminds us of racism and poverty; of their brutal, tragic results. He reminds us of society's vengefulness. He blurs the line between the perpetrator and the victim — a line we'd prefer remain simple and clear. At the heart of it, Clarke is frustrating the notion that society deals any better with these issues today than it did in the 1940s.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Girls Standing on Lawns&lt;/i&gt; is a unique collaboration between renowned artist and bestselling children’s book author Maira Kalman and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling writer Daniel Handler, better known as Lemony Snicket. This clever book contains 40 vintage photographs from the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, more than a dozen original paintings by Kalman inspired by the photographs, and brief, lyrical texts by Handler. Poetic and thought-provoking, &lt;i&gt;Girls Standing on Lawns&lt;/i&gt; is a meditation on memories, childhood, nostalgia, home, family, and the act of seeing. The gorgeous visual material sets the stage for what Handler succinctly describes as “a photograph, a painting, a sentence, a pose.” Girls, women, families, and even pets from days gone by grace the pages, looking out at us, enticing readers to imagine these people, their lives—and where they have gone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of One Blood&lt;/i&gt; is the last of four novels written by Pauline Hopkins. She is considered by some to be "the most prolific African-American woman writer and the most influential literary editor of the first decade of the twentieth century, though she is one of the lesser known literary figures of the much lauded Harlem Renaissance. &lt;i&gt;Of One Blood&lt;/i&gt; first appeared in serial form in &lt;i&gt;Colored American Magazine&lt;/i&gt; in the November and December 1902 and the January 1903 issues of the publication, during the four-year period that Hopkins served as its editor. &lt;br /&gt; Hopkins tells the story of Reuel Briggs, a medical student who couldn't care less about being black and appreciating African history, but finds himself in Ethiopia on an archeological trip. His motive is to raid the country of lost treasures -- which he does find in the ancient land. However, he discovers much more than he bargained for: the painful truth about blood, race, and the half of his history that was never told. Hopkins wrote the novel intending, in her own words, to "raise the stigma of degradation from [the Black] race." The title, &lt;i&gt;Of One Blood,&lt;/i&gt; refers to the biological kinship of all human beings.</description>

  <description>Bod is an unusual boy who inhabits an unusual place - he's the only living resident of a graveyard. Raised from infancy by the ghosts, werewolves, and other cemetery denizens, Bod has learned the antiquated customs of his guardians' time as well as their timely ghostly teachings-like the ability to Fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can a boy raised by ghosts face the wonders and terrors of the worlds of both the living and the dead? And then there are things like ghouls that aren't really one thing or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chilling tale is Neil Gaiman's first full-length novel for middle-grade readers since the internationally bestselling and universally acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Coraline&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Saul Indian Horse has hit bottom. His last binge almost killed him, and now he’s a reluctant resident in a treatment centre for alcoholics, surrounded by people he’s sure will never understand him. But Saul wants peace, and he grudgingly comes to see that he’ll find it only through telling his story. With him, readers embark on a journey back through the life he’s led as a northern Ojibway, with all its joys and sorrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With compassion and insight, author Richard Wagamese traces through his fictional characters the decline of a culture and a cultural way. For Saul, taken forcibly from the land and his family when he’s sent to residential school, salvation comes for a while through his incredible gifts as a hockey player. But in the harsh realities of 1960s Canada, he battles obdurate racism and the spirit-destroying effects of cultural alienation and displacement. &lt;em&gt;Indian Horse&lt;/em&gt; unfolds against the bleak loveliness of northern Ontario, all rock, marsh, bog and cedar. Wagamese writes with a spare beauty, penetrating the heart of a remarkable Ojibway man.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; The instant #1 NEW YORK TIMES Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A must read for anyone hoping to live a creative life... I dare you not to be inspired to be brave, to be free, and to be curious.” —PopSugar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the worldwide bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Eat Pray Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;City of Girls&lt;/i&gt;: the path to the vibrant, fulfilling life you’ve dreamed of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Readers of all ages and walks of life have drawn inspiration and empowerment from Elizabeth Gilbert’s books for years. Now this beloved author digs deep into her own generative process to share her wisdom and unique perspective about creativity. With profound empathy and radiant generosity, she offers potent insights into the mysterious nature of inspiration. She asks us to embrace our curiosity and let go of needless suffering. She shows us how to tackle what we most love, and how to face down what we most fear. She discusses the attitudes, approaches, and habits we need in order to live our most creative lives. Balancing between soulful spirituality and cheerful pragmatism, Gilbert encourages us to uncover the “strange jewels” that are hidden within each of us. Whether we are looking to write a book, make art, find new ways to address challenges in our work, embark on a dream long deferred, or simply infuse our everyday lives with more mindfulness and passion, &lt;i&gt;Big Magic&lt;/i&gt; cracks open a world of wonder and joy.</description>

  <description>Midnight picnics at the Eiffel Tower; wine tastings paired with blowgun lessons; and romance in cafés, cemeteries, and at the Brandenberg Gate--these are just some of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling cartoonist Lucy Knisley's experiences on her 2011 European book tour. &lt;i&gt;An Age of License&lt;/i&gt; is both a graphic travelogue and a journal of her trip abroad. Fans of Knisley's food-focused autobiography (&lt;i&gt;French Milk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Relish&lt;/i&gt;) savor her mouth-watering drawings and descriptions of culinary delights, seasons with cute cat cameos. But &lt;i&gt;An Age of License&lt;/i&gt; is not all kittens and raclette crepes: Knisley's account of her adventures is colored by anxieties about her life and career, depicted with fearlessness, relatability, and honesty, making &lt;i&gt;An Age of License&lt;/i&gt; an &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; for the &lt;i&gt;Girls&lt;/i&gt; generation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A hilarious romantic comedy about kleptomania and booklovers&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pascal is in a bad place. He’s out of work, he and his longtime girlfriend have just broken up, and when he goes out for a run to ease his frazzled nerves, he falls and injures his back so badly that he’s strictly forbidden from running. What’s an endorphin-loving cartoonist to do? In a bid to distract himself, Pascal throws himself into his other pleasure: reading. And while at the bookstore one day, he spies a young woman picking up his own book. But then she darts out of the shop without paying. Bemused, he decides to figure out why she did it.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Petty Theft&lt;/i&gt; showcases the wry, self-aware with Pascal Girard became known for in his books &lt;i&gt;Réunion&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bigfoot&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

From the magic of dating, lust, falling in love and true friendship to the horrors of falling out of love, ghosting, paranoia and misunderstandings - it is all here and universally familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laugh and cringe knowing that you've been there too and will probably go there again but that it's OK because so will everyone.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Frankie Landau-Banks has grown up a lot over the summer. She's no longer daddy's little girl - and almost immediately after starting the new semester at her highly prestigious school, she bags goofy-but-gorgeous Matthew Livingston as her boyfriend. They get along great but then Frankie discovers that Matthew is a member of a boys-only secret society that specialise in 'hilarious' pranks. Which hardly seems fair... especially when Frankie knows she's smarter than any of its members. And to prove this, she's going to teach them a lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impersonating lead member Alpha by using a fake email account is surprisingly easy, and soon Frankie is setting the boys up with all sorts of ridiculous schemes and sending them on wild goose chase after wild goose chase. Alpha's not prepared to lose face and admit it's not him sending the emails - but the fun can't last forever, and soon Frankie will have to choose between what she think she wants, and the reputation she deserves.</description>

  <description>An affecting and hope-filled posthumous collection of essays and stories from the talented young Yale graduate whose title essay captured the world’s attention in 2012 and turned her into an icon for her generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marina Keegan’s star was on the rise when she graduated magna cum laude from Yale in May 2012. She had a play that was to be produced at the New York International Fringe Festival and a job waiting for her at the New Yorker. Tragically, five days after graduation, Marina died in a car crash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her family, friends, and classmates, deep in grief, joined to create a memorial service for Marina, her unforgettable last essay for the Yale Daily News, “The Opposite of Loneliness,” went viral, receiving more than 1.4 million hits. She had struck a chord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though she was just twenty-two when she died, Marina left behind a rich, expansive trove of prose that, like her title essay, captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation. The Opposite of Loneliness is an assem­blage of Marina’s essays and stories that, like The Last Lecture, articulates the universal struggle that all of us face as we figure out what we aspire to be and how we can harness our talents to make an impact on the world.</description>

  <description>Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles?&lt;p&gt;Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house "spark joy" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Customer (holding up a book): What’s this? The Secret Garden? Well, it’s not so secret now, is it, since they bloody well wrote a book about it!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops was a Sunday Times bestseller, and could be found displayed on bookshop counters up and down the country. The response to the book from booksellers all over the world has been one of heartfelt agreement: it would appear that customers are saying bizarre things all over the place - from asking for books with photographs of Jesus in them, to hunting for the best horse owner’s manual that has a detailed chapter on unicorns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Customer: I had such a crush on Captain Hook when I was younger. Do you think this means I have unresolved issues?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops has yet more tales from the antiquarian bookshop where Jen Campbell works, and includes a selection of ‘Weird Things...’ sent in from other booksellers across the world. The book is illustrated by the BAFTA winning Brothers McLeod.</description>

  <description>"Is it me you love, friend? or the race that made me?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gothic novella about love, torment and doomed aristocracy, set in the remote mountains of Spain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introducing Little Black Classics: 80 books for Penguin's 80th birthday. Little Black Classics celebrate the huge range and diversity of Penguin Classics, with books from around the world and across many centuries.

Stevenson's works available in Penguin Classics are An Apology for Idlers, The Black Arrow, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, In the South Seas, Kidnapped, The Master of Ballantrae, Treasure Island and Selected Poems.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Unrequited love, underage drinking, and teen angst rule at a high school for mutants and witches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; illustrator Jillian Tamaki is best known for co-creating the award-winning young adult graphic novels &lt;em&gt;Skim&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;This One Summer&lt;/em&gt;—moody and atmospheric bestsellers. &lt;em&gt;SuperMutant Magic Academy&lt;/em&gt;, which she has been serializing online for the past four years, paints a teenaged world filled with just as much ennui and uncertainty, but also with a sharp dose of humor and irreverence. Tamaki deftly plays superhero and high-school Hollywood tropes against what adolescence is really like: The SuperMutant Magic Academy is a prep school for mutants and witches, but their paranormal abilities take a backseat to everyday teen concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science experiments go awry, bake sales are upstaged, and the new kid at school is a cat who will determine the course of human destiny. In one strip, lizard-headed Trixie frets about her nonexistent modeling career; in another, the immortal Everlasting Boy tries to escape this mortal coil to no avail. Throughout it all, closeted Marsha obsesses about her unrequited crush, the cat-eared Wendy. Whether the magic is mundane or miraculous, Tamaki’s jokes are precise and devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;SuperMutant Magic Academy&lt;/em&gt; has won two Ignatz Awards. This volume combines the most popular content from the webcomic with a selection of all-new, never-before-seen strips that conclude Tamaki’s account of life at the academy.</description>

  <description>This Sunday Times bestseller is a miscellany of hilarious and peculiar bookshop moments: 'Can books conduct electricity?'&lt;br /&gt;'My children are just climbing your bookshelves: that's ok... isn't it?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A John Cleese Twitter question ['What is your pet peeve?'], first sparked the 'Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops' blog, which grew over three years into one bookseller's collection of ridiculous conversations on the shop floor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 'Did Beatrix Potter ever write a book about dinosaurs?' to the hunt for a paperback which could forecast the next year's weather; and from 'I've forgotten my glasses, please read me the first chapter' to 'Excuse me... is this book edible?: here is a book for heroic booksellers and booklovers everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This full-length collection illustrated by the Brothers McLeod also includes top 'Weird Things' from bookshops around the world.</description>

  <description>Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames he’s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on some grand space-faring adventure.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage gamers with anger issues don’t get chosen to save the universe.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then he sees the flying saucer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even stranger, the alien ship he’s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called &lt;i&gt;Armada&lt;/i&gt;—in which gamers just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No, Zack hasn’t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he’s seeing is all too real. And his skills—as well as those of millions of gamers across the world—are going to be needed to save the earth from what’s about to befall it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s Zack’s chance, at last, to play the hero. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can’t help thinking back to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with, and wondering: Doesn’t something about this scenario seem a little…familiar?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At once gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as only Ernest Cline could, &lt;i&gt;Armada&lt;/i&gt; is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming of age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you’ve ever read before—one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy that has helped make &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt; a phenomenon.</description>

  <description>Anda loves Coarsegold Online, the massively-multiplayer role-playing game where she spends most of her free time. It's a place where she can be a leader, a fighter, a hero. It's a place where she can meet people from all over the world, and make friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things become a lot more complicated when Anda befriends a gold farmer--a poor Chinese kid whose avatar in the game illegally collects valuable objects and then sells them to players from developed countries with money to burn. This behavior is strictly against the rules in Coarsegold, but Anda soon comes to realize that questions of right and wrong are a lot less straightforward when a real person's real livelihood is at stake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From acclaimed teen author (&lt;i&gt;Little Brother&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;For the Win&lt;/i&gt;) and Boing Boing editor Cory Doctorow and &lt;i&gt;Koko Be Good&lt;/i&gt; creator Jen Wang, &lt;i&gt;In Real Life&lt;/i&gt; is a perceptive and high-stakes look at adolescence, gaming, poverty, and culture clash.</description>

  <description>Raleigh doesn't have a soul. A cat stole it – at least that's what she tells people – at least that's what she would tell people if she told people anything. But that would mean talking to people, and the mere thought of social interaction is terrifying. How did such a shy teenage girl end up in a car with three of her hooligan classmates on a cross-country road trip? Being forced to interact with kids her own age is a new and alarming proposition for Raleigh, but maybe it's just what she needs – or maybe it can help her find what she needs – or maybe it can help her to realize that what she needs has been with her all along.</description>

  <description>Het bewogen leven van Vincent van Gogh blijft een onuitputtelijke inspiratiebron. Stripmaker Barbara Stok neemt in dit verhaal de lezer mee naar de korte, intense periode die de schilder in Zuid-Frankrijk doorbrengt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vincent droomt ervan in Arles een kunstenaarshuis te stichten voor zichzelf en zijn artistieke vrienden. Maar door aanvallen waarin hij volledig in de war is, uitmondend in het beruchte oorincident, valt die droom in duigen. Zijn broer Theo blijft hem onvoorwaardelijk steunen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Gogh was een kunstenaar vol hartstocht voor zijn vak. Zijn ideeën over succes, tegenslag en een zinvol leven vormen een interessant tegenwicht in onze tijd van individualisme, maakbaarheid en economisch denken. Zo maakt Stok van de belevenissen van deze 19de-eeuwse schilder weer een actueel verhaal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An artistic collection of more than 50 drawings featuring unique, funny, and poignant foreign words that have no direct translation into English.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that the Japanese language has a word to express the way sunlight filters through the leaves of trees? Or that there’s a Finnish word for the distance a reindeer can travel before needing to rest? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;/i&gt; brings to life more than fifty words that don’t have direct English translations with charming illustrations of their tender, poignant, and humorous definitions. Often these words provide insight into the cultures they come from, such as the Brazilian Portuguese word for running your fingers through a lover’s hair, the Italian word for being moved to tears by a story, or the Swedish word for a third cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this clever and beautifully rendered exploration of the subtleties of communication, you’ll find new ways to express yourself while getting lost in the artistry of imperfect translation.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Steal Like an Artist&lt;/em&gt;, Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by “stealing” from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey—getting known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt; Show Your Work!&lt;/em&gt; is about why generosity trumps genius. It’s about getting &lt;em&gt;findable&lt;/em&gt;, about using the network instead of wasting time “networking.” It’s not self-promotion, it’s self-discovery—let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, &lt;em&gt;Show Your Work!&lt;/em&gt; offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In chapters such as&lt;strong&gt; You Don’t Have to Be a Genius&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Share Something Small Every Day&lt;/strong&gt;; and &lt;strong&gt;Stick Around&lt;/strong&gt;, Kleon creates a user’s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity— what he calls the “ecology of talent.” From broader life lessons about work (you can’t find your voice if you don’t use it) to the etiquette of sharing—and the dangers of oversharing—to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it’s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Four talented teenagers are traumatized-coping with grief, surviving date rape, facing the anxiety of standardized tests and the neglect of self-absorbed adults--and they'll do anything to escape the pressure. They'll even build an invisible helicopter, to fly far away to a place where everyone will understand them... until they learn the only way to escape reality is to face it head-on.</description>

  <description>Megan doesn't speak. She hasn't spoken in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pushing away the people she cares about is just a small price to pay. Because there are things locked inside Megan's head - things that are screaming to be heard - that she cannot, must not, let out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Jasmine starts at school: bubbly, beautiful, talkative Jasmine. And for reasons Megan can't quite understand, life starts to look a bit brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Megan would love to speak again, and it seems like Jasmine might be the answer. But if she finds her voice, will she lose everything else?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'All human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published as a &lt;i&gt;shilling shocker&lt;/i&gt;, Robert Louis Stevenson's dark psychological fantasy gave birth to the idea of the split personality. The story of respectable Dr Jekyll's strange association with &lt;i&gt;damnable young man&lt;/i&gt; Edward Hyde; the hunt through fog-bound London for a killer; and the final revelation of Hyde's true identity is a chilling exploration of humanity's basest capacity for evil.</description>

  <description>Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes never meant to get into the family business. But when you’re the sister of Bram and the niece of Sherlock, vampire hunting and mystery solving are in your blood. And when two society girls go missing, there’s no one more qualified to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fierce Evaline and logical Mina must resolve their rivalry, navigate the advances of not just one but three mysterious gentlemen, and solve murder with only one clue: a strange Egyptian scarab. The stakes are high. If Stoker and Holmes don’t unravel why the belles of London society are in such danger, they’ll become the next victims.</description>

  <description>Sometimes danger is hard to see... until it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Britt Pfeiffer has trained to backpack the Teton Range, but she isn't prepared when her ex-boyfriend, who still haunts her every thought, wants to join her. Before Britt can explore her feelings for Calvin, an unexpected blizzard forces her to seek shelter in a remote cabin, accepting the hospitality of its two very handsome occupants—but these men are fugitives, and they take her hostage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In exchange for her life, Britt agrees to guide the men off the mountain. As they set off, Britt knows she must stay alive long enough for Calvin to find her. The task is made even more complicated when Britt finds chilling evidence of a series of murders that have taken place there... and in uncovering this, she may become the killer’s next target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing is as it seems in the mountains, and everyone is keeping secrets, including Mason, one of her kidnappers. His kindness is confusing Britt. Is he an enemy? Or an ally?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLACK ICE is New York Times bestselling author Becca Fitzpatrick’s riveting romantic thriller set against the treacherous backdrop of the mountains of Wyoming. Falling in love should never be this dangerous…</description>

  <description>Lea and Gale are in the same creative writing class. They get the same pop culture references, order the same Chinese food, and hang out in the same places. Unfortunately, Lea is a little aloof, Gabe is shy, and it looks like they are never going to work things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; is happening between them, and &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; can see it. Their creative writing teacher pushes them together. The baristas at the local Starbucks watch their relationship like a TV series. The bus driver tells his wife about them. The waitress at the diner automatically seats them together. Even the squirrel who lives on the college green believes Lea and Gabe were meant to be together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fall in love with falling in love with this irresistibly romantic, completely original novel!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Medium is the Massage&lt;/i&gt; is Marshall McLuhan's most condensed, and perhaps most effective, presentation of his ideas. Using a layout style that was later copied by &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;, McLuhan and coauthor/designer Quentin Fiore combine word and image to illustrate and enact the ideas that were first put forward in the dense and poorly organized &lt;i&gt;Understanding Media&lt;/i&gt;. McLuhan's ideas about the nature of media, the increasing speed of communication, and the technological basis for our understanding of who we are come to life in this slender volume. Although originally printed in 1967, the art and style in &lt;i&gt;The Medium is the Massage&lt;/i&gt; seem as fresh today as in the summer of love, and the ideas are even more resonant now that computer interfaces are becoming gateways to the global village.</description>

      <![CDATA[The ideas are genius and brilliant and groundbreaking even today, but the graphic design element felt a little messy and random to me, and at time the writing would get superfluous. Much recommended, though, to learn about this important process of thought! Also, it's super super quick!]]>

  <description>Can an atheist be saved? The New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Crank&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tricks&lt;/i&gt; explores the highly charged landscapes of faith and forgiveness with brilliant sensitivity and emotional resonance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"There is no God, no benevolent ruler of the earth, no omnipotent grand poobah of countless universes. Because if there was ... my little brother would still be fishing or playing basketball instead of fertilizing cemetery vegetation."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew Turner doesn't have faith in anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not in family—his is a shambles after his younger brother was bullied into suicide. Not in so-called friends who turn their backs when things get tough. Not in some all-powerful creator who lets too much bad stuff happen. And certainly not in some "It Gets Better" psychobabble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what his girlfriend Hayden says about faith and forgiveness, there's no way Matt's letting go of blame. He's decided to "live large and go out with a huge bang," and whatever happens happens. But when a horrific event plunges Matt into a dark, silent place, he hears a rumble … a rumble that wakes him up, calling everything he's ever disbelieved into question.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the mountains of Northern China ancient custom demands that every man have a wife to keep him company in the afterlife.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deshi Li's brother is dead—and unmarried. Which means that Deshi must find him an eligible body before the week is up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily Chen, sweet as a snakebite, needs money and a fast ride out of town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the gods of their ancestors and the expectations of the new world, Deshi and Lily embark on a journey with two very different destinations in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They travel through a land where the ground is hard and the graves are shallow, where marriage can be murder and where Lily Chen is wanted—dead and alive.</description>

  <description>The protagonist of &lt;i&gt;The Hole&lt;/i&gt; has discovered a hole in his apartment and tries to find an explanation for it. He seeks expert advice. But not everything can be explained. Perhaps he'll just have to accept that the hole is there? &lt;i&gt;The Hole&lt;/i&gt; has simple, expressive drawings created by pen and computer, and there's a hole punched right through the book, so it really exists, even if it can't be explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comic yet philosophical, simple yet deeply expressive, &lt;i&gt;The Hole&lt;/i&gt; is quite simply—brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hello, I've discovered a hole in my apartment. . . . It moves. . . . If you could come take a look. . . . Bring it down, you say? What? Hello?!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in 1972, &lt;b&gt;Øyvind Torseter&lt;/b&gt; is an artist and one of Norway's most acclaimed illustrators. He employs both traditional and digital picture techniques and has created six picture books on his own and many others with different authors. Torseter has received numerous prizes for his books, which have been translated into many languages. &lt;i&gt;My Father's Arms Are A Boat&lt;/i&gt; (Enchanted Lion Books, 2012) was his first book to be published in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

Two years ago, only Judith returned, permanently mutilated, reviled and ignored by those who were once her friends and family.   Unable to speak, Judith lives like a ghost in her own home, silently pouring out her thoughts to the boy who's owned her heart as long as she can remember--even if he doesn't know it--her childhood friend, Lucas.   But when Roswell Station is attacked, long-buried secrets come to light, and Judith is forced to choose: continue to live in silence, or recover her voice, even if it means changing her world, and the lives around her, forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longlisted for the Carnegie Medal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A 2014 Edgar Award nominee for YA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A YALSA Best Fiction for Young Adults Top Ten title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A Junior Library Guild Selection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A &lt;i&gt;School Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;Best Book of 2013 and 2014 "Battle of the Books" contender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; Best Teen Book for 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A &lt;i&gt;Horn Book &lt;/i&gt;Fanfare 2013 title&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A 2014 TAYSHAS Top Ten Pick&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>All Jin Wang wants is to fit in. When his family moves to a new neighborhood, he suddenly finds that he's the only Chinese American student at his school. Jocks and bullies pick on him constantly, and he has hardly any friends. Then, to make matters worse, he falls in love with an all-American girl...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born to rule over all the monkeys in the world, the story of the Monkey King is one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables. Adored by his subjects, master of the arts of kung-fu, he is the most powerful monkey on earth. But the Monkey King doesn't want to be a monkey. He wants to be hailed as a god...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, and he's ruining his cousin Danny's life. Danny's a popular kid at school, but every year Chin-Kee comes to visit, and every year Danny has to transfer to a new school to escape the shame. This year, though, things quickly go from bad to worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three apparently unrelated tales come together with an unexpected twist, in a modern fable that is hilarious, poignant and action-packed. &lt;i&gt;American Born Chinese&lt;/i&gt; is an amazing rise, all the way up to the astonishing climax--and confirms what a growing number of readers already know: Gene Yang is a major talent.</description>

  <description>From breathtaking stop-action animation to bittersweet modern fairy tales, filmmaker &lt;b&gt;Tim Burton&lt;/b&gt; has become known for his unique visual brilliance – witty and macabre at once. Now he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic children – misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the sweetness and the tragedy of these dark yet simple beings – hopeful, hapless heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world we have long left behind (mostly anyway).</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate Cover Edition for ISBN-13: 9780812974621&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in 1921, &lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; is set in the One State, where all live for the collective good and individual freedom does not exist. The novel takes the form of the diary of mathematician D-503, who, to his shock, experiences the most disruptive emotion imaginable: love. At once satirical and sobering—and now available in a powerful new translation—&lt;i&gt;We&lt;/i&gt; is both a rediscovered classic and a work of tremendous relevance to our own times.</description>

  <description>This award winning novel will soon be released as a movie starring Saoirse Ronan as Daisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old New Yorker Daisy is sent to live in the English countryside with cousins she’s never even met. When England is attacked and occupied by an unnamed enemy, the cousins find themselves on their own. Power fails, system fail. As they grow more isolated, the farm becomes a kind of Eden, with no rules. Until the war arrives in their midst.&lt;br /&gt;          Daisy’s is a war story, a survival story, a love story—all told in the voice of a subversive and witty teenager. This book crackles with anxiety and with lust. It’s a stunning and unforgettable first novel that captures the essence of the age of terrorism: how we live now.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed as a quiet triumph and a brutally moving work of art, the first volume of Art Spieglman's &lt;i&gt;Maus&lt;/i&gt; introduced readers to Vladek Spiegleman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe, and his son, a cartoonist trying to come to terms with his father, his father's terrifying story, and History itself. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), succeeds perfectly in shocking us out of any lingering sense of familiararity with the events described, approaching, as it does, the unspeakable through the diminutive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This second volume, subtitled &lt;i&gt;And Here My Troubles Began&lt;/i&gt;, moves us from the barracks of Auschwitz to the bungalows of the Catskills. Genuinely tragic and comic by turns, it attains a complexity of theme and a precision of thought new to comics and rare in any medium. &lt;i&gt;Maus&lt;/i&gt; ties together two powerful stories: Vladek's harrowing tale of survival against all odds, delineating the paradox of daily life in the death camps, and the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. At every level this is the ultimate survivor's tale - and that too of the children who somehow survive even the survivors.</description>

  <description>Mindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence “Can I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I’ll shut up about it?” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages). If so, you’ve come to the right book, mostly!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, &lt;/i&gt;Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood, with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door—not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An epic battle between good and evil...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he knew about the Roses, 16-year-old Jack lived an unremarkable life in the small Ohio town of Trinity. Only the medicine he has to take daily and the thick scar above his heart set him apart from the other high schoolers. Then one day Jack skips his medicine. Suddenly, he is stronger, fiercer, and more confident than ever before. And it feels great - until he loses control of his own strength and nearly kills another player during soccer team tryouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Jack learns the startling truth about himself: he is Weirlind, part of an underground society of magical people who live among us. At their helm sits the feuding houses of the Red Rose and the White Rose, whose power is determined by playing The Game - a magical tournament in which each house sponsors a warrior to fight to the death. The winning house rules the Weir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if his bizarre heritage isn't enough, Jack finds out that he's not just another member of Weirlind - he's one of the last of the warriors - at a time when both houses are scouting for a player.</description>

  <description>Gordon Comstock loathes dull, middle-class respectability and worship of money. He gives up a 'good job' in advertising to work part-time in a bookshop, giving him more time to write. But he slides instead into a self-induced poverty that destroys his creativity and his spirit. Only Rosemary, ever-faithful Rosemary, has the strength to challenge his commitment to his chosen way of life. Through the character of Gordon Comstock, Orwell reveals his own disaffection with the society he once himself renounced. Enlivened with vivid autobiographical detail, George Orwell's &lt;i&gt;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&lt;/i&gt; is a tragically witty account of the struggle to escape from a materialistic existence, with an introduction by Peter Davison in Penguin Modern Classics.</description>

  <description>Young Tristran Thorn will do anything to win the cold heart of beautiful Victoria - even fetch her the star they watch fall from the night sky. But to do so, he must enter the unexplored lands on the other side of the ancient wall that gives their tiny village its name. Beyond that old stone wall, Tristran learns, lies Faerie - where nothing, not even a fallen star, is what he imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Neil Gaiman comes a remarkable quest into the dark and miraculous - in pursuit of love and the utterly impossible.</description>

  <description>After years of homeschooling, Maggie is starting high school. It's pretty terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie's big brothers are there to watch her back, but ever since Mom left it just hasn't been the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides her brothers, Maggie's never had any real friends before. Lucy and Alistair don't have lots of friends either. But they eat lunch with her at school and bring her along on their small-town adventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missing mothers...distant brothers...high school...new friends... It's a lot to deal with. But there's just one more thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAGGIE IS HAUNTED.</description>

  <description>Ten thousand years ago, in what would one day be known as North America, Young Hunter set out on an epic quest to overcome the Stone Giants who were terrorizing his people. Pitted against creatures of legend, Young Hunter journeyed to the innermost heart of his own humanity, even meeting the very gods of the land. He was entrusted with his tribe's most dangerous secret, a weapon that would change mankind forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the classic Joseph Bruchac novel, Will Davis brings a timeless story to life, as the lore of old spawns a thrilling new kind of graphic novel. Drawing from the enduring creation myths of the Abenaki nation, &lt;i&gt;Dawn Land &lt;/i&gt;immerses readers in Young Hunter's vision quest and offers a fresh perspective on the Native American experience.</description>

      <![CDATA[THE ART, MAN, I DONT KNOW. One the one hand it felt really dramatic and organic and earthy and cool, but on the other hand it was too dark and hard to decipher and missing detail. Art is really subjective though, so what I see as too dark you might see as perfect. I would have liked a little more...]]>

  <description>Of all the things Anya expected to find at the bottom of an old well, a new friend was not one of them. Especially not a new friend who’s been dead for a century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling down a well is bad enough, but Anya's normal life might actually be worse. She's embarrassed by her family, self-conscious about her body, and she's pretty much given up on fitting in at school. A new friend--even a ghost--is just what she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Anya's new B.F.F. isn't kidding about the "forever" part...</description>

  <description>Every summer, Rose goes with her mom and dad to a lake house in Awago Beach. It's their getaway, their refuge. Rosie's friend Windy is always there, too, like the little sister she never had. But this summer is different. Rose's mom and dad won't stop fighting, and when Rose and Windy seek a distraction from the drama, they find themselves with a whole new set of problems. It's a summer of secrets and sorrow and growing up, and it's a good thing Rose and Windy have each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;This One Summer&lt;/i&gt; two stellar creators redefine the teen graphic novel. Cousins Mariko and Jillian Tamaki, the team behind &lt;i&gt;Skim&lt;/i&gt;, have collaborated on this gorgeous, heartbreaking, and ultimately hopeful story about a girl on the cusp of her teen age—a story of renewal and revelation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you . . . " &lt;/b&gt;From the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fangirl&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Landline&lt;/i&gt; comes a hilarious and heartfelt novel about love in the workplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail. (Everybody in the newsroom knows. It's company policy.) But they can't quite bring themselves to take it seriously. They go on sending each other endless and endlessly hilarious e-mails, discussing every aspect of their personal lives.Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now- reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be "internet security officer," he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers- not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lincoln comes across Beth's and Jennifer's messages, he knows he should turn them in. But he can't help being entertained-and captivated-by their stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would he say . . . ?&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Emma, who is half human and half Syrena, and her Syrena love, Galen, need time together. Alone. Away from the kingdoms of Poseidon and Triton. Emma’s grandfather, the Poseidon king, suggests the two visit a small town called Neptune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neptune is home to both Syrena and Half-Breeds alike. But Emma and Galen didn’t sign up to be peacemakers between the ocean-living Syrena and the land-dwelling, freshwater counterparts. They didn’t bargain for meeting a charming Half-Breed named Reed, who can barely disguise his feelings for Emma. And they especially didn’t expect to find themselves in the middle of a power struggle that threatens not only their love, but their ocean kingdoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this stunning conclusion to her bestselling Syrena Legacy, Anna Banks thrills fans with more action and romance than ever.</description>

  <description>Emma has just learned that her mother is a long-lost Poseidon princess, and now struggles with an identity crisis: As a Half-Breed, she’s a freak in the human world and an abomination in the Syrena realm below. Syrena law states that all Half-Breeds should be put to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if that’s not bad enough, her mother’s reappearance among the Syrena turns the two kingdoms—Poseidon and Triton—against one another. Which leaves Emma with a decision to make: Should she comply with Galen’s request to keep herself safe and just hope for the best? Or should she risk it all and reveal herself—and her Gift—to save a people she’s never known?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, Anna Banks infuses Emma and Galen's points of view with humor, intrigue, and waves of romance.</description>

  <description>The steamy first installment in the Inside Out erotic romance trilogy by Lisa Renee Jones, in the bestselling tradition of Fifty Shades of Grey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sara McMillan finds a stack of journals in a storage unit, she’s shocked and enthralled by the erotic life the writer led. Unable to stop reading, she vicariously lives out dark fantasies through Rebecca, the writer—until the terrifying final entry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain something sinister has happened, Sara sets out to discover the facts, immersing herself in Rebecca’s life. Soon she’s working at the art gallery Rebecca worked at and meeting Rebecca’s friends. Finding herself drawn to two dangerously sexy men, the manager of the gallery and a famed artist, Sara realizes she’s going down the same path Rebecca took. But with the promise of her dark needs being met by a man with confident good looks and a desire for control, she’s not sure anything else matters. Just the burn for more.</description>

  <description>Hanging over the porch of the tiny New England bookstore called Island Books is a faded sign with the motto “No Man Is an Island; Every Book Is a World.” A.J. Fikry, the irascible owner, is about to discover just what that truly means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A.J. Fikry’s life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly. And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It’s a small package, but large in weight. It’s that unexpected arrival that gives A.J. the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn’t take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming him or for a determined sales rep named Amelia to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light. The wisdom of all those books again become the lifeblood of A.J.’s world and everything twists into a version of his life that he didn’t see coming. As surprising as it is moving, &lt;em&gt;The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read and why we love.</description>

  <description>Harper Price, peerless Southern belle, was born ready for a Homecoming tiara. But after a strange run-in at the dance imbues her with incredible abilities, Harper's destiny takes a turn for the seriously weird. She becomes a Paladin, one of an ancient line of guardians with agility, super strength and lethal fighting instincts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when life can't get any more disastrously crazy, Harper finds out who she's charged to protect: David Stark, school reporter, subject of a mysterious prophecy and possibly Harper's least favorite person. But things get complicated when Harper starts falling for him—and discovers that David's own fate could very well be to destroy Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With snappy banter, cotillion dresses, non-stop action and a touch of magic, this new young adult series from bestseller Rachel Hawkins is going to make y'all beg for more.</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a dead-end town of 12,000 people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather never thought she would compete in Panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher. She’d never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dodge has never been afraid of Panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game, he’s sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he’s not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them—and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.</description>

  <description>The gates of Mr. Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory are opening at last! But only five lucky children will be allowed inside. And the winners are: Augustus Gloop, and enormously fat boy whose hobby is eating; Veruca Salt, a spoiled-rotten brat whose parents are wrapped around her little finger; Violet Beauregarde, a dim-witted gum-chewer with the fastest jaws around; &lt;br /&gt;Mike Teavee, a toy pistol-toting gangster-in-training who is obsessed with television; and &lt;br /&gt;Charlie Bucket, Our Hero, a boy who is honest and kind, brave and true, and good and ready for the wildest time of his life!&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>This beloved book by E. B. White, author of Stuart Little and The Trumpet of the Swan, is a classic of children's literature that is "just about perfect." This high-quality paperback features vibrant illustrations colorized by Rosemary Wells!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Pig. Humble. Radiant. These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high up in Zuckerman's barn. Charlotte's spiderweb tells of her feelings for a little pig named Wilbur, who simply wants a friend. They also express the love of a girl named Fern, who saved Wilbur's life when he was born the runt of his litter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. B. White's Newbery Honor Book is a tender novel of friendship, love, life, and death that will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come. This edition contains newly color illustrations by Garth Williams, the acclaimed illustrator of E. B. White's Stuart Little and Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House series, among many other books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--harpercollins.com</description>

  <description>Abel's place in his familiar, mouse world has always been secure; he had an allowance from his mother, a comfortable home, and a lovely wife, Amanda. But one stormy August day, furious flood water carry him off and dump him on an uninhabited island. Despite his determination and stubborn resourcefulness--he tried crossing the river with boats and ropes and even on stepping-stones--Abel can't find a way to get back home. Days, then weeks and months, pass. Slowly, his soft habits disappear as he forages for food, fashions a warm nest in a hollow log, models clay statues of his family for company, and continues to brood on the problem of how to get across the river--and home. Abel's time on the island brings him a new understanding of the world he's separated from. Faced with the daily adventure of survival in his solitary, somewhat hostile domain, he is moved to reexamine the easy way of life he had always accepted and discovers skills and talents in himself that hold promise of a more meaningful life, if and when he should finally return to Mossville and his dear Amanda again.</description>

  <description>When a crash kills their father and leaves them orphaned, Zel knows she needs to protect her sister, Dyl. But before Zel has a plan, Dyl is taken by strangers using bizarre sensory weapons, and Zel finds herself in a safe house for teens who aren’t like any she’s ever seen before—teens who shouldn’t even exist. Using broken-down technology, her new friends’ peculiar gifts, and her own grit, Zel must find a way to get her sister back from the kidnappers who think a powerful secret is encoded in Dyl’s DNA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Set in 2150—in a world of automatic cars, nightclubs with auditory ecstasy drugs, and guys with four arms—this is about the human genetic “mistakes” that society wants to forget, and the way that outcasts can turn out to be heroes.</description>

  <description>When Claudio breaks the new laws against vice in Vienna by getting his financee, Julietta, pregnant, a series of ethical issues is brought under scrutiny. His sister's virtue is held to ransom by the deputy rule of the city until justice is done, mercy shown, and order restored. This is among Shakespeare's most vivid dramatic projections of moral duplicity. The introduction discusses the origins of his treatment of the well-known story and examines his sources. The editor also sets the play in its historical context and offers the most comprehensive available account of the text's theatrical life from Restoration adaptations to present-day productions.</description>

  <description>It's been three years since the devastating accident . . . three years since Mia walked out of Adam's life forever.&lt;p&gt;Now living on opposite coasts, Mia is Juilliard's rising star and Adam is LA tabloid fodder, thanks to his new rock star status and celebrity girlfriend. When Adam gets stuck in New York by himself, chance brings the couple together again, for one last night. As they explore the city that has become Mia's home, Adam and Mia revisit the past and open their hearts to the future - and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from Adam's point of view in the spare, lyrical prose that defined &lt;i&gt;If I Stay&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Where She Went&lt;/i&gt; explores the devastation of grief, the promise of new hope, and the flame of rekindled romance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Really good! I flew through it. My overall problem with this duology is a sense of disconnect. I seriously can not pinpoint it, but I never felt truly attached to any of the characters or events. There were flickers of sentiment, but overall I just felt like I was along for an interesting story....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;On a day that started like any other…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia had everything: a loving family, a gorgeous, adoring boyfriend, and a bright future full of music and full of choices. Then, in an instant, almost all of that is taken from her. Caught between life and death, between a happy past and an unknowable future, Mia spends one critical day contemplating the one decision she has left—the most important decision she’ll ever make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simultaneously tragic and hopeful, this is a romantic, riveting and ultimately uplifting story about memory, music, living, and dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Librarian note: an alternate cover for this edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21570677-if-i-stay" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Galen is the prince of the Syrena, sent to land to find a girl he's heard can communicate with fish. Emma is on vacation at the beach. When she runs into Galen—literally, &lt;i&gt;ouch!&lt;/i&gt;—both teens sense a connection. But it will take several encounters, including a deadly one with a shark, for Galen to be convinced of Emma's gifts. Now, if he can only convince Emma that she holds the key to his kingdom...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from both Emma and Galen's points of view, here is a fish-out-of-water story that sparkles with intrigue, humor, and waves of romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br /&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanor&lt;/i&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Park&lt;/i&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds—smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I’d pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring… until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something… unexpected happens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon’s touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I’m getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don’t kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>Georgie McCool knows her marriage is in trouble; it has been in trouble for a long time. She still loves her husband, Neal, and Neal still loves her, deeply — but that almost seems beside the point now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that was always beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days before they’re supposed to visit Neal’s family in Omaha for Christmas, Georgie tells Neal that she can’t go. She’s a TV writer, and something’s come up on her show; she has to stay in Los Angeles. She knows that Neal will be upset with her — Neal is always a little upset with Georgie — but she doesn't expect him to pack up the kids and go home without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her husband and the kids leave for the airport, Georgie wonders if she’s finally done it. If she’s ruined everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, Georgie discovers a way to communicate with Neal in the past. It’s not time travel, not exactly, but she feels like she’s been given an opportunity to fix her marriage before it starts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that what she’s supposed to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or would Georgie and Neal be better off if their marriage never happened?</description>

  <description>"Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say." From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old rock star Sam Lee isn’t like other girls. She’s the super-talented bass player and songwriter for an all-girl indie band and an incurable loner. Then one night after a concert in Central Park, she’s attacked by a “wild dog.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, this long-time vegetarian is craving meat—the bloodier, the better. Sam finds herself with an unbelievable secret and no one she trusts to share it with. So begin the endless lies to cover up the hairy truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a new girl gang appears in the city—with claws and paws—Sam suspects there’s a connection to her own inner beast. Trapped in a tug-of-war between her animal and human self, forced to choose between the guy who sparks her carnal appetite and the one who makes her feel like a normal teenage girl, Sam has to unravel the mysteries of the werewolf world before her bandmates, the media, and her mother catch up to her.</description>

  <description>Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A groundbreaking work from a master, &lt;i&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/i&gt; is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.</description>

  <description>A captivating, beautiful, and stunningly accomplished debut novel that opens in 1918 Australia - the story of a lighthouse keeper and his wife who make one devastating choice that forever changes two worlds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia, 1926. After four harrowing years fighting on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns home to take a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day's journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season and shore leaves are granted every other year at best, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby's cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom, whose records as a lighthouse keeper are meticulous and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel has taken the tiny baby to her breast. Against Tom's judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. L. Stedman's mesmerizing, beautifully written debut novel seduces us into accommodating Isabel's decision to keep this "gift from God." And we are swept into a story about extraordinarily compelling characters seeking to find their North Star in a world where there is no right answer, where justice for one person is another's tragic loss.</description>

  <description>Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When the two meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. But as the loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special friendship—the kind that changes lives and lasts a lifetime. And it is through this friendship that Ari and Dante will learn the most important truths about themselves and the kind of people they want to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An unflinching, darkly funny, and deeply moving story of a boy, his seriously ill mother, and an unexpected monstrous visitor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting-- he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It's ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd-- whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself-- Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.</description>

  <description>One school. Twenty voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endless possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's the girl who is in love with Holden Caulfield. The boy who wants to be strong who falls for the girl who's convinced she needs to be weak. The girl who writes love songs for a girl she can't have. The two boys teetering on the brink of their first anniversary. And everyone in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he did in the highly acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Boy Meets Boy&lt;/i&gt;, David Levithan gives us a world of unforgettable voices that readers will want to visit again and again. It's the realm of possibility open to us all - where love, joy, and the stories we tell will linger.</description>

  <description>"'There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark's Eve,' Neeve said. 'Either you're his true love...or you killed him.'"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them — not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can't entirely explain. He has it all — family money, good looks, devoted friends — but he's looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she's not so sure anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the Shiver trilogy and The Scorpio Races, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we've never been before.</description>

  <description>In this masterpiece about freedom, feminism, and destiny, Printz Honor author A.S. King tells the epic story of a girl coping with devastating loss at long last--a girl who has no idea that the future needs her, and that the present needs her even more.&lt;br /&gt;Graduating from high school is a time of limitless possibilities--but not for Glory, who has no plan for what's next. Her mother committed suicide when Glory was only four years old, and she's never stopped wondering if she will eventually go the same way...until a transformative night when she begins to experience an astonishing new power to see a person's infinite past and future. From ancient ancestors to many generations forward, Glory is bombarded with visions--and what she sees ahead of her is terrifying: A tyrannical new leader raises an army. Women's rights disappear. A violent second civil war breaks out. And young girls vanish daily, sold off or interned in camps. Glory makes it her mission to record everything she sees, hoping her notes will somehow make a difference. She may not see a future for herself, but she'll do anything to make sure this one doesn't come to pass.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if the bomb had actually been dropped? What if your family was the only one with a shelter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer of 1962, the possibility of nuclear war is all anyone talks about. But Scott's dad is the only one in the neighborhood who actually prepares for the worst. As the neighbors scoff, he builds a bomb shelter to hold his family and stocks it with just enough supplies to keep the four of them alive for two critical weeks. In the middle of the night in late October, when the unthinkable happens, those same neighbors force their way into the shelter before Scott's dad can shut the door. With not enough room, not enough food, and not enough air, life inside the shelter is filthy, physically draining, and emotionally fraught. But even worse is the question of what will—and won't—remain when the door is opened again. Internationally best-selling author Todd Strasser has written his most impressive and personal novel to date, ruthlessly yet sensitively exploring the terrifying what-ifs of one of the most explosive moments in human history.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; is probably the most skillfuly told story in the whole of the English Arthurian cycle. Originating from the north-west midlands of England, it is based on two ancient Celtic motifs--the Beheading and the Exchange of Winnings--brought together by the anonymous 14th century author. Acclaimed poet Keith Harrison's new translation uses a modern alliterative pattern which subtly echoes the music of the original at the same time it strives for fidelity. This is the most generously annotated edition available, complete with a detailed introduction which situates the work in the context of Arthurian Romance and analyzes its poetics and narrative structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Series: &lt;/strong&gt; For over 100 years &lt;strong&gt;Oxford World's Classics&lt;/strong&gt; has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Translated, edited, and with an Introduction by Stanley Corngold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Featuring essays by Philip Roth, W. H Auden, and Walter Benjamin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin.” With this startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first sentence, Franz Kafka begins his masterpiece, &lt;i&gt;The Metamorphosis.&lt;/i&gt; It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetlelike insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, &lt;i&gt;The Metamorphosis&lt;/i&gt; has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Modern Library edition collects Stanley Corngold’s acclaimed English translation—long hailed as the gold standard by scholars and general readers alike—along with seven critical essays by writers including Philip Roth, W. H. Auden, and Walter Benjamin, background and contextual material, and a new Introduction from Corngold himself.</description>

And that's the bottom line: I need help with this novella. I need a teacher (or sparksotes) to help me understand the symbolisms and meanings. I think theire could be in...]]>

  <description>To five-year-old-Jack, Room is the world. . . . It's where he was born, it's where he and his Ma eat and sleep and play and learn. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma it's the prison where she has been held for seven years. Through her fierce love for her son, she has created a life for him in this eleven-by-eleven-foot space. But with Jack's curiosity building alongside her own desperation, she knows that Room cannot contain either much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Room is a tale at once shocking, riveting, exhilarating--a story of unconquerable love in harrowing circumstances, and of the diamond-hard bond between a mother and her child.&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;from the back cover&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third installment of Scott Westerfeld’s &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling and award-winning Uglies series—a global phenomenon that started the dystopian trend.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tally thought they were a rumor, but now she’s one of them. A Special. A super-amped fighting machine, engineered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe being perfectly programmed with strength and focus isn’t better than anything she’s ever known. Tally still has memories of something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it’s easy to tune that out—until she’s offered a chance to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke permanently. It all comes down to one last choice: listen to that tiny, faint heartbeat, or carry out the mission she’s programmed to complete. Either way, Tally’s world will never be the same.</description>

  <description>Every winter, straight-laced, Ivy League bound Evan looks forward to a visit from Lucy, a childhood pal who moved away after her parent's divorce. But when Lucy arrives this year, she's changed. The former "girl next door" now has chopped dyed black hair, a nose stud, and a scowl. But Evan knows that somewhere beneath the Goth, "Old Lucy" still exists, and he's determined to find her... even if it means pissing her off. &lt;br /&gt;Can opposites attract? Or does growing up mean having to grow apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from two perspectives, this funny and honest novel by Stephen Emond (&lt;i&gt;Happyface&lt;/i&gt;) is a unique combination of text, comic strips, and art. It's an indie movie in a book, perfect for the inner outcast and lovelorn nerd in us all.</description>

  <description>When Cameron Post's parents die suddenly in a car crash, her shocking first thought is relief. Relief they'll never know that, hours earlier, she had been kissing a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that relief doesn't last, and Cam is soon forced to move in with her conservative aunt Ruth and her well-intentioned but hopelessly old-fashioned grandmother. She knows that from this point on, her life will forever be different. Survival in Miles City, Montana, means blending in and leaving well enough alone (as her grandmother might say), and Cam becomes an expert at both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Coley Taylor moves to town. Beautiful, pickup-driving Coley is a perfect cowgirl with the perfect boyfriend to match. She and Cam forge an unexpected and intense friendship--one that seems to leave room for something more to emerge. But just as that starts to seem like a real possibility, ultrareligious Aunt Ruth takes drastic action to "fix" her niece, bringing Cam face-to-face with the cost of denying her true self--even if she's not exactly sure who that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Miseducation of Cameron Post&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning and unforgettable literary debut about discovering who you are and finding the courage to live life according to your own rules.</description>

  <description>The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon away from life as a San Francisco web-design drone and into the aisles of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, but after a few days on the job, Clay discovers that the store is more curious than either its name or its gnomic owner might suggest. The customers are few, and they never seem to buy anything; instead, they "check out" large, obscure volumes from strange corners of the store. Suspicious, Clay engineers an analysis of the clientele's behavior, seeking help from his variously talented friends, but when they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the bookstore's secrets extend far beyond its walls.</description>

  <description>When Sam's dad whisks him and his brother off to a remote beach town for the summer, he's all for it-- at first. Sam soon realizes, though, that this place is anything but ordinary. Time seems to slow down around here, and everywhere he looks, there are beautiful blond girls. Girls who seem inexplicably drawn to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Sam meets DeeDee, one of the Girls, and she's different from the others. Just as he starts to fall for her, she pulls away, leaving him more confused than ever. He knows that if he's going to get her back, he'll have to uncover the secret of this beach and the girls who live here.</description>

  <description>While the other girls in the walled city-state of Baalboden learn to sew and dance, Rachel Adams learns to track and hunt. While they bend like reeds to the will of their male Protectors, she uses hers for sparring practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rachel's father fails to return from a courier mission and is declared dead, the city's brutal Commander assigns Rachel a new Protector: her father's apprentice, Logan—the boy she declared her love to and who turned her down two years before. Left with nothing but fierce belief in her father's survival, Rachel decides to escape and find him herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rachel and Logan battle their way through the Wasteland, stalked by a monster that can't be killed and an army of assassins out for blood, they discover romance, heartbreak, and a truth that will incite a war decades in the making.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Some schools have honor codes.&lt;br /&gt;Others have handbooks.&lt;br /&gt;Themis Academy has the Mockingbirds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the glossy pages of its admissions brochure, the prestigious Themis Academy appears perfect in every way: exceptional academics, extraordinary students, the kind of extracurriculars to make an Ivy League proud, and zero instances of student misbehavior. But this boarding school isn't as pristine as it appears. There's a dark underbelly to the perfect record the Themis administration flaunts. Student infractions are rampant, and it's up to a secret vigilante society, the Mockingbirds, to maintain order on campus--a responsibility their members take very seriously. &lt;br /&gt;Alex Patrick never thought she would need the Mockingbirds. But when she's date-raped by another student, she doesn't know where else to go. As much as she'd like to forget what happened, she can't escape the daily reminders of what went wrong that terrible night. Before she can summon the courage to take a stand, she'll have to accept that her battle for justice is not hers alone. Standing up for someone, especially yourself, is worth the fight.</description>

  <description>It’s the summer of 1889, and Amelia van den Broek is new to Baltimore and eager to take in all the pleasures the city has to offer. But her gaiety is interrupted by disturbing, dreamlike visions she has only at sunset—visions that offer glimpses of the future. Soon, friends and strangers alike call on Amelia to hear her prophecies. However, a forbidden romance with Nathaniel, an artist, threatens the new life Amelia is building in Baltimore. This enigmatic young man is keeping secrets of his own—still, Amelia finds herself irrepressibly drawn to him.When one of her darkest visions comes to pass, Amelia’s world is thrown into chaos. And those around her begin to wonder if she’s not the seer of dark portents, but the cause.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; </description>

  <description>Things in Delilah Hannaford's life have a tendency to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used to be a good student, but she can't seem to keep it together anymore. Her "boyfriend" isn't much of a boyfriend. And her mother refuses to discuss the fight that divided their family eight years ago. Falling apart, it seems, is a Hannaford tradition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a summer of new friendships, unexpected romance, and moments that test the complex bonds between mothers and daughters, Delilah must face her family's painful past. Can even her most shattered relationships be pieced together again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich with emotion, Sarah Ockler delivers a powerful story of family, love, and self-discovery.</description>

  <description>Tally has finally become pretty. Now her looks are beyond perfect, her clothes are awesome, her boyfriend is totally hot, and she's completely popular. It's everything she's ever wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beneath all the fun -- the nonstop parties, the high-tech luxury, the total freedom -- is a nagging sense that something's wrong. Something important. Then a message from Tally's ugly past arrives. Reading it, Tally remembers what's wrong with pretty life, and the fun stops cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she has to choose between fighting to forget what she knows and fighting for her life -- because the authorities don't intend to let anyone with this information survive.</description>

  <description>First, there were ten - a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal - and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. And only the dead are above suspicion.</description>

  <description>After her mother died, Glory retreated into herself and her music. Her single father raised her as a piano prodigy, with a rigid schedule and the goal of playing sold-out shows across the globe. Now, as a teenager, Glory has disappeared. As we flash back to the events leading up to her disappearance, we see a girl on the precipice of disaster. Brilliant and lonely, Glory is drawn to an artistic new boy, Frank, who moves in next door. The farther she falls, the deeper she spirals into madness. Before long, Glory is unable to play anything but the song "Chopsticks."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But nothing is what it seems, and Glory's reality is not reality at all. In this stunningly moving novel told in photographs, pictures, and words, it's up to the reader to decide what is real, what is imagined, and what has been madness all along....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A terrifying thriller for young adult fans of &lt;i&gt;The Martian&lt;/i&gt; and paranormal space adventure that will be devoured in one heart-pounding sitting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been decades since anyone set foot on the moon. Now three ordinary teenagers, the winners of NASA's unprecedented, worldwide lottery, are about to become the first young people in space--and change their lives forever. It's the opportunity of a lifetime, but little do the teenagers know that something sinister is waiting for them on the desolate surface of the moon. And in the black vacuum of space...no one is coming to save them.&lt;br /&gt;In this chilling adventure set in the most brutal landscape known to man, highly acclaimed Norwegian novelist Johan Harstad creates a vivid and frightening world of possibilities we can only hope never come true.</description>

  <description>On the heels of a family tragedy, the last thing Katie Greene wants to do is move halfway across the world. Stuck with her aunt in Shizuoka, Japan, Katie feels lost. Alone. She doesn’t know the language, she can barely hold a pair of chopsticks, and she can’t seem to get the hang of taking her shoes off whenever she enters a building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there’s gorgeous but aloof Tomohiro, star of the school’s kendo team. How did he really get the scar on his arm? Katie isn’t prepared for the answer. But when she sees the things he draws start moving, there’s no denying the truth: Tomo has a connection to the ancient gods of Japan, and being near Katie is causing his abilities to spiral out of control. If the wrong people notice, they'll both be targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie never wanted to move to Japan—now she may not make it out of the country alive.</description>

  <description>The first ten lies they tell you in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Speak up for yourself—we want to know what you have to say." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt; was a 1999 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.</description>

  <description>The picture-perfect new town of Candor, Florida, is attracting more and more new families, drawn by its postcard-like small-town feel, with white picket fences, spanking-new but old-fashioned-looking homes, and neighborliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the parents are drawn by something else as well.  They know that in Candor their obstreperous teenagers will somehow become rewired - they'll learn to respect their elders, to do their chores, and enjoy their homework.  They'll give up the tattoos, metal music, and partying that have been driving their parents crazy.  They'll become every parent's dream.</description>

  <description>Hermann Kermit Warm is going to die. The enigmatic and powerful man known only as the Commodore has ordered it, and his henchmen, Eli and Charlie Sisters, will make sure of it. Though Eli doesn't share his brother's appetite for whiskey and killing, he's never known anything else. But their prey isn't an easy mark, and on the road from Oregon City to Warm's gold-mining claim outside Sacramento, Eli begins to question what he does for a living - and whom he does it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;The Sisters Brothers&lt;/i&gt;, Patrick deWitt pays homage to the classic Western, transforming it into an unforgettable comic tour de force. Filled with a remarkable cast of characters - losers, cheaters, and ne'er-do-wells from all stripes of life - and told by a complex and compelling narrator, it is a violent, lustful odyssey through the underworld of the 1850s frontier that beautifully captures the humor, melancholy, and grit of the Old West, and two brothers bound by blood, violence, and love.</description>

  <description>The shocking thing about the five Lisbon sisters was how nearly normal they seemed when their mother let them out for the one and only date of their lives. Twenty years on, their enigmatic personalities are embalmed in the memories of the boys who worshipped them and who now recall their shared adolescence: the brassiere draped over a crucifix belonging to the promiscuous Lux; the sisters' breathtaking appearance on the night of the dance; and the sultry, sleepy street across which they watched a family disintegrate and fragile lives disappear.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Although I had never seen him before, I recognized him immediately. I'd have known his voice anywhere. This was the guy I'd seen on my last journey back in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or more precisely, the one who'd kissed my doppelganger while I was hiding behind the curtain in disbelief.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Gwen lives with her extended - and rather eccentric - family in an exclusive London neighborhood. In spite of her ancestors' peculiar history, she's had a relatively normal life so far. The time-traveling gene that runs like a secret thread through the female half of the family is supposed to have skipped over Gwen, so she hasn't been introduced to "the mysteries," and can spend her time hanging out with her best friend, Lesley. It comes as an unwelcome surprise when she starts taking sudden, uncontrolled leaps into the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's totally unprepared for time travel, not to mention all that comes with it: fancy clothes, archaic manners, a mysterious secret society, and Gideon, her time-traveling counterpart. He's obnoxious, a know-it-all, and possibly the best-looking guy she's seen in any century...</description>

  <description>Since its immediate success in 1813, &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</description>
