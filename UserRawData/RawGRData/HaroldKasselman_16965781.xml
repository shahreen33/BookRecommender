  <description>Between 1995, when Mike Schmidt was inducted into the Hall of Fame, and the dawn of the recent "Steroid Era," when baseball's biggest names were as likely to appear before Congress as they were to play in the All-Star Game, our national pastime has devolved into a national punch line. Even though the past two years have witnessed the Red Sox' finally putting an end to the Curse of the Bambino and the White Sox' bringing a championship to the South Side of Chicago for the first time in eighty-seven years, the sad truth is that the 2005 and 2006 seasons may be remembered as much for the league's scandals and blockbuster free-agent signings as they are for historic accomplishments on the field. Something has gone horribly wrong with the game, and according to Schmidt, it's time to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Clearing the Bases" is a much-needed call to arms by one of baseball's most respected players. Drawing on his experiences as a third baseman, a manager, and, most recently, a fan, Schmidt takes on everything from skyrocketing payrolls, callous owners, and unapproachable players to inflated statistics, and, of course, ersatz home run kings. With bold and spirited counsel, Schmidt offers his own prescription for restoring integrity to the game and bringing baseball back, once and for all, to its rightful place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than just an old-timer's screed against the modern game, however, "Clearing the Bases" goes beyond the BALCO investigation and never-ending free-agent bonanzas that dominate the back pages. It also examines all that's right -- and what still needs work -- with our national pastime, including interleague play, expansion, and, most surprisingly, better all-around hitters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riveting, wise, and illuminating, "Clearing the Bases" is a Hall of Famer's look at how Major League Baseball has lost its way and how it can head back home.</description>

  <description>When baseball fans voted on the top twenty-five players of the twentieth century in 1999, Stan Musial didn’t make the cut. This glaring omission—later rectified by a panel of experts—raised an important question: How could a first-ballot Hall of Famer, widely considered one of the greatest hitters in baseball history, still rank as the most underrated athlete of all time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Stan Musial&lt;/i&gt;, veteran sports journalist George Vecsey finally gives this twenty-time All-Star and St. Louis Cardinals icon the kind of prestigious biographical treatment previously afforded to his more celebrated contemporaries Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. More than just a chronological recounting of the events of Musial’s life, this is the definitive portrait of one of the game’s best-loved but most unappreciated legends, told through the remembrances of those who played beside, worked with, and covered “Stan the Man” over the course of his nearly seventy years in the national spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stan Musial never married a starlet. He didn’t die young, live too hard, or squander his talent. There were no legendary displays of temper or moodiness. He was merely the most consistent superstar of his era, a scarily gifted batsman who compiled 3,630 career hits (1,815 at home and 1,815 on the road), won three World Series titles, and retired in 1963 in possession of seventeen major-league records. Away from the diamond, he proved a savvy businessman and a model of humility and graciousness toward his many fans in St. Louis and around the world. From Keith Hernandez’s boyhood memories of Musial leaving tickets for him when the Cardinals were in San Francisco to the little-known story of Musial’s friendship with novelist James Michener—and their mutual association with Pope John Paul II—Vecsey weaves an intimate oral history around one of the great gentlemen of baseball’s Greatest Generation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may never be another Stan the Man, a fact that future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols—reluctantly nicknamed “El Hombre” in Musial’s honor—is quick to acknowledge. But thanks to this long-overdue reappraisal, even those who took his greatness for granted will learn to appreciate him all over again.</description>

      <![CDATA[There are so many "wunnerful" things to say about Vecsey's biography of Stanley Musial. It is simply superb. First, I liked the fact that Vecsey did not begin the book with details about Musial's childhood. Instead we have an overview of the man in the first six chapters. Secondly, I could sense...]]>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed the read, but it didn't touch me as I had hoped. It was fun to relive literally the play by play of the 1975 world series, one that the author feels was the greatest of all time. I don't agree, although it is one of the best especially game six. The sub title implies there will be some...]]>

  <description>When all-time pitching great Christy Mathewson died of tuberculosis in 1925 at the age of 45, it touched off a wave of national mourning that remains without precedent for an American athlete. The World Series was underway, and the game the day after Mathewson's death took on the trappings of a state funeral: officials slowly lowered the flag to half-mast, each ballplayer wore a black armband, and fans joined together in a chorus of "Nearer My God to Thee." Newspaper editorials recalled Mathewson's glorious career with the New York Giants, but also emphasized his unstinting good sportsmanship and voluntary service in World War I. The pitcher known to one and all as "Matty" or "Big Six" was as beloved for the strength of character he brought to the national pastime, as for his stunning 373 career victories. "I do not expect to see his like again," said his best friend and former manager, John McGraw. "But I do know that the example he set and the imprint he left on the sport that he loved and honored will remain long after I am gone."&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Matty&lt;/em&gt;, Ray Robinson tells the story of a man who became America's first authentic sports hero. Until Mathewson, Robinson reveals, Americans loved baseball, but looked down on ballplayers and other athletes as hard-drinking, skirt-chasing ne'er-do-wells. Deprived of real-life role models, millions of readers followed the serialized exploits of Frank Merriwell, a fictional hero who excelled at sports from baseball to billiards and never drank, smoke, or swore. Robinson shows how an eager public greeted Mathewson as a flesh-and-blood version of Merriwell from his first year at Bucknell University, where he shone as star pitcher, premier field-goal kicker, and class president. Lured into the big leagues before he could graduate, the tall, handsome pitcher soon won over men, women and children with his sense of fair play and his arsenal of blazing fastballs, sweeping curves, and infamously deceptive fadeaway pitches. Robinson skillfully details the highlights of Mathewson's career, including his showdowns against the great batters of his day and his encounters with the young Brooklyn, Chicago, Pittsburgh and St. Louis teams. Here are the six remarkable days in October, 1905 when Mathewson became the only pitcher ever to hurl three straight shutouts in a World Series, and the afternoon at West Point when he won $50 in a bet that he could throw 20 of his best pitches to exactly the same spot. Robinson does not underplay Mathewson's occasional failings, but the most surprising aspect of this fascinating portrait is just how close America's first Hall of Fame pitcher came to living up to his image.&lt;br /&gt; Drawing on rare interviews, press clips, and long overlooked eyewitness accounts, &lt;em&gt;Matty&lt;/em&gt; brings baseball's golden age to life--not only the great teams and the early superstars, but the long train trips between games, with cramped berths and no air conditioning; the small town ballplayers let loose amidst big city vice; and the two-bit gambling that eventually led to the infamous Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 Series (a scandal that might have escaped detection if the sportswriters in the press box with Mathewson had not been able to rely on his experienced eye for clues to how ballplayers might throw games). Offering rare insight into the making of an early twentieth century American hero, &lt;em&gt;Matty&lt;/em&gt; is must reading for anyone who loves baseball.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a delightful audio "scrap book" of a truly lovable icon of baseball communications. There are too many topics to cover in depth so we have a couple of paragraphs of individuals and incidents. That is the reason for three rather than four stars.

  <description>Hall of Famer Robin Roberts was baseball's most dominant pitcher from 1950 to 1955. He was the ace of the Whiz Kids rotation that led the Phillies to the NL pennant in 1950. In 1966 Roberts introduced Marvin Miller to the players' union, a major chapter in baseball history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy slipped out of the Supreme Court building on June 27, 2018, and traveled incognito to the White House to inform President Donald Trump that he was retiring, setting in motion a political process that his successor, Brett Kavanaugh, would denounce three months later as a “national disgrace” and a “circus.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;Justice on Trial&lt;/i&gt;, the definitive insider’s account of Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court, is based on extraordinary access to more than one hundred key figures—including the president, justices, and senators—in that ferocious political drama.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Trump presidency opened with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. But the following year, when Trump drew from the same list of candidates for his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the justice being replaced was the swing vote on abortion, and all hell broke loose.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The judicial confirmation process, on the point of breakdown for thirty years, now proved utterly dysfunctional. Unverified accusations of sexual assault became weapons in a ruthless campaign of personal destruction, culminating in the melodramatic hearings in which Kavanaugh’s impassioned defense resuscitated a nomination that seemed beyond saving.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Supreme Court has become the arbiter of our nation’s most vexing and divisive disputes. With the stakes of each vacancy incalculably high, the incentive to destroy a nominee is nearly irresistible. The next time a nomination promises to change the balance of the Court, Hemingway and Severino warn, the confirmation fight will be even uglier than Kavanaugh’s.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A good person might accept that nomination in the naïve belief that what happened to Kavanaugh won’t happen to him because he is a good person. But it can happen, it does happen, and it just happened. The question is whether America will let it happen again.</description>

  <description>1944. Physics professor Alfred Mendl is separated from his family and sent to the men’s camp, where all of his belongings are tossed on a roaring fire. His books, his papers, his life’s work. The Nazis have no idea what they have just destroyed. And without that physical record, Alfred is one of only two people in the world with his particular knowledge. Knowledge that could start a war, or end it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nathan Blum works behind a desk at an intelligence office in Washington, DC, but he longs to contribute to the war effort in a more meaningful way, and he has a particular skill set the U.S. suddenly needs. Nathan is fluent in German and Polish, he is Semitic looking, and he proved his scrappiness at a young age when he escaped from the Polish ghetto. Now, the government wants him to take on the most dangerous assignment of his life: Nathan must sneak into Auschwitz, on a mission to find and escape with one man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This historical thriller from New York Times bestseller Andrew Gross is a deeply affecting, unputdownable series of twists and turns through a landscape at times horrifyingly familiar but still completely compelling.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Year of the Pitcher&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the remarkable 1968 baseball season, which culminated in one of the greatest World Series contests ever, with the Detroit Tigers coming back from a 3–1 deficit to beat the Cardinals in Game Seven of the World Series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 1968, two remarkable pitchers would dominate the game as well as the broadsheets. One was black, the other white. Bob Gibson, together with the St. Louis Cardinals, embodied an entire generation's hope for integration at a heated moment in American history. Denny McLain, his adversary, was a crass self-promoter who eschewed the team charter and his Detroit Tigers teammates to zip cross-country in his own plane. For one season, the nation watched as these two men and their teams swept their respective league championships to meet at the World Series. Gibson set a major league record that year with a 1.12 ERA. McLain won more than 30 games in 1968, a feat not achieved since 1934 and untouched since. Together, the two have come to stand as iconic symbols, giving the fans “The Year of the Pitcher” and changing the game. Evoking a nostalgic season and its incredible characters, this is the story of one of the great rivalries in sports and an indelible portrait of the national pastime during a turbulent year—and the two men who electrified fans from all walks of life.</description>

      <![CDATA[Mr. Pappu's book is superbly researched and acutely portrays the transition of baseball and the country in 1968. I found the book made me feel melancholy: not nostalgic, but rather sad. It was a year of immense racial tension in the country especially after the 1967 riots in Detroit. There remain...]]>

  <description>This autobiography of Hank Greenberg tells of one of the most dynamic and inspiring stories in the history of baseball. The son of Eastern European parents, he rose from the streets of New York to rank among the greatest home-run hitters of the game, and became the first Jewish player to be elected to the Hall of Fame. Along the way he challenged Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs in a season; led the Detroit Tigers to four pennants; fiercely stood up to anti-Semitic slurs, insults, and assaults; and was one of the first major leaguers to enlist in the military at the outbreak of World War II. Hank Greenberg's extraordinary life in baseball-playing with and against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Charlie Gehringer, Joe DiMaggio, Dizzy Dean, and Bob Feller—combined the uncommon courage, dignity, strength and, to be sure, humor, in the face of formidable odds.</description>

  <description>It's 1949. World War II is over, but it has a way of haunting people for years to come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gordon Sandalwood suspects his wife Edith is hiding something from him, and he asks Denver private investigator Dewey Webb to find out what. Dewey, toughened by his own war experiences, reluctantly takes the case, certain it will lead to nothing. But when he sees Edith rendezvous with a mysterious man, Dewey realizes his assumptions might be wrong. As he digs deeper to identify the stranger, he turns up secrets that reach back into the war, and as he unravels a web of deceit, he discovers who has the most to gain, and the most to lose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A hard-boiled, historical mystery that's great for fans who love a traditional detective crime story with a noir flavor, but without a lot of sex or swearing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dewey Webb first appeared in the Reed Ferguson mystery, Back Story. Pick up a copy of Back Story to find out more about this classic hard-boiled detective. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From an award-winning journalist comes the riveting odyssey of seven Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1960s—a chronicle of a team, a game, and a nation in transition during one of the most exciting and unsettled decades in history.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legendary Dodgers Maury Wills, Sandy Koufax, Wes Parker, Jeff Torborg, Dick Tracewski, Lou Johnson and Tommy Davis encapsulated 1960s America: white and black, Jewish and Christian, wealthy and working class, pro-Vietnam and anti-war, golden boy and seasoned veteran. The Last Innocents is a thoughtful, technicolor portrait of these six players—friends, mentors, confidants, rivals, and allies—and their storied team that offers an intriguing look at a sport and a nation in transition. Bringing into focus the high drama of their World Series appearances from 1962 to 1972 and their pivotal games, Michael Leahy explores these men’s interpersonal relationships and illuminates the triumphs, agonies, and challenges each faced individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leahy places these men’s lives within the political and social maelstrom that was the era when the conformity of the 1950s gave way to demands for equality and rights. Increasingly frustrated over a lack of real bargaining power and an iron-fisted management who occasionally meddled in their personal affairs, many players shared an uneasy relationship with the team’s front office. This contention mirrored the discord and uncertainty generated by myriad changes rocking the nation: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, and growing hostility to the escalation of the Vietnam War. While the nation around them changed, these players each experienced a personal and professional metamorphosis that would alter public perceptions and their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comprehensive and artfully crafted, &lt;i&gt;The Last Innocents&lt;/i&gt; is an evocative and riveting portrait of a pivotal era in baseball and modern America.</description>

  <description>For 25 years, Philadelphia waited for a team like the 2008 Phillies to come along. Waited for a team that could end the longest title drought on any city in America that fields teams in all four major professional sports. Waited for that one magical postseason run that could unleash a quarter-century of pent-up frustration. And then these '08 Phillies hopped on that magic carpet and made it happen. Unlike so many Phillies teams that were haunted by the past, this team was inspired by it, by the chance to place its own inimitable stamp on the franchise. And as the 2 million people who attended their championship parade can attest, it was &lt;b&gt;Worth the Wait&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>When &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt; declared on the cover of a June 2014 issue that the Houston Astros would win the World Series in 2017, people thought Ben Reiter, the article's author, was crazy. The Astros were the worst baseball team in half a century, but they were more than just bad. They were an embarrassment, a club that didn't even appear to be trying to win. The cover story, combined with the specificity of Reiter's claim, met instant and nearly universal derision. But three years later, the critics were proved improbably, astonishingly wrong. How had Reiter predicted it so accurately? And, more important, how had the Astros pulled off the impossible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astroball&lt;/i&gt; is the inside story of how a gang of outsiders went beyond the stats to find a new way to win--and not just in baseball. When new Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and his top analyst, the former rocket scientist Sig Mejdal, arrived in Houston in 2011, they had already spent more than half a decade trying to understand how human instinct and expertise could be blended with hard numbers such as on-base percentage and strikeout rate to guide their decision-making. In Houston, they had free rein to remake the club. No longer would scouts, with all their subjective, hard-to-quantify opinions, be forced into opposition with the stats guys. Instead, Luhnow and Sig wanted to correct for the biases inherent in human observation, and then roll their scouts' critical thoughts into their process. The numbers had value--but so did the gut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strategy paid off brilliantly, and surprisingly quickly. It pointed the Astros toward key draft picks like Carlos Correa and Alex Bregman; offered a path for developing George Springer, Jos� Altuve, and Dallas Keuchel; and showed them how veterans like Carlos Beltr�n and Justin Verlander represented the last piece in the puzzle of fielding a championship team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting at the nexus of sports, business, and innovation--and written with years of access to the team's stars and executives--&lt;i&gt;Astroball&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the next wave of thinking in baseball and beyond, at once a remarkable underdog story and a fascinating look at the cutting edge of evaluating and optimizing human potential.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With unmatched suspense and emotional insight, Harlan Coben explores the big secrets and little lies that can destroy a relationship, a family, and even a town in this powerful new thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suburban New Jersey Detective Napoleon “Nap” Dumas hasn't been the same since senior year of high school, when his twin brother Leo and Leo’s girlfriend Diana were found dead on the railroad tracks—and Maura, the girl Nap considered the love of his life, broke up with him and disappeared without explanation. For fifteen years, Nap has been searching, both for Maura and for the real reason behind his brother's death. And now, it looks as though he may finally find what he's been looking for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Maura's fingerprints turn up in the rental car of a suspected murderer, Nap embarks on a quest for answers that only leads to more questions—about the woman he loved, about the childhood friends he thought he knew, about the abandoned military base near where he grew up, and mostly about Leo and Diana—whose deaths are darker and far more sinister than Nap ever dared imagine.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A riveting new legal thriller from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;My Sister’s Grave&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In San Francisco’s seamy Tenderloin district, a teenage street hustler has been murdered in a shelter for boys. And the dedicated priest who runs the struggling home stands accused. But despite damning evidence that he’s a killer—and worse—Father Thomas Martin stands by his innocence. And attorney Peter Donley stands with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For three years Donley has cut his legal teeth in his uncle’s tiny, no-frills firm, where people come before profits. Just as Donley is poised to move on to a lucrative dream job, the shocking case lands in his lap, and he must put his future on hold while putting his courtroom skills to the test. But a ruthless DA seeking headlines and a brutal homicide cop bent on vengeance have their own agendas. Now, as he unearths the dirty secrets surrounding the case, Donley must risk his neck to save his client’s life…and expose the face of true evil.</description>

  <description>She was his best-kept secret …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an isolated village in the mountains of Andalusia, a mysterious Frenchwoman begins work on a dangerous memoir. It is the story of a man she once loved in the Beirut of old, and a child taken from her in treason’s name. The woman is the keeper of the Kremlin’s most closely guarded secret. Long ago, the KGB inserted a mole into the heart of the West—a mole who stands on the doorstep of ultimate power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one man can unravel the conspiracy: Gabriel Allon, the legendary art restorer and assassin who serves as the chief of Israel’s vaunted secret intelligence service. Gabriel has battled the dark forces of the new Russia before, at great personal cost. Now he and the Russians will engage in a final epic showdown, with the fate of the postwar global order hanging in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel is lured into the hunt for the traitor after his most important asset inside Russian intelligence is brutally assassinated while trying to defect in Vienna. His quest for the truth will lead him backward in time, to the twentieth century’s greatest act of treason, and, finally, to a spellbinding climax along the banks of the Potomac River outside Washington that will leave readers breathless.</description>

  <description>POUZE MUŽ BEZ RODINY MŮŽE ODHALIT KOŘENY VLASTNÍHO SPŘÍZNĚNÍ…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jefferson Tayte věnoval celý život zkoumání neúplných rodokmenů, aby pomohl rozvráceným rodinám… a odkryl dlouho ukrytá tajemství. Sám je ale samotář, muž bez kořenů – jeho vlastní původ představuje největší záhadu jeho kariéry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To se však změní, když se Taytovi dostane do rukou nová stopa, za kterou se s profesorkou a kolegyní Jean Summerovou vydají do Mnichova. Hon za odpověďmi je ale zavede na nebezpečné území: ke zlověstným tajemstvím nacistického Německa a lidem ochotným obětovat cokoli, aby je ochránili.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Když jejich pátrání začne ohrožovat základy fašistické organizace, Tayte se Summerovou pochopí, že hrají o čas. Dokážou odhalit kořeny temné minulosti německého národa dřív, než se sami stanou jejími oběťmi?</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From Daniel Silva, the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling author, comes a modern masterpiece of espionage, love, and betrayal&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;She was his best-kept secret …&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an isolated village in the mountains of Andalusia, a mysterious Frenchwoman begins work on a dangerous memoir. It is the story of a man she once loved in the Beirut of old, and a child taken from her in treason’s name. The woman is the keeper of the Kremlin’s most closely guarded secret. Long ago, the KGB inserted a mole into the heart of the West—a mole who stands on the doorstep of ultimate power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one man can unravel the conspiracy: Gabriel Allon, the legendary art restorer and assassin who serves as the chief of Israel’s vaunted secret intelligence service. Gabriel has battled the dark forces of the new Russia before, at great personal cost. Now he and the Russians will engage in a final epic showdown, with the fate of the postwar global order hanging in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel is lured into the hunt for the traitor after his most important asset inside Russian intelligence is brutally assassinated while trying to defect in Vienna. His quest for the truth will lead him backward in time, to the twentieth century’s greatest act of treason, and, finally, to a spellbinding climax along the banks of the Potomac River outside Washington that will leave readers breathless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Fast as a bullet, hauntingly beautiful, and filled with stunning double-crosses and twists of plot, The Other Woman is a tour de force that proves once again that “of all those writing spy novels today, Daniel Silva is quite simply the best” &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Kansas City Star).&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>"The story of the 1969 Miracle Mets, unlikely world champions against the backdrop of the space race and Vietnam, on the 50th anniversary of their Cinderella season In 1962, the New York Mets spent their first year in existence racking up the worst record in baseball history. Things scarcely got any better for the ensuing six years--they were baseball's laughingstock, but somehow lovable in their ineptitude, building a fiercely loyal fan base. And then came 1969, a year that brought the lunar landing, Woodstock, nonstop antiwar protests, and the most tumultuous and fractious New York City mayoral race in memory--along with the most improbable season in the annals of Major League Baseball. It concluded on an invigorating autumn afternoon in Queens, when a Minnesota farm boy named Jerry Koosman beat the Baltimore Orioles for the second time in five games, making the Mets champions of the baseball world. It wasn't merely an upset but an unprecedented, uplifting achievement for the ages. From the ashes of those early scorched-earth seasons, Gil Hodges, a beloved former Brooklyn Dodger, put together a 25-man whole that was vastly more formidable than the sum of its parts. Beyond the top-notch pitching staff headlined by Tom Seaver, Koosman, and Gary Gentry, and the hitting prowess of Cleon Jones, the Mets were mostly comprised of untested kids and lightly regarded veterans. Everywhere you looked on this team, there was a man with a compelling backstory, from Koosman, who never played high school baseball and grew up throwing in a hayloft in subzero temperatures with his brother Orville, to third baseman Ed Charles, an African-American poet with a deep racial conscience whose arrival in the big leagues was delayed almost a decade because of the color of his skin. In the tradition of The Boys of Winter, his classic bestseller about the 1980 U.S. men's Olympic hockey team, Wayne Coffey tells the story of the '69 Mets as it has never been told before--against the backdrop of the space race, Stonewall, and Vietnam, set in an ever-changing New York City. With dogged reporting and a storyteller's eye for detail, Coffey finds the beating heart of a baseball family. Published to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Mets' remarkable transformation from worst to best, They Said It Couldn't Be Done is a spellbinding, feel-good narrative about an improbable triumph by the ultimate underdog"--</description>

      <![CDATA[It's hard to find anyone outside of Baltimore who wasn't rooting for the hugely underdog NY Mets in the 1969 World Series. My team the Phillies were out of the race early and ended up with 99 losses. The Cinderella Mets team put an exclamation point to the baseball axiom that "good pitching beats...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; baseball columnist, an enchanting, enthralling history of the national pastime as told through the craft of pitching, based on years of archival research and interviews with more than three hundred people from Hall of Famers to the stars of today&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baseball is an amazing plaything. We can grip it and hold it so many different ways, and even the slightest calibration can turn an ordinary pitch into a weapon to thwart the greatest hitters in the world. Each pitch has its own history, evolving through the decades as the masters pass it down to the next generation. From the earliest days of the game, when Candy Cummings dreamed up the curveball while flinging clamshells on a Brooklyn beach, pitchers have never stopped innovating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches&lt;/i&gt;, Tyler Kepner traces the colorful stories and fascinating folklore behind the ten major pitches. Each chapter highlights a different pitch, from the blazing fastball to the fluttering knuckleball to the slippery spitball. Infusing every page with infectious passion for the game, Kepner brings readers inside the minds of combatants sixty feet, six inches apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with priceless insights from many of the best pitchers in baseball history--from Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, and Nolan Ryan to Greg Maddux, Mariano Rivera, and Clayton Kershaw&lt;i&gt;--K&lt;/i&gt; will be the definitive book on pitching and join such works as &lt;i&gt;The Glory of Their Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Moneyball &lt;/i&gt;as a classic of the genre.</description>

      <![CDATA[I thoroughly enjoyed this trip through the history of the game as depicted by the ten primary pitches: each is given its own chapter. Kepner was a beat writer for NY teams but he also has a fondness for my team the Phillies. There are a lot of original quotes, stories, and explanations first hand...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dramatic story of a legendary 1979 slugfest between the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies, full of runs, hits, and subplots, at the tipping point of a new era in baseball history&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It was a Thursday at Chicago's Wrigley Field, mostly sunny with the wind blowing out. Nobody expected an afternoon game between the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs on May 17, 1979, to be much more than a lazy early-season contest matching two teams heading in opposite directions--the first-place Phillies and the Cubs, those lovable losers--until they combined for thirteen runs in the first inning. "The craziest game ever," one player called it. "And then the second inning started."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ten Innings at Wrigley&lt;/i&gt; is Kevin Cook's vivid account of a game that could only have happened at this ballpark, in this era, with this colorful cast of heroes and heels: Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt and Bruce Sutter, surly slugger Dave Kingman, hustler Pete Rose, unlucky Bill Buckner, scarred Vietnam vet Garry Maddox, troubled relief pitcher Donnie Moore, clubhouse jester Tug McGraw, and two managers pulling out what was left of their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the highest-scoring ballgame in a century, and much more than that. Bringing to life the run-up and aftermath of a contest &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; called "the wildest in modern history," Cook reveals the human stories behind the game--and how money, muscles and modern statistics were about to change baseball forever.</description>

In the balance hang the ingredients for all-out war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his mentor out of the game, counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath must take on the role he has spent his career avoiding. But, as with everything else he does, he intends to rewrite the rules—all of them.</description>

  <description>Lucy Kendall lived her life in a strange mixture of carefully calculated moves and impulse decisions. Cracking the skull of the man who molested her sister and attacking her was impulse. Spending half her teenage years drinking and acting out were calculated cries for attention from her narcissistic mother followed by impulsive rages at her lack of concern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decade spent working in Child Protective Services before becoming a private investigator taught her two truths. One, CPS failed miserably in protecting children. Two, Lucy was more than willing to do it for them, meting out her brand of dark justice in spite of her own fear of death. But Lucy's crusade is compromised when a self-proclaimed sociopath offers to help—and leaves her no choice but to accept it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When eight-year old Kailey Richardson is abducted, it sets off a chain of events linked to Justin Beckett, a suspect in a life-changing case in Lucy's past. The path she's chosen since dealing with Beckett has been dark and terrifying—but she has no idea just how deep she will go or where the twisted road will take her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's about to find out.</description>

  <description>In the future, The Mueller Report may be judged as the most important document of our time. And no matter where you reside on the American political spectrum, you will probably agree that it will have far-reaching implications for the balance of power among the three coequal branches of government that create, administer, and apply the laws of our republic. With forewords by Lt. Col. Allen B. West (Ret.), and the Hon. Dan Boren, both former congressmen who served on opposite sides of the aisle while Robert Mueller served as director of the FBI, they hold insight into the leadership of the organization created expressly to investigate the questions answered by this report.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A pulse-pounding thriller of espionage, spy games, and treachery by the New York Times bestselling author of the &lt;i&gt;Tracy Crosswhite&lt;/i&gt; Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former CIA case officer Charles Jenkins is a man at a crossroads: in his early sixties, he has a family, a new baby on the way, and a security consulting business on the brink of bankruptcy. Then his former bureau chief shows up at his house with a risky new assignment: travel undercover to Moscow and locate a Russian agent believed to be killing members of a clandestine US spy cell known as the seven sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for money, Jenkins agrees to the mission and heads to the Russian capital. But when he finds the mastermind agent behind the assassinations—the so-called eighth sister—she is not who or what he was led to believe. Then again, neither is anyone else in this deadly game of cat and mouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursued by a dogged Russian intelligence officer, Jenkins executes a daring escape across the Black Sea, only to find himself abandoned by the agency he serves. With his family and freedom at risk, Jenkins is in the fight of his life—against his own country.</description>

      <![CDATA[More like a 3.7 rating for me. The first half was more intriguing to me. It began as a true espionage caper with intense chapters especially those escaping from Russian and a true heroine in Paulina. The unraveling of the truth about the eight sisters was very interesting. But, then I became disa...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;His ultimate challenge: justice for an innocent woman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former law professor Tom McMurtrie has taken on some of the most infamous cases in Alabama’s history—but this one will be his biggest yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McMurtrie’s old nemesis, Jack Willistone, is found dead on the banks of the Black Warrior River. Willistone had his share of enemies, but all evidence points to a forgotten, broken woman as the killer. At the urging of the suspect’s desperate fourteen-year-old daughter, McMurtrie agrees to take the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as seasoned as McMurtrie is, even he isn’t prepared for how personal and dangerous it’s going to get. With the trial drawing near and his sharp young partner, Rick Drake, dealing with a family tragedy, he recruits his best friend, Bocephus Haynes, to help investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As key witnesses disappear and old demons return, time becomes McMurtrie’s most fearsome opponent. Soon loyalties will be tested and the boundaries of law will be broken as McMurtrie fights to save his legacy—and his client’s life—before the truth is buried forever in the muddy waters of the Black Warrior.</description>

  <description>The home was top-notch New Jersey suburban. The living room was Martha Stewart. The basement was Legos—and blood. For sports agent Myron Bolitar, the disappearance of a man he'd once competed against was bringing back memories—of the sport he and Greg Downing had both played and the woman they both loved. Now, among the stars, the wanna-bes, the gamblers and groupies, Myron is unraveling the strange, violent life of a sports hero gone wrong, and coming face-to-face with a past he can't relive, and a present he may not survive.&lt;br /&gt;In novels that crackle with wit and suspense, Edgar Award winner Harlan Coben has created one of the most fascinating and complex heroes in suspense fiction—Myron Bolitar—a hotheaded, tenderhearted sports agent who grows more and more engaging and unpredictable with each page-turning appearance.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Cuckoo's Calling&lt;/i&gt; is a 2013 crime fiction novel by J. K. Rowling, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant mystery in a classic vein: Detective Cormoran Strike investigates a supermodel's suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.</description>

      <![CDATA[I had the audio unabridged version. The narration by Robert Glenister was superb. I thought the investigation was meticulously plotted and fascinating as it unfolded. I thought the characters were extremely well drawn so that I could picture them all so clearly that it made for an enjoyable story...]]>

  <description>Steve Martini has written a wonderfully crafted and clever courtroom thriller. We unquestionably have a new literary lion in the fictional crime genre.&lt;br /&gt; —Vincent Bugliosi"In the tradition of great courtroom dramas, Steve Martini's &lt;b&gt;Compelling Evidence&lt;/b&gt; is a taut, tense tale that I simply could not put down."&lt;br /&gt; —Dominick Dunne"Sets a standard for suspenseful, intelligent courtroom drama that will be hard to equal. It's by far the best of the genre I've ever seen . . . Absolutely thrilling."&lt;br /&gt; —Clifford Irving"Terrific and intriguing legal drama . . . thoroughly entertaining. It's great!"&lt;br /&gt; —Melvin Belli"Superb . . . truly on a level with &lt;b&gt;Presumed Innocent&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;br /&gt; —F. Lee Bailey&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The past and the present collide with stunning results in the latest Reed Ferguson mystery.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Potential client Brad Webb asks Denver private investigator Reed Ferguson to look into the decades-old murder of Brad’s grandfather, Dewey Webb. Dewey was a Denver-based private detective who died mysteriously in 1955, and although Reed is intrigued, he doesn't see much promise in solving the case. After all, the police didn't find Dewey's killer at the time, and seventy years have passed, leaving a cold trail. However, Reed accepts the case, and as he is drawn back into both the underworld and the elite society of 1950s Denver, he realizes that Dewey had discovered secrets that someone still wants to keep hidden today, even if it means resorting to murder. Can Reed piece together old and new clues to find the killer, or will the past come back to harm him?</description>

  <description>America has enemies - ruthless people that the police, the FBI, even the military can't stop. That's when the U.S. government calls on Will Robie, a stone cold hitman who never questions orders and always nails his target. But Will Robie may have just made the first - and last - mistake of his career... &lt;p&gt;It begins with a hit gone wrong. Robie is dispatched to eliminate a target unusually close to home in Washington, D.C. But something about this mission doesn't seem right to Robie, and he does the unthinkable. He refuses to kill. Now, Robie becomes a target himself and must escape from his own people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleeing the scene, Robie crosses paths with a wayward teenage girl, a fourteen-year-old runaway from a foster home. But she isn't an ordinary runaway -- her parents were murdered, and her own life is in danger. Against all of his professional habits, Robie rescues her and finds he can't walk away. He needs to help her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the more Robie learns about the girl, the more he's convinced she is at the center of a vast cover-up, one that may explain her parents' deaths and stretch to unimaginable levels of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Robie may have to step out of the shadows in order to save this girl's life... and perhaps his own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>America has enemies - ruthless people that the police, the FBI, even the military can't stop. That's when the U.S. government calls on Will Robie, a stone cold hitman who never questions orders and always nails his target. But Will Robie may have just made the first - and last - mistake of his career... &lt;p&gt;It begins with a hit gone wrong. Robie is dispatched to eliminate a target unusually close to home in Washington, D.C. But something about this mission doesn't seem right to Robie, and he does the unthinkable. He refuses to kill. Now, Robie becomes a target himself and must escape from his own people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleeing the scene, Robie crosses paths with a wayward teenage girl, a fourteen-year-old runaway from a foster home. But she isn't an ordinary runaway -- her parents were murdered, and her own life is in danger. Against all of his professional habits, Robie rescues her and finds he can't walk away. He needs to help her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the more Robie learns about the girl, the more he's convinced she is at the center of a vast cover-up, one that may explain her parents' deaths and stretch to unimaginable levels of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Robie may have to step out of the shadows in order to save this girl's life... and perhaps his own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"If Grisham wrote political thrillers, they'd feel like this!" The first woman U.S. President is impeached in an international conspiracy to destroy her. She’s the target of an assassination attempt to kill her. She’s a U.S.-born Mexican-American whose family background is both historic and criminal. She’s what Kirkus Reviews calls “An enthralling protagonist at the heart of a gripping tale.” Best selling author Lawrence De Maria says, “It wasn't that long ago when a plot like this would seem far-fetched. No more!” This thriller skims the surface between fiction and reality, told by an author who spent decades immersed in the tense and turbulent world of high stakes politics. The Latina President is suspenseful, topical, important. And it’s one hell of a good read. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES&lt;/b&gt; is BOOK 1 of 7 in the legal thriller series featuring Mike Daley &amp;amp; Rosie Fernandez. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Debut author Sheldon Siegel bursts into the legal thriller arena with a riveting courtroom drama, exposing the world of big-time law firms and lawyers in a fresh, sharp-witted, wonderfully sardonic page-turner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meet Mike Daley. Ex-priest. Ex–public defender. And as of yesterday, ex-partner in one of San Francisco's most prominent law firms. Today he's out on his own, setting up practice on the wrong side of town. Then his best friend and former colleague is charged with a brutal double murder, and Daley is instantly catapulted into a high-profile investigation involving the prestigious law firm that just booted him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As he prepares his case, Daley uncovers the firm's dirtiest secrets. It doesn't take long for him to discover that in this trial, ambition, friendship, greed, and long-standing grudges will play just as important a role as truth and justice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly paced, crackling with energy and suspense, Special Circumstances reminds us why we love to hate lawyers — but can't get enough of courtroom drama when it's done this well.</description>

  <description>When Ernie Banks passed away in 2015, he was regarded as one of the most beloved men in baseball history. Making his start as a shortstop with the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Leagues as a teenager, Banks went on to become the first African American to play for the Chicago Cubs. Known affectionately as "Mr. Cub," he brought exceptional talent and boundless optimism to the game of baseball, earning him a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a place in the Hall of Fame. In Let's Play Two: The Life and Times of Ernie Banks, Doug Wilson explores the life of one of baseball's most immortal figures, from his humble beginnings as a young boy living in the segregated South to his last few years and the public battles over his remains and will. Drawing on interviews of those close to Banks from all stages of his life, Wilson presents a portrait of the baseball player not just as an athlete, but also as a complex man with ambitious goals and hidden pains. Ernie Banks's enthusiasm and skill transcended issues of race and helped him to become one of the most highly-regarded men in baseball. Offering details that have never before been printed, this book discusses Banks's athletic prowess as well as the legacy he left behind. Let's Play Two is the essential Ernie Banks biography for sports fans and historians alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"I swing big, with everything I've got. I hit big or I miss big. I like to live as big as I can." -- Babe Ruth&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Babe Ruth is without a doubt the most famous character ever produced by the sport of baseball. A legendary player, world-famous for his hitting prowess, he transcended the sport to enter the mainstream of American life as an authentic folk hero. &lt;br /&gt; In this extraordinary biography, noted sportswriter Robert W. Creamer reveals the complex man behind the sports legend. From Ruth's early days in a Baltimore orphanage, to the glory days with the Yankees, to his later years, Creamer has drawn a classic portrait of an American original.</description>

  <description>With World War II finally ending, Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has wangled one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the Allied occupation. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. &lt;p&gt; When Jake stumbles on a murder -- an American soldier washes up on the conference grounds -- he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What Jake finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation. Berlin in July 1945 is like nowhere else -- a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Jake searches the ruins for Lena, he discovers that years of war have led to unimaginable displacement and degradation. As he hunts for the soldier's killer, he learns that Berlin has become a city of secrets, a lunar landscape that seethes with social and political tension. When the two searches become entangled, Jake comes to understand that the American Military Government is already fighting a new enemy in the east, busily identifying the "good Germans" who can help win the next war. And hanging over everything is the larger crime, a crime so huge that it seems -- the worst irony -- beyond punishment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At once a murder mystery, a moving love story, and a riveting portrait of a unique time and place, &lt;i&gt;The Good German&lt;/i&gt; is a historical thriller of the first rank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Set in Berlin just after the end of World War II, a brilliant thriller about the end of one war and the beginning of another, by the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Los Alamos&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Berlin, 1945. Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has managed to wangle one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the American occupation of postwar Berlin. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles on a murder--an American soldier washed up on the shore of the conference grounds--he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What he finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation and a city not only physically but morally devastated, where children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and the black market is the only means of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berlin at zero hour is like nowhere else--a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. And nothing is simple--not the murder of a soldier and not any of the lives, American and German, that Jake encounters as he tries to solve it. More unsolvable still is the larger crime that hangs over everything in 1945, a crime so huge it seems beyond punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At once a murder mystery, a love story, and a riveting portrait of a unique time and place, &lt;i&gt;The Good German&lt;/i&gt; is a historical thriller of the first rank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Though Carey's career is on the rise, his marriage is circling the drain, and as he spends more time at the office, he discovers there is something not quite right about this decaying old home. It harbors some dark secrets—connecting him to the long-dead soldier and others in ways he can't understand. With his personal life in shambles, and forces from within the house vying for his attention, Carey casts reason aside and begins an investigation to uncover the truth about what happened in this haunted place. As he peels back the layers of history, he finds courage and love, but also deception, greed, jealousy, and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisting through time—between an America torn by Civil War and the prosperous 1950s—&lt;i&gt;Murder Bay&lt;/i&gt; is a mystery that spans eras and the gulf dividing what can and cannot be explained.</description>

Horwitz was born in Washington, D.C., the son of a D.C. police officer and a piano teacher. Raised in suburban Maryland, David read voraciously, wrote short stories, and biked into the city whenever he could. He studied journalism and Russian in college, wrote for the school paper, and earned a degree in information systems. In 2000, he and his wife moved to rural Minnesota, where he programmed computers by day and wrote on nights and weekends. David's dream of writing full-time ended when he died in 2004. He left behind his wife of ten years, parents, siblings, and the manuscripts that would become the Ben Carey mystery series. Murder Bay was his first book.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With inside access and reporting, &lt;i&gt; Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt; senior baseball writer and FOX Sports analyst Tom Verducci reveals how Theo Epstein and Joe Maddon built, led, and inspired the Chicago Cubs team that broke the longest championship drought in sports, chronicling their epic journey to become World Series champions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It took 108 years, but it really happened. The Chicago Cubs are once again World Series champions. &lt;br /&gt; How did a team composed of unknown, young players and supposedly washed-up veterans come together to break the Curse of the Billy Goat? Tom Verducci, twice named National Sportswriter of the Year and co-writer of The Yankee Years with Joe Torre, will have full access to team president Theo Epstein, manager Joe Maddon, and the players to tell the story of the Cubs' transformation from perennial underachievers to the best team in baseball. &lt;br /&gt; Beginning with Epstein's first year with the team in 2011, Verducci will show how Epstein went beyond "Moneyball" thinking to turn around the franchise. Leading the organization with a manual called "The Cubs Way," he focused on the mental side of the game as much as the physical, emphasizing chemistry as well as statistics. &lt;br /&gt; To accomplish his goal, Epstein needed manager Joe Maddon, an eccentric innovator, as his counterweight on the Cubs' bench. A man who encourages themed road trips and late-arrival game days to loosen up his team, Maddon mixed New Age thinking with Old School leadership to help his players find their edge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cubs Way&lt;/i&gt; takes readers behind the scenes, chronicling how key players like Rizzo, Russell, Lester, and Arrieta were deftly brought into the organization by Epstein and coached by Maddon to outperform expectations. Together, Epstein and Maddon proved that clubhouse culture is as important as on-base-percentage, and that intangible components like personality, vibe, and positive energy are necessary for a team to perform to their fullest potential. &lt;br /&gt; Verducci chronicles the playoff run that culminated in an instant classic Game Seven. He takes a broader look at the history of baseball in Chicago and the almost supernatural element to the team's repeated loses that kept fans suffering, but also served to strengthen their loyalty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cubs Way &lt;/i&gt;is a celebration of an iconic team and its journey to a World Championship that fans and readers will cherish for years to come.</description>

  <description>Lauren Riley is an accomplished detective who has always been on the opposite side of the courtroom from her nemesis, slick defense attorney Frank Violanti. But now he's begging to hire her as a private investigator to help clear his client of murder. At first Lauren refuses, wanting nothing to do with the media circus surrounding that case—until she meets the eighteen-year-old suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep an innocent teen from life in prison, Lauren must unravel the conflicting evidence and changing stories to get at the buried facts. But the more she digs, the more she discovers that nothing is what it first appears to be. As Lauren puts her career and life in danger, doubt starts to lurk on every corner . . . and so does her stalker.</description>

The intruder is retired detective Harry Bosch, working a cold case that has gotten under his skin. Ballard kicks him out, but then checks into the case herself and it brings a deep tug of empathy and anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bosch is investigating the death of fifteen-year-old Daisy Clayton, a runaway on the streets of Hollywood who was brutally murdered and her body left in a dumpster like so much trash. Now, Ballard joins forces with Bosch to find out what happened to Daisy and finally bring her killer to justice.</description>

  <description>With an evenly-divided United States Senate, the stakes are high for the nation's political power brokers. The leader of one party decides to change the numbers by arranging the elimination of one of the other party's senators. As the death sends shock waves through the nation's capital, federal prosecutor Jeff Trask and a team of FBI agents and police officers must solve not only the senator's homicide, but the murder of one witness and the attempted murder of another. Further complicating their efforts is the fact that the trial of the killer must take place in the political swamp of Washington, D.C. As Trask and his team investigate the deaths and prepare for the trial of the century, the nation's political fate hangs in the balance.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed author Mike Vaccaro presents a riveting, must-read account of what remains, nearly a century later, the greatest World Series ever played. &lt;br /&gt;In October of 1912, seven years before gambling nearly destroyed the sport, the world of baseball got lucky. It would get two teams-the Boston Red Sox and the New York Giants, winners of a combined 208 games during the regular season-who may well have been the two finest ball clubs ever assembled to that point. Most importantly, during the course of eight games spanning nine days in that marvelous baseball autumn, they would elevate the World Series from a regional October novelty to a national obsession. The games would fight for space on the front pages of the nation's newspapers, battling both an assassin's bullet and the most sensational trial of the young century, with the Series often carrying the day and earning the "wood." &lt;br /&gt;In "The First Fall Classic," veteran sports journalist and author Mike Vaccaro brings to life a bygone era in cinematic and intimate detail-and gives fans a wonderful page-turner that re-creates the magic and suspense of the world's first "great" series.</description>

      <![CDATA[I absolutely loved this book. How interesting can a book be about one world series played over a hundred years ago? It can be engrossing in the hands of Mike Vaccaro. This was easily the best world series up until 1912 in baseball, and perhaps one of the best ever. The author brings alive the lov...]]>

  <description>Just minutes after winning a $1.6 million wrongful-death verdict, attorney David Sloane confronts the one case that threatens to blemish his unbeaten record in the courtroom. Beverly Ford wants Sloane to sue the United States government and military in the mysterious death of her husband, James, a national guardsman killed in Iraq. While a decades-old military doctrine might make Ford's case impossible to win, Sloane, a former soldier himself, is compelled to find justice for the widow and her four children in what is certain to become the biggest challenge of his career.With little hard evidence to go on, Sloane calls on his friend, reclusive former CIA agent turned private investigator Charles Jenkins, to track down the other men serving with Ford the night he died. Alarmingly, two of the four who returned home alive didn't stay that way for long, and though the mission's wheelchairbound commander now works for a civilian contractor, he refuses to talk. The final -- and youngest -- soldier is also the most elusive, but he's their only shot at discovering the truth -- if Sloane and Jenkins can keep him alive long enough to tell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Sloane isn't the only one on a manhunt. As he propels his case into a federal courtroom, those seeking to hide the truth threaten Sloane's family, forcing his new wife Tina and stepson Jake into hiding, where they become the targets of a relentless killer. Now Sloane must race to uncover what really happened on that fatal mission, not only to bring justice to a family wronged but to keep himself and the people closest to him from becoming the next casualties....</description>

Hynd takes us through the early 20th century and introduces us to the names of big entertainment. In a curious way baseball players also became entertainers on the stage. It was usually vaudeville and...]]>

Behind the headlines, unknown to most private citizens, the two super powers bumble toward nuclear confrontation....and in the back streets and back alleys of world capitals, spies and recalled spies fight for a part of a missile guidance system that could tip the balance during nuclear confrontation. And at the center is a woman with a terrible secret.&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Flowers From Berlin, Conspiracy in Kiev&lt;/i&gt; and two dozen other best selling thrillers, comes a newly revised 'endgame' spy story, based on the events of 1983 that were all too real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Noel Hynd knows the ins and outs of Washington's institutions, public and private." –&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The novels of Noel Hynd stand out like emeralds." -–&lt;i&gt;NY Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A few notches above the Ludlums and Clancys of the world" –&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This is the book Frank Sinatra failed to stop,  the unauthorized biography of one of the most  elusive public figures of our time. Celebrated  journalist Kitty Kelley spent three years researching  government documents (Mafia-related material, wiretaps  and secret testimony) and interviewing more than  800 people in Sinatra's life (family, colleagues,  law-enforcement officers, personal friends). Fully  documented, highly detailed and filled with  revealing anecdotes, here is the penetrating story of  the explosively controversial and undeniably  multi-talented legend who ruled the entertainment  industry for more than fifty  years.</description>

No doubt some of what she writes is true, but she doesn't present a balanced and fair portrait of the Chairman of the Board.

      <![CDATA[ I found the writing to be humorless and prosaic. I felt like I was reading the daily wrap ups of games from his playing days. The book simply had no umph to it, void of drama. We get glimpses of what Foxx was like but they are superficial and almost cliche. He was "a great guy", "always had fun"...]]>

  <description>"The Storytellers" are baseball s play-by-play and color men who have created the legends and lore of the game. From the days of static-filled radio broadcasts to today's internationally televised games, baseball has been shaped into America s pastime by these wizards of the microphone. Assembled in this terrific collection, these great announcers from all over the country share with us some of their favorite stories about the job - their best games, most admired players, preferred parks, biggest flubs and more. With their unique styles of speech, cadences, and catch phrases, these broadcasters have become our friends at the ballpark conveying the excitement, celebrating the victories, and commiserating on the defeats. Baseball fans of all ages and from the East coast to the West coast will enjoy welcoming these ballpark friends into their homes once again. "The Storytellers" will be released in an audio version in Spring 1997.</description>

  &lt;blockquote&gt;To unmask a CIA mole, John Wells must resume his old undercover identity as an al Qaeda jihadi and hope he can survive it in the new cutting-edge novel from the #1 bestselling author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;It is the most dangerous mission of John Wells s career.&lt;br /&gt; Evidence is mounting that someone high up in the CIA is doing the unthinkable passing messages to ISIS, alerting them to planned operations. Finding out the mole s identity without alerting him, however, will be very hard, and to accomplish it, Wells will have to do something he thought he d left behind forever. He will have to reassume his former identity as an al Qaeda jihadi, get captured, and go undercover to befriend an ISIS prisoner in a secret Bulgarian prison.&lt;p&gt;Many years before, Wells was the only American agent ever to penetrate al Qaeda, but times have changed drastically. The terrorist organizations have multiplied: gotten bigger, crueler, more ambitious and powerful. Wells knows it may well be his death sentence. But there is no one else."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A frighteningly plausible, fast-paced thriller about a Russian cyberattack on America, involving fake news and anonymous hackers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The CIA has learned that the Kremlin is about to launch a sophisticated propaganda operation aimed at discrediting and disrupting the United States and ultimately restoring Russia to great nation status. Intercepted intelligence suggests that the operation will hinge on a single, breaking news event in Eastern Europe, supported by a sustained campaign of disinformation and cyberattacks. Code-named the "Children’s Game"--a chess stratagem that leads to checkmate in four moves--it was probably conceived by a Russian billionaire and former FSB officer named Andrei Turov. For years Turov has been developing the infrastructure for a new kind of warfare that exploits weaknesses in western democracies and manipulates public opinion. His organization offers the Kremlin plausible deniability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the United States has its own secret weapon: Christopher Niles, a former CIA intelligence officer, who understands Turov's ambitions and capabilities. It falls to him and his small team--composed of his journalist half-brother Jon, a special forces operative he would trust with his life, and Anna Carpenter, a resourceful US senator with deep roots in the intelligence community--to unravel Turov's plot and restore truth to a world spiraling into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Children's Game&lt;/i&gt; is a frighteningly realistic, timely thriller that delves into the secret corners of Vladimir Putin's Russia, exploring the shifting world order and the murky realm of US-Russia relations.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a novel cut straight out of current headlines. This is a novel of intrigue, deception, and contemporary warfare. The plot is engaging, intricate, and plausible. I think this is a top notch espionage story with interesting characters to accompany a thoughtful story line.]]>

  <description>The incredible performances of Juan Marichal and Warren Spahn on July 2, 1963, would forever link their names together in baseball history, and this dual biography of these athletes weaves that 1963 contest throughout the narrative in a book that is sure to be a home run with baseball fans everywhere. Even before their epic pitching duel, Marichal and Spahn already had a lot in common. Future Hall of Famers with high-kicking deliveries, they were shaped into winners by character-building experiences in the military. Spahn had been baseball's most winning pitcher in the 1950s, and Marichal would be equally dominant in the 1960s. The Braves' Spahn and the Giants' Marichal began their duel in San Francisco's cold and windy Candlestick Park. Four hours later, the two pitching legends were deadlocked in a scoreless tie when Willie Mays hit a walk-off home run to end the greatest game ever pitched. In between, Marichal and Spahn each threw more than 200 pitches and went 16 innings without relief. Considering today's culture of pitch counts and coddled arms, it was proved to be a legendary night that won't be repeated ever again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Legendary first baseman Keith Hernandez tells all in this gripping and literary memoir.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times Bestseller&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; Keith Hernandez revolutionized the role of first baseman. During his illustrious career with the World Series-winning St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets, he was a perennial fan favorite, earning eleven consecutive Gold Gloves, a National League co-MVP Award, and a batting title. But it was his unique blend of intelligence, humor, and talent--not to mention his unflappable leadership, playful antics, and competitive temperament--that transcended the sport and propelled him to a level of renown that few other athletes have achieved, including his memorable appearances on the television show &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; Now, with a striking mix of candor and self-reflection, Hernandez takes us along on his journey to baseball immortality. There are the hellacious bus rides and south-of-the-border escapades of his minor league years. His major league benchings, unending plate adjustments, and role in one of the most exciting batting races in history against Pete Rose. Indeed, from the Little League fields of Northern California to the dusty proving grounds of triple-A ball to the grand stages of Busch Stadium and beyond, &lt;em&gt;I'm Keith Hernandez&lt;/em&gt; reveals as much about America's favorite pastime as it does about the man himself. &lt;br /&gt; What emerges is an honest and compelling assessment of the game's past, present, and future--a memoir that showcases one of baseball's most unique and experienced minds at his very best.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When family secrets are unearthed, a woman’s past can become a dangerous place to hide…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the death of her adoptive mother, Ava Saunders comes upon a peculiar photograph, sealed and hidden away in a crawl space. The photo shows a shuttered, ramshackle house on top of a steep hill. On the back, a puzzling inscription: &lt;i&gt;Destiny calls us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ava is certain that it’s a clue to her elusive past. Twenty-three years ago, she’d been found wrapped in a yellow blanket in the narthex of the Holy Saviour Catholic Church—and rescued—or so she’d been told. Her mother claimed there was no more to the story, so the questions of her abandonment were left unanswered. For Ava, now is the time to find the roots of her mother’s lies. It begins with the house itself—once the scene of a brutal double murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ava enlists the help of the two people closest to her, a police detective and her best friend, she fears that investigating her past could be a fatal mistake. Someone is following them there. And what’s been buried in Ava’s nightmares isn’t just a crime. It’s a holy conspiracy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The world knows Aimée Leduc, heroine of 15 mysteries in this &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series, as a &lt;i&gt;très chic&lt;/i&gt;, no-nonsense private investigator—the toughest and most relentless in Paris. Now author Cara Black dips back in time to reveal how Aimée first became a detective . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 1989: Aimée Leduc is in her first year of college at Paris’s preeminent medical school. She lives in a 17th-century apartment that overlooks the Seine with her father, who runs the family detective agency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the week the Berlin Wall crumbles, so does Aimée’s life as she knows it. First, someone has sabotaged her lab work, putting her at risk of failing out of the program. Then, she finds out her &lt;i&gt;aristo&lt;/i&gt; boyfriend is planning to get engaged to another woman. And finally, Aimée’s father takes off to Berlin on a mysterious errand. He asks Aimée to help out at the detective agency while he’s gone—as if she doesn’t already have enough to do. But the case Aimée finds herself investigating—a murder linked to a transport truck of Nazi gold that disappeared in the French countryside during the height of World War II—has gotten under her skin. Her heart may not lie in medicine after all—maybe it’s time to think harder about the family business.</description>

  <description>Detective Harry Bosch has retired from the LAPD, but his half-brother, defense attorney Mickey Haller, needs his help. A woman has been brutally murdered in her bed and all evidence points to Haller's client, a former gang member turned family man. Though the murder rap seems ironclad, Mickey is sure it's a setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bosch doesn't want anything to do with crossing the aisle to work for the defense. He feels it will undo all the good he's done in his thirty years as a homicide cop. But Mickey promises to let the chips fall where they may. If Harry proves that his client did it, under the rules of discovery, they are obliged to turn over the evidence to the prosecution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it goes against all his instincts, Bosch reluctantly takes the case. The prosecution's file just has too many holes and he has to find out for himself: if Haller's client didn't do it, then who did? With the secret help of his former LAPD partner Lucy Soto, Harry starts digging. Soon his investigation leads him inside the police department, where he realizes that the killer he's been tracking has also been tracking him.</description>

  <description>Harry Bosch is back as a volunteer working cold cases for the San Fernando Police Department and is called out to a local drug store where a young pharmacist has been murdered. Bosch and the town's 3-person detective squad sift through the clues, which lead into the dangerous, big business world of pill mills and prescription drug abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, an old case from Bosch's LAPD days comes back to haunt him when a long-imprisoned killer claims Harry framed him, and seems to have new evidence to prove it. Bosch left the LAPD on bad terms, so his former colleagues aren't keen to protect his reputation. He must fend for himself in clearing his name and keeping a clever killer in prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two unrelated cases wind around each other like strands of barbed wire. Along the way Bosch discovers that there are two kinds of truth: the kind that sets you free and the kind that leaves you buried in darkness.</description>

  <description>Mickey Haller gets the text, "Call me ASAP - 187," and the California penal code for murder immediately gets his attention. Murder cases have the highest stakes and the biggest paydays, and they always mean Haller has to be at the top of his game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mickey learns that the victim was his own former client, a prostitute he thought he had rescued and put on the straight and narrow path, he knows he is on the hook for this one. He soon finds out that she was back in LA and back in the life. Far from saving her, Mickey may have been the one who put her in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by the ghosts of his past, Mickey must work tirelessly and bring all his skill to bear on a case that could mean his ultimate redemption or proof of his ultimate guilt.</description>

      <![CDATA[Loved the story. Mickey Haller and his team are easy to like and root for. This is a very interesting and not implausible mystery that leads to a realistic and fascinating trial. Connelly knows his legal strategy better than most lawyers, and he tells it simply and powerfully.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling author Philip Kerr, the much-anticipated return of Bernie Gunther, our compromised former Berlin bull and unwilling SS officer. With his cover blown, he is waiting for the next move in the cat-and-mouse game that, even a decade after Germany’s defeat, continues to shadow his life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The French Riviera, 1956: The invitation to dinner was not unexpected, though neither was it welcome. Ernst Mielke, deputy head of the East German Stasi, has turned up in Nice, and he’s not on holiday. An old and dangerous adversary, Mielke is calling in a debt. He intends that Bernie go to London and, with the vial of Thallium he now pushes across the table, poison a female agent they both have had dealings with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But chance intervenes in the form of Friedrich Korsch, an old Kripo comrade now working for Stasi and probably there to make sure Bernie gets the job done. Bernie bolts for the German border. Traveling by night, holed up during the day, Bernie has plenty of down time to recall the last time Korsch and he worked together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was the summer of 1939: At Hitler’s mountaintop retreat in Obersalzberg, the body of a low-level bureaucrat has been found murdered. Bernie and Korsch are selected to run the case. They have one week to solve the murder—Hitler is due back then to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. Lucky Bernie: it’s his reward for being Kripo’s best homicide detective. He knows what a box he’s in: millions have been spent to secure Obersalzberg. It would be a disaster if Hitler were to discover a shocking murder had been committed on the terrace of his own home. But the mountaintop is home to an elite Nazi community. It would be an even bigger disaster for Bernie if one of them was the murderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1939 and 1956: two different eras, seventeen years apart. And yet, not really apart, as the stunning climax will show when the two converge explosively.</description>

Dillon Randolph, a young Foreign Service officer, arrives at the U.S. Mission in Berlin hoping for a fresh start after a messy scandal at his last embassy posting.

Dillon and Christa are plunged into the shadowy struggle between competing spy agencies where the innocent become bargaining chips in a game with life-and-death consequences.</description>

  <description>A few short blocks from the safety of the museums and monuments on the National Mall, a ruthless killer prowls the streets of Washington DC. Federal prosecutor Jeff Trask joins a team of FBI agents and police detectives as they try and solve the series of brutal murders. As the body count rises, the investigation leads to a chilling confrontation with the leader of an international drug smuggling ring, and no one is safe, not even the police.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by former Washington prosecutor Marc Rainer, Capital Kill is a swirling thrill ride through the labyrinth of a major federal investigation and trial, with a gripping conclusion that no one will see coming.</description>

  <description>Most fans today know that gamblers and ballplayers conspired to fix the 1919 World Series the Black Sox Scandal. It has been touched upon in classic works of sports history such as Eliot Asinof 's "Eight Men Out," referred to in literary classics like W. P. Kinsella 's "Shoeless Joe," and has been central to two of the best baseball movies ever made, John Sayles 's "Eight Men Out" and Phil Robinson 's "Field of Dreams."Many, however, would be surprised to learn that it took nearly a year to uncover the fix. "Burying the Black Sox" is the first book to focus on the cover-up that kept the fix from the American public until almost another whole baseball season was played, and to examine in detail the way events unfolded as the deception was unraveled. Unlike Eliot Asinof in "Eight Men Out," previously the definitive book on the subject, Carney thoroughly documents his information and brings together evidence from a wide variety of sources, many not available to Asinof or more recent writers.In "Burying the Black Sox," Gene Carney reveals what else happened and answers the questions that fascinate any baseball fan wondering about baseball 's original dilemma over guilt and innocence. Who else in baseball knew that the fix was in? When did they know? And what did they do about it? Carney explores how Charles Comiskey, the owner of the White Sox, and his fellow owners tried to bury the incident and control the damage, how the conspiracy failed, and how Shoeless Joe Jackson attempted to clear his name. He uses primary research materials that weren t available when Asinof wrote "Eight Men Out," including the 1920 grand jury statements by Jackson and pitcher Eddie Cicotte, the diary of Comiskey 's secretary, and the transcripts of Jackson 's 1924 suit against the Sox for back pay. Where Asinof told the story of the eight Black Sox, Carney explains the baseball industry 's uncertain response to the scandal.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Summer Game&lt;/i&gt;, Roger Angell’s first book on the sport, changed baseball writing forever. Thoughtful, funny, appreciative of the elegance of the game and the passions invested by players and fans, it goes beyond the usual sports reporter’s beat to examine baseball’s complex place in our American psyche. Between the miseries of the 1962 expansion Mets and a classic 1971 World Series between the Pirates and the Orioles, Angell finds baseball in the 1960s as a game in transition—marked by league expansion, uprooted franchises, the growing hegemony of television, the dominance of pitchers, uneasy relations between players and owners, and mounting competition from other sports for the fans’ dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, Brooks Robinson, Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, Carl Yastrzemski, Tom Seaver, Jim Palmer, and Casey Stengel are seen here with fresh clarity and pleasure. Here is California baseball in full flower, the once-mighty Yankees in collapse, baseball in French (in Montreal), indoor baseball (at the Astrodome), and sweet spring baseball (in Florida)—as Angell observes, “Always, it seems, there is something more to be discovered about this game.”</description>

  <description>Amos Decker's life changed forever--twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time was on the gridiron. A big, towering athlete, he was the only person from his hometown of Burlington ever to go pro. But his career ended before it had a chance to begin. On his very first play, a violent helmet-to-helmet collision knocked him off the field for good, and left him with an improbable side effect--he can never forget anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time was at home nearly two decades later. Now a police detective, Decker returned from a stakeout one evening and entered a nightmare--his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His family destroyed, their killer's identity as mysterious as the motive behind the crime, and unable to forget a single detail from that horrible night, Decker finds his world collapsing around him. He leaves the police force, loses his home, and winds up on the street, taking piecemeal jobs as a private investigator when he can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But over a year later, a man turns himself in to the police and confesses to the murders. At the same time a horrific event nearly brings Burlington to its knees, and Decker is called back in to help with this investigation. Decker also seizes his chance to learn what really happened to his family that night. To uncover the stunning truth, he must use his remarkable gifts and confront the burdens that go along with them. He must endure the memories he would much rather forget. And he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Memory Man&lt;/i&gt; will stay with you long after the turn of the final page.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a fascinating and engrossing story. The character of Amos Decker is unique and makes for a different kind of investigator. The supporting cast and the villains are also interesting. I have two minor critical points. First, the attention to detail at the school was overdone for me especial...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 11 hours and 30 minutes, 9 CDs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The man was smart and he didn't mind killing people. Welcome to the big leagues, Davenport. &lt;/i&gt;Lucas Davenport's first case as a U.S. Marshal sends him into uncharted territory, in the thrilling new novel in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks to some &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; influential people whose lives he saved, Lucas is no longer working for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, but for the U.S. Marshals Service, and with unusual scope. He gets to pick his own cases, whatever they are, wherever they lead him.&lt;br /&gt; And where they've led him this time is into real trouble. A Biloxi, Mississippi, drug-cartel counting house gets robbed, and suitcases full of cash disappear, leaving behind five bodies, including that of a six-year-old girl. Davenport takes the case, which quickly spirals out of control, as cartel assassins, including a torturer known as the "Queen of home-improvement tools" compete with Davenport to find the Dixie Hicks shooters who knocked over the counting house. Things get ugly &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; fast, and neither the cartel killers nor the holdup men give a damn about whose lives Davenport might have saved; to them, he's just another large target.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is my first Sandford novel and I loved it. It's amazing how he can sustain an interesting-often riveting plot revolving around an escape route by two notorious fugitives. The characters are original, quirky, mean spirited yet at the same time fascinating and funny. Plenty of dark humor here....]]>

  <description>Harry Bosch is California's newest private investigator. He doesn't advertise, he doesn't have an office, and he's picky about who he works for, but it doesn't matter. His chops from thirty years with the LAPD speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon one of Southern California's biggest moguls comes calling. The reclusive billionaire is nearing the end of his life and is haunted by one regret. When he was young, he had a relationship with a Mexican girl, his great love. But soon after becoming pregnant, she disappeared. Did she have the baby? And if so, what happened to it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to know whether he has an heir, the dying magnate hires Bosch, the only person he can trust. With such a vast fortune at stake, Harry realizes that his mission could be risky not only for himself but for the one he's seeking. But as he begins to uncover the haunting story--and finds uncanny links to his own past--he knows he cannot rest until he finds the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, unable to leave cop work behind completely, he volunteers as an investigator for a tiny cash-strapped police department and finds himself tracking a serial rapist who is one of the most baffling and dangerous foes he has ever faced.</description>

  <description>David Baldacci's remarkable detective Amos Decker - the man who can forget nothing - was first introduced in the sensational number-one New York Times best seller Memory Man. Now Decker returns in a stunning new novel.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fix &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker witnesses a murder just outside FBI headquarters. A man shoots a woman execution style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter - a family man with a successful consulting business - and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government - or, worse, an international terrorist group - and an attack may be imminent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2017 David Baldacci (P)2017 Hachette Audio</description>

  <description>Oliver Stone is the most wanted man in America; no, not the maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone but the covert agent whose real name is John Carr. Men in the highest circles of power want him dead, and they want him dead quickly, because he knows too many of their deepest secrets. The members of the secretive Camel Club, on the other hand, not only want him alive; they are willing to risk their own lives to save their leader and friend. All of which sets up David Baldacci's thriller of relentless intensity, a perfect follow-up to his acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Stone Cold&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE CROWS ARE GATHERING. WAR IS COMING.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, every intelligence agency in the world has been chasing the elusive terrorist known only as The Moroccan. But when James Hicks and his clandestine group known as the University thwart a bio-terror attack against New York City and capture The Moroccan, they find themselves in the crosshairs of their own intelligence community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CIA, NSA, DIA and the Mossad are still hunting for for The Moroccan and will stop at nothing to get him. Hicks must find a way to keep the other agencies at bay while he tries to break The terrorist and uncover what else he is planning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he ultimately surrenders information that leads to the most wanted terrorist in the world, Hicks and his team find themselves in a strange new world where allies become enemies, enemies become allies and the fate of the University - perhaps even the Western world - may hang in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Hicks and the University survive an onslaught from A MURDER OF CROWS?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The classical novel (and basis for the acclaimed film) now in a new edition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introduction by Kevin Baker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Natural&lt;/i&gt;, Bernard Malamud's first novel, published in 1952, is also the first—and some would say still the best—novel ever written about baseball. In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material—the story of a superbly gifted "natural" at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era—and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin's comment still holds true: "Malamud has done something which—now that he has done it!—looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives. He has really raised the whole passion and craziness and fanaticism of baseball as a popular spectacle to its ordained place in mythology."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An FBI investigation of a German spy ring on American soil threatens to devastate lives, loves, and families forty years after the end of World War II&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A watertight packet is discovered by a diver in the waters surrounding Block Island. Unrecovered detritus from the last German U-boat sunk off the coast of Rhode Island, it contains secret codes suggesting that a Nazi spy ring operated in the United States during the darkest days of World War II. If confirmed, it could prove a major embarrassment to the FBI—whose late director, J. Edgar Hoover, once assured the government there were no spies in the country—so the Bureau sends one of its best, Unit Chief Todd Oliver, to Newport to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A war that ended four decades earlier is not yet over for some in this New England naval town, as Oliver’s mission threatens to destroy the lives and relationships of the guilty and the innocent alike. Suddenly, dark, lingering shadows are everywhere, enveloping respected pillars of the community, the wealthy and powerful in their mansions on “the Avenue,” and respectable, law-abiding citizens who merely wish to forget. Even Oliver himself is not safe, as the agent’s inquiries into secret wartime espionage begin unraveling strong, sacred bonds of love, friendship, and family, tempting the dedicated operative to compromise everything he stands for in the face of a shocking murder that rocks Newport society to its core.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The Oakland A's of the early 1970s were the most transformative team in baseball history. Never before had an entire organization so collectively traumatized baseball's establishment with its outlandish behavior and business decisions-or with its indisputable winning record: five straight division titles and three straight championships. The high drama that played out on the field was exceeded only by the drama in the clubhouse and front office. But those A's, with their garish uniforms and outlandish facial hair, redefined soon...virtually every aspect of the game for coming generations. Under the visionary leadership of Charles O. Finley, the team assembled such luminary figures as Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Rollie Fingers, and Vida Blue. Finley acted as his own general manager, and, with an insatiable need for control, dictated everything from the playlist of the ballpark organist to the menu for the media lounge. The advent of free agency spelled the end of Finley's reign; within two years, his dynasty was lost. A sprawling, brawling history of one of the game's most unforgettable teams, Dynastic, Bombastic, Fantastic is a paean to a turbulent yet magical time.</description>

&lt;/b&gt;, Israeli-born Dalia Artzi, a tactical genius and specialist at Princeton in the study of maneuver warfare, uncovers a fiendish plot by a small group of Israeli fanatics to commit a horrific crime against the United States government and pin the blame on Iran. At first, Dalia, a pacifist, is hesitant to get involved. But, strong in her Jewish faith, she believes that the goal of her religion is not to crush one's enemies but to practice tikkun olam, to repair the world. Soon Dalia has little choice but to act quickly and do what she must to prevent the unspeakable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Jana, a beautiful but deadly Israeli operative taking orders from the conspiring fanatics, is determined to deftly fulfill the deadly mission entrusted to her. Once the plot has been carried out, Jana and the commanders of her mission believe that Israel's enemies will meet with total destruction when the world's most powerful nation retaliates. Jana is firm in her conviction that she is on the side of right and believes the ends will justify the means, however violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centered on a fascinating and original Israeli heroine and antiheroine, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;False Flag&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; probes some of the most important political and moral conflicts of our times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The search for a missing child leads a courageous railway cop down a twisted trail of murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been five months since Special Agent Sydney Parnell survived a violent confrontation with a gang of brutal thugs, an encounter that left her physically and emotionally scarred. Deep down, Sydney fears she isn’t ready for another investigation. But when a woman is murdered on the train tracks and a child is kidnapped, she knows she’s the only one who can lead the hunt for the killer. While Denver police and the FBI chase down blind alleys, Sydney focuses on a single cryptic clue left behind at the crime scene — one that will send her down a path of greed, violence, and long-ago love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Denver beset by a series of monsoonlike thunderstorms that threaten to flood the city, Sydney and her K9 partner, Clyde, must wade through a murky trail of murder that stretches back thirty years — all to rescue a child… and catch a killer with a long memory and an insatiable appetite for destruction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The epic World Series between the Yankees and the Dodgers and the six men whose lives were changed forever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1947 World Series was "the most exciting ever" in the words of Joe DiMaggio, with a decade's worth of drama packed into seven games between the mighty New York Yankees and underdog Brooklyn Dodgers. It was Jackie Robinson's first Series, a postwar spectacle featuring Frank Sinatra, Ernest Hemingway and President Harry Truman in supporting roles. It was also the first televised World Series - sportswriters called it "Electric October."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for all the star power on display, the outcome hinged on role players: Bill Bevens, a journeyman who knocked on the door of pitching immortality; Al Gionfriddo and Cookie Lavagetto, bench players at the center of the Series' iconic moments; Snuffy Stirnweiss, a wartime batting champion who never got any respect; and managers Bucky Harris and Burt Shotton, each an unlikely choice to run his team. Six men found themselves plucked from obscurity to shine on the sport's greatest stage. But their fame was fleeting; three would never play another big-league game, and all six would be forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Cook brings the '47 Series back to life, introducing us to men whose past offered no hint they were destined for extraordinary things. For some, the Series was a memory to hold onto. For others, it would haunt them to the end of their days. And for us, Cook offers new insights--some heartbreaking, some uplifting--into what fame and glory truly mean.</description>

  <description>A heart-stopping tale of suspense, Daniel Silva’s runaway bestseller, The Black Widow, was one of 2016’s biggest novels. Now, in House of Spies, Gabriel Allon is back and out for revenge – determined to hunt down the world’s most dangerous terrorist, a shadowy ISIS mastermind known only as Saladin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months after the deadliest attack on the American homeland since 9/11, terrorists leave a trail of carnage through London’s glittering West End. The attack is a brilliant feat of planning and secrecy, but with one loose thread. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thread leads Gabriel Allon and his team of operatives to the south of France and to the gilded doorstep of Jean-Luc Martel and Olivia Watson. A beautiful former British fashion model, Olivia pretends not to know that the true source of Martel’s enormous wealth is drugs. And Martel, likewise, turns a blind eye to the fact he is doing business with a man whose objective is the very destruction of the West. Together, under Gabriel’s skilled hand, they will become an unlikely pair of heroes in the global war on terrorism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in seductive and elegant prose, the story moves swiftly from the glamour of Saint-Tropez to the grit of Casablanca and, finally, to an electrifying climax that will leave readers breathless long after they turn the final page.</description>

Make sure you read beyond the initial chapters involving a rather ordinary armed robbery and unfamiliar terms. This is a very good story with some surprises and moments of suspense.

  &lt;b&gt;Based on the true story of a forgotten hero, &lt;i&gt;Beneath a Scarlet Sky&lt;/i&gt; is the triumphant, epic tale of one young man’s incredible courage and resilience during one of history’s darkest hours.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pino Lella wants nothing to do with the war or the Nazis. He’s a normal Italian teenager—obsessed with music, food, and girls—but his days of innocence are numbered. When his family home in Milan is destroyed by Allied bombs, Pino joins an underground railroad helping Jews escape over the Alps, and falls for Anna, a beautiful widow six years his senior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to protect him, Pino’s parents force him to enlist as a German soldier—a move they think will keep him out of combat. But after Pino is injured, he is recruited at the tender age of eighteen to become the personal driver for Adolf Hitler’s left hand in Italy, General Hans Leyers, one of the Third Reich’s most mysterious and powerful commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command, Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in secret, his courage bolstered by his love for Anna and for the life he dreams they will one day share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Unbroken&lt;/i&gt; will enjoy this riveting saga of history, suspense, and love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[As the author tells us in the preface, this is not fiction. Rather, it is a novel of biographical and historical fiction about the life of a young man who lived, loved, observed, and survived the Italian front in the second world war. It is a story of hair raising intensity and of cruelty of unim...]]>

  <description>The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, tucked away in upstate New York in a small town called Cooperstown, is far from any major media market or big league stadium. Yet no sports hall of fame's membership is so hallowed, nor its qualifications so debated, nor its voting process so dissected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its founding in 1936, the Hall of Fame's standards for election have been nebulous, and its selection processes arcane, resulting in confusion among voters, not to mention mistakes in who has been recognized and who has been bypassed. Numerous so-called "greats" have been inducted despite having not been so great, while popular but controversial players such as all-time home run leader Barry Bonds and all-time hits leader Pete Rose are on the outside looking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Cooperstown Casebook&lt;/i&gt;, Jay Jaffe shows us how to use his revolutionary ranking system to ensure the right players are recognized. The foundation of Jaffe's approach is his JAWS system, an acronym for the Jaffe WAR Score, which he developed over a decade ago. Through JAWS, each candidate can be objectively compared on the basis of career and peak value to the players at his position who are already in the Hall of Fame. Because of its utility, JAWS has gained an increasing amount of exposure in recent years. Through his analysis, Jaffe shows why the Hall of Fame still matters and how it can remain relevant in the 21st century.</description>

  <description>From his status as the #17 pick overall in the 1970 June draft in the shadow of his induction notice to his post-game minor league antics with Goose Gossage, Gorman Thomas and Charlie “Country Chuck” Manuel, former Rookie Pitcher of the Year John D’Acquisto explores the free love and “free agency” of 1972 California; the tragedy at Spring Training ‘74; John’s role as a pawn in the struggle for clubhouse power between manager Charlie Fox and Bobby Bonds; deep inside the untold story of the Bob Gibson/D’Acquisto pitching duels; the endless nightlife and shady characters of 1976 San Francisco; the despair of ex-major leaguers deserted in the 1977 AAA baseball purgatory of sunny Honolulu; the backroom dealings between players and management ahead of the 1981 players’ strike, and the fateful meeting between John and his former owner that may have derailed his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Heinie.” Randy. Buzzie. “Sweet Matt.” “Davvy.” Marvin. “Mac.” Juan. Jimmie Reese. Gibby &amp;amp; Torre. “Moff.” Keith. “Onti.” “Ras.” Pete. “Simba” &amp;amp; Geno, among many others along for the ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring a foreword by popular 70's baseball historian Dan Epstein and flavored by music of the era. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love the narrative structure of cable dramas like Mad Men and House of Cards, then you will adore this rich, period love story between a man and his profession.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Dying Hour&lt;/i&gt; introduces Jason Wade, a rookie crime reporter with &lt;i&gt;The Seattle Mirror&lt;/i&gt;, a loner who grew up in the shadow of a brewery in one of the city's blue-collar neighborhoods. At &lt;i&gt;The Seattle Mirror&lt;/i&gt;, he is competing for the single full-time job being offered through the paper's intense intern program. But unlike the program's other young reporters, who attended big name schools and worked at other big metro dailies, Wade put himself through community college, and lacked the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wade struggles with his haunting past as he pursues the story of Karen Harding, a college student whose car was found abandoned on a lonely stretch of highway in the Pacific Northwest. How could this beloved young woman with the altruistic nature simply vanish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wade battles mounting odds and cut-throat competition to unearth the truth behind Karen Harding's disturbing case. Her disappearance is a story he cannot give up, never realizing the toll it could exact from him. &lt;i&gt;The Dying Hour&lt;/i&gt; is a bone-chilling, mesmerizing page-turner that introduces readers to an all-too-human young hero who journeys into the darkest regions of the human heart to confront a nightmare.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The never-before-told story of the momentous season torn in half by the bitter players strike.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;1981 was a watershed moment in American sports, when players turned an oligarchy of owners into a game where they had a real voice. Midway through the season, a game-changing strike ripped baseball apart, the first time a season had ever been stopped in the middle because of a strike. Marvin Miller and the MLB Players Association squared off against Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and the owners in a fight to protect players rights to free agency and defend America's pastime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a time bomb was ticking as the 1981 season began, the game rose to impressive---and now legendary---heights. Pete Rose chased Stan Musial's National League hit record and rookie Fernando Valenzuela was creating a sensation as the best pitcher in the majors when the stadiums went dark and the players went on strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in modern history, there were first- and second-half champions; the two teams with the overall best records in the National League were not awarded play-off berths. When the season resumed after an absence of 712 games, Rose's resumption of his pursuit, the resurgence of Reggie Jackson, the rise of the Montreal Expos, and a Nolan Ryan no-hitter became notable events. The Dodgers bested their longtime rivals in a Yankees-Dodgers World Series, the last classic matchup of those storied opponents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sourcing incredible and extensive interviews with almost all of the major participants in the strike, &lt;i&gt;Split Season: 1981&lt;/i&gt; returns us to the on- and off-field drama of an unforgettable baseball year.</description>

  <description>On a secret sea maneuver just before D-Day, American Colonel Hugh Kelso goes down in the English Channel. Wounded and adrift for days, he washes ashore on the German-occupied island of Jersey. The news spreads panic through the Allied high command: Kelso knows the time and place of the invasion. He must be rescued -- or silenced. A British professor turned Nazi impersonator and a young Jersey girl posing as his mistress set off to find Kelso in the fiercely guarded island fortress. The pair join a deadly game of wits that they must win....or perish in the darkness of the "Night of the Fox"</description>

      <![CDATA[If there is such a thing as a perfect novel, this one is for me. Can anyone tell a tale of historical fiction like Jack Higgins? Not in my opinion. This novel has everything in it that a reader would ever ask. It is a thriller, an ingenious plot, a crucial stage of World War 11, and romance to bo...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The stunning new legal thriller from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Hanging Judge&lt;/i&gt;, "a talent to watch" (&lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When FBI agents barge into Sidney Cranmer's home accusing him of a heinous crime, the respected literature professor's life becomes a nightmare. Cranmer insists the illicit material found by the agents isn't his, but the charge against him appears airtight, and his academic specialty--the life and work of controversial author Lewis Carroll, creator of &lt;i&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;--convinces investigators he's lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Presiding over the case against Professor Cranmer, U.S. District Judge David Norcross fears his daily confrontation with evil has made him too jaded to become a husband and father. His girlfriend, Claire Lindemann, teaches in the same department as the defendant and is convinced of his innocence. Soon, she will take matters into her own hands. Meanwhile--with his love life in turmoil and his plans for the future on hold--a personal tragedy leaves Norcross responsible for his two young nieces. Unbeknownst to him, a vengeful child predator hovers over his new family, preparing to strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Michael Ponsor's debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Hanging Judge&lt;/i&gt;, was praised by retired Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens for reminding readers "that the judicial process is not infallible" and by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder for bearing "the heft of authenticity." &lt;i&gt;The One-Eyed Judge &lt;/i&gt;again draws on Ponsor's thirty years as a US district judge, offering readers an insider's view of one of the most harrowing kinds of cases faced by the courts. Fast-paced, thrilling, and thought-provoking, this is legal fiction at its most realistic and compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The One-Eyed Judge &lt;i&gt;is the 2nd book in the Judge Norcross Novels, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Losing the trial of his life could mean losing everything.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young reporter is found dead and a prominent Philadelphia businessman is accused of her murder, Mick McFarland finds himself involved in the case of his life. The defendant, David Hanson, was Mick’s close friend in law school, and the victim, a TV news reporter, had reached out to Mick for legal help only hours before her death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mick’s played both sides of Philadelphia’s courtrooms. As a top-shelf defense attorney and former prosecutor, he knows all the tricks of the trade. And he’ll need every one of them to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the trial progresses, he’s disturbed by developments that confirm his deepest fears. This trial, one that already hits too close to home, may jeopardize his firm, his family—everything. Now Mick’s only way out is to mastermind the most brilliant defense he’s ever spun, one that will cross every legal and moral boundary.</description>

  <description>They killed Patton when he opposed them. They ve cowered Presidents into going to war. For more than half a century, a secret organization of Army officers known as The Line has been covertly manipulating US Policy. Now, in a political climate rife with dissent and unrest, The Line has ordered a pivotal top-secret operation that will let the world know who is really in charge: take out the President on Pearl Harbor Day. But The Line didn t count on Boomer Watson, a member of the Army s elite Delta Force and Major Benita Trace, both West Point graduates, staying true to their oath of allegiance and willing to fight The Line with their lives. From The Ukraine to Pearl Harbor to West Point to the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia, it s a race against time to stop The Line as December 7th looms.</description>

  <description>A botched drone strike pushes the United States and China to the brink of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE #1 BESTSELLING BLAKE CARVER SERIES RETURNS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As dawn rises over Tripoli, counter-terrorism operative Blake Carver arrives ahead of a planned drone strike on an extremist stronghold. But his plan to extract an embedded CIA operative turns disastrous when the mistargeted attack reduces the Chinese Embassy to rubble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All signs point to an inside job, and Carver finds himself on the wrong end of an internal investigation. Forced into exile, he watches helplessly as Beijing erupts in riots, an American diplomat is murdered and cyber attacks are unleashed on Wall Street. The two superpowers teeter on the brink of all-out war. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With only the help of a renegade hacker and an old flame with powerful friends, Carver must act alone to thwart the most ingenious conspiracy the world has ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover why critics call the Blake Carver Series "Astonishing," "Chilling" and "Impossible to put down."&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition for ASIN B00OHZ151W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Hurts. For Derwena de Caro, songstress, female icon, teenage dream, success brought drugs, alcohol and a philandering boyfriend. It also brought wealth, fame and a stalker, or so she claimed. And that’s where I came in, to investigate the identity of the stalker, little realising that the trail would lead to murder and a scandal that would make the newspaper headlines for months on end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love Hurts. For me, Samantha Smith, Enquiry Agent, love arrived at the end of a fist. First, I had to contend with an alcoholic mother, who took her frustrations out on me throughout my childhood, then my husband, Dan, who regarded domestic violence as an integral part of marriage. But I survived. I obtained a divorce, kept my sense of humour and retained an air of optimism. I established my business and gained the respect of my peers. However, I was not prepared for Dan when he re-entered my life, or for the affection showered on me by Dr Alan Storey, a compassionate and rather handsome psychologist. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam’s Song. This is the story of a week that changed my life forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Extract &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He was running towards me now, shotgun in his hands. I gathered my things, turned on my heel and scarpered into the woods. It would take me twenty minutes, at least, to get out of there. In my favour, I had mobility and agility. In his favour, he had power, strength and speed. With all things being equal, he would catch me before I made it back to my car. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Five minutes into my run I was starting to pant, more from anxiety than from a lack of stamina. I glanced over my shoulder. I could hear him, but I couldn’t see him. I pinned my ears back and ran as fast as I could. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After ten minutes, I sensed that he was close behind me. I was about to turn around to look when I heard the blast of the shotgun and, just above my head, saw the splintering of wood. Stumbling and gasping, I ploughed on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I ran, two thoughts occurred to me: one – he was faster than me and at this rate, he would catch up with me before I left the wood. Two – the fact that he was willing to use the shotgun revealed that he was taking no prisoners; he was shooting to kill. I increased my pace and prayed that I’d catch sight of the country lane soon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I tripped over a branch. I went sprawling into the mulch of the forest floor. I tried to stand, but my ankle gave way. I would need five minutes recovery time but at this rate, I had less than five minutes to live. Frantically, I looked around and saw a large stone, heavy, but not quite a boulder. I limped over to the stone and tried to lift it. It was heavy, but fear gives you amazing strength and somehow I raised the stone to shoulder level and on to a knot of branches. Then I started to climb the tree. It was slow, painful going but, as a tomboy, climbing trees was my speciality and I still had the elasticity and suppleness of youth. Occasionally I’d pause to reposition the stone, then I’d move up to a higher branch. From ground level, I was out of sight, but I had a clear view through the tree to its base and roots. With my ankle aching and sweat dripping off my brow, I raised the stone and steadied myself. It seemed to take an age and my arms were hurting now, but Baldy appeared at the base of the tree, shotgun poised, his beady eyes scanning the woods... &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"I CONSIDER MYSELF THE LUCKIEST MAN ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;On July 4, 1939, baseball great Lou Gehrig delivered what has been called "baseball's Gettysburg Address" at Yankee Stadium and gave a speech that included the phrase that would become legendary. He died two years later and his fiery widow, Eleanor, wanted nothing more than to keep his memory alive. With her forceful will, she and the irascible producer Samuel Goldwyn quickly agreed to make a film based on Gehrig's life, &lt;i&gt;The Pride of the Yankees&lt;/i&gt;. Goldwyn didn't understand--or care about--baseball. For him this film was the emotional story of a quiet, modest hero who married a spirited woman who was the love of his life, and, after a storied career, gave a short speech that transformed his legacy. With the world at war and soldiers dying on foreign soil, it was the kind of movie America needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using original scrips, letters, memos, and other rare documents, Richard Sandomir tells the behind-the-scenes story of how a classic was born. There was the so-called Scarlett O'Hara-like search to find the actor to play Gehrig; the stunning revelations Elanor made to the scriptwriter Paul Gallico about her life with Lou; the intensive training Cooper underwent to learn how to catch, throw, and hit a baseball for the first time; and the story of two now-legendary Hollywood actors in Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright whose nuanced performances endowed the Gehrigs with upstanding dignity and cemented the baseball icon's legend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandomir writes with great insight and aplomb, painting a fascinating portrait of a bygone Hollywood era, a mourning widow with a dream, and the shadow a legend cast on one of the greatest sports films of all time. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Inspired by real crimes. From the author of the number-one best-seller, &lt;i&gt;The Good Lawyer&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serial killer is littering the south shore beach of Long Island with the bones of his female victims stuffed into burlap bags. Nick Mannino, &lt;i&gt;The Good Lawyer &lt;/i&gt;and former South Bronx Legal Aid Attorney born into a mobster dominated family, is a complex and compelling character--his constant court battles nothing more than a futile effort to hide and deny a haunting truth about himself and worse--a sinewy bloodline marred by unspeakable crimes. Then this brutal serial killer turns on him, and worse, his family. As much a thriller as it is a mystery, with an ending as riveting as that in &lt;i&gt;Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Criminal Lawyer&lt;/i&gt; is also a love story, a novel of family secrets, and crimes beyond forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Bill Barrister is riddled with almost crippling anxiety, the kind of nervous condition that prevents him from having any kind of normal life. Once a teenage pitching phenom, he finds temporary calm and comfort from throwing a baseball every day in the backyard of his boyhood home where he lives after spending twenty years in the military. When a free-spirited boyhood friend lures him on a cross-country road trip, Bill is sprung from the malaise of his small town existence and off on a reluctant journey of self-discovery and of his past.</description>

  <description>The death of a teenage Amish girl in a cornfield looks like an accident, but sheriff Serenity Adams suspects foul play. To solve the murder, she must investigate the nearby Amish community with the help of a man who was shunned years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lamb to the Slaughter&lt;/i&gt; is a story about the intertwining lives of three unlikely people in an Indiana Amish Community and the devastating results when a rebellious teenage girl is found shot to death in a corn field during the harvest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serenity Adams is the newly elected young sheriff in the country town of Blood Rock and besides dealing with the threatening behavior of her predecessor, she now has a dead Amish girl on her plate. At first glance, the case seems obvious. The poor girl was probably accidentally shot during hunting season, but when the elders of the Amish community and even the girl’s parents react with uncaring subdued behavior, Serenity becomes suspicious. As she delves deeper into the secretive community that she grew up beside, she discovers a gruesome crime from the past that may very well be related to the Amish girl’s shooting. Serenity enlists the help of the handsome bad-boy building contractor, Daniel Bachman, who left the Amish when he was nineteen and has his own dark reasons to help the spunky sheriff solve the crime that the family and friends who shunned him are trying desperately to cover up. Serenity’s persistence leads her to a stunning discovery that not only threatens to destroy her blossoming romance with Daniel, but may even take her life in the end.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brad Thor comes Foreign Agent—a thriller as current as tomorrow’s headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a safe house near the Syrian border, a clandestine American operations team readies to launch a dramatic mission months in the making. Their target: the director of Social Media for ISIS, Abu Muslim al-Naser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple analysts, as well as a senior Congresswoman, are in the country to monitor the raid, but before the team can launch, the safe house is attacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unfolds in the bloody aftermath is a political and public relations nightmare. As horrific videos of the Americans are published on the Internet, the blame-storming back in Washington goes into full swing, focusing on how the intel for the raid was developed and how it might have leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search for answers mounts, half spy, half covert counterterrorism operative, Scot Harvath quickly finds himself at the center of the storm. Working for a private intelligence agency contracted by both the CIA and the DoD, it was Harvath who pinpointed al-Naser. But how could ISIS have known the Americans were coming, much less where they would be staying? There has to be more to it; something everyone—especially the politicians—is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the weight of the attack on his shoulders and several powerful members of Congress calling for his head, Harvath is forced to launch his own operation to unravel what went wrong and exact revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as he nears the truth and the deadly puzzle pieces begin to fall into place, Harvath will uncover another actor—a rogue player hell-bent on forcing America’s hand and drawing it into a plot more dangerous than anyone in Washington could have imagined.</description>

      <![CDATA[An interesting premise and tactic on the ISIS/ Russian threat. This is not a full blown action novel nor is it full of twists, but it is thoughtful and topical. My reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is the fantasy-like epilogue that belies reality.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18625570-flash" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN B00F240FDG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT WOULD YOU DO&lt;br /&gt;if you woke up to the sound of screaming . . .&lt;br /&gt;in the trunk of a car . . .&lt;br /&gt;beside a dead cop . . .&lt;br /&gt;with no idea where you were . . .&lt;br /&gt;or why . . .&lt;br /&gt;or when?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine THE BOURNE IDENTITY meets THE FIRM.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO BLOOD-SPATTERED STRANGERS awake, locked in the trunk of a car—with a murdered cop and the smoking gun. Aside from raging headaches and no idea what’s happened, they appear to have nothing in common. Troy thinks it’s 2001 and he’s still a combat surgeon fighting terrorists in Afghanistan. Emmy believes it’s 2002 and she’s still grifting a living from the streets of L.A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they archenemies or coconspirators? Lovers or friends? What are they doing in the Caribbean, and why is a Croatian assassin determined to kill them? The only thing they know for certain is that they’ll be spending the rest of their lives in prison if the police catch them before they learn the truth.</description>

  <description>Ash Rashid is a former homicide detective who can't stand the thought of handling another death investigation. Another year, and he'll be out of the department completely. That's the plan, at least, until his niece's body is found in the guest home of one of his city's most wealthy citizens. The coroner calls it an overdose, but the case doesn't add up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against orders, Ash begins a danger-filled investigation to find his niece's murderer, but the longer he searches, the more entangled he becomes in a case that hits increasingly close to home. If he doesn't solve it fast, his niece won't be the only family member he has to bury.</description>

This is an easy read with a protagonist who is flawed yet still likeable. He respects his faith but doesn't dogmatically follow its tenets. He is also an alcoh...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT SENT HIM...&lt;br /&gt;The Russian president caught him...&lt;br /&gt;The free world is counting on him...&lt;br /&gt;But he doesn't remember.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Imagine Robert Ludlum’s THE BOURNE IDENTITY meets Lee Child’s PERSONAL.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journey beneath the diplomatic veneer of international politics and beyond the reach of conventional military operations into the epicenter of clandestine affairs — where diplomats dance and spies collide in wars that never make the news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the next step in its expansionist agenda, the Kremlin devises a covert coup far more devastating than Bin Laden’s most dangerous dream. With the American economy in his crosshairs, Russian President Vladimir Korovin picks suitable pawns and pulls sizable levers, initiating the boldest gambit the world has ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;Halfway around the world, the White House develops a plan for derailing Russian aggression. A way-off-the-books, high-risk, high-reward plan. American President William Silver identifies the perfect person for his impossible mission: former CIA operative Kyle Achilles.&lt;br /&gt;With their plans in place and their spies undercover, each president is confident that he has outplayed the other — until everything goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lies Of Spies will keep you guessing from first page to last with the suspenseful twists and unpredictable turns readers expect from Tim Tigner. Don’t pick it up at night if you plan to work in the morning.</description>

Why? He has no idea. He's fighting blind against two master strategists and one extraordinary invention--known as Brillyanc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Achilles' only ally is the other prime suspect, a beautiful Russian mathematician who is either the best or worst person to ever enter his life. Katya was engaged to Achilles' brother -- before he died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chasing clues while dodging bullets, Achilles and Katya race around the globe, uncovering a conspiracy conceived in Moscow, born in Silicon Valley, and destined to demolish both the White House and the Kremlin. Along the way a lost soul finds purpose, a broken heart confronts forbidden love, and America gains a new hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with heart-stopping surprises, paced by razor-sharp plotting, and populated with richly rendered characters, Pushing Brilliance will leave you breathless and longing for more.</description>

While urging Titus to become a believer in Jesus Christ, they manage to smuggle him out of Iran to freedom in Turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it help him deal with his past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the States, he discovers his Iranian mission failed because of political infighting within the Agency. In a hot-tempered outburst, he delivers a scathing indictment against the Deputy Director of Operations, and, as a result, the deputy forces Titus to take a year's medical leave in Oklahoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will it change his future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before leaving Langley, Virginia, Titus learns he's been targeted by a Hezbollah assassin hired by the Iranians. Now, while trying to figure out what it means to be a follower of Christ, he must decide if the Iranian couple he meets in Norman, Oklahoma has ties to the man who's trying to kill him, and if Nikki Saxon, a local detective with an intriguing past, can be trusted with his secrets.</description>

  <description>West Point Graduate, former Green Beret, and NY Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal Bestselling Author Bob Mayer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over four million books sold. Translated into over a dozen languages. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Heart-racing, non-stop action that is difficult to put down."-Mystery News on Bodyguard of Lies &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Thelma and Louise go clandestine."-Kirkus Reviews on Bodyguard of Lies &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” Winston Churchill &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who polices the world of covert operations? Enter the Cellar, the most secret spy organization hiding deep within the United States. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two women become inextricably involved in a dangerous web of lies, intrigue, and betrayal as they fight for their lives and the safety of their country. Neeley is the lover and protégé of Gant, a Cellar operative, and is trying to pick up the pieces of her life after Gant's death and unveil a mystery that Gant always held close to his chest. Hannah, a housewife, is equally lost after her husband simply disappears. They soon learn that the men in their lives shared a dangerous secret, one some very powerful people would shed blood to protect. Neeley and Hannah's chance meeting sets a decades-old plan into motion and puts their lives at risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They couldn't come from more different worlds, but as they try to escape the people who seem determined to kill them, Hannah and Neeley discover they have at least one thing in common: they've both been living a lie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Crisscrossing the globe, the women find themselves in a deadly game of survival, one that they must win in order to keep the United States safe not only from vicious acts of terror, but from its own powers that be. And if they ever hope to uncover the truth about the lovers they thought they knew, Neeley and Hannah first must learn the truth about themselves. But when the Cellar is involved, there is no such thing as coincidence, and the truth is always protected by a Bodyguard of Lies.</description>

  <description>Governments, hospitals, and industry use computerized industrial control systems to remotely monitor and control elevators, electricity, alarms, surveillance systems, and more. It's convenient and efficient. And potentially deadly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Aroostine Higgins put her personal life on hold to join the Department of Justice's elite Criminal Division. Now she’s prosecuting two men accused of attempting to bribe a foreign government official. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But everything's going wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her pretrial motion vanishes from the federal court's electronic docketing system. Her apartment catches fire. Routine dental surgery turns into a near-death experience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Aroostine's past comes crashing into her present, her most critical vulnerability is exploited and she finally admits she isn't simply suffering a string of bad luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An unseen enemy is determined to destroy her—and the only man she's ever loved—unless she finds him first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Critical Vulnerability is the latest whip-smart legal thriller by USA TODAY Bestselling &lt;br /&gt;Author Melissa F. Miller. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A young woman is found brutally murdered, and the main suspect is the victim’s fiancé, a hideously scarred Iraq War vet known as the Burned Man. But railroad police Special Agent Sydney Rose Parnell, brought in by the Denver Major Crimes unit to help investigate, can't shake the feeling that larger forces are behind this apparent crime of passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the depths of an icy winter, Parnell and her K9 partner, Clyde ― both haunted by their time in Iraq ― descend into the underground world of a savage gang of rail riders. There, they uncover a wide-reaching conspiracy and a series of shocking crimes. Crimes that threaten everything Parnell holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search for the truth puts her directly in the path of the killer, Parnell must struggle with a deadly question: Can she fight monsters without becoming one herself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Suspense Magazine Best of 2016 Books Selection.</description>

But I will buy Barbara Nickless' next book in this series. This is a gripping, and intelligently written masterpiece. The lead character Sydney Rose, a railroad...]]>

  <description>Bill Barrister is riddled with almost crippling anxiety, the kind of nervous condition that prevents him from having any kind of normal life. Once a teenage pitching phenom, he finds temporary calm and comfort from throwing a baseball every day in the backyard of his boyhood home where he lives after spending twenty years in the military. When a free-spirited boyhood friend lures him on a cross-country road trip, Bill is sprung from the malaise of his small town existence and off on a reluctant journey of self-discovery and of his past.</description>

  <description>Will Robie is the government's most professional, disciplined, and lethal assassin. He infiltrates the most hostile countries in the world, defeats our enemies' advanced security measures, and eliminates threats before they ever reach our shores. &lt;br /&gt;But now, his skills have left him. Sent overseas on a critical assignment, he fails, unable to pull the trigger. Absent his talents, Robie is a man without a mission, and without a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;To recover what he has lost, Robie must confront what he has tried to forget for over twenty years: his own past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE GUILTY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Robie escaped his small Gulf Coast hometown of Cantrell, Mississippi, after high school, severing all personal ties, and never looked back. Not once. Not until the unimaginable occurs. His father, Dan Robie, has been arrested and charged with murder.&lt;br /&gt;Father and son haven't spoken or seen each other since the day Robie left town. In that time, Dan Robie--a local attorney and pillar of the community--has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed.&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty? &lt;br /&gt;With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism . . . and violence.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son. And this time, there may be no escape for either of them.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[At best this warrants a two rating. The first half is interesting because of the setting and the murder charge against Robie's father(Think The Judge). But the plot then devolves into bad pulp fiction. The plot is absurd, improbable, and beneath the standards of a Balducci novel. I won't "ruin" t...]]>

  <description>Forged masterpieces. Hidden messages. A desperate swan song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When world-renowned nonverbal communication expert Doctor Genevieve Lenard wakes up in an unknown location, drugged and kidnapped, it pushes the limits of her autism coping skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last year, Russian philanthropist and psychopath Tomasz Kubanov has been studying Genevieve just as she and her team have been studying him. Now forged paintings and mysterious murders are surfacing around her team, with evidence pointing to one of them as the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genevieve knows Kubanov is behind these senseless acts of violence. What she doesn’t understand are the inconsistencies between his actions and the cryptic messages he sends. Something has triggered his unpredictable behaviour, something that might result in many more deaths, including those she cares for. Because this time, Kubanov has nothing to lose.</description>

  <description>A bizarre honeymoon plunges Fedora into the search for a disguised Nazi killer, a fabulous cache of diamonds – and an espionage plot so monstrous it will hold readers spellbound until the shattering climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS AS IMPOSSIBLE AS ONE, TWO, THREE…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Find a well-disguised ex-Nazi without knowing what he looks like…&lt;br /&gt;2. Uncover a fantastic, vital cache of diamonds that might not even exist…&lt;br /&gt;3.	Climb the dangerous slopes of a virtually un-scalable mountain with men you suspect want to kill you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it was an assignment Johnny wouldn’t have accepted from British Intelligence in a million years – but on his own, with a once-in-a-lifetime girl like Marie-Andrée at his side, he jumped at the chance. Unfortunately, it was only his first mistake…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it was Eric Amber, then Ian Fleming, now the most lethal espionage mastermind blasts onto the scene …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“As one has come to expect from Cory, colorful action, copious carnage, elaborate intrigue, frequent surprises.”&lt;br /&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Readers who like their thrillers to complement their intelligence must on no account miss Mr Cory.”&lt;br /&gt;The Times</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 30th, 1970, at the age of 38, former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston died from what Las Vegas police suspected was a heroin overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When police arrived, they found a one-ounce balloon on Sonny's nightstand but the coroner quickly labelled Sonny's passing as death by natural causes. To this day, Liston's death hovers over Las Vegas and the sports world, leaving unanswered questions about his ties to powerful boxing promoters, billionaire hoteliers, mob kingpins and shadowy drug lords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviving boxing's most infamous cold case to work out what really happened on that night in December over forty years ago, in &lt;i&gt;The Murder of Sonny Liston: A Story of Fame, Heroin, Boxing &amp;amp; Las Vegas&lt;/i&gt; Shaun Assael examines the last mysterious year of Liston's life against the backdrop of a pivotal year in the history of Las Vegas. 1970 was the year that the mob turned a sleepy desert oasis into a cathedral of corporate gambling. Glittering new towers were rising along the strip, while race riots were devastating the black community, creating two very different cities for Sonny Liston to disappear into. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With key aspects of Liston's life previously ignored or glossed over, Assael takes a fresh look at Liston's complicated life, getting to the bottom of one of America's most enduring mysteries, while painting a stunning portrait of mob-run Las Vegas in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>“A delight for baseball lovers” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) and “one of the most significant baseball books of the year” (Bob Costas) &lt;i&gt;Ahead of the Curve&lt;/i&gt; uses stories from baseball’s present and past to examine why we sometimes choose ignorance over information, and how tradition can trump logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget batting average. Kill the “Win.” Say goodbye to starting pitchers. And please, please stop bunting. MLB Network anchor and commentator Brian Kenny provides “an excellent, entertaining read for the all-around baseball fan” (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;) and shows how baseball has been revolutionized—not destroyed—by analytical thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people who resist logical thought in baseball preach “tradition” and “respecting the game.” But many of baseball’s traditions go back to the nineteenth century, when the pitcher’s job was to provide the batter with a ball he could hit and fielders played without gloves. Instead of fearing change, Brian Kenny wants fans to think critically, reject outmoded groupthink, and embrace the changes that have come with the sabermetric era. In his entertaining and enlightening book, Kenny discusses why the pitching win-loss record, the Triple Crown, fielding errors, and so-called battling titles should be ignored. He also points out how fossilized sportswriters have been electing the wrong MVP’s and ignoring legitimate candidates for the Hall of Fame; why managers are hired based on their looks; and how the most important position in baseball may just be “Director of Decision Sciences.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Prepare to have your brain and your assumptions challenged. Guided by data and a deep love of the game, Brian Kenny takes a cutting-edge look at where baseball is and where it is going” (Tom Verducci, &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt;). Illustrated with unique anecdotes from those who have reshaped the game, &lt;i&gt;Ahead of the Curve&lt;/i&gt; is “a great story about the game in the age of information and technology” (Billy Beane).</description>

  <description>Bearing W.P. Kinsella's trademark combination of "sweet-natured prose and a richly imagined world" (Philadelphia Inquirer), The Iowa Baseball Confederacy tells the story of Gideon Clark, a man on a quest. He is out to prove to the world that the indomitable Chicago Cubs traveled to Iowa in the summer of 1908 for an exhibition game against an amateur league, the Iowa Baseball Confederacy. But a simple game somehow turned into a titanic battle of more than two thousand innings, and Gideon Clark struggles to set the record straight on this infamous game that no one else believes ever happened.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first biography of the eccentric pitcher, rookie All-Star starter, 70s pop icon, and first athlete on the cover of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who remember him, Mark Fidrych is still that player who brings a smile to your face, the irresistibly likable pitcher whose sudden rise brightened the star-spangled season of 1976 and reminded us of the pure joy of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanky, mop-topped, and nicknamed for his resemblance to Big Bird on &lt;i&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/i&gt;, Fidrych exploded onto the national stage during the Bicentennial summer as a rookie with the Detroit Tigers. He won over fans nationwide with his wildly endearing antics such as talking to the ball---and throwing back the ones that "had hits in them"; getting down on his knees to "manicure" the mound of any cleat marks; and shaking hands with just about everyone from teammates to groundskeepers to cops during and after games. Female fans tried to obtain locks of his hair from his barber and even named babies after him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But The Bird was no mere sideshow. The non-roster invitee to spring training that year quickly emerged as one of the best pitchers in the game. Meanwhile, his boyish enthusiasm, his famously modest lifestyle, and his refusal to sign with an agent during the days of labor disputes and free agency made him such a breath of fresh air for fans that not only did attendance in Detroit increase---by &lt;i&gt;tens&lt;/i&gt; of thousands---for games he pitched, &lt;i&gt;opposing teams&lt;/i&gt; would specifically ask the Tigers to shuffle their rotation so Fidrych would pitch in their cities, too. A rare player who transcended pop culture, Fidrych was named starting pitcher in the All-Star Game as a rookie (the first of his two All-Star nods) and became the first athlete to appear on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baseball researcher Doug Wilson delivers the first biography of this once-in-a-lifetime player. Through extensive interviews and meticulous research, the author recounts Fidrych's meteoric rise from Northborough, Massachusetts, to the big leagues, his heartbreaking fall after a torn knee ligament and then rotator cuff, his comeback attempts with the Tigers and in the Red Sox system, and one unforgettable night when The Bird pitched a swan song for the Pawtucket Red Sox against future star Dave Righetti in a game that remains part of local folklore. Finally, Wilson captures Fidrych's post-baseball life and his roles in the community, tragically culminating with his death in a freak accident in 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bird&lt;/i&gt; gives readers a long-overdue look into the life of a player whom baseball had never seen before---and has never seen since.</description>

  <description>  Berlin, 1943.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;British agent Michael York is sent to Berlin to solve the mystery of his predecessor’s death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A member of the Berlin String Quartet, four talented musicians, had offered the British Intelligence officer valuable information. But another member had betrayed him, and turned him in to the Gestapo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Each of the musicians has access to vital information and can easily be the one who betrayed York’s predecessor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;York finds the quartet difficult to assess. Amanda Hamilton is lead violinist and a former Brit. Her husband is a German citizen, Manfred Richter, a high ranking Nazi. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She could be the Gestapo informant, loyal to her husband even with his indiscretions. An amateur photographer, she has chronicled ten years of life in Germany, and is a favorite of Hitler. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Erika Jaeger, second violinist, works in the logistics department of the War Ministry. Viola player Gerhard works as a draftsmen for the Armaments Department, with access to secret weapons. The last of the quartet, Albert Kaiser, has access to valuable information through highly-placed relatives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the aid of a British master spy, Max, York works painstakingly to solve the riddle and gather information for the Allies. He must tiptoe through the streets of Berlin, always cautious, always aware, knowing that a child could betray him as easily as a grandmother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He approaches each member of the quartet, watching and waiting, probing their weaknesses and avoiding their strengths. As the months pass, he observes and assesses, learns their secrets, and evaluates their loyalties. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael York must decide who is on his side, who is dangerous, and who is in danger. As the Gestapo slowly begins to close in on York, his friendship with Amanda blooms to romance and they plan their escape from Germany. Nothing can prepare him for the revelations that follow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Anthony Miller&lt;/b&gt; is a world traveller. He is the author of &lt;em&gt;To Parts Unknown,&lt;/em&gt; published in the fall of 2014. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;  Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent digital publisher.

      <![CDATA[This is a well written and touching story of espionage during the zenith of World War 2. It reads like a mystery and most chapters end with tension so it's difficult to put down. In fact the last 20% of the book is a nail biter. It's a realistic and unique story that will keep you involved throug...]]>

  <description>THE COALITION - A NOVEL OF SUSPENSE&lt;br /&gt;#1 DENVER POST BESTSELLING AUTHOR (FICTION)&lt;br /&gt;WINNER BEVERLY HILLS BOOK AWARDS (POLITICAL THRILLER)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Coalition’ has a lot of good action and suspense, an unusual female assassin, and the potential to be another ‘The Day After Tomorrow.’"--James Patterson, #1 New York Times Best-Selling Author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the fiftieth floor of an office building in Denver, Colorado, a long-range assassin calmly watches a procession of black Lincolns. When the motorcade pulls to the curb in Civic Center Plaza, a prominent leader steps from one of the vehicles and takes the stage to make an important speech. Moments later, a loud BOOM echoes through the Plaza and the man slumps to the platform like a stringless marionette. The mysterious sniper, whose very existence is unknown to the international law enforcement community, has just assassinated U.S. President-elect William Ambrose Kieger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of the shocking political crime, the shooter escapes and a Task Force is swiftly assembled, headed up by Special Agent Kenneth Patton of the FBI’s Denver Field Office. A ten year vet in Domestic Terrorism, the unconventional Ken is driven to solve the crime by both professional and personal motives. His search leads him to a secret society whose diabolical and far-reaching plot threatens the very highest levels of the U.S. government. Yet the group’s motives, secret membership, and ambitious plans remain elusive. Can Ken and his team uncover the plot in time to save the day? Can they beat the countdown on the clock and catch the assassin and the shadowy group in the background pulling the strings? Or will time run out?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ASIN: B00428LBDQ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confessions abound-some of them quite unexpected-in Sheldon Siegel's new legal thriller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Daley doesn't go to confession much since he left the priesthood twenty years ago and became a lawyer, but that doesn't stop his old friend, Father Ramon Aguirre, from trying to get him there. "It wouldn't kill you to go to church once in a while," he tells Mike. But it does kill someone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several months, a ruinous sexual harassment suit has been building against the San Francisco Catholic Archdiocese, and when the plaintiff's lawyer is found dead, an apparent suicide, an almost audible sigh of relief is heard in certain quarters. But that is before the police find evidence of murder. Even worse-the evidence points to Father Aguirre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike and his ex-wife law partner, Rosie, jump in to take the priest's case, but what started out as difficult soon appears impossible as forensics, witnesses, and secrets from Father Aguirre's past all incriminate their client. Soon, their wits are the only things keeping the priest from a life sentence or worse, and wits simply may not be enough-unless they can conjure up a miracle of their own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;Robert Harris returns to the thrilling historical fiction he has so brilliantly made his own. This is the story of the infamous Dreyfus affair told as a chillingly dark, hard-edged novel of conspiracy and espionage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Paris in 1895. Alfred Dreyfus, a young Jewish officer, has just been convicted of treason, sentenced to life imprisonment at Devil’s Island, and stripped of his rank in front of a baying crowd of twenty-thousand. Among the witnesses to his humiliation is Georges Picquart, the ambitious, intellectual, recently promoted head of the counterespionage agency that “proved” Dreyfus had passed secrets to the Germans. At first, Picquart firmly believes in Dreyfus’s guilt. But it is not long after Dreyfus is delivered to his desolate prison that Picquart stumbles on information that leads him to suspect that there is still a spy at large in the French military. As evidence of the most malignant deceit mounts and spirals inexorably toward the uppermost levels of government, Picquart is compelled to question not only the case against Dreyfus but also his most deeply held beliefs about his country, and about himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing to life the scandal that mesmerized the world at the turn of the twentieth century, Robert Harris tells a tale of uncanny timeliness––a witch hunt, secret tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, the fate of a whistle-blower--richly dramatized with the singular storytelling mastery that has marked all of his internationally best-selling novels.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of The 25th Hour, a captivating novel about war, courage, survival — and a remarkable friendship that ripples across a lifetime.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Nazis’ brutal siege of Leningrad, Lev Beniov is arrested for looting and thrown into the same cell as a handsome deserter named Kolya. Instead of being executed, Lev and Kolya are given a shot at saving their own lives by complying with an outrageous directive: secure a dozen eggs for a powerful Soviet colonel to use in his daughter’s wedding cake. In a city cut off from all supplies and suffering unbelievable deprivation, Lev and Kolya embark on a hunt through the dire lawlessness of Leningrad and behind enemy lines to find the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns insightful and funny, thrilling and terrifying, &lt;i&gt;City of Thieves&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping, cinematic World War II adventure and an intimate coming-of-age story with an utterly contemporary feel for how boys become men.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A strategy born of desperation: an assassination to end the war.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one event can turn the tide. Hitler believes that the death of one man—Franklin Delano Roosevelt—will save Nazi Germany. From a prisoner of war camp near Fort Lewis, Washington, where 50,000 German soldiers are interned, Wehrmacht Captain Kurt Monck—a man of frightening resources with ruthless intelligence whose devious determination is sparked by Berlin’s orders via secret channels to escape the camp and head east. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monck’s trail is picked up by U.S. Secret Service agent John Wren, who hunts Monck as the German nears Franklin Roosevelt’s armored train en route to the Democratic Convention in Chicago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monck’s only aid comes from his reluctant accomplice Margaret Bayerlein, a widow who provokes a haunting triangular relationship. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eighteen years ago, Jake Lassiter crossed paths with a teenage runaway who disappeared into South Florida’s sex trade. Now he retraces her steps and runs head-on into a conspiracy of Miami’s rich and powerful who would do anything to keep the past as dark as night and silent as the grave. In this tale of redemption and revenge, Edgar-nominated author Paul Levine delivers his most powerful thriller yet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jake Lassiter, second-string linebacker turned low-rent lawyer, is cynical about the law, but if you hire him, he’ll take a punch for you . . . and maybe a swing at the prosecutor, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Larkin—beautiful, angry, and mysterious—accuses Lassiter of involvement in the disappearance of her sister eighteen years earlier. What does Lassiter know about Krista Larkin, the runaway teen turned porn actress? More than he’s saying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking to atone for his own past, Lassiter follows the cold trail of the missing Krista and butts head with the powerful men who also knew her: a former porn king turned philanthropist, a slick Cuban-born prosecutor who’d love to be governor, and an aging mobster who once worked for the infamous Meyer Lansky.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evidence leads to a long-ago night of kinky sex, designer drugs—and possible murder. But before Lassiter can nail the truth, a gun goes off, a suspect falls dead, and Amy is charged with murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The state has an eyewitness and a slam-dunk case. Lassiter has a client he doesn’t trust and a case he can’t win. Did Amy shoot the man who killed her sister? Or the wrong man? And what really happened to Krista? The answers, buried under years of deceit and corruption, are revealed in an explosive courtroom finale proving that rough justice is better than no justice at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A network of terror.&lt;br /&gt;A web of deceit.&lt;br /&gt;A deadly game of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legendary spy and art restorer Gabriel Allon is poised to become the chief of Israel’s secret intelligence service. But on the eve of his promotion, events conspire to lure him into the field for one final operation. ISIS has detonated a massive bomb in the Marais district of Paris, and a desperate French government wants Gabriel to eliminate the man responsible before he can strike again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They call him Saladin …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a terrorist mastermind whose ambition is as grandiose as his nom de guerre, a man so elusive that even his nationality is not known. Shielded by sophisticated encryption software, his network communicates in total secrecy, leaving the West blind to his planning—and leaving Gabriel no choice but to insert an agent into the most dangerous terrorist group the world has ever known. Natalie Mizrahi is an extraordinary young doctor as brave as she is beautiful. At Gabriel’s behest, she will pose as an ISIS recruit in waiting, a ticking time bomb, a black widow out for blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her perilous mission will take her from the restive suburbs of Paris to the island of Santorini and the brutal world of the Islamic State’s new caliphate, and eventually to Washington, D.C., where the ruthless Saladin is plotting an apocalyptic night of terror that will alter the course of history. The Black Widow is a riveting thriller of shocking prescience. But it is also a thoughtful journey into the new heart of darkness that will haunt readers long after they have turned the final page.</description>

  <description>On an ordinary morning, Maria Colson takes her baby son Dylan to the corner store. She only turns her back for a few seconds. When she looks again, the stroller is empty, and her terrified child is being shoved into a waiting van that vanishes without a trace. Settle Mirror reporter Jason Wade is under a lot of pressure to bring in a big story, and the Colson kidnapping could be it. It's certainly a bizarre case with pieces that don't add up: The Colsons are a hard-working couple. Former high school sweethearts. No problems. No enemies. The sort of people who shouldn't have any connection any a grisly, unsolved murder. Now, in a dark Seattle underground of street girls, drug runners, and pimps, Jason is searching for the one puzzle piece that connects a baby's disappearance with a vast criminal network. And time is running out, because whoever took little Dylan Colson is more dangerous than anyone could ever imagine.</description>

  <description>On the blood-stained streets of a ruthless American city, the fight for survival takes on a meaning unknown in the cushy suburbs just a few miles away. Working the drug corners and back alleys, Shadeed “Deed” Fleetwood deals rock and blow to the endless stream of customers. All the while, he harbors bigger dreams – dreams of competing for glory on the world stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the underworld figures who rule the streets aren’t interested in Deed’s dreams – they’re interested in cash, cars and women. And they’ll do whatever it takes to keep their stranglehold on the forlorn city – even if it means innocents fall in the crossfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deed also harbors a secret, one that could bring down the baddest of the bad: Kareem Payton, a.k.a. “Pay Day,” the charismatic killer and drug lord whose past intertwines with Deed’s by threads that can’t be unwound, only violently torn. The threads also connect Pay Day’s younger brother Tony “Tone Bone” Payton, Deed’s best friend since they were toddlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the thirst for profit launches a street war for Pay Day’s lucrative turf, the resulting bloodshed brings Deed face to face with a life-changing decision. It also brings him face to face with Sgt. Al Peoples and Detective Eddie “E-Rod” Rodriguez, who are trying to solve a murder mystery that has haunted the city for years. Does Deed remain loyal to Pay Day and the crew? Or does he make a break - and risk all? Besides his own fate, he holds in his hands the fate of his girlfriend Tyesha and their young son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His decision forces him into a whole new life; new, but not without its own perils. And the streets don’t let go easily – revenge can be as deadly a motivator as money. Once again, violence shatters Deed’s world and thrusts him into unfamiliar territory. There, he meets Reggie Nguyen. Reggie recognizes something special in Deed – traits that could propel him beyond his past to lofty heights available only to the truly gifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s a long, hard road and the hurdles Deed faces, though less deadly than the ones back home, are equally daunting. They will require new kinds of strength and bravery, defined much differently than on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the streets have a long memory – they are not inclined to forgive and forget. In a fight to survive, in a place where the blood of the innocent runs together with the blood of the damned, can Deed outrun his pursuers – and his past?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Russians are hacking into British politics – the old fashioned way.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The lead singer of pop band, The G-String Girls, Valda Kramer reckons she’s streetwise enough to handle anything which comes on top. When she learns her bandmate, Renee, is playing both sides – taking turns doing it with a Russian emigre and a government minister – she’s too foxy to be fazed. Until Renee is drowned in her bath. It’s murder and all the evidence points at the fall gal. That’s Valda. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s savvy enough to know who the real culprits are also that they’re above the law. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Jack Lauder, a legend in a lawyer’s suit. A chance meeting with the songstress in Belfast’s mean streets has him expecting a shot at romance! Instead, he finds himself taking aim at Profumo Mark 2. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Valda’s case will propel him from his quiet life up north into London’s political swamp, pitted against the Russian mob, their shady politicians and their bent cops. The capital’s media hacks salivate over the imminent Trial of the Century. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hit men comb the Isles to find Valda and Jack. Will the fugitives find the evidence they need to save her, will they be liquidated before they get to the Bailey, or will Valda put everything on the line at trial?” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Readers who enjoy John Grisham and Sidney Sheldon will find this book right up their street.</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed the novel for the most part. The story is a bit long and would have benefited from a tighter presentation. Also the local lingo is a bit distracting for those unfamiliar with the terms. Fundamentally, it's a murder mystery and thriller but there isn't really much of a mystery regarding...]]>

  <description>When the Philadelphia Phillies signed Dick Allen in 1960, fans of the franchise envisioned bearing witness to feats never before accomplished by a Phillies player. A half-century later, they're still trying to make sense of what they saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrying to the plate baseball's heaviest and loudest bat as well as the burden of being the club's first African American superstar, Allen found both hits and controversy with ease and regularity as he established himself as the premier individualist in a game that prided itself on conformity. As one of his managers observed, "I believe God Almighty hisself would have trouble handling Richie Allen." A brutal pregame fight with teammate Frank Thomas, a dogged determination to be compensated on par with the game's elite, an insistence on living life on his own terms and not management's: what did it all mean? Journalists and fans alike took sides with ferocity, and they take sides still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite talent that earned him Rookie of the Year and MVP honors as well as a reputation as one of his era's most feared power hitters, many remember Allen as one of the game's most destructive and divisive forces, while supporters insist that he is the best player not in the Hall of Fame. &lt;i&gt;God Almighty Hisself: The Life and Legacy of Dick Allen&lt;/i&gt; explains why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchell Nathanson presents Allen's life against the backdrop of organized baseball's continuing desegregation process. Drawing out the larger generational and business shifts in the game, he shows how Allen's career exposed not only the racial double standard that had become entrenched in the wake of the game's integration a generation earlier but also the forces that were bent on preserving the status quo. In the process, &lt;i&gt;God Almighty Hisself&lt;/i&gt; unveils the strange and maddening career of a man who somehow managed to fulfill and frustrate expectations all at once.</description>

  <description>September 1939. As Warsaw falls to Hitler’s Wehrmacht, Captain Alexander de Milja is recruited by the intelligence service of the Polish underground. His mission: to transport the national gold reserve to safety, hidden on a refugee train to Bucharest. Then, in the back alleys and black-market bistros of Paris, in the tenements of Warsaw, with partizan guerrillas in the frozen forests of the Ukraine, and at Calais Harbor during an attack by British bombers, de Milja fights in the war of the shadows in a world without rules, a world of danger, treachery, and betrayal.</description>

  <description>The minor leagues are largely misunderstood, more well known for the players who have skipped through their ranks than the ones who reside in them. They’re a mysterious land of hotels, bus rides, and clubhouses. Upon being drafted out of UC Irvine by the Phillies, right-handed pitcher Eric Pettis didn’t quite know what he was getting himself into. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just A Minor Perspective allows readers to jump into Eric’s mind and experience the journey along with him. The narrative resembles stream-of-consciousness as he describes the good, the bad, and the ugly of the minor leagues as it hits him square in the face for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From his first day in Philadelphia...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I tried to open the door in a manner that would exude confidence in the off chance that my new teammate was an expert on body language and would be analyzing my entry."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the heat of the battle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"As I hopped over the foul line I could feel my body try to rev itself up. It was pleading with me to get something going. It knew how significant this was... As hard as my body tried, it couldn’t muster anything. I tried again and again to turn the key, but my engine just wouldn’t start."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric gives an honest, pointed, and often humorous account of what he feels when he’s feeling it. Just A Minor Perspective is a gripping story of one man’s attempt to find his place in a new world; a scramble to conquer the first rung of the professional baseball ladder.</description>

  <description>In Ben Coes' latest, &lt;i&gt;Eye for an Eye&lt;/i&gt;, Dewey Andreas faces the toughest odds of his life as one of China's most powerful men has decided to do whatever he must to take down Dewey—and inflicts a horrifying loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dewey Andreas uncovers the identity of a mole embedded at a high level in Israel's Mossad, it triggers a larger, more dangerous plot. The mole was the most important asset of Chinese Intelligence, and Fao Bhang, head of China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), responds to the discovery and brutal elimination of the mole, by immediately placing a kill order on the man responsible—Dewey Andreas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dewey is tracked to Argentina, where he is on vacation with his fiancée, Jessica Tanzer, a U.S. National Security Advisor. A top-level kill team is sent in quickly and quietly, but their attack fails to take out Dewey. The collateral damage, however, is both horrifying and deeply personal. With nothing left to lose, Andreas is determined to have his revenge. Once he learns who is probably behind the attack—and why they are after him—Dewey goes rogue, using all of his assets and skills to launch a counterattack. Andreas must now face the full weight and might of the MSS, Chinese Intelligence, and the formidable Fao Bhang, if he's to achieve his one last goal: revenge on a biblical scale, no matter the odds or the armies that he will have to fight his way through. Andreas—former Army Ranger and Delta—is a man of great skills and cunning. His opponent, Fao Bhang, is ruthless, determined, and with no limit to the assets at his disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this conflict, there are only two possible outcomes. And only &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;Dewey Andreas.</description>

This book sets the standard for Cold War suspense novels.&lt;br /&gt;"High entertainment of the first order."&lt;br /&gt;THE BOSTON GLOBE</description>

The authorities label Quinnborne a traitor, but when the nanotechnology spirals out of control, his grit and bloody-minded determination become humankind’s last thin hope of surviving a weapon of mass destruction that can be deployed at will and against which there is no defense.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SHAMUS AWARD WINNER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When finding criminals is your business, it's easy to make a killing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finn Harding (Mr. Finn to his clients) specializes in finding people who don't want to be found. Stripped of his PI license, Finn begins working for the type of clientele who operate in the shadows, pay in cash, and don't care if he's licensed or not. As Finn becomes ensnared in a plot to take over a black market information brokerage, he finds himself and his family straddling the thin line between life and death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his own clients gunning for him, Finn must evade a psychopathic killer, special agents from the FBI's cybercrime unit, and a Detroit mob boss. Finn is about to find out that working with criminals has its advantages. Staying alive isn't one of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Shadow Broker, Trace Conger delivers a sharp-edged and gritty tale of crime, murder, and family. It's a fast-paced crime thriller that holds nothing back.</description>

  <description>Bush pilot and family man Tom Stokes is about to face the worst day of his life. On a clear winter morning he sets out in his Cessna 180 to do some repairs on a remote hunt camp, leaving his five year old son and very pregnant wife snug in their beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the return trip, a squall forces him into an emergency landing and he winds up—quite literally—in the lap of petty criminal Dale Knight. Dale, now a fugitive from the law—and worse, from a merciless drug lord who just happens to be his brother—draws Tom into a web of mayhem and treachery that puts not only his life at risk, but the lives of his wife, son…and unborn child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SQUALL is a fast-paced, darkly-comic tale of murder and gang-style retribution that grabs the reader on page one and simply does not let go.</description>

  <description>It’s 2:30am on a warm July night in New York City. Four months after they first encountered one another, NYPD 3rd Grade Detective Sam Archer and Alice Vargas are working in the NYPD Counter-Terrorism Bureau and also living together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, things between them are strained; both are struggling to deal with the aftermath of a terrifying ordeal in a Harlem tenement block the day they met. Before long, the tension between them boils over and Vargas walks out, going to Spain to visit family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven days later, Archer still hasn’t heard a peep from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to sleep and sitting on the balcony of his apartment, Archer suddenly hears a knock on his front door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s his NYPD partner, Josh, and he has some shocking news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vargas has been abducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archer and Josh are soon at the Bureau, working with two other members of their team to try and find out what happened; a preliminary lead suggests Vargas may have been taken to London. Within twelve hours Archer suddenly finds himself back on his old turf, reunited with old friends and team-mates at the ARU as the Unit and Archer’s NYPD team work together to try and find Vargas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his past and present collide, several unexpected and violent incidents occur and the situation starts to deteriorate at a frightening pace. Using all his skills but with his back against the ropes as their every move seems to be anticipated, Archer starts to unravel the mystery surrounding Vargas’ disappearance and begins to realise just why she was taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as events unfold and the confrontations with the enemy intensify, one thing remains constant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every second Vargas is missing is another second closer to never seeing her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if Archer stands any chance of ever finding her, he’s going to have to return fire with fire.</description>

  <description>New York, January 1951. When columnist Dennis Collins returns to his hometown after covering the brutal Chosin Reservoir battle in Korea, he finds his newspaper closed down and New York on edge about a possible European war with the Russians. Collins is reluctantly drawn into an investigation of leaked American military secrets that focuses on the British diplomats Donald Maclean and Kim Philby (later exposed as members of the infamous Cambridge Five spy ring).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his search for the truth takes him to Washington, Paris, and London, Collins enters a shadowy world of intrigue where moral boundaries blur and the line between justice and revenge is easily crossed. The North Building tells a story of love and personal redemption, seamlessly blending fact and fiction as it takes the reader from the foxholes of Korea to the corridors of power in the West, with the fate of nations, and individuals, hanging in the balance.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a well written and credible scenario that is born of some under-reported press accounts. It is timely and chillingly realistic. With a lead character Adam Drake, as likeable as a Brad Thor or Vince Flynn protagonist, the plot is complex, nefarious, and thought provoking. The action is app...]]>

  <description>Trust no one. Sam Callahan learned this lesson from a childhood spent in abusive foster care, on the streets, and locked in juvie. With the past behind him and his future staked on law school, he is moonlighting as a political tracker, paid to hide in crowds and shadow candidates, recording their missteps for use by their opponents. One night, after an anonymous text tip, Sam witnesses a congressional candidate and a mysterious blonde in a motel indiscretion that ends in murder, recording it all on his phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Sam is a target. Set up to take the fall and pursued by both assassins and the FBI, he is forced to go on the run. Using the street skills forged during his troubled youth—as well as his heightened mental abilities—Sam goes underground until he can uncover who is behind the conspiracy and how far up it goes. A taut thriller with an unforgettable young hero, The Tracker is a heart-stopping debut from an exciting new voice.</description>

  <description>Did the Cold War end or did the KGB find a way to retain its power and dominate the new Russian Federation? "Harry's Rules" is an espionage thriller set against the backdrop of post-Soviet Russia in the early 1990's. Written by a veteran of CIA's Clandestine Services, the novel exposes the chilling and authentic sources of the power and the abiding malice of the people who rule Russia today. When a CIA officer is murdered shortly after meeting a long inactive Russian agent in Vienna, Harry Connolly is sent on a secret mission to investigate. He is drawn inexorably into a vortex of violence and international intrigue when his mission runs afoul of a powerful Russian revanchist organization controlled by former KGB officers.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A #1 Techno Thriller on Kindle&lt;br /&gt;For another FREE thriller, come by my website — &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.HelenHanson.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.HelenHanson.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrorists? Or someone more sinister . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On hiatus from the corporate treadmill, Clint finds love to last a lifetime in Beth. While she recovers from kidney failure through dialysis, Beth is kidnapped from her home. But Clint’s the only one who suspects foul play in her disappearance. In spite of the evidence, her family refuses to admit she’s in danger. And without routine dialysis, Beth won’t survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five hundred miles south, the case attracts the attention of spy trackers at the CIA. Can Clint find Beth before her kidneys fail or her abductors unload a bullet in his head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An espionage and suspense thriller with a techno bent, 3 LIES is set along the Massachusetts coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 LIES story continues with Book 2 of The Masters CIA Thriller Series — THE MASTERS’ KEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interview with the Author:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: What does Helen Hanson bring to the thriller genre?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HH: Heart-skipping pace, life-critical stakes, and broody, looming danger wrapped in a twenty-first century skin. We live in a time when technology surrounds us. The kid down the street has instant access to information unfathomable a century ago. Consequently crime had gone digital, online, and victims rarely see what hit them.&lt;br /&gt;Because of my background, I present the technology employed by my characters in a fluent way to readers. They say I write about techno topics in a way that makes them enjoyable. I don’t burden the prose with jargon. Most readers want to know what kind of gun is fired, not how to field strip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Tell us about your characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HH: My characters are unique beings, each requiring a different spark to light the fire. I explore their sparks. &lt;br /&gt;I create believable characters with realistic dialogue engaged in page-flipping action. I like to watch ordinary people find the extraordinary in themselves when facing adversity. No one is surprised when Jason Bourne takes out a detachment of Marines, but we can’t say that about waitress Maggie Fender.&lt;br /&gt;My protagonists don’t possess the Special Forces skills of a super spy. They stumble into dangerous situations and use technology to advance their position even if it isn’t strictly legal. The stakes have to be worthy of a fight.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they’re witty people who possess veins of humor. As in life, it punctuates disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Where do your thrillers take place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HH: The action in my thrillers takes place in a variety of locations around the globe. So far, we’ve landed in: Russia, Boston, San Francisco, Pakistan, Washington D.C., Santa Cruz, Venezuela, Half Moon Bay, and Mongolia. Since the characters across my novels exist in the same story world, they often appear in other works, though the current titles are not a single series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Do you write your thrillers in series?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HH: At the request of my readers, I am. The sequel to 3 LIES is now out and called THE MASTERS’ KEY, with a third volume on deck.</description>

  <description>From the Tom Clancy for a new generation, a debut thriller following two CIA outcasts who must race to stop a secret Chinese weapon that threatens to provoke a world war After her first assignment in Venezuela goes disastrously awry, rookie case officer Kyra Stryker is brought back to Langley to work in the Red Cell, the CIA’s out-of-the-box think tank. There she’s paired with Jonathan Burke, a straitlaced analyst who has alienated his colleagues with his unorthodox methods and a knack for always being right, political consequences be damned. &lt;p&gt;When a raid on Chinese spies in Taiwan ends in a shoot-out and the release of a deadly chemical, CIA director Kathy Cooke turns to the Red Cell to figure out why China is ready to invade the island nation without any fear of reprisal from the US Navy. Stryker and Burke’s only lead is the top CIA asset in China, code named Pioneer. But when Pioneer reports that Chinese security has him under surveillance, Stryker is offered a chance for redemption with a highly dangerous mission: extract Pioneer from China before he’s arrested and executed. The answers he holds could mean the difference between peace in the Pacific or another world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From CIA headquarters to the White House to a Navy carrier in the South China Sea and the dark alleyways of Beijing, Red Cell takes readers on a whirlwind race against time as Stryker and Burke work to save Pioneer and discover the hidden threat to America’s power: China’s top-secret weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIA analyst Mark Henshaw infuses expert knowledge of the intelligence world into a pulse-pounding plot to create a fascinating, authentic, and unforgettable read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made &lt;i&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/i&gt; a classic, &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt; changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt; we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</description>

  <description>When &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; foreign correspondent J. B. Collins hears rumors that an al-Qaeda splinter cell--ISIS--has captured a cache of chemical weapons inside Syria, he knows this is a story he must pursue at all costs. Does the commander of the jihadist faction really have weapons of mass destruction? If so, who is the intended target? The U.S.? Israel? Or someone else? With tensions already high, the impending visit of the American president to the region could prove to be the spark that sets off an explosion of horrendous proportions. Knowing that terrorist forces are already trying to bring down two Arab governments in the region--Iraq and Syria--can Collins uncover the truth before it's too late? Or will the terrorists succeed in setting their sights on the third target and achieving genocide?</description>

  <description>Kirkus Reviews says: A full-throttle adventure through modern Europe and the Mediterranean in a book that’s part thriller, part mystery, and all rollicking ride... An exhilarating journey that will satisfy the most avid thriller reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearce again accomplishes every thriller writer’s aim: creating characters that the readers can root for and a believable, fast-paced storyline. The climax and denouement bring the storylines together neatly, but fans will see that there may yet be room for another book in the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Kirkus Reviews</description>

  <description>Captain Jay Marsh had never questioned where his ultimate loyalty lay. He had witnessed the bloody horror left behind by the retreating Japanese army during World War II's final days. And he had abandoned his beautiful Filipina fiancee to see his duty through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not even Marsh could guess the terrible personal price he would have to pay for his loyalty. He would follow General Douglas MacArthur to Tokyo itself. There he would become the brilliant, egocentric general's confidant, translator, surrogate son--and spy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marsh would play a dangerous game of deliberate deceit and brutal injustice in the shadow world of postwar Japan's royal palaces and geisha houses, and recognize that the defeated emperor and his wily aides were exploiting MacArthur's ruthless ambition to become the American Caesar. &lt;b&gt;The Emperor's General&lt;/b&gt; is a dramatic human story of the loss of innocence and the seduction of power, about the conflict between honor, duty, and love, all set against an extraordinary historical backdrop.</description>

  <description>Carlton Fisk retired having played in more games and hit more home runs than any other catcher before him. A baseball superstar in the 1970s and 80s, Fisk was known not just for his dedication to the sport and tremendous plays but for the respect with which he treated the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A homegrown icon, Fisk rapidly became the face of one of the most storied teams in baseball, the Boston Red Sox of the 1970s. As a rookie making only $12,000 a year, he became the first player to unanimously win the American League Rookie of the Year award in 1972, upping both his pay grade and national recognition. Fisk's game-winning home run in Game Six of the hotly-contested 1975 World Series forever immortalized him in one of the sport's most exciting televised moments. Fisk played through an epic period of player-owner relations, including the dawn of free agency, strikes, and collusions. After leaving Boston under controversy in 1981, he joined the Chicago White Sox, where he played for 12 more major league seasons, solidifying his position as one of the best catchers of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug Wilson, finalist for both the Casey Award and Seymour Medal for his previous baseball biographies, uses his own extensive research and interviews with childhood friends and major league teammates to examine the life and career of a leader who followed a strict code and played with fierce determination.</description>

  <description>On a cold December morning in New York City, a man is found dead in Central Park. There are no knife or gunshot wounds to his body and no signs of violence. But beside the body is a box containing a cracked vial. Suspecting he died from some sort of biological attack, a lab team screen the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they find is deeply unsettling and terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven months after he left the ARU, Sam Archer is now a 3rd Grade Detective in the NYPD's Counter Terrorism Bureau. However, not everything has gone as expected. Most of his new squad have welcomed him. Others haven't. But when he and the rest of his team are called in urgently and told of the situation all personal differences need to be put aside. It's been confirmed the man in Central Park was killed by an unknown strain of a toxic pneumonic virus. Once inhaled, there is no chance of survival. The victim dies quickly, violently and in agonising pain. There is no antidote. No one knows where it has come from, who planted it in the Park and why. No ransom demands or threats have been received. Archer and his team are ordered to find out who was responsible, and to locate and secure any other strains of the virus that may exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are already almost out of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is intending to release more of the virus into the city within the next ninety minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they desperately search for answers, Archer and the rest of his team quickly discover that the cracked vial in the Park was just the start. They are also not alone in wanting to get their hands on the virus. There are others, people with far more sinister motives who are desperate to acquire the virus and who will kill anyone who gets in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As people around him start going down, Archer must battle to stay one step ahead in the race to find the toxic weapon before it is used again. When he and his team finally realise the full horrifying extent of what they’re dealing with and the potentially devastating effects of its release, Archer must do everything he possibly can to stay alive and secure the lethal virus before many more people die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, he is already too late.</description>

  <description>On December 7, 1941, as the battleships of Pearl Harbor smoldered, one of the most powerful athletes in America, Detroit Tigers MVP Hank Greenberg, made a tumultuous decision-to leave the baseball field for the field of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His decision left baseball's place during the war uncertain as more and more ballplayers, famous and unknown alike, put off their careers to go into the fight. President Roosevelt was faced with a difficult decision: stop all of professional baseball for the good of the victory, but, in doing so, risk losing a vital part of morale. He decided that, whatever it took, THE GAME MUST GO ON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of American baseball history during World War II-of both the players who left to join the war and of the ones who struggled to keep the game alive on the home front. Taking the place of the big shots turned soldiers, sailors, and combat pilots were misfit replacement players. While Greenberg represented the player who served, Pete Gray symbolized the player who stayed. He was a one-armed outfielder who overcame insurmountable odds to become a professional athlete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Klima drops us straight into 1941-1945. Culminating in the 1945 pennant race where Greenberg and Gray's paths memorably crossed, Klima shows us how World War II made the country come of age and took baseball with it. This is the story of how the games we play changed because of the battles we fought.</description>

  <description> THE PAGES WON'T STOP TURNING  
  &lt;i&gt;Get two of Ernest Dempsey's introductory action adventure thrillers plus a guide to the top 16 hidden mysteries on the planet FREE for a limited time. Look Inside for details.&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the final days of World War II, a mysterious German U-boat was seen by a United States naval vessel in the Atlantic Ocean, just north of South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the ship could fire upon the sub, it vanished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History tells us that, after the war, the German high command scattered across world hoping to evade punishment for their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it doesn't tell us is what they took with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priceless paintings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare sculptures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vast treasures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these things have been discovered but there is one that remains hidden. It was one of the most well-hidden, secretive experiments the Nazis carried out during the war and now someone is trying to unearth it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they succeed, it could bring civilization to its knees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ˃˃˃ Not if Sean Wyatt can help it. &lt;p&gt;Sean Wyatt quit working for the United States government years ago but after recent events, he's come to realize his particular set of skills might still be needed to keep the world a little safer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an evil mastermind behind a twisted plot, Sean is on the clock with less than 72 hours to find a Nazi device known as die glocke before a for-profit terrorist cell known as The Black Ring executes an innocent woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, if they get what they want, the terrorists will wreak havoc across the planet. &lt;/p&gt; ˃˃˃ If Indiana Jones and Jason Bourne had a kid together, his name would be Sean Wyatt &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game of Shadows is packed with suspense and romance, filled with conspiracies and intrigue, and leaves you wanting more in Dempsey's breakthrough international mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel with Sean Wyatt as he pieces together a sequence of ancient riddles in this suspense packed thriller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love fast, up-tempo stories that don't get bogged down in a lot of bull, this series of thrillers is for you. With crime, murder, suspense, mystery, and white hot action, you're sure to keep turning the pages until you realize the story just ended. But beware, this book is not for the faint of heart. In the world of high stakes adventure, things can get pretty violent. You've been warned.&lt;/p&gt; ˃˃˃ Interview with the author &lt;p&gt;Q: What made you want to write an international mystery series like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: I grew up watching movies like Indiana Jones and The Goonies. Those movies were so fascinating to me. As a kid, I always wanted to be an adventurer that discovered ancient treasures, not for the financial wealth, but because I always thought, and still think, it must be so amazing to find something that someone left hidden hundreds or thousands of years before. At that moment, you are the first person to see that artifact in a long time. I also love suspense action fiction stories, terrorism novels and television shows, and especially enjoy a good thriller about conspiracies and secret societies. Jack Reacher, Jason Bourne, Jack Ryan, are all pulp heroes I can root for. It seemed logical to make Sean Wyatt like one of those guys, but one that also has a background in history, making him the Indiana Jones of action adventure thrillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: There are several books in the Sean Wyatt series. In what order should they be read?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A: The first three are a trilogy, but you can read them out of order if you really want to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I had some misgivings about giving this a 4 star review. First, the author seemed intent upon covering and weaving in every important event in Germany and Poland from 1932 through 1944.

  <description>From the #1 New York Times bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the Lusitania&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 1, 1915, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months, its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic "Greyhounds" and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster that helped place America on the road to war.</description>

  <description>It's the middle of the night. You’re awakened by a noise. Someone is in your house. What do you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it happens at 148 Maple Drive, homeowner Jeff Shaw gets his gun and goes downstairs to investigate while his wife calls 9-1-1. It’s their home, after all. Jeff has to protect it. He finds two men in the kitchen and shoots them both. Dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incident puts great strain on Jeff and his family. He wants to believe they just need to get on with their lives and everything will return to normal. But it’s not that easy. The dead intruders belonged to a gang, ANG, “Ain’t No Game,” that now wants revenge. And one of the gang, an ex-con who goes by the name I-Man, knows more about the break-in than he’s letting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with a threatening phone call. Then it gets worse. The police, unable to protect the Shaws, suggest they move away for a while. But Jeff isn't going to be intimidated from his house. &lt;i&gt;Homeowner With a Gun&lt;/i&gt; takes the reader on a suspense-filled thrill ride as this everyman fights to save himself and his family, while something a detective said plays in the back of his mind: &lt;i&gt;Maybe the intruders broke into the wrong house. Happens all the time. You wouldn’t believe how often...&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>News-making, inside revelations about the tumultuous years when the Los Angeles Dodgers were remade from top to bottom—from the ownership of the team to management to the players on the field—becoming the most talked-about and most colorful team in baseball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012 the Los Angeles Dodgers were bought out of bankruptcy in the most expensive sale in sports history. Los Angeles icon Magic Johnson and his partners hoped to put together a team worthy of Hollywood: consistently entertaining. By most accounts they have succeeded, if not always in the way they might have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Molly Knight tells the story of the Dodgers’ 2013 season with detailed, previously unreported revelations. She shares a behind-the-scenes account of the astonishing sale of the Dodgers, and why the team was not overpriced, as well as what the Dodgers actually knew in advance about rookie phenom and Cuban defector Yasiel Puig and how they and teammates handled him during his roller-coaster season. We learn how infighting on the team nearly derailed the 2013 season and nearly cost manager Don Mattingly his job—and how the team turned around the season in the most remarkable fifty-game stretch (42-8) of any team since World War II, before losing in the NLCS. Knight also reveals the facts behind the blockbuster trade with the Red Sox—and why that trade may yet turn out to be of greater benefit to the Dodgers. And, there’s an intimate portrait of star pitcher Clayton Kershaw, probably the best pitcher in the game today, including details about the contract offer he turned down before accepting the richest contract any pitcher ever signed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exciting, surprising, and filled with juicy details, Molly Knight’s account is a must-read for baseball fans and anyone who wants the inside story of today’s Los Angeles Dodgers.</description>

  <description>Carl Logan was the perfect agent. A loner, with no real friends or family, he was trained to deal with any situation with cold efficiency, devoid of emotion. But Logan isn't the man he used to be, or the asset he once was. Five months ago his life changed forever when he was captured, tortured and left for dead by Youssef Selim, one of the world's most violent terrorists. When Selim mysteriously reappears in Paris, linked to the kidnapping of America's Attorney General, Logan smells his chance for revenge. Pursuing his man relentlessly, oblivious to the growing trail of destruction that he leaves in his wake, Logan delves increasingly deep into the web of lies and deceit surrounding the kidnapping. Finally, he comes to learn just what it means to Dance with the Enemy.</description>

  <description>When No One Is Watching follows Blair Van Howe, a promising young political star who frames his best friend in a deadly accident that could otherwise compromise his success. When a dogged detective nears the truth, Blair must ask himself how far he is willing to go to protect his dark secret, and whether the good he can accomplish politically justifies the sins he commits when no one is watching.</description>

  <description>When someone starts assassinating paparazzi in three countries, MI7 sits up. Apparently, the killer is a retired SVR field-operative and former Kremlin protege named Dmitri Vassyli Kramski. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, the Cold War is long finished, but everyone knows Vladimir Putin is as unhappy for Russia to play second fiddle on the international stage as even the most strident of his Communist predecessors. Could this be the key to the riddle? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kramski's trail leads deep into London's immigrant community, forcing his pursuers into conflict with an unknown organisation bent on protecting him. Little by little, he begins to look less like a professional assassin and more like someone plotting to scupper the foundations of Western democracy itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compound matters, the Russians are as baffled by him as anyone.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; bestselling, highly-acclaimed account is a hilarious but scathing baseball tell-all. After being voted the 1977 American League Cy Young Award winner, Sparky Lyle was rewarded for his efforts by being benched. The Yankees, a leader of free agency, signed Goose Gossage as their closer. Things only went downhill from there and the 1978 season turned out to be one of controversy, firings, fights and acrimony. In short, it was a zoo.</description>

      <![CDATA[The book is essentially a diary of the 1978 dream season of the Yankees and the disappointing role Sparky Lyle played on that team after Goose Gossage arrived. I enjoyed the book largely because of the the circus atmosphere generated by that team's "chemistry" and their inimitable owner. The diar...]]>

  <description>Finally - a fascinating &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; authoritative biography of perhaps the most controversial player in baseball history, Ty Cobb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ty Cobb is baseball royalty, maybe even the greatest player who ever lived. His lifetime batting average is still the highest of all time, and when he retired in 1928, after twenty-one years with the Detroit Tigers and two with the Philadelphia Athletics, he held more than ninety records. But the numbers don't tell half of Cobb's tale. The Georgia Peach was by far the most thrilling player of the era: "Ty Cobb could cause more excitement with a base on balls than Babe Ruth could with a grand slam," one columnist wrote. When the Hall of Fame began in 1936, he was the first player voted in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Cobb was also one of the game's most controversial characters. He got in a lot of fights, on and off the field, and was often accused of being overly aggressive. In his day, even his supporters acknowledged that he was a fierce and fiery competitor. Because his philosophy was to "create a mental hazard for the other man,"; he had his enemies, but he was also widely admired. After his death in 1961, however, something strange happened: his reputation morphed into that of a monster - a virulent racist who also hated children and women, and was in turn hated by his peers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did this happen? Who is the real Ty Cobb? Setting the record straight, Charles Leerhsen pushed aside the myths, traveled to Georgia and Detroit, and re-traced Cobb's journey, from the shy son of a professor and state senator who was progressive on race for his time, to America's first true sports celebrity. In the process, he tells of a life overflowing with incident and a man who cut his own path through his times - a man we thought we knew but really didn't.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have some issues with the book but it still gets 5 stars. In my opinion Mr. Leerhsen tends to minimize and euphemistically characterize the actions and behavior of Cobb. For example, most of Cobb's fistfights with ball players,or fans, or strangers are chalked up to the natural rowdiness of the...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The incredible inside story of power, money, and baseball's last twenty years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the fall of 1992, America's National Pastime is in crisis and already on the path to the unthinkable: cancelling a World Series for the first time in history. The owners are at war with each other, their decades-long battle with the players has turned America against both sides, and the players' growing addiction to steroids will threaten the game's very foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tipping point for baseball, a crucial moment in the game's history that catalyzes a struggle for power by three strong-willed men: Commissioner Bud Selig, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, and union leader Don Fehr. It's their uneasy alliance at the end of decades of struggle that pulls the game back from the brink and turns it into a money-making powerhouse that enriches them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real story of baseball, played out against a tableau of stunning athletic feats, high-stakes public battles, and backroom political deals--with a supporting cast that includes Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, Joe Torre and Derek Jeter, George Bush and George Mitchell, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from hundreds of extensive, exclusive interviews throughout baseball, &lt;i&gt;The Game &lt;/i&gt;is a stunning achievement: a rigorously reported book and the must-read, fly-on-the-wall, definitive account of how an enormous struggle for power turns disaster into baseball's Golden Age.</description>
