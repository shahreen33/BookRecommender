  <description>Police investigators Pete Culnane and Martin Tierney are as different as parchment and newsprint, and Martin's insecurities are fed by Pete's expertise and finesse. A homeless man wearing an eye-popping diamond ring is as inexplicable to both of them as the disappearance of the two boys who reported his body on St. Paul's Upper Landing. Blinded by the Sight demonstrates how good intentions can go awry, resulting in unintended, life-altering predicaments.</description>

  <description>In stark, haunting prose, first-time author Peter Razor recalls his early years as a ward of the State of Minnesota. Told in flashbacks and relying on research from his own case files, Razor manages to piece together the shattered fragments of his boyhood into a memoir that reads as compellingly as a novel. Abandoned as an infant at the State Public School in Owatonna, Razor spent his childhood at the hands of abusive workers who thought of him as nothing more than 'a dirty Injun'. He endures years of beatings 'with a broom or radiator brush -- whatever was handy' until, one night while he is asleep, one of the matrons attacks him with a hammer. Fearing for his life, he makes two failed attempts to run away from the orphanage. Quickly labelled a trouble-maker, he is later indentured as a hired hand to a farm family. The farmer beats him, clothes him in rags, and treats him like a slave, often working him to exhaustion without food or water. Remarkably, Razor struggles to attend high school and begins to dream of another life, but first he must endure the darkest and most vicious attack yet...</description>

  <description>An exciting new series character ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gia Santella is a fast-driving, hard-drinking, karate-trained free spirit, who is gorgeous, sexy, and a young heiress. She also has a fierce temper and zero tolerance for people in power preying on the vulnerable ... especially when the injustice takes place in her neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late one Autumn night, violence breaks out in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood, as a hate group and counter-protesters come face to face. Gia Santella rushes to the protest to help find her friend's granddaughter. Sasha Kennedy is a student journalist at U.C. Berkeley covering the protest for the school paper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Sasha mysteriously disappears at the protest, Gia learns that the young woman was on the brink of uncovering a story that would blow the whole city wide open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her efforts to find the girl, Gia finds herself investigating more mysterious disappearances and begins to unravel a string of dark secrets that lie below the surface of her beloved neighborhood, threatening to destroy it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then her plan goes terribly wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gia receives a terrifying message, she is caught in a race against time to find the young journalist before it's too late... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she fails, more innocent people will die ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it will all be her fault. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A page-turning dark and gritty thriller packed with edge-of-your-seat suspense. Gia and the Forgotten Island is perfect for fans of Lisa Gardner, Patricia Cornwell, and Gregg Hurwitz &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Tami Hoag returns with a thriller that begins with a shocking crime scene you’ll never forget and follows two relentless detectives on a manhunt that ends in a chilling confrontation with the essence of human evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a crime so brutal, it changed the lives of even the most hardened homicide cops. The Haas family murders left a scar on the community nothing can erase, but everyone agrees that convicting the killer, Karl Dahl, is a start. Only Judge Carey Moore seems to be standing in the way. Her ruling that Dahl’s prior criminal record is inadmissible raises a public outcry—and puts the judge in grave danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an unknown assailant attacks Judge Moore in a parking garage, two of Minneapolis’s top cops are called upon to solve the crime and keep the judge from further harm. Detective Sam Kovac is as hard-boiled as they come, and his wisecracking partner, Nikki Liska, isn’t far behind. Neither one wants to be on this case, but when Karl Dahl escapes from custody, everything changes, and a seemingly straightforward case cartwheels out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stakes go even higher when the judge is kidnapped—snatched out of her own bed even as the police sit outside, watching her house. Now Kovac and Liska must navigate through a maze of suspects that includes the stepson of a murder victim, a husband with a secret life, and a rogue cop looking for revenge where the justice system failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no time to spare, the detectives are pulled down a strange dark trail of smoke and mirrors, where no one is who they seem and everyone is guilty of &lt;b&gt;Prior Bad Acts&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In C.J. Box's &lt;i&gt;Badlands&lt;/i&gt;, the town of Grimstad used to be a place people came from but were never headed to. Now it’s the oil capital of North Dakota. With oil comes money, with money comes drugs, and with drugs come the dirtiest criminals Grimstad’s new deputy sheriff Cassie Dewell has ever encountered. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Kyle Westergaard dreams of getting out of Grimstad and leading a better life. Even though Kyle has been written off as a “slow” kid, he has dreams deeper than anyone can imagine. One day, while delivering newspapers, he witnesses a car accident and takes a mysterious bundle from the scene. Suddenly he’s in possession of a lot of money—and packets of white powder—and Kyle can’t help but wonder whether his luck has changed…for better or for worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Suspenseful—you can’t put it down.’’—&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the temperature drops to 30 below and a gang war heats up, it’s up to Cassie to help restore law and order. But is she in over her head? As she is propelled on a collision course with a murderous enemy, she finds that the key to it all might come in the most unlikely form: a boy on a bike named Kyle. He keeps showing up where he doesn’t belong. And he seems to know something that Cassie does not about what lies beneath the surface of this small and troubled town…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The unrelenting cold makes this the perfect beach read.”—&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A richly imagined novel that tells the story behind &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, the book that inspired the iconic film, through the eyes of author L. Frank Baum's intrepid wife, Maud--from the family's hardscrabble days in South Dakota to the Hollywood film set where she first meets Judy Garland.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maud Gage Baum, widow of the author of the book &lt;i&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt;, met Judy Garland, the young actress playing the role of Dorothy on the set of &lt;i&gt;The Wizard of Oz &lt;/i&gt;in 1939. At the time, Maud was seventy-eight and Judy was sixteen. In spite of their age difference, Maud immediately connected to Judy--especially when Maud heard her sing "Over the Rainbow," a song whose yearning brought to mind the tough years in South Dakota when Maud and her husband struggled to make a living--until Frank Baum's book became a national sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderfully evocative two-stranded story recreates Maud's youth as the rebellious daughter of a leading suffragette, and the prairie years of Maud and Frank's early days when they lived among the people--especially young Dorothy--who would inspire Frank's masterpiece. Woven into this past story is one set in 1939, describing the high-pressured days on &lt;i&gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt;/i&gt; film set where Judy is being badgered by the director, producer, and her ambitious stage mother to lose weight, bind her breasts, and laugh, cry, and act terrified on command. As Maud had promised to protect the original Dorothy back in Aberdeen, she now takes on the job of protecting young Judy.</description>

      <![CDATA[I read this for my book club and wasn't overly impressed. The writer's style didn't quite work for me as she adopted a narrative style that seemed intended to capture the more prudish, proper era of the late 19th century. Prose seemed stilted. But . . . MC, Maud Baum, was of that era and perhaps...]]>

  <description>Who was James Putnam? Answering that question may mean salvation for Alexander Rupert, a Minnesota detective whose life is in a serious downward spiral. A Medal of Valor winner, Alexander is now under subpoena by a grand jury on suspicion of corruption. He’s been reassigned to the Frauds Unit, where he is shunned by his fellow detectives, and he fears his status-seeking wife may be having an affair. When he happens across a complex case of identity theft, Alexander sees an opportunity to rehabilitate his tattered reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the case explodes into far more than he could have expected, putting him in the path of trained assassin Drago Basta, a veteran of the Balkan wars who has been searching for “James Putnam” for years. As his life spins out of control, Alexander’s last hope may be his older brother, Max, a fellow police detective who steps in to try to save his brother from the carnage his investigation has let loose.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the New Blood Dagger, Arthur Ellis, Barry, Anthony, and Dilys awards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Surêté du Québec and his team of investigators are called in to the scene of a suspicious death in a rural village south of Montreal. Jane Neal, a local fixture in the tiny hamlet of Three Pines, just north of the U.S. border, has been found dead in the woods. The locals are certain it’s a tragic hunting accident and nothing more, but Gamache smells something foul in these remote woods, and is soon certain that Jane Neal died at the hands of someone much more sinister than a careless bowhunter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still Life&lt;/i&gt; introduces not only an engaging series hero in Inspector Gamache, who commands his forces---and this series---with integrity and quiet courage, but also a winning and talented new writer of traditional mysteries in the person of Louise Penny.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;BENEATH THE FLAMES &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is an intimate combination of love, race, and life as an urban firefighter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fire in a neighboring farmhouse has young farmer and volunteer firefighter, Mitch Garner, blaming himself for the tragic outcome. He loses all hope of forgiving himself. His only hope for redemption is to leave Jennie, the girl he's loved since high school, and journey from Wisconsin's lush farmland to the decaying inner city of Milwaukee to prove himself as a professional firefighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch is assigned to the busiest firehouse in the heart of one of the most blighted areas of Milwaukee, the Core, where he's viciously hazed by senior firefighters. He struggles to hold it together at horrific scenes of violence and can't do anything right at fires. Within weeks, he's ready to give up and quit. His salvation comes in the form of a brash adolescent girl, Jasmine Richardson. Mitch is assigned to tutor her little sister through a department mentoring program. Despite Jasmine's contempt toward Mitch, her courage and devotion to her little sister inspire Mitch to stay and dedicate himself to helping her and the neighboring children overcome the hopelessness of growing up in crushing poverty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble on the farm has Mitch torn between returning home to Jennie and staying in Milwaukee where he'll be forced to risk his life to protect Jasmine from the leader of the One-Niner street gang.</description>

  <description>Lo Blacklock, a journalist who writes for a travel magazine, has just been given the assignment of a lifetime: a week on a luxury cruise with only a handful of cabins. The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What would happen if you were visited by your younger self, and got a chance for a do-over? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Alice Love is twenty-nine years old, madly in love with her husband, and pregnant with their first child. So imagine her surprise when, after a fall, she comes to on the floor of a gym (a gym! she HATES the gym!) and discovers that she's actually thirty-nine, has three children, and is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A knock on the head has misplaced ten years of her life, and Alice isn't sure she likes who she's become. It turns out, though, that forgetting might be the most memorable thing that has ever happened to Alice.</description>

  <description>The fascinating story of brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss's big bet on crypto-currency and its dazzling pay-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning to start careers as venture capitalists, the brothers quickly discover that no one will take their money after their fight with Zuckerberg. While nursing their wounds in Ibiza, they accidentally run into an eccentric character who tells them about a brand-new idea: cryptocurrency. Immersing themselves in what is then an obscure and sometimes sinister world, they begin to realize “crypto” is, in their own words, "either the next big thing or total bulls--t." There’s nothing left to do but make a bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Silk Road to the halls of the Securities and Exchange Commission, &lt;i&gt;Bitcoin Billionaires&lt;/i&gt; will take us on a wild and surprising ride while illuminating a tantalizing economic future. On November 26, 2017, the Winklevoss brothers became the first bitcoin billionaires. Here’s the story of how they got there—as only Ben Mezrich could tell it.</description>

  <description>In 2068 St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Douglas (Doug) Michaels finds his lifelong friend, Josh Unger, dead in his home. When law enforcement concludes his death was a suicide, Doug and his wife, Ali, are dumbstruck; they wonder what could explain such a needlessly violent and lonely death in a future where such actions are unimaginable. Trying to unearth a killer, be it either flesh and blood or the cumulative stress of life, Doug creates a mental landscape of Josh’s past, a retroscape, starting in the mid-2030s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among its landmarks are:&lt;br /&gt; - An illness, sensationalized in the media as the “zombie pandemic” that drives a wedge between husband and wife, parents and children.&lt;br /&gt; - Cryptic communications between Josh and an “after-life specialist” who peddles immortality services.&lt;br /&gt; - A mysterious phrase uttered at the assassination of a government official that ties it to Josh’s death 14 years later.&lt;br /&gt; - Josh’s machine-intelligence wife, Julia, who may hold the secret to his death…if she can only remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, determining guilt in a retroscape littered with suspects tells Doug more about humanity, technology, and himself than he ever could have imagined.</description>

  <description>As an aircraft mechanic, Sierra Bauer is a woman in a man's world. There are few things more satisfying to her than the challenge of working on multimillion-dollar turboprops at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, especially now that her life has returned to normal after losing her brother in a plane crash, and almost losing her career in the FAA investigation that followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal is pitched into a tailspin when she finds a frozen body in a plane she is inspecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Quinn Moore is certain Sierra's discovery is happenstance until he learns the victim, Tori Hjelle, is the woman Sierra blames for her brother's death. Despite his attraction to her, he must consider Sierra a prime suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efforts to prove her own innocence are jeopardized when Rune, her ex-boyfriend, returns after a five-year stint in state prison for stalking and attempting to kill Sierra. Things get complicated when Quinn finds evidence linking Rune and Sierra to Tori's murder, not to mention the counterfeit aircraft part discovered in her possession. He starts to doubt his belief that Sierra is innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sierra figures out Tori discovered the key to unraveling a tangled web of conspiracy that threatens the aviation world, she's forced to change everything she thought she knew about her brother's death. That knowledge comes with a price. She and Quinn must expose a network of money, deceit, and murder before Sierra becomes the next casualty.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In first-century Rome, following Jesus comes at a tremendous social cost.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An urbane Roman landowner and merchant is intrigued by the Christian faith—but is he willing to give up his status and lifestyle to join the church? Meanwhile his young client, a catechumen in the church at Rome, is beginning to see just how much his newfound faith will require of him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Week in the Life of Rome&lt;/i&gt; is a cross section of ancient Roman society, from the overcrowded apartment buildings of the poor to the halls of the emperors. Against this rich backdrop, illuminated with images and explanatory sidebars, we are invited into the daily struggles of the church at Rome just a few years before Paul wrote his famous epistle to them. A gripping tale of ambition, intrigue, and sacrifice, James Papandrea's novel is a compelling work of historical fiction that shows us the first-century Roman church as we've never seen it before.</description>

  <description>A tree in rural Iowa bears witness to generations of human experience—and deadly secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dani Holden thinks moving to an old farmstead will help her forget her past. She agrees to help neighbors take down a strange double-headed tree that has stood alone between two fields for almost a century. Unexplainable accidents begin haunting those who help, and Dani must uncover a community's secret before tragedy claims her as its next victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dani's not the only one running from her past—two generations ago, young Lilly Bradstreet is not the person her small town wants her to be. She falls in love with a Mexican migrant worker and is forced to choose between her family's wishes, her passionate romance, and the life of freedom she's always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lilly's long-forgotten quest for independence and Dani's search for answers intertwine at the foot of the Witness Tree, whose secrets are darker and more unnerving than either woman ever expected. Vivid depictions of small-town bonds, young love, racism, and women who've dreamed and been denied make The Witness Tree a moving, page-turning debut novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Named an Oprah’s Book Club Selection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. Roy is arrested and sentenced to twelve years for a crime Celestial knows he didn’t commit. Though fiercely independent, Celestial finds herself bereft and unmoored, taking comfort in Andre, her childhood friend, and best man at their wedding. As Roy’s time in prison passes, she is unable to hold on to the love that has been her center. After five years, Roy’s conviction is suddenly overturned, and he returns to Atlanta ready to resume their life together.</description>

  <description>16 hours, 36 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Fresh off the success of his Edgar® Award-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller &lt;i&gt;Down River&lt;/i&gt;, John Hart returns with his most powerful and intricately-plotted novel yet. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Thirteen year-old Johnny Merrimon had the perfect life: happy parents and a twin sister that meant the world to him. But Alyssa went missing a year ago, stolen off the side of a lonely street with only one witness to the crime. His family shattered, his sister presumed dead, Johnny risks everything to explore the dark side of his hometown in a last, desperate search. What he finds is a city with an underbelly far blacker than anyone could’ve imagined— and somewhere in the depths of it all, with the help of his only friend and a giant of a man with his own strange past, Johnny, at last, finds the terrible truth. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Detective Clyde Hunt has devoted an entire year to Alyssa’s case, and it shows: haunted and sleepless, he’s lost his wife and put his shield at risk. But he can’t put the case behind him—he won’t—and when another girl goes missing, the failures of the past year harden into iron determination. Refusing to lose another child, Hunt knows he has to break the rules to make the case; and maybe, just maybe, the missing girl will lead him to Alyssa... &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Last Child &lt;/i&gt;is a tale of boundaries: county borders and circles on a map, the hard edge between good and evil, life and death, hopelessness and faith. Perfectly blending character and plot, emotion and action, John Hart again transcends the barrier between thrillers and literature to craft a story as &lt;div&gt;heartrending as it is redemptive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Is a loved one missing some body parts? Are blondes becoming extinct? Is everyone at your dinner table of the same species? Humans and chimpanzees differ in only 400 genes; is that why an adult human being resembles a chimp fetus? And should that worry us? There's a new genetic cure for drug addiction—is it worse than the disease?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a time of momentous scientific leaps; a time when it's possible to sell our eggs and sperm online for thousands of dollars or test our spouses for genetic maladies. We live in a time when one fifth of all our genes are owned by someone else, and an unsuspecting person and his family can be pursued cross-country because they happen to have certain valuable genes within their chromosomes . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devilishly clever, &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; blends fact and fiction into a breathless tale of a new world where nothing is what it seems, and a set of new possibilities can open at every turn. &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; challenges our sense of reality and notions of morality. Balancing the comic and bizarre with the genuinely frightening and disturbing, &lt;em&gt;Next&lt;/em&gt; shatters our assumptions, and reveals shocking new choices where we least expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future is closer than you think. Get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performed by Dylan Baker</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Battle Cry&lt;/em&gt; is the riveting Marine epic by the bestselling author of such classics as &lt;em&gt;Trinity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Exodus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in 1953, Leon Uris's &lt;em&gt;Battle Cry&lt;/em&gt; is the raw and exciting story of men at war from a legendary American author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of enlisted men – Marines – at the beginning of World War II. They are a rough–and–ready tangle of guys from America's cities and farms and reservations. Led by a tough veteran sergeant, these soldiers band together to emerge as part of one of the most elite fighting forces in the world. With staggering realism and detail, we follow them into intense battles – Guadalcanal and Tarawa – and through exceptional moments of camaraderie and bravery. &lt;em&gt;Battle Cry&lt;/em&gt; does not extol the glories of war, but proves itself to be one of the greatest war stories of all time.</description>

  <description>The body of the Masters rules committee chairman is found floating in the pond in front of the 12th green on the morning that Sam Skarda arrives at Augusta National Golf Club to play in his first Masters. Skarda, a 37-year-old police detective on medical leave from the Minneapolis police department, is an accomplished amateur golfer who won the U.S. Publinx and an invitation to play in the Masters while rehabbing a shooting injury suffered on the job. &lt;br /&gt;Evidence left at the crime scene suggests the murder might have been tied to the ongoing protest by a women's group that has been demanding that the club admit women members. Then a crusading New York Times columnist is murdered on the grounds of the club two days later. Local police suspect the murders might have been committed by a member and begin pressuring the new Augusta National president for access to the club's membership information. &lt;br /&gt;The club chairman asks Skarda for help finding the killer before the police thoroughly invade Augusta National's legendary privacy. Skarda looks for answers from members, veteran journalists, longtime caddies and ex-employees who may know why someone is determined to bring this year's Masters to a halt. &lt;br /&gt;He also falls for Caroline Rockingham, the soon-to-be ex-wife of one of the pre-tournament favorites, a former college golf teammate of Skarda's. Sam and Caroline themselves become targets as the murders continue and pressure to cancel the tournament builds. Meanwhile, the killer methodically prepares for a spectacular and deadly Sunday climax.</description>

  <description>Perched above Spirit Falls in the lush Wisconsin woodland, Robin Bentley’s cabin is remote enough for her and her book club friends to shed the restraints of city living, hike in the woods, take moonlight walks and go skinny dipping under the waterfall. But when a body washes up below the falls, the No Ordinary Women find themselves up to their bifocals in a real mystery. And one of them could be the next victim.</description>

  <description>Detective Amos Decker discovers that a mistake he made as a rookie detective may have led to deadly consequences in the latest Memory Man thriller in David Baldacci's #1 New York Times bestselling series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker and his FBI partner Alex Jamison are visiting his hometown of Burlington, Ohio, when he's approached by an unfamiliar man. But he instantly recognizes the man's name: Meryl Hawkins. He's the first person Decker ever arrested for murder back when he was a young detective. Though a dozen years in prison have left Hawkins unrecognizably aged and terminally ill, one thing hasn't changed: He maintains he never committed the murders. Could it be possible that Decker made a mistake all those years ago? As he starts digging into the old case, Decker finds a startling connection to a new crime that he may be able to prevent, if only he can put the pieces together quickly enough...</description>

      <![CDATA[Not much energized me about this book. I love Baldacci's skill at weaving plots and subplots, and his main characters are above average, but this story didn't get me emotionally involved like some of his other books. Maybe it was just me. He certainly checked all the boxes for writing a good thri...]]>

Medallion Honoree&lt;br /&gt;2017 Honorable Mention-Genre Fiction- Writer's Digest Self-Published Book Awards&lt;br /&gt;2018 Finalist- Adult Fiction- MN Writes, MN Reads self-published author contest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fugitive Matt Lanier, unjustly accused of a violent crime, has been hiding in the northeastern Minnesota wilderness for nine months. The law wants him in jail. His enemies want him dead. He simply wants to survive the most brutal winter in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rescuing an injured trapper, Matt is forced to leave his primitive encampment. He undertakes a Herculean trek through a blizzard to Castle Danger, a small town on the rugged North Shore of Lake Superior. There he’s saved from near death by Allyson Clifford, a shrewd and beautiful restaurant owner with secrets of her own. Despite wanting to move on in order to evade his pursuers, Matt helps Allyson weather a business crisis as repayment for her benevolence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Allyson’s estranged husband, Donnie Vossler, shows up intent on reclaiming their 8-year-old son, Josh. Caught in the middle of the custody battle, Matt learns about Allyson and Vossler’s criminal past life together and is torn between self-preservation and his growing feelings for Allyson and Josh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt's recent past has left him with little hope for the future, so when Vossler resorts to sabotage, kidnapping, and attempted murder to capture his son, Matt's integrity, honor, and survival instincts are put to the ultimate test just as a hit man hired by his enemies closes in for the kill.</description>

  <description>"&lt;b&gt;Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid....He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Code of the Private Eye as defined by Raymond Chandler in his 1944 essay 'The Simple Act of Murder.' Such a man was Philip Marlowe, private eye, an educated, heroic, streetwise, rugged individualist and the hero of Chandler's first novel, &lt;i&gt;The Big Sleep&lt;/i&gt;. This work established Chandler as the master of the 'hard-boiled' detective novel, and his articulate and literary style of writing won him a large audience, which ranged from the man in the street to the most sophisticated intellectual. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marlowe subsequently appeared in a series of extremely popular novels, among them &lt;i&gt;The Lady in the Lake&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Long Goodbye&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Farewell, My Lovely&lt;/i&gt;." ~ Elizabeth Diefendorf, editor, &lt;i&gt;The New York Public Library's Books of the Century&lt;/i&gt;, p. 112.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selected as one of Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Novels, with the following review: "'I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be.' This sentence, from the first paragraph of The Big Sleep, marks the last time you can be fully confident that you know what's going on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first novel by Raymond Chandler at the age of 51.</description>

  <description>For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, &lt;i&gt;Where the Crawdads Sing&lt;/i&gt; is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;2019 Kindle Book Review (KBR) Awards Semifinalist, Mystery/Thriller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STRAIGHT RIVER, the prequel to the award-winning thriller CASTLE DANGER, is a mystery-thriller set during the emotional and financial aftermath of the Great Recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his estranged father dies in a farming accident, professional musician Matt Lanier returns to his hometown of Straight River, Minnesota. While he's settling his father's estate, an old family friend and neighbor asks Matt for help. Her husband's recent death was ruled a suicide. She insists it wasn't. If she can't disprove that ruling, she'll lose her farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The local authorities are uncooperative, so Matt turns to his ex-wife and a young computer prodigy for assistance. As he gets closer to the truth, Matt suspects both deaths are connected to a violent conspiracy with national implications. When the conspirators intensify their efforts to silence him, Matt must decide if it's worth risking more lives--including his--to protect his friend and hundreds of other farmers from financial catastrophe.</description>

  <description>A must read! &lt;br /&gt;Longing to Belong by Judi Bergen is beautifully written in a style reminiscent of Faith Sullivan’s Good Night, Mr. Wodehouse. Turtle Creek, Iowa comes to life through the eyes of Amanda MacGregor, a young woman struggling to fit in with others in town. Her life is haunted by a family tragedy and secrets held by her father’s maiden sister who runs their household. Bergen’s characters drive the story within the milieu of small town life. &lt;br /&gt;Sue Grove, English &amp;amp; French emeritus faculty, Riverland Community College in Austin, Minnesota. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Longing to Belong, Judi Bergen’s debut novel, is an authentic, compelling story that draws the reader into the hidden layers of a family’s tragedy shrouded in secrecy. Recommended read for those who want to know the characters inner lives and how they affect the trajectory of their actions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Vellenga &lt;br /&gt;author of Strangers in Our Midst and In the Midst of Bounty.</description>

  <description>From the #1 bestselling author and former Starbucks CEO, here is a story that is part dramatic memoir, part blueprint of the new responsibilities that leaders and citizens share in America today. The book weaves two parallel narratives to show how experiences from Howard Schultz's troubled childhood--some of which he has never before disclosed--propelled him out of the housing projects and fueled his efforts to build a global brand and redefine the role of a company in society. Ultimately, Schultz reveals the potential we all have to transform communities and uplift lives.</description>

  <description>Kicking off a new series from Anthony, Barry &amp;amp; Macavity finalist Kristi Belcamino ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gia Valentina Santella's parents died four years ago, she fled small town Monterey to pursue the high life in the big city where she could smother her grief by playing house in a luxurious high-rise apartment with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with a hefty inheritance, it didn't take long for Gia to carve out an empty life for herself in San Francisco, slumming at art school, racing her red Ferrari up and down the coast, and getting hammered at the city's finest establishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day, a letter comes in the mail and everything changes. The death of Gia's parents was no accident. They were murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Gia must find who really killed her parents at the same time she's frantically trying to keep one step ahead of the murderer who is now intent on making her his next victim.</description>

  <description>Part Irish, part Anishinaabe Indian, Corcoran "Cork" O'Connor is the former sheriff of Aurora, Minnesota - population 3,752. Embittered by his "former" status, and the marital meltdown that has separated him from his children, Cork gets by on heavy doses of caffeine, nicotine, and guilt. Once a cop on Chicago's South Side, he's found that there's not much left in life that can shock him. But when the town's judge, Robert Parrant, is brutally murdered, and Eagle Scout Paul LeBeau is reported missing, Cork takes on a mind-jolting case of conspiracy, corruption and scandal.</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved the elegant prose, sharp dialogue, and "veddy Br-r-r-itish" style that Deighton brings to the table. The Cold War seems a bit quaint as well as "ancient" history these days.

  <description>Not many years from now, guns are still everyday killers. Most Americans have no defense—except in Oregon, where reforms have self-defense on the rise and guns that kill on the decline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Oath Keeper Hank Soldado, Army veteran, ex-cop, and a good guy with a gun, his duty is clear—find a way to stop the gun-reform leader from taking away 2nd Amendment rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, impossibly, the man’s freedom-destroying vision begins to feel like a way to turn America’s murderous gun impasse into self-defense, security, and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then treachery strikes, the vision is in its death throes, and Hank—Oath Keeper and good-guy-with-a-gun Hank—is the only one who can save it.</description>

Beautiful, self-assured Ifemelu heads for America, where despite her academic success, she is forced to grapple with what it means to be black for the first time. Quiet, thoughtful Obinze had hoped to join her, but with post-9/11 America closed to him, he instead plunges into a dangerous, undocumented life in London. Fifteen years later, they reunite in a newly democratic Nigeria, and reignite their passion—for each other and for their homeland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: chimamanda.com</description>

  <description>CIA director Thomas Stansfield is dead -- a fact many individuals in and around the nation's capital are pleased to hear. But their happiness proves to be short-lived once they learn that Stansfield's successor is the late director's close friend and protégé, Dr. Irene Kennedy. Her plan of action is to pursue the very goals Stansfield established -- something Stansfield's fiercest enemies don't want to hear. And something they refuse to accept. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Israel has discovered that Saddam Hussein is close to entering the nuclear arms race -- and they've vowed to stop the Iraqi madman before he can get his hands on the ultimate weapon. With the Middle East teetering on the precipice of chaos and devastation, the president of the United States is forced to act. The commander in chief's secret weapon? None other than the CIA's top counterterrorism operative, Mitch Rapp. But the window for action on this crucial mission is incredibly tight. Israel has given the United States only two weeks to take the nukes out. After that, they'll do whatever it takes to destroy the weapons themselves. With the haunting specter of World War III looming, Rapp races against time and impossible odds -- navigating the deadly alleys of Baghdad, tearing through the corruption-riddled streets of Washington, D.C., and taking drastic measures against anyone who gets in his way.</description>

But when the mission is dangerously compromised, Rapp realizes he’s been deemed an expendable asset in a power battle on home turf: the choice of Dr. Irene Kennedy as successor to dying CIA director Thomas Stansfield has many detractors, some who will resort to extreme measures to prevent her from taking the reins. But no one counted on Mitch Rapp’s return…or how far he’ll go to find out who set him up.</description>

  <description>EGGS is a quirky and moving audiobook about two very complicated, damaged children. David has recently lost his mother to a freak accident, his salesman father is constantly on the road, and he is letting his anger out on his grandmother. Primrose lives with her unstable, childlike, fortune teller mother and the only evidence of the father she never knew is a framed picture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their age difference (David is 9, Primrose is 13), they forge a tight yet tumultuous friendship, eventually helping each other deal with what is missing in their lives. This powerful, quirky novel about two very complicated, damaged children has much to say about friendship, loss, and recovery.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed debut author Jeff Kinney brilliantly re-creates the typical humor and logic of middle school boys sidling into adolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth grader Greg Heffley doesn’t understand his annoying younger brother, obnoxious older one, or well-meaning parents. But he knows enough to record his daily thoughts in a manly journal—not some girly diary. In a unique novel brimming with laugh-out-loud moments, Greg chronicles his first turbulent year of middle school.</description>

  <description>Hi, Phil,&lt;br /&gt;You miss me? I got bored, so I thought I’d reestablish our relationship. Give us both something to do in our later years. Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;Spare Change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When a serial murderer dubbed “The Spare Change Killer” by the Boston press surfaces after three decades in hiding, the police immediately seek out the cop, now retired, who headed the original task force: Phil Randall. As a sharp-eyed investigator and a doting parent, Phil calls on his daughter Sunny to help trap the criminal who eluded him so many years before.&lt;br /&gt; When the killer strikes a second time, and a third, the murders take a macabre turn, as, eerily, the victims each resemble Sunny. While her father pressures her to drop the case, her need to create a trap to catch her killer grows. In a compelling game of cat-and-mouse, Sunny Randall uses all her skills to draw out her prey, realizing too late that she’s setting herself up to become the next victim.</description>

  <description>Six million acres of Adirondack forest separate Natalie and Doug Larson from civilization. For the newlyweds, an isolated, back country honeymoon seems ideal: a chance to start their lives together with an adventure, on their own. But just as Natalie and Doug begin to explore the dark interiors of their own hearts, as well as the depths of their love for each other, it becomes clear that they are not alone in the woods. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because six million acres makes it easy for the wicked to hide. And even easier for someone to go missing for good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As they struggle with the worst the wilderness has to offer, a man watches them, wielding the forest like a weapon. And once they are near his domain, he will do everything in his power to make sure they never walk out again.</description>

  <description>An unidentified skull...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trail of terrifying secrets...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a woman whose talented hands could reveal the shocking truth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a forensic sculptor, Eve Duncan helps identify the dead from their skulls. Her own daughter murdered and her body never found, the job is Eve's way of coming to terms with her personal nightmare. But more terror lies ahead when she accepts work from billionaire John Logan. Beneath her gifted hands a face emerges from the skull he has given her to reconstruct—a face no one was ever meant to see. Now Eve is trapped in a frightening web of murder and deceit. Powerful enemies are determined to cover up the truth, and they will make certain that truth goes to the grave...even if Eve gets buried with it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Since We Fell&lt;/i&gt; follows Rachel Childs, a former journalist who, after an on-air mental breakdown, now lives as a virtual shut-in. In all other respects, however, she enjoys an ideal life with an ideal husband. Until a chance encounter on a rainy afternoon causes that ideal life to fray. As does Rachel’s marriage. As does Rachel herself. Sucked into a conspiracy thick with deception, violence, and possibly madness, Rachel must find the strength within herself to conquer unimaginable fears and mind-altering truths. By turns heart- breaking, suspenseful, romantic, and sophisticated, &lt;i&gt;Since We Fell&lt;/i&gt; is a novel of profound psychological insight and tension. It is Dennis Lehane at his very best.</description>

  <description>Nine years ago, terrorists hijacked a plane in Vienna. Somehow, a rescue attempt staged from the inside went terribly wrong and everyone on board was killed.Members of the CIA stationed in Vienna during that time were witness to this terrible tragedy, gathering intel from their sources during those tense hours, assimilating facts from the ground with a series of texts coming from one of their agents inside the plane. So when it all went wrong, the question had to be asked: Had their agent been compromised, and how?Two of those agents, Henry Pelham and Celia Harrison, were lovers at the time, and in fact that was the last night they spent together. Until now. That night Celia decided shed had enough; she left the agency, married and had children, and is living an ordinary life in the suburbs. Henry is still an analyst, and has traveled to California to see her one more time, to relive the past, maybe, or to put it behind him once and for all.But neither of them can forget that long-ago question: Had their agent been compromised, and how? And each of them also wonders what role tonights dinner companion might have played in the way things unfolded.All the Old Knives is Olen Steinhauers most intimate, most cerebral, and most shocking novel to datefrom the New York Times bestselling author deemed by many to be John le Carrs heir apparent.</description>

      <![CDATA[All the credit in the world to the author for taking a literary chance and writing a spy thriller with virtually no thrills or action. The structure was also reminiscent of Gillian Flynn's "Gone Girl" with the use of dual POVs--Henry and Celia--who end up being both protagonist and antagonist in...]]>

  <description>“I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb…. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</description>

  <description>With authoritative reporting honed through eight presidencies from Nixon to Obama, author Bob Woodward reveals in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside President Donald Trump’s White House and precisely how he makes decisions on major foreign and domestic policies. Woodward draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand sources, meeting notes, personal diaries, files and documents. The focus is on the explosive debates and the decision-making in the Oval Office, the Situation Room, Air Force One and the White House residence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fear&lt;/i&gt; is the most intimate portrait of a sitting president ever published during the president’s first years in office.</description>

  <description>From the creator of the critically acclaimed, award-winning Cork O'Connor mystery series comes a haunting, atmospheric, conspiracy thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When President Clay Dixon's father-in-law—a former vice president—is injured in a farming accident, First Lady Kate Dixon returns to Minnesota to be at his side. Assigned to protect her, Secret Service agent Bo Thorsen soon falls under Kate's spell. He also suspects the accident is part of a trap set for Kate by David Moses, an escaped mental patient who once loved her. What Bo and Moses don't realize is that they're caught in a web of deadly intrigue spun by a seemingly insignificant bureaucratic department within the federal government. Racing to find answers before an assassin's bullet can kill Kate, Bo soon learns that when you lie down with the devil, there's hell to pay.</description>

  <description>The most cataclysmic week of Lark Chadwick's life begins when she discovers the dead body of her aunt, a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning. This was the aunt who raised Lark from infancy after the tragic deaths of her parents in an auto accident. Yet what un-folds for Lark in the coming days is a dark and twisting mystery into the sinister circumstances of that awful day so long ago. Lark's desperate search for the truth reveals secrets that are about to put her life in great peril. "I was so interested in what happens with Lark I couldn't put it down. It's an awe-some book-a fun read. Intrigue, humor, emotion-what more do you need?" Carol Costello, Anchor, CNN Daybreak "Fast Track is a page-turning thriller that you simply won't be able to put down from start to finish. The suspense is palpable, the characters unforgettable and spectacu-lar, the plot ingenious and masterfully crafted." Barbara Casey, Author, The Coach's Wife "I've known John DeDakis as a dedicated and skilled journalist since 1975 when I was a White House reporter for United Press International. Now, as a journalism pro-fessor, I appreciate all the more John's commitment to bringing to life ethical journalism and mentoring relationships. He knows about the roller-coaster of life's experiences and he demonstrates that in Fast Track. IT'S A MUST READ." Wesley G. Pippert, Director, Washington Program University of Missouri School of Journalism "I love the story. John DeDakis' debut novel, Fast Track is such a well-woven tale, it will leave you wanting to stay up all night until you finish. The plot and scenes are rich in detail; and the characters intensely-memorable. This story will stick with you and you will want to read it again just to be sure you caught every nuance of this fine writer's wordsmithing."Lisa Adams, Author, Bound Justice</description>

      <![CDATA[I love reading books written by journalists! Why? Because they get to the point! Most good novels written by journalists don't need 30% of the book edited to eliminate the fluff, mindless detail, and to tighten up the meandering plot and subplots.<br /><br />For a first novel, this is exceptional...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Final words and heartfelt remembrances from bestselling author Pat Conroy take center stage in this winning nonfiction collection, supplemented by touching pieces from Conroy's many friends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new volume of Pat Conroy's nonfiction brings together some of the most charming interviews, magazine articles, speeches, and letters from his long literary career, many of them addressed directly to his readers with his habitual greeting, "Hey, out there." Ranging across diverse subjects, such as favorite recent reads, the challenge of staying motivated to exercise, and processing the loss of dear friends, Conroy's eminently memorable pieces offer a unique window into the life of a true titan of Southern writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a beautiful introduction from his widow, novelist Cassandra King, &lt;i&gt;A Lowcountry Heart&lt;/i&gt; also honors Conroy's legacy and the innumerable lives he touched. Finally, the collection turns to remembrances of "The Great Conroy," as he is lovingly titled by friends, and concludes with a eulogy. The inarguable power of Conroy's work resonates throughout &lt;i&gt;A Lowcountry Heart&lt;/i&gt;, and his influence promises to endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moving tribute is sure to be a cherished keepsake for any true Conroy fan and remain a lasting monument to one of the best-loved masters of contemporary American letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;A Lowcountry Heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A fascinating look into the mind of one of the South's greatest authors . . . something to remember him by and cherish for years to come."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The Clarion-Ledger&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Fans of Conroy . . . will relish the chance to spend more time with him in this glowing valedictory to his life and writing . . . Eloquent, folksy, and sometimes brutally honest."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A moving and proper tribute to a true Southern icon."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Florida Times-Union&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Elegant essays [that] will not disappoint."&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;--The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Resplendent . . . As always, his storytelling, word choice and rhythm are gorgeous, almost lyrical."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Cork O’Connor and his son Stephen work together to uncover the truth behind the tragic plane crash of a senator on Desolation Mountain and the mysterious disappearances of several first responders. This is a heart-pounding and devastating mystery the scope and consequences of which go far beyond what father or son could ever have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Stephen O’Connor, Hamlet’s dour observation is more than just words. All his life, he has had visions of tragedies to come. When he experiences the vision of a great bird shot from the sky, he knows something terrible is about to happen. The crash of a private plane on Desolation Mountain in a remote part of the Iron Lake Reservation, which kills a United States senator and most of her family, confirms Stephen’s worst fears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen joins his father, Cork O’Connor and a few Ojibwe men from the nearby Iron Lake reservation to sift through the smoldering wreckage when the FBI arrives and quickly assumes control of the situation. What seems like the end of the O’Connors’ involvement is, however, only the beginning of a harrowing journey to understand the truth behind the Senator’s death. As he initiates his own probe, Cork O’Connor stumbles upon a familiar face in Bo Thorson, a private security consultant whose unnamed clients have hired him to look quietly into the cause of the crash. The men agree to join forces in their investigation, but soon Cork begins to wonder if Thorson’s loyalties lie elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that far north Minnesota County, which is overrun with agents of the FBI, NTSB, DoD, and even members of a rightwing militia, all of whom have their own agendas, Cork, Stephen, and Bo attempt to navigate a perilous course. Roadblocked by lies from the highest levels of government, uncertain who to trust, and facing growing threats the deeper they dig for answers, the three men finally understand that to get to the truth, they will have to face the great menace, a beast of true evil lurking in the woods—a beast with a murderous intent of unimaginable scale.</description>

  <description>In a riveting debut thriller that has drawn comparisons to masters of the genre like Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly, Brian Freeman weaves obsession, sex, and revenge into a story that grips the reader with vivid characters and shocking plot twists from the first page to the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Jonathan Stride is suffering from an ugly case of &lt;i&gt;déjà vu&lt;/i&gt;. For the second time in a year, a beautiful teenage girl has disappeared off the streets of Duluth, Minnesota—gone without a trace, like a bitter gust off Lake Superior. The two victims couldn’t be more different.  First it was Kerry McGrath, bubbly, sweet sixteen.  And now Rachel Deese, strange, sexually charged, a wild child.  The media hounds Stride to catch a serial killer, and as the search carries him from the icy stillness of the northern woods to the erotic heat of Las Vegas, he must decide which facts are real and which are illusions.  And Stride finds his own life changed forever by the secrets he uncovers.  Secrets that stretch across time in a web of lies, death, and illicit desire.  Secrets that are chillingly…immoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Once in a great while, we encounter a novel in our voluminous reading that begs to be read aloud. Leif Enger's debut, &lt;i&gt;Peace Like a River&lt;/i&gt;, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affecting and dynamic, &lt;i&gt;Peace Like a River&lt;/i&gt; is at once a tragedy, a romance, and an unflagging exploration into the spirituality and magic possible in the everyday world, and in that of the world awaiting us on the other side of life. In Enger's superb debut effort, we witness a wondrous celebration of family, faith, and spirit, the likes of which we haven't seen in a long, long time—and the birth of a classic work of literature.</description>

  <description>Listener abounds with Native stories, Algonquin legend, Indian characters, and heartrending strife set against the Northern Minnesota snowscape. Native mojo and a windigo vision stir up a storm in this adventure. The struggle between domestic commitment and deceit plays out through Tatty Langille, the Mi'kmaq storyteller. His path to save his marriage is anything but typical-events explode in surreal settings, through winter storms, and during tavern brawls in rural Minnesota, weaving Native culture with odd Scandinavian characters. Tatty believes his Mary goes north to midwife a cousin's twins, but her sudden renewed contact with those far off stinks with suspicion. When family secrets, Ojibwe myth, and murder fuel surprises and twists in Tatty's search, he is left only with questions. Is Mary the wife he believed her to be? Had her wild rages pointed to a hidden past? Has Tatty lived a lie? Should he run? Can he out-distance his denial and his own buried past? After uncovering Mary's identity, what will he do? Author's bio: Tim Jollymore grew up among swamps, forests, and Indian reservations of northern Minnesota, the setting of his first novel. He worked as a tree planter, pulp peeler, local historian, traveling salesman, architectural designer, a contractor, and teacher. Jollymore writes and lives near his family in Northern California, returning to Minnesota in summer. He earned a master's degree in literature from the University of Minnesota.</description>

  <description>Lake Superior, the north country, the great fresh-water expanse. Frigid. Lethal. Wildly beautiful. &lt;i&gt;The Long-Shining Waters&lt;/i&gt; gives us three stories whose characters are separated by centuries and circumstance, yet connected across time by a shared geography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1622, Grey Rabbit—an Ojibwe woman, a mother and wife—struggles to understand a dream-life that has taken on fearful dimensions. As she and her family confront the hardship of living near the “big water,” her psyche and her world edge toward irreversible change. In 1902, Berit and Gunnar, a Norwegian fishing couple, also live on the lake. Berit is unable to conceive, and the lake anchors her isolated life, testing the limits of her endurance and spirit. And in 2000, when Nora, a seasoned bar owner, loses her job and is faced with an open-ended future, she is drawn reluctantly into a road trip around the great lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As these narratives unfold and overlap with the mesmerizing rhythm of waves, a fourth mysterious character gradually comes into stark relief. Rich in historical detail, and universal in its exploration of the human desire for meaning when faced with uncertainty, &lt;i&gt;The Long-Shining Waters&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable and singular debut.</description>

  <description>Growing up female in a Viking world of rough men and horrifying monsters is a tall order for any girl. Freawaru, daughter of a sixth-century Danish chieftain, does not have to kill the night-walking Grendel monster herself; the powerful Beowulf takes on that challenge. Freawaru must contend with other assaults both from within and without that demand her wits and intellect.&lt;br /&gt;First she must learn how to use and control her goddess-given gift: the ability to see the future. In her father’s hall she is challenged by her sly and lecherous older cousin, and by the mysterious rune-master who may be a madman.&lt;br /&gt;On a broader stage, she is challenged to act as peace-weaver between tribes, marrying a rival chieftain to end an ancient feud. In her husband’s hall she is faced with a mother-in-law who wishes her dead — unless she can produce a son. Should she fail, and the feud break out again, she will be forced to make a new life for herself in a foreign land.</description>

  <description>Jane Ryland was a rising star in television news…until she refused to reveal a source and lost everything. Now a disgraced newspaper reporter, Jane isn't content to work on her assigned puff pieces, and finds herself tracking down a candidate's secret mistress just days before a pivotal Senate election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Jake Brogan is investigating a possible serial killer. Twice, bodies of unidentified women have been found by a bridge, and Jake is plagued by a media swarm beginning to buzz about a "bridge killer" hunting the young women of Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises and election looms closer, it becomes clear to Jane and Jake that their cases are connected…and that they may be facing a ruthless killer who will stop at nothing to silence a scandal. &lt;br /&gt;Dirty politics, dirty tricks, and a barrage of final twists, &lt;i&gt;The Other Woman&lt;/i&gt; is the first in an explosive new series by Hank Phillippi Ryan. Seduction, betrayal, and murder—it'll take a lot more than votes to win this election.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Political Suicide&lt;/i&gt;, Michael Palmer delivers another gripping thriller at the crossroads of politics and medicine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lou Welcome, from Palmer's &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling &lt;i&gt;Oath of Office,&lt;/i&gt; is back in this heart stopping medical thriller. A desperate phone call embroils Lou in scandal and murder involving Dr. Gary McHugh, known around the Capital as the "society doc." Lou has been supervising McHugh, formerly a black-out drinker, through his work with the Physician Wellness Office. McHugh has been very cavalier about his recovery, barely attending AA and refusing a sponsor. But Lou sees progress, and the two men are becoming friends. Now, McHugh has been found unconscious in his wrecked car after visiting a patient of his, the powerful Congressman Elias Colston, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Soon after McHugh awakens in the hospital ER, Colston's wife returns home to find her husband shot dead in their garage. She then admits to the police that she had just broken off a long-standing affair with McHugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about McHugh's story has Lou believing he is telling the truth, that the Congressman was dead when he arrived and before he blacked out. Lou agrees to look into matters, but when he encounters motive, method and opportunity he is hard pressed to believe in his friend—that is until a deadly high-level conspiracy begins to unravel, and Lou acquires information that makes him the next target.</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2011 Hillerman Prize—an engaging historical mystery set in 1930s Salt Lake City starring a newly-minted Mormon lawman &lt;br /&gt;To the outside observer, Salt Lake City seems to be the squeaky-clean “City of Saints”—its nickname since Mormon pioneers first arrived. Its wide roads, huge Mormon temple topped by a horn-blowing angel, and orderly neighborhoods give it the appearance of the ideal American city. But looks can be deceiving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When beautiful socialite Helen Kent Pfalzgraf turns up dead, Salt Lake County Deputy Art Oveson—a twenty-something husband, dad, and devout Mormon just getting his start—finds himself thrust into the role of detective. With his partner, a foul-mouthed, vice-ridden former strikebreaker, he begins to pursue Pfalzgraf’s murderer—or murderers. Their search takes them into the dark underbelly of Salt Lake City, a place rife with blackmail, corruption and murder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Throw in a cowardly sheriff seeking reelection, a prominent local physician with a host of skeletons in his closet, and swirling rumors of an affair between the murder victim and an elusive Hollywood star, and you’ve got &lt;i&gt;City of Saints&lt;/i&gt;, a mystery based on a true yet largely forgotten murder that once captivated the nation but still remains unsolved eighty years later.</description>

      <![CDATA[An interesting concept and premise (a 1930 murder mystery set in Salt Lake City, based on a real case) combined with a unique character ( a squeaky clean young Mormon deputy sheriff) and high praise and awards attracted me to this book, but the book did not live up to the promise or the praise.<b...]]>

  <description>In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.</description>

  <description>The Job From Hell. . . Just Turned Deadly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraplegic young attorney Pen Wilkinson is putting her life back together after a tragic accident, working for a large bank in a faraway city. She soon begins to suspect that the job and the company are not what they seem to be, and suddenly she is thrust into a nightmare. Unbelievably, her employer and the media accuse Pen of fraud and wrongdoing, creating a scandal that threatens to bring down her company. Fired from her job, alone, and dodging attempts on her life, Pen uncovers a string of sophisticated, deadly corporate sabotage incidents. Her search for the unseen saboteurs who destroyed her life takes her across the country, reaching a terrifying climax, as she finally confronts the real force behind the plot called Downfall.</description>

  <description>When Elmore Leonard was just starting out as a writer, a man could make a living writing Westerns, especially if he was good at it--and Elmore Leonard was one of the best. In his Western novels, you can see the earliest traces of themes that would emerge in his contemporary crime novels. Although sheriffs and cavalry men look a little different than cops and G-men, Leonard's outlaws, bounty hunters, and mercenaries are the same in both worlds: tough and determined because they know that their lives depend on presence of mind and skillful execution of the task at hand, as &lt;i&gt;The Bounty Hunters&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gunsights&lt;/i&gt; reveal. And Leonard's prose is even more stripped down than usual, reduced to the bare essentials of plot and character. The reader's told exactly what he or she needs to know, and not one bit of information more.&lt;p&gt; Of the three novels reprinted here (plus the other five in &lt;i&gt;Western Roundup #2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Western Roundup #3&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Forty Lashes Less One&lt;/i&gt; is something of an anomaly. It's set in the Yuma Territorial Prison, sure, but the year is 1909. Eventually, it becomes clear that what we're dealing with here is actually a prison-break novel in which at least half a dozen factions are playing off each other, with two men at the center: Harold Jackson and Raymond San Carlos, the only two nonwhite convicts, who get put through a grueling physical regimen by a missionary warden who thinks it'll help them develop self-esteem. With its multiple perspectives and serpentine plot twists, this is ultimately as good an escape story as &lt;i&gt;Out of Sight&lt;/i&gt;--if not better. &lt;i&gt;--Ron Hogan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Originally written in the mid-1950s, &lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; was the novel Harper Lee first submitted to her publishers before &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;. Assumed to have been lost, the manuscript was discovered in late 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; features many of the characters from &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; some twenty years later. Returning home to Maycomb to visit her father, Jean Louise Finch—Scout—struggles with issues both personal and political, involving Atticus, society, and the small Alabama town that shaped her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring how the characters from &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; are adjusting to the turbulent events transforming mid-1950s America, &lt;em&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/em&gt; casts a fascinating new light on Harper Lee’s enduring classic. Moving, funny and compelling, it stands as a magnificent novel in its own right.</description>

      <![CDATA[Quite disappointing because "To Kill A Mockingbird" is one of my all-time favorite books. GSAW is a rambling assortment of scenes alternating between adult Scout and flashbacks of Scout as a child. There is little visible plot other than the build-up to Scout confronting her father about what she...]]>

  <description>“T. R. Schumer had me at ‘programmer’. I was a programmer before I retired and it was so nice to finally read a novel that talked about the binary number system, deadlines, bugs and staying up all night to fix the bugs before your deadline!” Reviewer’s comment, indieBRAG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hum is a 2018 indieBRAG Medallion Honoree and 2017 Self-Publishing Review Book Awards Finalist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Forges a sensational protagonist and an engaging story...” —Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUM is a sexy, supernatural thriller interwoven with real computer science, and tightly wound with breathtaking action...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Writing code came so naturally to me, it’s all I’ve ever wanted to do...” Twenty years into her highly lucrative career, and San Francisco based programmer, Lilly Hoffnung’s résumé reads like a who’s who of the biggest names in tech. She now holds a coveted reputation as a fixer who always meets her deadlines, but this was before she accepted the offer from the AI startup known as Exousía, it was before the shocking death of a lover, and before she began to hear the Hum.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been two years since Lilly woke up one morning hearing a strange sound. Constant, and inescapable, this low frequency hum has resonated inside her head ever since. She’s never been able to track down its source, and no doctor has been able to find anything wrong with her. Lilly’s last hope is an obscure, Hum research project run out of Menlo Park. So far, the only thing she’s learned from it is that she is not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Hum grows in intensity, Lilly is desperate to hold on to her professional life, to keep working, and to push through the pain—unaware that there are others around her; a friend, a mysterious stranger, who are watching...waiting... For the first time, Lilly is now struggling to nail down a seemingly untenable software defect. She has a hard deadline looming, while a billion-dollar tech company hemorrhages cash—Lilly never imagined her career could crash this suddenly. The Hum will forever alter the course of her life, perhaps even for the better, but only if she can survive it...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening length:&lt;/b&gt; 11 hours, 56 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The closer Amos Decker comes to the truth, the deadlier it gets in David Baldacci's latest #1 New York Times bestselling Memory Man thriller.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something sinister is going on in Baronville. The rust belt town has seen four bizarre murders in the space of two weeks. Cryptic clues left at the scenes--obscure bible verses, odd symbols--have the police stumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker and his FBI colleague Alex Jamison are in Baronville visiting Alex's sister and her family. It's a bleak place: a former mill and mining town with a crumbling economy and rampant opioid addiction. Decker has only been there a few hours when he stumbles on a horrific double murder scene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the next killing hits sickeningly close to home. And with the lives of people he cares about suddenly hanging in the balance, Decker begins to realize that the recent string of deaths may be only one small piece of a much larger scheme--with consequences that will reach far beyond Baronville. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decker, with his singular talents, may be the only one who can crack this bizarre case. Only this time--when one mistake could cost him everything--Decker finds that his previously infallible memory may not be so trustworthy after all...</description>

  <description>The latest thriller from the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Twelve Days&lt;/i&gt;, Alex Berenson. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; John Wells has just barely managed to stop an operation designed to drive the United States and Iran into war, but the instigator himself disappeared behind an impenetrable war of security. Now it’s time for him to pay, and Wells has made it his personal mission. There are plenty of crosscurrents at work, though. The White House doesn’t want anybody stirring the pot; his old CIA bosses have their own agendas; other countries are starting to sniff around, sensing something unusual. It is when Russia and China enter the mix, however, that the whole affair is set to combust. With alarming speed, Wells is once again on his own . . . and the wolves are closing in.</description>

  <description>The Godfather—the epic tale of crime and betrayal that became a global phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost fifty years ago, a classic was born. A searing portrayal of the Mafia underworld, The Godfather introduced readers to the first family of American crime fiction, the Corleones, and their powerful legacy of tradition, blood, and honor. The seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed, and the allegiance to family—these are the themes that have resonated with millions of readers around the world and made The Godfather the definitive novel of the violent subculture that, steeped in intrigue and controversy, remains indelibly etched in our collective consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~penguin.com</description>

  <description>There are many bizarre and terrible ways to die. Seattle Homicide Detective J.P. Beaumont thought he had seen them all--until he saw this body, its wounds, and the murder weapon: an elegant woman's shoe, its stiletto heel gruesomely caked with blood. The evidence is shocking and unsettling, even for a man who prowls the shadows for a living, for it suggests that savagery is not the exclusive domain of the predatory male. And the scent of a stylish killer is pulling Beaumont into a world of drugs, corruption, and murder to view close-up a cinematic dream at its most nightmarish lethal.</description>

      <![CDATA[I like Jance's writing style with JP Beaumont. It has a folksy, rough-around-the-edges charm with some dry wit and subtle humor. Beaumont's a hard-bitten throwback to noir detectives of the 40s &amp; 50s, but he's got more of a soft side than his forerunners.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot su...]]>

  <description>“In the midst of happy memories of licking the chocolate chip cookie batter . . . Adam&lt;br /&gt;	spotted a woman on the ground.”&lt;br /&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;	Adam, an eighteen year-old with autism, unwittingly gets caught up in the evil network of human trafficking the day he finds Marina on the ground. Nursing fresh wounds from losing his mother, Adam is ecstatic to accept a new mother figure into his life. He longs for someone to take walks with and who will watch nature videos with him. He can't fathom, however, the horrific existence Marina has led prior to appearing in his neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Marina, abducted from her country of Moldova, has landed in America and somehow managed to escape. Starving, filthy, and exhausted, she has nowhere to turn and desperately needs Adam's assistance. But what will Adam's father think of him allowing this emaciated refugee into their home?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	Adam's father Bruce has his own troubles as the sole caregiver of Adam while trying to hold down a regular job. How will he take on the added responsibility of protecting Marina from the traffickers who are intent on recapturing her? Can he successfully protect both her and his childlike son?</description>

  <description>Mississippi trial lawyers, husband &amp;amp; wife, sue a chemical company for causing death and destruction in a small county. Knowing that the trial will end up before the Mi Supreme Court, the billionaire owner of the chemical conglomerate skillfully buys off the election of one of the SC justices so that the huge award to the suing widow will be overturned and he won't have to pay out to any of the other residents or clean up the toxic dump he created in the county. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An intricate and entertaining story of the "Erin Brockovich" type but more complex, more trial and legal time, and not such a great ending. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good read.</description>

  <description>Jeff Shaara, America’s premier author of military historical fiction, brings us the centerpiece of his epic trilogy of the Second World War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Dwight Eisenhower once again commands a diverse army that must find its single purpose in the destruction of Hitler’s European fortress. His primary subordinates, Omar Bradley and Bernard Montgomery, must prove that this unique blend of Allied armies can successfully confront the might of Adolf Hitler’s forces, who have already conquered Western Europe. On the coast of France, German commander Erwin Rommel fortifies and prepares for the coming invasion, acutely aware that he must bring all his skills to bear on a fight his side must win. But Rommel’s greatest challenge is to strike the Allies on his front, while struggling behind the lines with the growing insanity of Adolf Hitler, who thwarts the strategies Rommel knows will succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Sergeant Jesse Adams, a no-nonsense veteran of the 82nd Airborne, parachutes with his men behind German lines into a chaotic and desperate struggle. And as the invasion force surges toward the beaches of Normandy, Private Tom Thorne of the 29th Infantry Division faces the horrifying prospects of fighting his way ashore on a stretch of coast more heavily defended than the Allied commanders anticipate–Omaha Beach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From G.I. to general, this story carries the reader through the war’s most crucial juncture, the invasion that altered the flow of the war, and, ultimately, changed history.</description>

  <description>College student Joe Talbert has the modest goal of completing a writing assignment for an English class. His task is to interview a stranger and write a brief biography of the person. With deadlines looming, Joe heads to a nearby nursing home to find a willing subject. There he meets Carl Iverson, and soon nothing in Joe's life is ever the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carl is a dying Vietnam veteran--and a convicted murderer. With only a few months to live, he has been medically paroled to a nursing home, after spending thirty years in prison for the crimes of rape and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Joe writes about Carl's life, especially Carl's valor in Vietnam, he cannot reconcile the heroism of the soldier with the despicable acts of the convict. Joe, along with his skeptical female neighbor, throws himself into uncovering the truth, but he is hamstrung in his efforts by having to deal with his dangerously dysfunctional mother, the guilt of leaving his autistic brother vulnerable, and a haunting childhood memory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thread by thread, Joe unravels the tapestry of Carl’s conviction. But as he and Lila dig deeper into the circumstances of the crime, the stakes grow higher. Will Joe discover the truth before it’s too late to escape the fallout?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brad Thor comes Foreign Agent—a thriller as current as tomorrow’s headlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a safe house near the Syrian border, a clandestine American operations team readies to launch a dramatic mission months in the making. Their target: the director of Social Media for ISIS, Abu Muslim al-Naser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple analysts, as well as a senior Congresswoman, are in the country to monitor the raid, but before the team can launch, the safe house is attacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unfolds in the bloody aftermath is a political and public relations nightmare. As horrific videos of the Americans are published on the Internet, the blame-storming back in Washington goes into full swing, focusing on how the intel for the raid was developed and how it might have leaked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search for answers mounts, half spy, half covert counterterrorism operative, Scot Harvath quickly finds himself at the center of the storm. Working for a private intelligence agency contracted by both the CIA and the DoD, it was Harvath who pinpointed al-Naser. But how could ISIS have known the Americans were coming, much less where they would be staying? There has to be more to it; something everyone—especially the politicians—is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the weight of the attack on his shoulders and several powerful members of Congress calling for his head, Harvath is forced to launch his own operation to unravel what went wrong and exact revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as he nears the truth and the deadly puzzle pieces begin to fall into place, Harvath will uncover another actor—a rogue player hell-bent on forcing America’s hand and drawing it into a plot more dangerous than anyone in Washington could have imagined.</description>

      <![CDATA[Very little to criticize about this book other than the excess gratuitous bloodshed and body count, some repetition (ex: brain matter and blood splattered all over after every sniper-quality shot during the heat of a frantic, chaotic firefight), and a general disdain for the lives of the enemy co...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Thor tops himself again and again.” —BookReporter.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Feels like the TV show &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;24&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; on the page.” —The Associated Press&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Brad Thor presents his greatest thriller ever—an action-packed literary tour de force!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden deep within one of the world’s most powerful organizations is a secret committee with a devastating agenda. Its members are afforded incredible protections—considered elites, untouchables.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when four seconds of video is captured halfway around the world and anonymously transmitted to DC, covert wheels are set in motion, and counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath is tapped to undertake the deadliest assignment of his career.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What begins as a favor will evolve into a globe-spanning drama of highly personal stakes played out against a backdrop of stunning international intrigue, duplicitous political gamesmanship, and the darkest, most clandestine fears of the espionage world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With razor-sharp plotting, richly rendered characters, and heart-stopping surprises on every page, Thor isn’t just at the top of his game—he owns the &lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt; genre.</description>

      <![CDATA[A solid, well-crafted thriller featuring a generally likable MC, Scot Harvath. He manages to single-handedly (Pretty much ) save the world, which is what a good international thriller is all about.

  <description>&lt;p&gt;“Sharp as an ice pick….You will love this excellent book.”&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elmore Leonard is the undisputed master, the “King Daddy of crime writers” (&lt;em&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;), in the august company of the all-time greats of mystery/noir/crime fiction genre: John D. MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, et al. The creator of such unforgettable classics as &lt;em&gt;Stick, Out of Sight,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Get Shorty&lt;/em&gt;—not to mention the character of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, lately of TV’s hit series &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;—Leonard is in fine form with &lt;em&gt;Mr. Paradise&lt;/em&gt;. A riveting Detroit-based thriller enlivened by Leonard’s trademark razor-sharp dialogue, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Paradise&lt;/em&gt; follows a smart Victoria’s Secret model’s attempt to score big after surviving a double murder in a millionaire’s mansion…with a lonely cop acting as spoiler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Nothing in particular stood out in this crime/thriller set in Detroit. Dialogue is the main reason I read Elmore Leonard. It's a joy to read conversations that virtually by themselves immerse you in the setting and culture of the story. Leonard uses very little description, backstory, scene setti...]]>

  <description>Winner of the Edgar Award for Best Novel, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Back of Beyond &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Breaking Point &lt;/i&gt;and the creator of the Joe Pickett series is back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If CJ Box isn't already on your list, put him there." - &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two sisters set out across a remote stretch of Montana road to visit their friend, little do they know it will be the last time anyone might ever hear from them again. The girls--and their car--simply vanish. Former police investigator Cody Hoyt has just lost his job and has fallen off the wagon after a long stretch of sobriety. Convinced by his son and his former rookie partner, Cassie Dewell, he begins the drive south to the girls' last known location. As Cody makes his way to the lonely stretch of Montana highway where they went missing, Cassie discovers that Gracie and Danielle Sullivan aren't the first girls who have disappeared in this area. This majestic landscape is the hunting ground for a killer whose viciousness is outmatched only by his intelligence. And he might not be working alone. Time is running out for Gracie and Danielle…Can Cassie overcome her doubts and lack of experience and use her innate skill? Can Cody Hoyt battle his own demons and find this killer before another victim vanishes on&lt;b&gt; the highway&lt;/b&gt;?</description>

Box is a master at setting his scenes to maximize the effect of that openness. Sort of like a story that takes place on an island in the ocean can't he...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Landing a prestigious position as a Supreme Court clerk fresh out of Yale Law, Ben Addison is on the ultra-fast track to success—until he inadvertently shares a classified secret with the wrong listener. And now the anonymous blackmailer who made a killing with Ben's information is demanding more. Guilty of a criminal act, his golden future suddenly in jeopardy, Ben turns for help to his roommates—three close friends from childhood, each strategically placed near the seats of Washington power—and to his beautiful, whip-smart fellow clerk, Lisa Schulman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But trust is a dangerous commodity in the nation's capital. And when lives, careers, and power are at stake, loyalties can shatter like glass . . . and betrayals can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[A strong debut novel from an eventual NY Times bestselling author, but I didn't think it was in the upper echelon of debuts. The MC was a bit hard to bond with since he came off as brash, impulsive, and guided by his emotions and ego rather than logic and reason along with not hurting his friends...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bulgaria, 1934.&lt;/b&gt; A young man is murdered by the local fascists. His brother, Khristo Stoianev, is recruited into the NKVD, the Soviet secret intelligence service, and sent to Spain to serve in its civil war. Warned that he is about to become a victim of Stalin's purges, Khristo flees to Paris. &lt;i&gt;Night Soldiers&lt;/i&gt; masterfully re-creates &lt;br /&gt;the European world of 1934-45: the struggle between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia for Eastern Europe, the last desperate gaiety of the beau monde in 1937 Paris, and guerrilla operations with the French underground in 1944. &lt;i&gt;Night Soldiers&lt;/i&gt; is a scrupulously researched panoramic novel, a work on a grand scale.</description>

  <description>Alexandra Giordano never knew she had it so good. Until it was all gone in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she begins her daunting quest to uncover the black spots on her memory, what she finds isn't sweet or charming or even pleasant. And that's when she begins to question everything, including herself. Her work as a Special Agent for the FBI is only a distraction, serving as a mental metronome...anything to crank the gears of her feeble mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it happens--a bizarre, ritualistic murder. She loses herself in her work, fully immersed in the investigation. Unable to recall even her own kids, she's somehow able to formulate coherent theories on what type of person could pull off such a sickening act. As her mind slowly plugs a few memory gaps, her emotions are scrambled by the reality of her worlds colliding. And the resulting explosion tears her in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she pick up all the incendiary fragments to solve the twisted crime while she clings to some semblance of sanity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One woman can only keep so much...&lt;i&gt;At Bay&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Jane, a brave and sensual Englishwoman, is caught in a deadly romantic triangle between rival spies Ellis and Jean-Pierre. Love, hatred and deception sweep them from terrorist conspiracies in Paris to full-tilt guerilla warfare in Afghanistan.&lt;p&gt;Jean-Pierre and Jane marry and go to work as doctors in the Valley of the Five Lions to help the rebels fighting for their freedom against the Russians. Trapped between extremes of violence, lust and danger, Jane desperately tries to get out of the line of fire. Help comes unexpectedly, from her husband's greatest enemy. They soon become the centre of the action, as treachery seeks its prey. Follett builds the menacing tension to breaking point, leading to a confrontation that echoes all our nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This book isn’t just about being in business; it’s about the business of being. But when you stop to think about it, each of us is like a small business. Successful business owners implement strategies that improve their prospects for success. Similarly, as human beings, it serves us well to implement guiding principles that inspire us to live our purpose and reach our goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rich ganache filling that flows through the center of this book is the story of La Mandarine Bleue, a delicious depiction of how nine individuals used twelve steps of a business plan to find their vocation and undergo a transformation (with some French recipes thrown in for good measure). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a business plan and metrics to mission and goals with everything between―investors, clients and customers, marketing strategies, and goodwill development―this book clearly maps how to create personal transformation at the intersection of business and spirituality. Merging the language of business and self-help, The Business of Being will teach you how to enhance “profitability”―body, mind, and spirit.</description>

  <description>A young farm girl defies the odds to become Oregon’s first female bounty hunter in this rollicking historical fiction set in the Pacific Northwest during the early part of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the 1920s—there may be telephones and electric lights in the small towns, but in the mountains of southern Oregon it’s still the Wild West, with gold thieves lurking in the alleys and armed moonshiners roaming the hills. It takes a steely heart for Iris Greenlee to try and make a living hunting criminals for money, but she’s determined to keep her twice-widowed mother and autistic brother safe in a world hell-bent on destroying their threadbare happiness. She has other motives, too. Iris isn’t simply intent on bringing lawbreakers to justice; she’s out to find the murderer of her game warden father. Although she’s mocked, cheated, and nearly shot to death, Iris is determined to ply her dangerous trade to its true conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a spirited good yarn, The Bounty Huntress is a moral tale that weighs law against justice, and explores the limits of forgiveness. How dark does Iris become in her search for righteousness? As her mother warns, “We all gotta figure out which way we tilt. We surely do. The good or the bad.” Iris can only reply, “I’m workin’ on that.”</description>

      <![CDATA[An excellent first novel. Unique, intriguing MC (how many one-armed female bounty hunters in the early 20th century have you read about?). Dialogue was sharp, appropriate for the characters, and defined each major character. Plot was a tiny bit rambling, but since it was inspired by a real woman'...]]>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Midwives&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Sandcastle Girls&lt;/i&gt; comes a spellbinding novel of love, despair, and revenge—set in war-ravaged Tuscany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1943: Tucked away in the idyllic hills south of Florence, the Rosatis, an Italian family of noble lineage, believe that the walls of their ancient villa will keep them safe from the war raging across Europe. Eighteen-year-old Cristina spends her days swimming in the pool, playing with her young niece and nephew, and wandering aimlessly amid the estate’s gardens and olive groves. But when two soldiers, a German and an Italian, arrive at the villa asking to see an ancient Etruscan burial site, the Rosatis’ bucolic tranquility is shattered. A young German lieutenant begins to court Cristina, the Nazis descend upon the estate demanding hospitality, and what was once their sanctuary becomes their prison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1955: Serafina Bettini, an investigator with the Florence police department, has her own demons. A beautiful woman, Serafina carefully hides her scars along with her haunting memories of the war. But when she is assigned to a gruesome new case—a serial killer targeting the Rosatis, murdering the remnants of the family one-by-one in cold blood—Serafina finds herself digging into a past that involves both the victims and her own tragic history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Set against an exquisitely rendered Italian countryside, &lt;i&gt;The Light in the Ruins&lt;/i&gt; unveils a breathtaking story of moral paradox, human frailty, and the mysterious ways of the heart.</description>

  <description> About the Book &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Powerful Character Arcs Create Powerful Stories&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you written a story with an exciting concept and interesting characters—but it just isn’t grabbing the attention of readers or agents? It’s time to look deeper into the story beats that create realistic and compelling character arcs. Internationally published, award-winning novelist K.M. Weiland shares her acclaimed method for achieving memorable and moving character arcs in every book you write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying the foundation of the Three-Act Story Structure and then delving even deeper into the psychology of realistic and dynamic human change, Weiland offers a beat-by-beat checklist of character arc guidelines that flexes to fit any type of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive book will teach you:&lt;/p&gt;  How to determine which arc—positive, negative, or flat—is right for your character.  &lt;br /&gt; Why you should NEVER pit plot against character. Instead, learn how to blend story structure and character development.  &lt;br /&gt; How to recognize and avoid the worst pitfalls of writing novels without character arcs.  &lt;br /&gt; How to hack the secret to using overarching character arcs to create amazing trilogies and series.  &lt;br /&gt; And much more!  &lt;p&gt;Gaining an understanding of how to write character arcs is a game-changing moment in any author’s pursuit of the craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Bring your characters to unforgettable and realistic life—and take your stories from good to great!&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>Kara Wright and Tien Tran, former members of an elite intelligence gathering team active in Afghanistan, Iraq, and places still classified, now make their living through Wright &amp;amp; Tran, a PI service that tracks errant spouses, identifies dishonest employees and, just occasionally, takes on more significant cases that allow them to use all their skills. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When siblings Zoe and Michael Sterling insist that their middle-aged parents have gone missing, Kara and Tien are at first sceptical and then quickly intrigued; the father, ex-intelligence analyst Chris Sterling, appears to be involved with an enigmatic Russian thug. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Using less than orthodox methods and the services of ex-colleagues with highly specialised talents, Wright &amp;amp; Tran take on the case. But the truth they uncover is far from simple and will shake Zoe and Michael as much as it will challenge Tien and anger Kara. Anger she can ill afford for she is being hunted by others for the killing of a street predator who chose the wrong prey. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only constant in this darkening world is that nothing and no one can be taken at face value. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Perfect Plan II is the continuation of the Davenport series, which brings several topics together in a thrilling, heart-pounding storyline that’s not only believable and filled with hope, but fun to read. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Exiled to the remote mountains of Northern Syria, Kalib Akmalit has waited a full year, planning and biding his time for avenging his brother’s death, a dark family past, and the downfall of Corporate Affairs—the company that made millions legally throughout the globe, but billions in the dark world of the slave market. Akmalit’s deep-seated hatred is directed at the Davenports, the family solely responsible and owners of Crude Technologies—the world’s foremost company in oil spill cleanup with three fleets around the globe. But this seething hatred has been hidden for years, festering, until the recent incursion into Corporate Affairs and the loss of his brother. Now the tactician unleashes his plan of redemption, and to permanently sever the long lasting—and volatile—relationship of two families. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reed Davenport lives to make a difference, as he balances his life between the oil clean-up giant, the sanctuary, and also between man and nature itself—while fighting for both. His five-hundred-square-mile sanctuary is a huge part of that process, intended to protect some of the world’s endangered animals. Located outside the comfortable borders of the United States, this leads to the ultimate confrontation when Reed Davenport and his best friend True John, captain of the oil-skimmer Arc Angel, have been lured to the sanctuary under the premise of finding poachers that are raiding Reed’s private reserve. But this is a well-laid trap, leaving them out of communication from the outside world. They’re also be vulnerable, outnumbered, and struggling to survive in the secluded mountainous country. At the same time, this leaves the entire Davenport family and Crude Technologies unsuspecting and susceptible as this ruthless adversary sets his multidimensional plan into motion, leaving a trail of intrigue and suspense to the final page.</description>

  <description>On the Fourth of July, just as fireworks are about to go off in Aurora, Minnesota, Cork O’Connor and his new bride Rainy Bisonette listen to a desperate voicemail left by Rainy's son, Peter. The message is garbled and full of static, but they hear Peter confess to the murder of someone named Rodriguez. When they try to contact him, they discover that his phone has gone dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning, Cork and Rainy fly to Coronado County in southern Arizona, where Peter has been working as a counselor in a well-known drug rehab center. When they arrive, they learn that Peter was fired six months earlier and hasn’t been heard from since. So they head to the little desert town of Sulfur Springs where Peter has been receiving his mail. But no one in Sulfur Springs seems to know him. They do, however, recognize the name Rodriguez. Carlos Rodriguez is the head of a cartel that controls everything illegal crossing the border from Mexico into Coronado County.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they gather scraps of information about Peter, Cork and Rainy are warned that there is a war going on along the border. “Trust no one in Coronado County,” is a refrain they hear again and again. And to Cork, Arizona is alien country. The relentless heat and absence of water, tall trees, and cool forests feel nightmarish to him, as does his growing sense that Rainy might know more about what's going on than she's willing to admit. And if he can't trust Rainy, who can he trust?</description>

      <![CDATA[Another solid story by WKK. Strange that Cork and Rainy are out of their usual element of northern MN, but I thought WKK did a fine job of setting the scene in southern AZ.

He's recuperating from a heart transplant and avoiding anything stressful. But when Graciella tells him the way her sister Gloria was murdered, it leaves Terry no choice. Now the man with the new heart vows to take down a predator without a soul.

      <![CDATA[Competent craftsmanship from Connelly as usual, but I had some reservations about the premise being a bit too contrived (what are the odds of a heart transplant recipient who is ex-FBI being asked by the donor's sister to solve her murder?).<br /><br />The plot contained some nice twists at the e...]]>

  <description>Narcotics office Cal Moore's orders were to look into the city's latest drug killing. Instead, he ends up in a motel room with a fatal bullet wound to the head and a suicide note stuffed in his back pocket.&lt;p&gt;Working the case, LAPD detective Harry Bosch is reminded of the primal police rule he learned long ago: don't look for the facts, but the glue that holds them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Harry's making some very dangerous connections, starting with a dead cop and leading to a bloody string of murders that wind from Hollywood Boulevard to the back alleys south of the border. Now this battle-scarred veteran will find himself in the centre of a complex and deadly game - one in which he may be the next and likeliest victim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[A surprisingly lackluster second novel for Connelly. I got the sense he rushed it to print because the plot was a bit rambling, pacing was erratic until the last 25% of the story, and the characters weren't terribly distinct or interesting. If he'd had more time to work on it, I sense the story c...]]>

  <description>It’s 1996, and Reacher is still in the army. In the morning they give him a medal, and in the afternoon they send him back to school. That night he’s off the grid. Out of sight, out of mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two other men are in the classroom—an FBI agent and a CIA analyst. Each is a first-rate operator, each is fresh off a big win, and each is wondering what the hell they are doing there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then they find out: A Jihadist sleeper cell in Hamburg, Germany, has received an unexpected visitor—a Saudi courier, seeking safe haven while waiting to rendezvous with persons unknown. A CIA asset, undercover inside the cell, has overheard the courier whisper a chilling message: “The American wants a hundred million dollars.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For what? And who from? Reacher and his two new friends are told to find the American. Reacher recruits the best soldier he has ever worked with: Sergeant Frances Neagley. Their mission heats up in more ways than one, while always keeping their eyes on the prize: If they don’t get their man, the world will suffer an epic act of terrorism.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From Langley to Hamburg, Jalalabad to Kiev, &lt;i&gt;Night School&lt;/i&gt; moves like a bullet through a treacherous landscape of double crosses, faked identities, and new and terrible enemies, as Reacher maneuvers inside the game and outside the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 13 hours and 7 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You can leave the army, but the army doesn’t leave you. Not always. Not completely&lt;/b&gt;, notes Jack Reacher—and sure enough, the retired military cop is soon pulled back into service. This time, for the State Department and the CIA.&lt;p&gt;Someone has taken a shot at the president of France in the City of Light. The bullet was American. The distance between the gunman and the target was exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile with total confidence? Very few, but John Kott—an American marksman gone bad—is one of them. And after fifteen years in prison, he’s out, unaccounted for, and likely drawing a bead on a G8 summit packed with enough world leaders to tempt any assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone can stop Kott, it’s the man who beat him before: Reacher. And though he’d rather work alone, Reacher is teamed with Casey Nice, a rookie analyst who keeps her cool with Zoloft. But they’re facing a rough road, full of ruthless mobsters, Serbian thugs, close calls, double-crosses—and no backup if they’re caught. All the while Reacher can’t stop thinking about the woman he once failed to save. But he won’t let that happen again. Not this time. Not Nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reacher never gets too close. But now a killer is making it personal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this new short story from #1 New York Times bestselling author Lee Child, available exclusively as an eBook, a young Jack Reacher knows how to finish a fight so it stays finished. He knows how to get the job done so it stays done. And, in one of his earliest challenges, he knows that his analytical brain is just as important as his impressive brawn.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Okinawa, 1974. Even at thirteen, Jack Reacher knows how to outwit and overpower anyone who stands in his way. And as the new kid in town, that’s pretty much everyone. His family has come to the Pacific with his father, who’s preparing for a top-secret Marine Corps operation. After receiving a rude welcome from the local military brats, Reacher and his older brother, Joe, intend to teach them a lesson they won’t forget. But it’s soon clear that there’s more at stake than pride. When his family’s future appears to come crumbling down, it’s the youngest Reacher who rises to the occasion with all the decisive cunning and bravura that will one day be his deadly trademark.</description>

  <description>In a Chicago suburb, a dentist is met in his office parking lot by three men and ordered into the trunk of his Lexus. On a downtown sidewalk, Jack Reacher and an unknown woman are abducted in broad daylight by two men - practiced and confident - who stop them at gunpoint and hustle them into the same sedan. Then Reacher and the woman are switched into a second vehicle and hauled away, leaving the dentist bound and gagged inside his car with the woman's abandoned possessions, two gallons of gasoline. . . and a burning match. The FBI is desperate to rescue the woman, a Special Agent from the Chicago office, because the FBI always - always - takes care of its own, and because this woman is not just another agent. Reacher and the woman join forces, against seemingly hopeless odds, to outwit their captors and escape. But the FBI thinks Jack is one of the kidnappers - and when they close in, the Bureau snipers will be shooting to kill.</description>

      <![CDATA[A middle-of-the-pack Reacher novel that is still interesting and entertaining. At a few points in the plot, I did a doubletake as in, "he/she did/said WHAT?" And even though Lee Child breaks many of the writing "rules" as espoused by certain "experts," he makes his quirky style work. The antagoni...]]>

  <description>Will Robie and Jessica Reel are two of the most lethal people alive. They're the ones the government calls in when the utmost secrecy is required to take out those who plot violence and mass destruction against the United States. And through every mission, one man has always had their backs: their handler, code-named Blue Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, Blue Man is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last seen in rural Colorado, Blue Man had taken a rare vacation to go fly fishing in his hometown when he disappeared off the grid. With no communications since, the team can't help but fear the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent to investigate, Robie and Reel arrive in the small town of Grand to discover that it has its own share of problems. A stagnant local economy and a woefully understaffed police force have made this small community a magnet for crime, drugs, and a growing number of militant fringe groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lying in wait in Grand is an even more insidious and sweeping threat, one that may shake the very foundations of America. And when Robie and Reel find themselves up against an adversary with superior firepower and a home-court advantage, they'll be lucky if they make it out alive, with or without Blue Man...</description>

  <description>Goal, motivation, and conflict are the foundation of everything that happens in the story world. Using charts, examples, and movies, the author breaks these key elements down into understandable components and walks the reader through the process of laying this foundation in his or her own work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn what causes sagging middles and how to fix them, which goals are important, which aren’t and why, how to get your characters to do what they need for your plot in a believable manner, and how to use conflict to create a good story. GMC can be used not only in plotting, but in character development, sharpening scenes, pitching ideas to an editor, and evaluating whether an idea will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be confident your ideas will work before you write 200 pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan a road map to keep your story on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discovery why your scenes aren’t working and what to do about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Create characters that editors and readers will care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This book belongs on every fiction writer's bookshelf. Anyone who has ever had a story to tell and is dying to get it down on paper will find guidance and inspiration in GMC. The presentation is clear, immediate, and relevant to all writers--from novices to seasoned professionals. Experienced author Debra Dixon has done a magnificent job of demystifying the toughest aspect of fiction writing: that of a giving a story shape, form and urgency." — Susan Wiggs, New York Times bestselling and RITA® Award winning author of over 40 novels and novellas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“One of the best in her craft.” — Toronto Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Goal, Motivation &amp;amp; Conflict is one of my all time favorites.” — Jane Porter (Flirting With Forty), award winning and bestselling author with 10 million books in print, in twenty languages and 25 countries</description>

  <description>In the tradition of bestselling authors such as Jack Higgins and Clive Cussler, a new voice in thriller writing has emerged to rival any of the masters. When the president is kidnapped during his ski holiday in Colorado, disavowed Secret Service Agent Scott Harvath is his only hope of rescue. As the FBI and CIA chase a string of dangerously false clues across the Middle East, Agent Harvath's investigation leads him to Switzerland. Throughout the picturesque towns of Bern, Interlaken and Lucerne, Harvath plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with the real kidnappers, as well as rogue factions within his own government that want him terminated before he can save the president. With only the ambitious Claudia Muehler of the Swiss Federal Attorney's Office to assist him, the pair are forced to go it alone as they realise the kidnapping plot reaches some of the highest levels of the Swiss Intelligence community. In a race against time, they must scale the treacherous heights of Mt. Pilatus, uncover a hidden military fortress secreted beneath its peak, and defeat the formidable force that stands between them and the safe return of the president - the deadly men known as the Lions of Lucer</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the founding editor of &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;'s sports section comes a bold new theory of leadership drawn from the elite captains who inspired their teams to achieve extraordinary success.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named one of the best business books of the year by CNBC, &lt;i&gt;strategy+business, &lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Forbes, &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SI.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The secret to winning is not what you think it is.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's not the coach. It's not the star.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's not money. It's not a strategy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It's something else entirely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, Sam Walker set out to answer one of the most hotly debated questions in sports: What are the greatest teams of all time? He devised a formula, then applied it to thousands of teams from leagues all over the world, from the NBA to the English Premier League to Olympic field hockey. When he was done, he had a list of the sixteen most dominant teams in history. At that point, he became obsessed with another, more complicated question: What did these freak teams have in &lt;i&gt;common&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Walker dug into their stories, a pattern emerged: Each team had the same type of captain--a singular leader with an unconventional skill set who drove it to achieve sustained, historic greatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fueled by a lifetime of sports spectating, twenty years of reporting, and a decade of painstaking research, &lt;i&gt;The Captain Class&lt;/i&gt; tells the surprising story of what makes teams exceptional. Drawing on original interviews with athletes from two dozen countries, as well as general managers, coaches, executives, and others skilled at building teams, Walker identifies the seven core qualities of this Captain Class--from extreme doggedness and emotional control to a knack for nonverbal communication to tactical aggression and the courage to stand apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told through riveting accounts of some of the most pressure-soaked moments in sports history--from Bill Russell's legendary "Coleman Play" in the 1957 NBA Finals to Barcelona's "Figo Game" against Real Madrid in 2000--&lt;i&gt;The Captain Class&lt;/i&gt; doesn't just bring these events to life; it presents a fresh, counterintuitive take on leadership that can be applied to a wide spectrum of competitive disciplines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The men and women who make up the Captain Class were never the most skilled athletes, nor were they gifted orators or paragons of sportsmanship. They were often role players who were allergic to the spotlight. In short, the seven attributes they shared challenge your assumptions of what inspired leadership looks like.</description>

  <description>Jack Reacher lives for the moment. Without a home. Without commitment. And with a burning desire to right wrongs --- and rewrite his own agonizing past. DEA agent Susan Duffy is living for the future, knowing that she has made a terrible mistake by putting one of her own female agents into a death trap within a heavily guarded Maine mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staging a brilliant ruse, Reacher hurtles into the dark heart of a vast criminal enterprise. Trying to rescue an agent whose time is running out, Reacher enters a crime lord's waterfront fortress. There he will find a world of secrecy and violence --- and confront some unfinished business from his own past.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling “Queen of Suspense” comes a thrilling novel about missing billions, a disgraced financier, and those determined to learn the truth at any cost…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sole assistant to a famous upscale interior designer, Lane Harmon, mother to five-year-old Katie, is accustomed to visiting opulent homes around the tri-state area. A born optimist, Lane finds the glimpse into these gilded worlds fascinating, and loves the reward of exceeding the expectations of their often-demanding owners. When she is called to assist in redecorating a modest townhouse in Bergen County, she knows the job is unusual. Then she learns the home belongs to the wife of a notorious and disgraced financier named Parker Bennett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parker Bennett has been missing for two years. He dropped out of sight just before it was discovered that the $5 billion dollars in the fund he had been managing had vanished. Bennett had gone out on his sailboat in the Caribbean. Was it suicide or had he staged his disappearance? The scandal around his name has not died down. His clients and the federal government all want to trace the money and find Bennett if he is still alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lane is surprised to find herself moved by Mrs. Bennett’s calm dignity and apparently sincere belief in her husband’s innocence. Gradually, Lane finds herself drawn to Eric, the Bennetts’ son, who is similarly determined to prove that his father is not guilty. Lane doesn’t know that the closer she gets to the Bennetts, the more she puts her life―and her daughter’s life―in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the hair-raising storytelling skill that has made her America’s “Queen of Suspense,” Mary Higgins Clark combines a headline-making financial scandal and a breathtaking tale of deception and betrayal into one of her finest novels.</description>

  <description>Ironworker Wayne Colson has come to the real estate office where his wife, Carmen, works at the worst possible time: while Ojibway Indian hit man Armand Degas and loose cannon Richie Nix are there to shake down Carmen's boss. Unable to help himself, Wayne steps into harm's way . . . and sends the two malefactors out the door bleeding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the shooter-for-hire and his ex-con partner are after the Colsons and there's little the state police and local law enforcement can do about it. The best the feds can offer is the Witness Security Program. So it's coming down to just Wayne and Carmen--and ultimately to Carmen herself--to deal with two rough-trade misfits with murder on their minds.</description>

  <description>In the stillness of a golden September afternoon, deep in the wilderness of the Rockies, a solitary craftsman, Grady Adams, and his magnificent Irish wolfhound, Merlin, step from shadow into light…and into an encounter with enchantment. That night, through the trees, under the moon, a pair of singular animals will watch Grady’s isolated home, waiting to make their approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few miles away, Camillia Rivers, a local veterinarian, begins to unravel the threads of a puzzle that will bring to her door all the forces of a government in peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a nearby farm, long-estranged identical twins come together to begin a descent into darkness…. In Las Vegas, a specialist in chaos theory probes the boundaries of the unknowable…. On a Seattle golf course, two men make matter-of-fact arrangements for murder…. Along a highway by the sea, a vagrant scarred by the past begins a trek toward his destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a novel that is at once wholly of our time and timeless, fearless and funny, Dean Koontz takes listeners into the moment between one turn of the world and the next, across the border between knowing and mystery. It is a journey that will leave all who take it Breathless.</description>

  <description>The first time she spoke to him was at midnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven-year-old Autumn Backman needed a hero. When she saw Special Agent Dillon Savich on TV after he’d brought down bank robbers in a Georgetown bank, she knew she’d found him. She called Savich, but she didn’t use the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They were burying dead people in my daddy’s grave . . . they’re coming after us. Please help me.&lt;br /&gt;Who’s they?&lt;br /&gt;Blessed, he’s coming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan Merriweather, sheriff of Titusville, Virginia, a small mountain town near the Titus Hitch Wilderness, goes looking for a missing little girl. Soon after he finds her, Ethan realizes that Autumn has brought him a huge problem – a relentless madman who has the ability to control others simply by looking at them. And the madman is after her and her mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Uncle Blessed, and he wants Autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Savich answers Autumn’s call, she tells him Blessed is from Bricker’s Bowl, Georgia. Savich and Sherlock go to Blessed’s home, learn about his brother, Grace, and meet their mother, Shepherd. Savich soon realizes the only way to stop Blessed is to “cut off the snake’s head.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Titusville, Ethan, Autumn, and her mother, Joanna, are forced to hide from Blessed and Grace in the wilderness. Ethan knows the brothers will never give up their insane pursuit for Autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a race to stop the madness, or the madness will destroy them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alternative Movie Tie-In cover can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44306177-coraline" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after they moved in, Coraline went exploring… In Coraline's family's new flat are twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. Thirteen of the doors open and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourteenth is locked, and on the other side is only a brick wall, until the day Coraline unlocks the door to find a passage to another flat in another house just like her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only it's different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, things seem marvelous in the other flat. The food is better. The toy box is filled with wind-up angels that flutter around the bedroom, books whose pictures writhe and crawl and shimmer, little dinosaur skulls that chatter their teeth. But there's another mother, and another father, and they want Coraline to stay with them and be their little girl. They want to &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; her and never let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other children are trapped there as well, lost souls behind the mirrors. Coraline is their only hope of rescue. She will have to fight with all her wits and all the tools she can find if she is to save the lost children, her ordinary life, and herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critically acclaimed and award-winning author Neil Gaiman will delight readers with his first novel for all ages.</description>

  <description>Trumble is a minimum-security federal prison, a "camp," home to the usual assortment of relatively harmless criminals--drug dealers, bank robbers, swindlers, embezzlers, tax evaders, two Wall Street crooks, one doctor, at least five lawyers.&lt;p&gt;And three former judges who call themselves the Brethren: one from Texas, one from California, and one from Mississippi. They meet each day in the law library, their turf at Trumble, where they write briefs, handle cases for other inmates, practice law without a license, and sometimes dispense jailhouse justice. And they spend hours writing letters. They are fine-tuning a mail scam, and it's starting to really work. The money is pouring in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then their little scam goes awry. It ensnares the wrong victim, a powerful man on the outside, a man with dangerous friends, and the Brethren's days of quietly marking time are over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;This rightly-named "Middle East western on water" takes off from Djibouti, a sweltering, downtrodden city at the lower end of the Red Sea. From this inhospitable port, documentary filmmaker Dara sets out into the Indian Ocean to make a movie that presents a sympathetic view of the pirates operating in the region. Accompanied by a towering, resolutely skeptical African sailor, she ventures into dangerous, unknown waters, heading into a tempest far worse than any weather. Trademark Elmore Leonard twists, turn, and wry current affairs commentary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>~ Available as an audio book in download format at &lt;a href="http://lodingo.com/_product_26190/Blood_Stories_of_Life_and_Death" rel="nofollow"&gt;LoDingo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Civil War — the bloodiest, most dramatic moment in this nation’s history — also produced some of the country’s greatest literature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blood reflects the violent hatred, love, patriotism, and heroism this conflict generated through the vivid stories of the men and women who were there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection includes Ulysses S. Grant (via the rumored pen of Mark Twain) recounting the taking of Vicksburg; Theodore Lyman watching Grant come into his own on his first drive toward Richmond; George Templeton Strong describing the horror of the New York Draft Riots; and plantation owner Mary Chestnut’s report on the final days before the fall of Atlanta. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included are firsthand accounts ranging from Pickett’s Charge to Sherman’s March, from Lee’s Virginia campaigns to the heroism of African American foot soldiers, as well as excerpts from some of the most notable fiction on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the Critics are Saying&lt;br /&gt; "This collection of eyewitness accounts of the Civil War presents a wide range of experiences; civilian, officer, slave, and poet all tell of what they saw. Among the most prominent are: Grant, Sherman, Pickett, and Whitman. The five readers all give distinctive voices to each character as they read. All are believable and make one realize that history is the story of people."

  <description>Nine-year-old Emily Anne Toussaint is fatally shot on a Montreal street. A North Carolina teenager disappears from her home, and parts of her skeleton are found hundreds of miles away. The shocking deaths propel Tempe Brennan from north to south, and deep into a shattering investigation inside the bizarre culture of outlaw motorcycle gangs - where one misstep could bring disaster for herself or someone she loves.</description>

  <description>Hilary and Mark Bradley are trapped in a web of suspicion. Last year, accusations of a torrid affair with a student cost Mark his teaching job and made the young couple outcasts in their remote island town off the Lake Michigan coast. Now a teenage girl is found dead on a deserted beach, and once again, Mark faces a hostile town convinced of his guilt. Hilary Bradley is determined to prove that Mark is innocent, but she's on a lonely, dangerous quest. Even when she discovers that the murdered girl was witness to a horrific crime years earlier, the police are certain she's throwing up a smoke screen to protect her husband. Only a quirky detective named Cab Bolton seems willing to believe Hilary's story. Hilary and Cab soon find that people in this community are willing to kill to keep their secrets hidden--and to make sure Mark doesn't get away with murder. With each shocking revelation, even Hilary begins to wonder whether her husband is truly innocent. Freeman's first stand-alone thriller since his Stride novels is a knockout.</description>

  <description>Swirling riffs of language and a propulsive beat set this gritty, transcendent novel in motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the sparkle and hum of a New York City winter, Jed and his best friend, Flyer, are filming a documentary of their neighborhood. All around them are images that Jed’s older brother Zeke wrote about: drummers, drunks, dog walkers, and the beautiful water towers that dot the city’s skyline. But what Jed is really in search of is Zeke, a poet who loved jazzman Charlie “Bird” Parker and who left behind his CDs, a notebook, and a lot of unanswered questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jed encounters a mysterious homeless girl he thinks holds the key to connecting him to Zeke, it could be his only way to unlock his deepest sorrow and discover how to be—who to be—on his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As true and lyrical as a sax solo, Birdland touches down at the core of the human heart and sends it soaring.</description>

  <description>Kek comes from Africa. In America he sees snow for the first time, and feels its sting. He's never walked on ice, and he falls. He wonders if the people in this new place will be like the winter – cold and unkind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Africa, Kek lived with his mother, father, and brother. But only he and his mother have survived, and now she's missing. Kek is on his own. Slowly, he makes friends: a girl who is in foster care; an old woman who owns a rundown farm, and a cow whose name means "family" in Kek's native language. As Kek awaits word of his mother's fate, he weathers the tough Minnesota winter by finding warmth in his new friendships, strength in his memories, and belief in his new country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Katherine Applegate presents a beautifully wrought novel about an immigrant's journey from hardship to hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Home of the Brave&lt;/i&gt; is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</description>

  <description>Before &lt;i&gt;The Firm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Pelican Brief&lt;/i&gt; made him a superstar, John Grisham wrote this riveting story of retribution and justice -- at last it's available in a Doubleday hardcover edition. In this searing courtroom drama, best-selling author John Grisham probes the savage depths of racial violence...as he delivers a compelling tale of uncertain justice in a small southern town...Clanton, Mississippi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. Until her black father acquires an assault rifle and takes matters into his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ten days, as burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life...and then his own.</description>

      <![CDATA[The moral dilemmas embedded within the plot alone make this an excellent debut novel by one of the best legal thriller writers in the world.

  <description>Thumbing across the scorched west Texas desert, loner Jack Reacher has nowhere to go, and all the time in the world to get there. Cruising the same stretch of two-lane blacktop is pretty Carmen Greer. But for Reacher, the lift comes with a hitch. Carmen's got a story to tell, and it's a wild one. All about her husband, her family secrets, and a hometown that's pure Gothic. She's also got a plan. Jack Reacher's part of it. And before the sun sets, this ride could cost them both their lives.</description>

  <description>Read by the author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new story collection, the first in six years, from one of our greatest living writers, MacArthur "genius grant" recipient and New Yorker contributor George Saunders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Saunders, one of our most important writers, is back with a masterful, deeply felt collection that takes his literary powers to a new level. In a recent interview, when asked how he saw the role of the writer, Saunders said: "To me, the writer's main job is to make the story unscroll in such a way that the reader is snared-she's right there, seeing things happen and caring about them. And if you dedicate yourself to this job, the meanings more or less take care of themselves." In Tenth of December, the reader is always right there, and the meanings are beautiful and profound and abundant. The title story is an exquisite, moving account of the intersection, at a frozen lake in the woods, of a young misfit and a middle-aged cancer patient who goes there to commit suicide, only to end up saving the boy's life. "Home" is the often funny, often poignant account of a soldier returning from the war. And "Victory Lap" is a taut, inventive story about the attempted abduction of a teenage girl. In all, Tenth of December is George Saunders at his absolute best, a collection of stories and characters that add up to something deep, irreducible, and uniquely American.</description>

  <description>On the right side of the law. Sort of.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sebastian Rudd is not your typical street lawyer. He works out of a customized bulletproof van, complete with Wi-Fi, a bar, a small fridge, fine leather chairs, a hidden gun compartment, and a heavily armed driver. He has no firm, no partners, no associates, and only one employee, his driver, who’s also his bodyguard, law clerk, confidant, and golf caddy. He lives alone in a small but extremely safe penthouse apartment, and his primary piece of furniture is a vintage pool table. He drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sebastian defends people other lawyers won’t go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult, who is accused of molesting and murdering two little girls; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house.  Why these clients? Because he believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial, even if he, Sebastian, has to cheat to secure one. He hates injustice, doesn’t like insurance companies, banks, or big corporations; he distrusts all levels of government and laughs at the justice system’s notions of ethical behavior.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sebastian Rudd is one of John Grisham’s most colorful, outrageous, and vividly drawn characters yet. Gritty, witty, and impossible to put down, &lt;i&gt;Rogue Lawyer &lt;/i&gt;showcases the master of the legal thriller at his very best.</description>

  <description>A young woman is found brutally murdered, and the main suspect is the victim’s fiancé, a hideously scarred Iraq War vet known as the Burned Man. But railroad police Special Agent Sydney Rose Parnell, brought in by the Denver Major Crimes unit to help investigate, can't shake the feeling that larger forces are behind this apparent crime of passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the depths of an icy winter, Parnell and her K9 partner, Clyde ― both haunted by their time in Iraq ― descend into the underground world of a savage gang of rail riders. There, they uncover a wide-reaching conspiracy and a series of shocking crimes. Crimes that threaten everything Parnell holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the search for the truth puts her directly in the path of the killer, Parnell must struggle with a deadly question: Can she fight monsters without becoming one herself?</description>

      <![CDATA[An outstanding debut novel, one of the best books I've read this year. Certainly deserving of the numerous awards it has won.<br /><br />Be warned; this is a dark story about an Iraq veteran (who happens to be a woman) and her K-9 dog partner, Clyde, and how they cope with PTSD while trying to do...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The plane circled in the dark. Joe Pickett could just make out down below a figure in the snow and timber, and then three other figures closing in. There was nothing he could do about it. And Joe knew that he might be their next target.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cates family had always been a bad lot. Game warden Joe Pickett had been able to strike a fierce blow against them when the life of his daughter April had been endangered, but he d always wondered if there d be a day of reckoning. He s not wondering any longer. Joe knows they re coming after him and his family now. He has his friend Nate by his side, but will that be enough this time? All he can do is prepare . . . and wait for them to make the first move."</description>

      <![CDATA[My first CJ Box novel, and I will read more of his work. The setting, characters, story line seemed unique, Box's style has a certain flair, and the craftsmanship is excellent.

  <description>On her way to Utah to see her dying mother, college student Darby Thorne gets caught in a fierce blizzard in the mountains of Colorado. With the roads impassable, she’s forced to wait out the storm at a remote highway rest stop. Inside, are some vending machines, a coffee maker, and four complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find a signal to call home, Darby goes back out into the storm . . . and makes a horrifying discovery. In the back of the van parked next to her car, a little girl is locked in an animal crate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is the child? Why has she been taken? And how can Darby save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cell phone reception, no telephone, and no way out. One of her fellow travelers is a kidnapper. But which one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in an increasingly dangerous situation, with a child’s life and her own on the line, Darby must find a way to break the girl out of the van and escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who can she trust?</description>

      <![CDATA[A small-scale thriller that was rich with twists and turns and one surprise after another. I was continuously wrong as I guessed "what happens next." Early on, my first reaction was "Why doesn't she tell the others what's going on???" but that was about the only fault I could find with the plot....]]>

  <description>An old man is dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the old man is dead they will come for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they will come for her, to make him hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Hart has written three New York Times bestsellers and won an unprecedented two back-to-back Edgar Awards. His books have been called "masterful" (Jeffery Deaver) and "gripping" (People) with "Grisham-style intrigue and Turow-style brooding" (The New York Times). Now he delivers his fourth novel—a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping thriller no reader will soon forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HE WOULD GO TO HELL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Iron Mountain Home for Boys, there was nothing but time. Time to burn and time to kill, time for two young orphans to learn that life isn't won without a fight. Julian survives only because his older brother, Michael, is fearless and fiercely protective. When tensions boil over and a boy is brutally killed, there is only one sacrifice left for Michael to make: He flees the orphanage and takes the blame with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO KEEP HER SAFE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two decades, Michael has been an enforcer in New York's world of organized crime, a prince of the streets so widely feared he rarely has to kill anymore. But the life he's fought to build unravels when he meets Elena, a beautiful innocent who teaches him the meaning and power of love. He wants a fresh start with her, the chance to start a family like the one he and Julian never had. But someone else is holding the strings. And escape is not that easy. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GO TO HELL, AND COME BACK BURNING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mob boss who gave Michael his blessing to begin anew is dying, and his son is intent on making Michael pay for his betrayal. Determined to protect the ones he loves, Michael spirits Elena—who knows nothing of his past crimes, or the peril he's laid at her door— back to North Carolina, to the place he was born and the brother he lost so long ago. There, he will encounter a whole new level of danger, a thicket of deceit and violence that leads inexorably to the one place he's been running from his whole life: Iron House.</description>

The one weak spot was the relationship between Michael and Elena. She came across as a bit whiny and wishy-washy...]]>

  <description>By May 1940, panzer divisions had decimated Belgium and reached Calais. Lietenant John Randal, a veteran of the U.S. 26th Cavalry Regiment, volunteers his expertise to help slow their advance. What unfolds is a blend of military guerrilla tactics, suspense, humor, and brotherly camaraderie-plus a little romance between the American GI and the widowed Lady Jane Seaborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way readers meet such colorful characters as Captain David Niven in MO-9 and Captain "Geronimo Joe" McKoy with his Traveling Wild West Show and Shooting Emporium. The author-a decorated combat veteran-covers the details of war extensively, from the five points of contact of a parachute landing to descriptions of a British raider's A-5 flinging Jerries before the first shell casing even hits the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel ends, Major Randal's men, fresh from Operation Tomcat in France, learn they'll deploy via sea transport within 48 hours on their next mission. The second book which has already been written, tells that tale. Those Who Dare is sure to appeal to avid military ficton fans and WWII historical fiction readers alike.</description>

      <![CDATA[Interesting book. I enjoyed the detailed account of a US army officer fighting with the Brits early in WW II. But the story was about 95% "telling, " and only 5% showing, which breaks a "cardinal rule" of writing--show don't tell. However, this storytelling was overall quite entertaining, so that...]]>

  <description>13 hours, 11 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expect our judges to be honest and wise. Their integrity and impartiality are the bedrock of the entire judicial system. We trust them to ensure fair trials, to protect the rights of all litigants, to punish those who do wrong, and to oversee the orderly and efficient flow of justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But what happens when a judge bends the law or takes a bribe? It’s rare, but it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lacy Stoltz is an investigator for the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct. She is a lawyer, not a cop, and it is her job to respond to complaints dealing with judicial misconduct. After nine years with the Board, she knows that most problems are caused by incompetence, not corruption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But a corruption case eventually crosses her desk. A previously disbarred lawyer is back in business with a new identity. He now goes by the name Greg Myers, and he claims to know of a Florida judge who has stolen more money than all other crooked judges combined. And not just crooked judges in Florida. All judges, from all states, and throughout U.S. history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What’s the source of the ill-gotten gains? It seems the judge was secretly involved with the construction of a large casino on Native American land. The Coast Mafia financed the casino and is now helping itself to a sizable skim of each month’s cash. The judge is getting a cut and looking the other way. It’s a sweet deal: Everyone is making money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But now Greg wants to put a stop to it. His only client is a person who knows the truth and wants to blow the whistle and collect millions under Florida law. Greg files a complaint with the Board on Judicial Conduct, and the case is assigned to Lacy Stoltz, who immediately suspects that this one could be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dangerous is one thing. Deadly is something else.</description>

      <![CDATA[A bit disappointing considering I generally enjoy Grisham's writing. As is common for best-selling authors, a little editing would have gone a LONG way. So much repetition in the form of recapping what we the reader know about the case and who's who and what they did and why we think they did it....]]>

  <description>Kirk McGarvey--one-time CIA assassin--dreams of a peaceful life and marital bliss. One man will change all that. In 1945, Isawa Nakaruma lost his mother and father at Hiroshima, his wife and child at Nagasaki, and has been planning years to wreak his revenge--and he holds Kirk McGarvey personably responsible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His plan begins with the murder of McGarvey's girlfriend and the kidnapping and torturing of McGarvey's ex-wife and daughter. But he won't stop there, not until McGarvey himself is six-feet under and nuclear bombs are detonated over Los Angeles and San Francisco.</description>

  <description>Lucy Kendall lived her life in a strange mixture of carefully calculated moves and impulse decisions. Cracking the skull of the man who molested her sister and attacking her was impulse. Spending half her teenage years drinking and acting out were calculated cries for attention from her narcissistic mother followed by impulsive rages at her lack of concern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decade spent working in Child Protective Services before becoming a private investigator taught her two truths. One, CPS failed miserably in protecting children. Two, Lucy was more than willing to do it for them, meting out her brand of dark justice in spite of her own fear of death. But Lucy's crusade is compromised when a self-proclaimed sociopath offers to help—and leaves her no choice but to accept it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When eight-year old Kailey Richardson is abducted, it sets off a chain of events linked to Justin Beckett, a suspect in a life-changing case in Lucy's past. The path she's chosen since dealing with Beckett has been dark and terrifying—but she has no idea just how deep she will go or where the twisted road will take her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's about to find out.</description>

  <description>Roller derby is an odd place to strike a balance in life, but Sammi straps on her skates, adjusts her spandex, tests her center of gravity, and scores points with her no-punches-pulled memoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Sammi Jones's rollicking memoir takes us into the fast-paced, hard-hitting world of women's flat track roller derby. With comedic prose (think Mindy Kaling, Haven Kimmell, Jenny Lawson, and Amy Poehler), Jones, through a series of experimental vignettes (including text messages, instructional illustrations, lists, a glossary of Derby-ness...even a Shakespearian sonnet!), takes us along on her journey from 'fresh meat' recruit to seasoned jammer, with stops along the way for field sobriety tests, emergency rooms, failing personal relationships, and lost weekends. Battered and bruised, Jones realizes her life is askew. Roller derby was Jones's salvation, forcing her to confront personal demons that hounded her around the flat track of life, and by the end of the memoir, we are cheering her on, as she jams her way to victory.' Thom Tammaro, author of 23 Poems, 31 Mornings in December and Holding on for Dear Life,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'In Derby Girl, Sammi Jones has written a raw, brave coming out memoir that's also a primer...at times comic, at times painful...on the complexities and pleasures of roller derby in the upper Midwest, the courage it takes to climb on the wagon and face one's own life, and the choices we make along the way.' Alan Davis, author of So Bravely Vegetative and Alone with the Owl.</description>

The setup is plausible--the police chief and the local college's behavioral sciences expert team up to figure out the identity of the killer. The style leans toward that...]]>

  <description>Abigail Foster fears she will end up a spinster, especially as she has little dowry to improve her charms and the one man she thought might marry her--a longtime friend--has fallen for her younger, prettier sister. &lt;br /&gt;When financial problems force her family to sell their London home, a strange solicitor arrives with an astounding offer: the use of a distant manor house abandoned for eighteen years. The Fosters journey to imposing Pembrooke Park and are startled to find it entombed as it was abruptly left: tea cups encrusted with dry tea, moth-eaten clothes in wardrobes, a doll's house left mid-play . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handsome local curate welcomes them, but though he and his family seem to know something about the manor's past, the only information they offer Abigail is a warning: Beware trespassers who may be drawn by rumors that Pembrooke contains a secret room filled with treasure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to improve her family's financial situation, Abigail surreptitiously searches for the hidden room, but the arrival of anonymous letters addressed to her, with clues about the room and the past, bring discoveries even more startling. As secrets come to light, will Abigail find the treasure and love she seeks...or very real danger?</description>

  <description>The year is 1860. In Evanston, Illinois, a young, unassuming butcher, Ruse Blackburn, wants what every man wants, to earn a decent living and marry a lovely wife. With these goals almost in his grasp, the privileged stomp on his ambitions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruse, rightly accused of murder and tortured, sells his soul and ends up as General William T. Sherman’s aide—charged with keeping the general drunk enough to do evil but sober enough to conduct war. As Sherman’s troops pillage Georgia, Ruse sinks deeper and deeper into madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, beautiful Anne Southern lives a life of lonely luxury with her two young sons at Meridian Plantation. Her husband, Allen, fires the mortar that begins the Civil War and abandons his family to fight for the Confederacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swept with her dependents to Atlanta by the winds of war, Anne must deal with a society in decline and a diminishing food supply. To feed her children, in an act of desperation and desire, she gives dearly to a suitor for ten pounds of jerky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evicted from Atlanta, Anne returns to the plantation. There, she encounters Major Ruse Blackburn and his skinning knife—a man with a grudge to settle and a proclivity for cutting pretty flesh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne finds herself completely without resources and must make difficult decisions.…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A very entertaining, mile-a-minute style, and remarkably vivid characters.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana Gabaldon, New York Times bestselling author of the award winning Outlander novels.</description>

But even more gripping than living through the drama of Revolutionary Boston is the important discovery Johnny makes in his own life.</description>

      <![CDATA[One of the seminal books of my childhood, I decided to read Johnny Tremain again almost 50 years after I first read the book. It didn't disappoint. However, reading it as an "old man" is a completely different experience than reading it as a ten-year-old. It was harder to see myself in the moment...]]>

  <description>A puzzling murder takes place in a small southern Minnesota town during the coldest spell of winter. It's January, and Beth Reddy, newly certified private investigator, is hired by members of her book club to help solve the killing of one of their own. Beth and her partner, Damien George, are supposed to be cooperating with the local authorities, but after deciding there's more to this than meets the eye, strike out on their own. The reader is taken on a psychological journey into the minds of several suspects after the murder of another book club member occurs in a neighboring town. Although one individual, a local odd fellow, emerges in the eyes of Beth and Damien as the main person of interest, local officials seem to be perplexed. The odd fellow possesses a mysterious past and a curious connection to the murder victims, but the logistics and motives just don't seem to add up. The murders continue to pile up, further complicating the investigation and confirming the suspicions of some in the law enforcement community. Nothing is as it seems as Beth and Damien stretch the legal boundaries while desperately seeking the identity of the person eliminating members of the book club.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sam and Remi Fargo, heroes of &lt;i&gt;Spartan Gold&lt;/i&gt;, return in this extraordinary new adventure from the number-one &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;- bestselling author. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With &lt;i&gt;Spartan Gold&lt;/i&gt;, a daring thriller that &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; proclaimed "solidly in the Cussler tradition, [and] sure to please new fans and old," Clive Cussler introduced husband-and-wife treasure-hunting team Sam and Remi Fargo. In their electrifying new adventure, the Fargos make a startling discovery that others would kill to keep hidden...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While scuba diving in Tanzania, Sam and Remi Fargo come upon a relic belonging to a long-lost Confederate ship. An anomaly about the relic sets them off chasing a mystery-but unknown to them, a much more powerful force is engaged in the same chase. Mexico's ruling party, the ultranationalist Mexica Tenochca, is intent on finding that artifact as well, because it contains a secret that could destroy the party utterly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Through Tanzania and Zanzibar, into the rainforests of Madagascar, and across the Indian Ocean to Indonesia and the legendary site of the 1883 Krakatoa explosion, the Fargos and their ruthless opponents pursue the hunt-but only one can win. And the penalty for failure is death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Filled with the dazzling suspense and breathtaking action that are Cussler's trademarks, &lt;i&gt;Lost Empire&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning new novel from the grand master of adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Rick Barron, a sharp, capable detective on the Beverly Hills force, finds himself demoted after a run-in with a superior officer, but he soon lands a job other cops only dream about: the security detail for Centrion Pictures, one of the hottest studios in the midst of Hollywood’s golden age of the late 1930s. As the protector of the studio’s interests, Barron looks after the elite of filmdom’s stars - among them Clete Barrow, a British leading man with a penchant for parties, and Glenna Gleason, a peach of a talent on the verge of superstardom. Rick’s easy charm has society columnists dubbing him “the Prince of Beverly Hills,” the white knight of movie stars, until he stumbles across a murder cover-up and a blackmail scam that threaten the studio’s business and may have origins with some unsavory characters. When two suspicious deaths begin to look like a double murder, and an attempt is made on someone who has become an intimate friend, Barron knows he is up against wise guys whose stakes are nothing less than do-or-die. A dicey war of nerves is on.</description>

Beaumont is a throwback to the 1940s film noir style private eye/detective, which is fun when transposed into a modern day setting (in this case, modern is the 1980s).<br /><br />Jance's style is concise...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Very New Day &lt;/em&gt;is about a boy with Cerebral palsy, who goes to go regular school for the first time in junior high and uses Morse code to write. Rich Trout is unable to use his hands. Instead, he drives his electric wheelchair and writes in Morse code with his head. Rich doubts that he belongs in regular school after being isolated to special education classes only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is inspired by Mrs. Tilley, his English teacher, who treats him as a regular student and shows Rich that anything is possible. Rich has one dream, to be a writer. Mrs. Tilley introduces Rich to an author friend of hers, who also has Cerebral palsy, serving as an inspiration and role model.</description>

      <![CDATA[Any book that contains so much raw honesty deserves praise. "A Very New Day" is such a book. I related to it because my first day of seventh grade was tough too, although nowhere near as rough as it was a kid with cerebral palsy (or anyone who isn't considered "normal" by his peers--don't you hat...]]>

  <description>After tracking a clever killer in &lt;i&gt;Death Stalks Door County&lt;/i&gt;, park ranger and former Chicago homicide detective Dave Cubiak is elected Door County sheriff. His newest challenge arrives as spring brings not new life but tragic death to the isolated fishing village of Gills Rock. Three prominent World War II veterans who are about to be honored for their military heroics die from carbon monoxide poisoning during a weekly card game. Blame falls to a faulty heater but Cubiak puzzles over details. When one of the widows receives a message claiming the men “got what they deserved,” he realizes that there may be more to the deaths than a simple accident.&lt;br /&gt;             Investigating, Cubiak discovers that the men’s veneer of success and respectability hides a trail of lies and betrayal that stems from a single, desperate act of treachery and eventually spreads a web of deceit across the peninsula. In a dark, moody tale that spans more than half a century, Cubiak encounters a host of suspects with motives for murder. Amid broken dreams, corruption, and loss, he sorts out the truth.&lt;i&gt; Death at Gills Rock &lt;/i&gt;is the second book in Patricia Skalka’s Dave Cubiak Door County Mystery series.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After an epic and interrupted journey all the way from the snows of South Dakota, Jack Reacher has finally made it to Virginia. His destination: a sturdy stone building a short bus ride from Washington D.C., the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. It was the closest thing to a home he ever had.&lt;p&gt;Why? He wants to meet the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner. He liked her voice on the phone. But the officer sitting behind Reacher’s old desk isn't a woman. Why is Susan Turner not there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Reacher doesn’t expect is what comes next. He himself is in big trouble, accused of a sixteen-year-old homicide. And he certainly doesn't expect to hear these words: ‘You’re back in the army, Major. And your ass is mine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will he be sorry he went back? Or – will someone else?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When her husband dies after a long illness in 1881, newly pregnant Jane Weber must choose between fading to obscurity under the wing of her parents or forging a new life for herself in the Dakota Territories. Arriving in Flats Junction, Jane meets her employer, Doctor Kinney, to whom she is to be housekeeper and cook and is greeted by the engimatic Widow Hawks, her Sioux landlady. While trying to organize her new life and surroundings, Jane endeavors to establish a friendship with Kate, the town's half-breed grocer, and to understand the underlying and escalating violence toward the Native American Sioux. Life on the prairie is both simple and difficult, and tries Jane's character in more ways than simply learning to survive in the pioneer west.</description>

  <description>Like no other suspense author in his genre, Follett reinvents the thriller with each newstoryline. But nothing matches the intricate, knife-edge drama of &lt;i&gt;Whiteout&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A missing canister of a deadly virus. A lab technician bleeding from the eyes. Toni Gallo, the security director of a Scottish medical research firm, knows she has problems, but she has no idea of the nightmare to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Christmas Eve blizzard whips out of the north, several people converge on a remote family house. Stanley Oxenford, the research company's director, has everything riding on the drug he is developing to fight the virus—but he isn't the only one: His grown children, who have come to spend Christmas, have their eyes on the money it will bring; Toni Gallo, forced to resign from the police department in disgrace, is betting her career on keeping the drug safe; a local television reporter, determined to move up, has sniffed the story, even if he has to bend the facts to tell it; and a violent trio of thugs is on its way to steal it for a client already waiting—though what the client really has in mind is something that will shock them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the storm worsens, the emotional sparks—jealousies, distrust, sexual attraction, rivalries—crackle; desperate secrets are revealed; hidden traitors and unexpected heroes emerge. Filled with startling twists at every turn, &lt;i&gt;Whiteout&lt;/i&gt; rockets Follett to a class by himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Biography: Ken Follett</description>

      <![CDATA[Not Follett's best work. Put off mostly by the slow pacing and seemingly unnecessary detail. Listened to the audiobook, which lasts almost twelve hours.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Saving Arcadia: A Story of Conservation and Community in the Great Lakes&lt;/em&gt; is a suspenseful and intimate land conservation adventure story set in the Great Lakes heartland. The story spans more than forty years, following the fate of a magnificent sand dune on Lake Michigan and the people who care about it. Author and narrator Heather Shumaker shares the remarkable untold stories behind protecting land and creating new nature preserves. Written in a compelling narrative style, the book is intended in part as a case study for landscape-level conservation and documents the challenges of integrating economic livelihoods into conservation and what it really means to "preserve" land over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of a small band of determined townspeople and how far they went to save beloved land and endangered species from the grip of a powerful corporation. &lt;em&gt;Saving Arcadia&lt;/em&gt; is a narrative with roots as deep as the trees the community is trying to save, something set in motion before the author was even born. And yet, Shumaker gives a human face to the changing nature of land conservation in the twenty-first century. Throughout this chronicle we meet people like Elaine, a nineteen-year-old farm wife; Dori, a lakeside innkeeper; and Glen, the director of the local land trust. Together with hundreds of others they cross cultural barriers and learn to help one another in an effort to win back the six-thousand-acre landscape taken over by Consumers Power that is now facing grave devastation. The result is a triumph of community that includes working farms, local businesses, summer visitors, year-round residents, and a network of land stewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A work of creative nonfiction, &lt;em&gt;Saving Arcadia&lt;/em&gt; is the adventurous tale of everyday people fighting to reclaim the land that has been in their family for generations. It explores ideas about nature and community, and anyone from scholars of ecology and conservation biology to readers of naturalist writing can gain from Arcadia's story.</description>

  <description>David Baldacci's remarkable detective Amos Decker - the man who can forget nothing - was first introduced in the sensational number-one New York Times best seller Memory Man. Now Decker returns in a stunning new novel.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fix &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amos Decker witnesses a murder just outside FBI headquarters. A man shoots a woman execution style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter - a family man with a successful consulting business - and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government - or, worse, an international terrorist group - and an attack may be imminent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late.</description>

  <description>A mysterious high-profile homicide in the nation's capital collides with the dark side of national security in David Baldacci's new, heart-stopping thriller.TRUE BLUE Mason Mace Perry was a firebrand cop on the D.C. police force until she was kidnapped and framed for a crime. She lost everything-her badge, her career, her freedom-and spent two years in prison. Now she's back on the outside and focused on one mission: to be a cop once more. Her only shot to be a true blue again is to solve a major case on her own, and prove she has the right to wear the uniform. But even with her police chief sister on her side, she has to work in the shadows: A vindictive U.S. attorney is looking for any reason to send Mace back behind bars. Then Roy Kingman enters her life. Roy is a young lawyer who aided the poor until he took a high-paying job at a law firm in Washington. Mace and Roy meet after he discovers the dead body of a female partner at the firm. As they investigate the death, they start uncovering surprising secrets from both the private and public world of the nation's capital. Soon, what began as a fairly routine homicide takes a terrifying and unexpected turn-into something complex, diabolical, and possibly lethal.</description>

  <description>In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue. Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash, Bosch searches for the "black box," the one piece of evidence that will pull the case together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riveting and relentlessly paced, THE BLACK BOX leads Harry Bosch, "one of the greats of crime fiction" (&lt;i&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/i&gt;), into one of his most fraught and perilous cases.</description>

  <description>As the sole daughter of the chief priest, Hannah is publicly shamed when the prophet of Israel refuses to heal her. Determined to restore her family’s honor, she escapes Jerusalem in hopes of finding the prophet and convincing him to restore her deformities. Gilead, a young Hebrew guard sympathetic to her plight, willingly accompanies her. On their way, they are captured by a band of raiders and Hannah is forced to serve in the household of the commander of the Aramean army, an officer who is in need of healing himself. Meanwhile, Gilead is being used as sword practice for the Aramean soldiers. Hannah must act fast to save Gilead and herself, but survival will mean coaxing the prophet of Israel to heal an enemy commander.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Hannah is based on the servant girl from Naaman's story in 2 Kings 5.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"He puts a gun on your pillow every night?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Pretty much."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was no surprise when sex worker Marnie called retired pastor Shepherd Murdoch for help. But when Shep arrived at Marnie's house, she found the kitchen covered in blood, her young son left behind and Marnie nowhere to be found. All Shep really wants is to grow flowers in her greenhouse, but a nagging sense of duty draws her into a dangerous underworld as she searches for Marnie and tries to take care of her boy. And is police Sgt. Kelly flirting with her? She just hopes she can stay alive long enough to find out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A great new author gives us a fresh and complicated female sleuth in Reverend Shepherd Murdoch. This well-written debut is packed with plenty of entertaining trouble, wisdom, worries, and humor. I loved this book. A highly recommended new arrival for mystery readers!" --Christine DeSmet, author, &lt;em&gt;Fudge Shop Mystery Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Best first line I've read in 10 years." --Jeremiah Healy, lawyer and author of &lt;em&gt;John Cuddy Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF WHAT MAKES A MEGA-BESTSELLER IN THIS ENTERTAINING, REVELATORY GUIDE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do Michael Corleone, Jack Ryan, and Scout Finch have in common? Creative writing professor and thriller writer James W. Hall knows. Now, in this entertaining, revelatory book, he reveals how bestsellers work, using twelve twentieth-century blockbusters as case studies—including &lt;i&gt;The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Jaws&lt;/i&gt;. From tempting glimpses inside secret societies, such as submariners in &lt;i&gt;The Hunt for Red October, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Opus Dei in &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code,&lt;/i&gt; to vivid representations of the American Dream and its opposite—the American Nightmare—in novels like &lt;i&gt;The Firm &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Dead Zone,&lt;/i&gt; Hall identifies the common features of mega-bestsellers. Including fascinating and little-known facts about some of the most beloved books of the last century, &lt;i&gt;Hit Lit &lt;/i&gt;is a must-read for fiction lovers and aspiring writers alike, and makes us think anew about why we love the books we love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A debut psychological thriller about a woman who becomes emotionally entangled in a murder investigation because of something she witnesses on her daily commute.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and every night. Every day she rattles over the same track junctions, flashes past the same stretch of cozy suburban homes. And every day she stops at the same signal and she sees the same couple, breakfasting on their roof deck, living the perfect life that Rachel craves for herself - a lifestyle she recently lost. She looks forward to observing this household every morning, even makes up names and narratives for its residents. Then one day Rachel sees someone new in their garden, and soon after, the woman who lived there disappears. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to keep this information to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and in the process is drawn into the lives of the couple she thought of as Jason and Jess but whose names - she has learned from the news - are really Megan and Scott Hipwell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the police accuse Rachel of being unreliable, and it's true that her memories can't always be trusted. Plus there are the stories that her ex-husband's new wife has been spreading about her. By the time Megan's body is found, Rachel is in over her head, intricately entangled in the details of the investigation, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she put others in danger? Has she done more harm than good? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller that draws comparisons to &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl, The Silent Wife&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;Before I Go to Sleep&lt;/i&gt;, this is an electrifying debut embraced by listeners across markets and categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening Length: 10 hours and 59 minutes</description>

Forced to change her name and live as his second wife, her life is filled with trauma and heartbreak. Thrust into a world of violence and oppression, Ally must fight not only to keep herself alive but to protect the lives of the people she now considers family. At night, she retreats into her memories of the only man she has ever loved – a man she believes no longer loves her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-four-year-old handsome surgeon, David Dimarchi, has spent the last two years mourning the disappearance of his wife. After a painful and isolated existence, he begins the process of healing. It is then that he is visited by a stranger, who informs him that Ally is very much alive and needs his help. In a desperate attempt to save her, David enlists the help of a mercenary. Together they find themselves in the center of more than just a rescue mission. Will he be able to reach her in time and if he does, will she still want him?</description>

  <description>For Ta-Nehisi Coates, history has always been personal. At every stage of his life, he's sought in his explorations of history answers to the mysteries that surrounded him -- most urgently, why he, and other black people he knew, seemed to live in fear. What were they afraid of? Coates takes readers along on his journey through America's history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings -- moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield with a rogue historian, a journey to Chicago's South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America's 'long war on black people,' or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police. In his trademark style -- a mix of lyrical personal narrative, reimagined history, essayistic argument, and reportage -- Coates provides readers a thrillingly illuminating new framework for understanding race: its history, our contemporary dilemma, and where we go from here.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A rich and revelatory memoir of a young woman reclaiming her courage in the stark landscapes of the north.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Blair Braverman was eighteen, she had left her home in California, moved to arctic Norway to learn to drive sled dogs, and found work as a tour guide on a glacier in Alaska. Determined to carve out a life as a “tough girl”—a young woman who confronts danger without apology—she slowly developed the strength and resilience the landscape demanded of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turns funny and sobering, bold and tender, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube&lt;/em&gt; brilliantly recounts Braverman’s adventures in Norway and Alaska. Settling into her new surroundings, Braverman was often terrified that she would lose control of her dog team and crash her sled, or be attacked by a polar bear, or get lost on the tundra. Above all, she worried that, unlike the other, gutsier people alongside her, she wasn’t cut out for life on the frontier. But no matter how out of place she felt, one thing was clear: she was hooked on the North. On the brink of adulthood, Braverman was determined to prove that her fears did not define her—and so she resolved to embrace the wilderness and make it her own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assured, honest, and lyrical, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube&lt;/em&gt; paints a powerful portrait of self-reliance in the face of extraordinary circumstance. Braverman endures physical exhaustion, survives being buried alive in an ice cave, and drives her dogs through a whiteout blizzard to escape crooked police. Through it all, she grapples with love and violence—navigating a grievous relationship with a fellow musher, and adapting to the expectations of her Norwegian neighbors—as she negotiates the complex demands of being a young woman in a man’s land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weaving fast-paced adventure writing and ethnographic journalism with elegantly wrought reflections on identity, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube&lt;/em&gt; captures the triumphs and the perils of Braverman’s journey to self-discovery and independence in a landscape that is as beautiful as it is unforgiving. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Fugitive Matt Lanier, unjustly accused of a violent crime, has been hiding in the northeastern Minnesota wilderness for nine months. The law wants him in jail. His enemies want him dead. He simply wants to survive the most brutal winter in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rescuing an injured trapper, Matt is forced to leave his primitive encampment. He undertakes a Herculean trek through a blizzard to Castle Danger, a small town on the rugged North Shore of Lake Superior. There he’s saved from near death by Allyson Clifford, a shrewd and beautiful restaurant owner with secrets of her own. Despite wanting to move on in order to evade his pursuers, Matt helps Allyson weather a business crisis as repayment for her benevolence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Allyson’s estranged husband, Donnie Vossler, shows up intent on reclaiming their 8-year-old son, Josh. Caught in the middle of the custody battle, Matt learns about Allyson and Vossler’s criminal past life together and is torn between self-preservation and his growing feelings for Allyson and Josh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt's recent past has left him with little hope for the future, so when Vossler resorts to sabotage, kidnapping, and attempted murder to capture his son, Matt's integrity, honor, and survival instincts are put to the ultimate test just as a hit man hired by his enemies closes in for the kill.</description>

  <description>Shanghai, 1941. Jake Greenberg, an American expatiate, owns a casino in the International Settlement. Certain Japanese officers want it. Jake barely escapes a bombing, one of his casino people is murdered by the Japanese, and a newspaper friend is kidnapped. He strikes back, working secretly with American intelligence and the Chinese underground. Then, one night in December, the Japanese invade. Jake has only hours to save his friends and escape.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following on the heels of Lisa Cron's breakout first book, &lt;i&gt;Wired for Story&lt;/i&gt;, this writing guide reveals how to use cognitive storytelling strategies to build a scene-by-scene blueprint for a riveting story&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Story Genius&lt;/i&gt; is a foolproof program that saves writers from penning hundreds of pages only to realize that something's not working and they have to start again. Informed by story consultant Lisa Cron's science-based insights into how story structure is built into the architecture of the brain, this guide shows writers how to plumb the nitty-gritty details of their raw idea to organically generate a story scene by scene. Once writers reach the end of Cron's program, they will have both a blueprint that works and plenty of compelling writing suitable for their finished novel--allowing them to write forward with confidence.</description>

  <description>This classic guide, from the renowned novelist and professor, has helped transform generations of aspiring writers into masterful writers—and will continue to do so for many years to come.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;John Gardner was almost as famous as a teacher of creative writing as he was for his own works. In this practical, instructive handbook, based on the courses and seminars that he gave, he explains, simply and cogently, the principles and techniques of good writing. Gardner’s lessons, exemplified with detailed excerpts from classic works of literature, sweep across a complete range of topics—from the nature of aesthetics to the shape of a refined sentence. Written with passion, precision, and a deep respect for the art of writing, Gardner’s book serves by turns as a critic, mentor, and friend. Anyone who has ever thought of taking the step from reader to writer should begin here.</description>

  <description>Based on the bestselling series from The Great Courses, &lt;i&gt;Building Great Sentences&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the sheer joy of language—and will forever change the way you read and write. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great writing begins with the sentence. Whether it’s two words (“Jesus wept.”) or William Faulkner’s 1,287-word sentence in &lt;i&gt;Absalom! Absalom!&lt;/i&gt;, sentences have the power to captivate, entertain, motivate, educate, and, most importantly, delight. Yet, the sentence-oriented approach to writing is too often overlooked in favor of bland economy. &lt;i&gt;Building Great Sentences&lt;/i&gt; teaches you to write better sentences by luxuriating in the pleasures of language. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Award-winning Professor Brooks Landon draws on examples from masters of long, elegant sentences—including Don DeLillo, Virginia Woolf, Joan Didion, and Samuel Johnson—to reveal the mechanics of how language works on thoughts and emotions, providing the tools to write powerful, more effective sentences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Great writing isn’t born&lt;/i&gt;, it’s built—sentence by sentence. But too many writers—and writing guides—overlook this most important unit. The result? Manuscripts that will never be published and writing careers that will never begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this wickedly humorous manual, language columnist June Casagrande uses grammar and syntax to show exactly what makes some sentences great—and other sentences suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With chapters on “Conjunctions That Kill” and “Words Gone Wild,” this lighthearted guide is perfect for anyone who’s dead serious about writing, from aspiring novelists to nonfiction writers, conscientious students to cheeky literati. So roll up your sleeves and prepare to craft one bold, effective sentence after another. Your readers will thank you.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Artful Edit&lt;/em&gt; explores the many-faceted and often misunderstood—or simply overlooked—art of editing. Brimming with examples, quotes, and case studies that include an illuminating discussion of Max Perkins's editorial collaboration with F. Scott Fitzgerald on &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, this book proves how fundamental editing is to great writing. Bell also offers strategic tips and exercises for self-editing, and a series of remarkable interviews, that take us into the studios of established authors such as Michael Ondaatje, Tracy Kidder, and Ann Patchett to learn from their various approaches to shaping their work after its initial creation. Much more than a manual, &lt;em&gt;The Artful Edit&lt;/em&gt; inspires readers to think about both the discipline and the creativity of editing and how editing can enhance their work. A vigorous investigation into the history and meaning of the edit, this book, like &lt;em&gt;The Triggering Town&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/em&gt;, is a must-have companion for every writer.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?</description>

  <description>Always put the listener first has been NPR's mantra since its inception in 1970. Now celebrating its 40th anniversary, NPR's programming attracts over 27 million listeners every week. This beautifully designed volume chronicles NPR's storied history, featuring dozens of behind-the-scenes photos, essays and original reporting by a who's who of NPR staff and correspondents, transcripts of memorable interviews, and an audio CD of the most memorable programming throughout the decades. Beyond an entertaining and inspiring tribute to NPR's remarkable history, this book is an intimate look at the news and stories that have shaped our world, from the people who were on the ground and on the air. With contributions from Steve Inskeep, Neal Conan, Robert Siegel, Nina Totenberg, Linda Wertheimer, Scott Simon, Melissa Block, P.J. O'Rourke, David Sedaris, Sylvia Poggioli, and many more, this is the perfect book for any NPR supporter, fan, or devotee.</description>
