  <description>This unusual fictional memoir - in good part autobiographical - narrates without self-pity and often with humor the adventures of a penniless British writer among the down-and-outs of two great cities. The Parisian episode is fascinating for its expose of the kitchens of posh French restaurants, where the narrator works at the bottom of the culinary echelon as dishwasher, or plongeur. In London, while waiting for a job, he experiences the world of tramps, street people, and free lodging houses. In the tales of both cities we learn some sobering Orwellian truths about poverty and of society.</description>

Down and Out in Paris and London was his first book, published when he was just 29, in January of 1933. It is a memoir made up of two parts focusing on the theme of abjection within the two cit...]]>

  <description>You just dropped off your child at the bus stop. A panicked stranger calls your phone. Your child has been kidnapped, and the stranger explains that their child has also been kidnapped, by a completely different stranger. The only way to get your child back is to kidnap another child within 24 hours. Your child will be released only when the next victim's parents kidnap yet another child, and most importantly, the stranger explains, if you don't kidnap a child, or if the next parents don't kidnap a child, your child will be murdered. You are now part of The Chain.</description>

  <description>Charismatic college student Ed Grey’s life is a carousel of one night stands until inheriting his childhood home after his grandparent’s untimely death. As summer arrives, he moves in, reliving his past as a quiet, shy, loner by day and obsessively watching for his childhood crush Elise through his telescope by night. The fragile shell of his identity begins to crack after she doesn’t recognize him during a chance encounter and falls in love with the caricature he has invented. As he becomes entangled in a complex web of lies a small metal box abandoned in the garage waits to be discovered. The secret it contains changes everything. My Summer Friend is a modern American love story that offers a glimpse into the psyche of a disturbed young man.</description>

  <description>Part memoir, part study, The Making of a Philosopher is the self–portrait of a deeply intelligent mind as it develops over a life on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Making of a Philosopher follows Colin McGinn from his early years in England reading Descartes and Anselm, to his years in the states, first in Los Angeles, then New York. McGinn presents a contemporary academic take on the great philosophical figures of the twentieth century, including Bertrand Russell, Jean–Paul Sartre, and Noam Chomsky, alongside stories of the teachers who informed his ideas and often became friends and mentors, especially the colorful A.J. Ayer at Oxford. McGinn's prose is always elegant and probing; students of contemporary philosophy and the general reader alike will absorb every page.</description>

  <description>Pull up your satire shorts, grab a bottle of your favourite sauce and take a plunge into the nihilistic world of G.C. McKay. You'll feel your fingers get grubbier with each flick of the page inside an anthology of deviant, yet at times touching and poignant short stories and novelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening things up with 'Something Borrowed, Something Blue', a depressed, self-confessed drunk and sex-addicted late-teen discovers the joys of free cocaine and the sexual prowess of a married woman old enough to be his mother. Self-destruction never felt so good. A sin-a-rama that would make even Oedipus blush.&lt;br /&gt;Self-destruction isn't supposed to feel this good, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drinks down the road we take a turn into 'A Lesson Worth Unlearning', where a father and son bond over their mutual appreciation for teachers, pornography and the best places to masturbate during a mysterious trip out of town. But where on earth is Daddy taking his son? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 'Mother Nature Sends Her Love' and 'SQUIRM', a group of amoral, reckless teens run amok and fuck shit up just because they can inside a series of distasteful pranks and crude group games, inspired by the sexual frustration they're all governed by, yet totally unaware of. The perfect toilet reads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And closing the collection off with a descent into the more horrific we come to 'The Last Laugh', where a sleep-deprived stand-up comedian attempts to shake off the aftermath of a destructive relationship... only to be immediately confronted by it again as he makes his long-awaited return to the stage. Cue tension, questionable narration and whole barrel of laughs, but at whose expense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between there's runaway dogs, sexy inanimate objects and barely legal prostitution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darkly humorous, satirical and unusually heart-rendering, these dank and disturbing short stories will soon become what you'll expect from an author who cannot seem to stop himself trailing down the path marked debauched.</description>

  <description>Combining personal reflection and social observation, Bret Easton Ellis's first work of nonfiction is an incendiary polemic about this young century's failings, e-driven and otherwise, and at once an example, definition, and defense of what "freedom of speech" truly means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bret Easton Ellis has wrestled with the double-edged sword of fame and notoriety for more than thirty years now, since &lt;i&gt;Less Than Zero&lt;/i&gt; catapulted him into the limelight in 1985, earning him devoted fans and, perhaps, even fiercer enemies. An enigmatic figure who has always gone against the grain and refused categorization, he captured the depravity of the eighties with one of contemporary literature's most polarizing characters, &lt;i&gt;American Psycho&lt;/i&gt;'s iconic, terrifying Patrick Bateman. In recent years, his candor and gallows humor on both Twitter and his podcast have continued his legacy as someone determined to speak the truth, however painful it might be, and whom people accordingly either love or love to hate. He encounters various positions and voices controversial opinions, more often than not fighting the status quo.&lt;br /&gt; Now, in &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt;, with the same originality displayed in his fiction, Ellis pours himself out onto the page and, in doing so, eviscerates the perceived good that the social-media age has wrought, starting with the dangerous cult of likeability. &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; is both a denunciation of censorship, particularly the self-inflicted sort committed in hopes of being "accepted," and a bracing view of a life devoted to authenticity.&lt;br /&gt; Provocative, incisive, funny, and surprisingly poignant, &lt;i&gt;White&lt;/i&gt; reveals not only what is visible on the glittering, pristine surface but also the riotous truths that are hidden underneath.</description>

  <description>Harriet Jareck is dying. Cancer snakes through her brain, eradicating her short-term memory and her ability to recognize faces. It’s not looming death that scares her—she’s had a long life on the farm she loves. What she fears most is dying before she’s been forgiven for her worst sin. She’s dedicated her life to repenting for that sin, but she worries that it’s not enough. She feels called to tell the whole story—every disturbing detail—to seek forgiveness, not knowing who listens or whether she has enough time left in her to finish.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;film critic shows why we need criticism now more than ever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few could explain, let alone seek out, a career in criticism. Yet what A.O. Scott shows in &lt;i&gt;Better Living Through Criticism&lt;/i&gt; is that we are, in fact, all critics: because critical thinking informs almost every aspect of artistic creation, of civil action, of interpersonal life. With penetrating insight and warm humor, Scott shows that while individual critics--himself included--can make mistakes and find flaws where they shouldn't, criticism as a discipline is one of the noblest, most creative, and urgent activities of modern existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using his own film criticism as a starting point--everything from his infamous dismissal of the international blockbuster &lt;i&gt;The Avengers&lt;/i&gt; to his intense affection for Pixar's animated &lt;i&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/i&gt;--Scott expands outward, easily guiding readers through the complexities of Rilke and Shelley, the origins of Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, the power of Marina Abramovich and 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' Drawing on the long tradition of criticism from Aristotle to Susan Sontag, Scott shows that real criticism was and always will be the breath of fresh air that allows true creativity to thrive. "The time for criticism is always now," Scott explains, "because the imperative to think clearly, to insist on the necessary balance of reason and passion, never goes away."</description>

  <description>A woman writer goes to Athens in the height of summer to teach a writing course. Though her own circumstances remain indistinct, she becomes the audience to a chain of narratives, as the people she meets tell her one after another the stories of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with the neighbouring passenger on the flight out and his tales of fast boats and failed marriages, the storytellers talk of their loves and ambitions and pains, their anxieties, their perceptions and daily lives. In the stifling heat and noise of the city the sequence of voice begins to weave a complex human tapestry. The more they talk the more elliptical their listener becomes, as she shapes and directs their accounts until certain themes begin to emerge: the experience of loss, the nature of family life, the difficulty of intimacy and the mystery of creativity itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outline is a novel about writing and talking, about self-effacement and self-expression, about the desire to create and the human art of self-portraiture in which that desire finds its universal form.</description>

  <description>From bestselling writer David Graeber, a powerful argument against the rise of meaningless, unfulfilling jobs, and their consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does your job make a meaningful contribution to the world? In the spring of 2013, David Graeber asked this question in a playful, provocative essay titled “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs.” It went viral. After a million online views in seventeen different languages, people all over the world are still debating the answer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are millions of people—HR consultants, communication coordinators, telemarketing researchers, corporate lawyers—whose jobs are useless, and, tragically, they know it. These people are caught in bullshit jobs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Graeber explores one of society’s most vexing and deeply felt concerns, indicting among other villains a particular strain of finance capitalism that betrays ideals shared by thinkers ranging from Keynes to Lincoln. &lt;i&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/i&gt; gives individuals, corporations, and societies permission to undergo a shift in values, placing creative and caring work at the center of our culture. This book is for everyone who wants to turn their vocation back into an avocation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a captivating account of how "a skinny Asian kid from upstate" became a successful entrepreneur, only to find a new mission: calling attention to the urgent steps America must take, including Universal Basic Income, to stabilize our economy amid rapid technological change and automation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The shift toward automation is about to create a tsunami of unemployment. Not in the distant future—now. One recent estimate predicts 45 million American workers will lose their jobs within the next twelve years—jobs that won't be replaced. In a future marked by restlessness and chronic unemployment, what will happen to American society? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The War on Normal People&lt;/i&gt;, Andrew Yang paints a dire portrait of the American economy. Rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and automation software are making millions of Americans' livelihoods irrelevant. The consequences of these trends are already being felt across our communities in the form of political unrest, drug use, and other social ills. The future looks dire-but is it unavoidable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The War on Normal People&lt;/i&gt;, Yang imagines a different future—one in which having a job is distinct from the capacity to prosper and seek fulfillment. At this vision's core is Universal Basic Income, the concept of providing all citizens with a guaranteed income-and one that is rapidly gaining popularity among forward-thinking politicians and economists. Yang proposes that UBI is an essential step toward a new, more durable kind of economy, one he calls "human capitalism."</description>

  <description>In this valuable and revealing anthology, cultural critic and bestselling author Roxane Gay collects original and previously published pieces that address what it means to live in a world where women have to measure the harassment, violence, and aggression they face, and where they are “routinely second-guessed, blown off, discredited, denigrated, besmirched, belittled, patronized, mocked, shamed, gaslit, insulted, bullied” for speaking out. Contributions include essays from established and up-and-coming writers, performers, and critics, including actors Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union and writers Amy Jo Burns, Lyz Lenz, and Claire Schwartz. Covering a wide range of topics and experiences, from an exploration of the rape epidemic embedded in the refugee crisis to first-person accounts of child molestation, this collection is often deeply personal and is always unflinchingly honest. Like Rebecca Solnit’s &lt;em&gt;Men Explain Things to Me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Not That Bad&lt;/em&gt; will resonate with every reader, saying “something in totality that we cannot say alone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searing and heartbreakingly candid, this provocative collection both reflects the world we live in and offers a call to arms insisting that “not that bad” must no longer be good enough.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A stunning follow up to &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Tears We Cannot Stop&lt;/i&gt;, a timely exploration of America's tortured racial politics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2015 BLM activist Julius Jones confronted Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with an urgent query: “What in your heart has changed that’s going to change the direction of this country?” “I don’t believe you just change hearts,” she protested. “I believe you change &lt;i&gt;laws&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fraught conflict between conscience and politics – between morality and power – in addressing race hardly began with Clinton. An electrifying and traumatic encounter in the sixties crystallized these furious disputes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1963 Attorney General Robert Kennedy sought out James Baldwin to explain the rage that threatened to engulf black America. Baldwin brought along some friends, including playwright Lorraine Hansberry, psychologist Kenneth Clark, and a valiant activist, Jerome Smith. It was Smith’s relentless, unfiltered fury that set Kennedy on his heels, reducing him to sullen silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kennedy walked away from the nearly three-hour meeting angry – that the black folk assembled didn’t understand politics, and that they weren’t as easy to talk to as Martin Luther King. But especially that they were more interested in witness than policy. But Kennedy’s anger quickly gave way to empathy, especially for Smith. “I guess if I were in his shoes…I might feel differently about this country.” Kennedy set about changing policy – the meeting having transformed his thinking in fundamental ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was more: every big argument about race that persists to this day got a hearing in that room. Smith declaring that he’d never fight for his country given its racist tendencies, and Kennedy being appalled at such lack of patriotism, tracks the disdain for black dissent in our own time. His belief that black folk were ungrateful for the Kennedys’ efforts to make things better shows up in our day as the charge that black folk wallow in the politics of ingratitude and victimhood. The contributions of black queer folk to racial progress still cause a stir. BLM has been accused of harboring a covert queer agenda. The immigrant experience, like that of Kennedy – versus the racial experience of Baldwin – is a cudgel to excoriate black folk for lacking hustle and ingenuity. The questioning of whether folk who are interracially partnered can authentically communicate black interests persists. And we grapple still with the responsibility of black intellectuals and artists to bring about social change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book exists at the tense intersection of the conflict between politics and prophecy – of whether we embrace political resolution or moral redemption to fix our fractured racial landscape. The future of race and democracy hang in the balance.</description>

  <description>" a stomach-twisting ride through the depths of horror, breathing new life into an often-stagnant part of the genre" - Publishers Weekly, starred review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, Phil Pendleton and his son Adam are just an ordinary father and son, no different from any other. They take walks in the park together, visit county fairs, museums, and zoos, and eat together overlooking the lake. Some might say the father is a little too accommodating given the lack of discipline when the child loses his temper in public. Some might say he spoils his son by allowing him to set his own bedtimes and eat candy whenever he wants. Some might say that such leniency is starting to take its toll on the father, given how his health has declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What no one knows is that Phil is a prisoner, and that up until a few weeks ago and a chance encounter at a grocery store, he had never seen the child before in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new novella from the Bram Stoker Award-winning author of THE TURTLE BOY and KIN.</description>

  <description>Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, &lt;i&gt;Bird Box&lt;/i&gt; is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

  <description>“After saying our good-byes to friends and neighbors, we all got in the cars and headed up the hill and down the road toward a future in Ohio that we hoped would be brighter,” Otis Trotter writes in his affecting memoir, &lt;i&gt;Keeping Heart: A Memoir of Family Struggle, Race, and Medicine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Organized around the life histories, medical struggles, and recollections of Trotter and his thirteen siblings, the story begins in 1914 with his parents, Joe William Trotter Sr. and Thelma Odell Foster Trotter, in rural Alabama. By telling his story alongside the experiences of his parents as well as his siblings, Otis reveals cohesion and tensions in twentieth-century African American family and community life in Alabama, West Virginia, and Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This engaging chronicle illuminates the journeys not only of a black man born with heart disease in the southern Appalachian coalfields, but of his family and community. It fills an important gap in the literature on an underexamined aspect of American experience: the lives of blacks in rural Appalachia and in the nonurban endpoints of the Great Migration. Its emotional power is a testament to the importance of ordinary lives.</description>

  <description>Jacqueline Woodson, one of today's finest writers, tells the moving story of her childhood in mesmerizing verse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child’s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson’s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become.</description>

  <description>Fifty years after Betty Friedan unveiled &lt;i&gt;The Feminine Mystique&lt;/i&gt;, relations between men and women in America have never been more dysfunctional. If women are more liberated than ever before, why aren't they happier? In this shocking, funny, and bluntly honest tour of today’s gender discontents, Andrea Tantaros, one of Fox News' most popular and outspoken stars, exposes how the rightful feminist pursuit of equality went too far, and how the unintended pitfalls of that power trade have made women (and men!) miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a covetous quest to attain the power that men had, women were advised to work like men, talk like men, party like men, and have sex like men. There’s just one problem: women aren’t men. Instead of feeling happy with their newfound freedoms, females today are tied up in knots, trying to strike a balance between their natural, feminine and traditional desires and what modern society dictates—and demands—through the commandments of feminism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revealing the mass confusion this has caused among both sexes, Tantaros argues that decades of social and economic progress haven’t brought women the peace and contentedness they were told they'd gain from their new opportunities. The pressure both to have it all and to put forth the perfectly post-worthy, filtered life for social media and society at large has left women feeling twisted. Meanwhile, in their rightful quest for equality, women have promoted themselves at the expense of their male counterparts, leaving both genders frayed and frustrated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid and humorous romp through the American cultural landscape, Tantaros reveals how gaining respect in the office—where women earned it—made them stop demanding it where they really wanted it: in their love lives. The impact of this power trade has been felt in every way, from sex to salaries, to dating and marriage, to fertility and female friendships, to the personal details they share with each other.  As a result, we've lost the traditional virtues and values that we all want, regardless of our politics: intimacy, authenticity, kindness, respect, discretion, and above all commitment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With scathing wit—and insights born of personal experience—Tantaros explores how women have taken guys off the hook in dating (much to their own detriment) and exposes how we’ve become a nation averse to intimacy and preoccupied with porn, one that has traded kindness for control, intimacy for sexting, and monogamy for polygamy.  Sorry romance. Sorry decency and manners. Long talks over the telephone have been supplanted by the "belfie."  All this indicates a culture that's devolving, not evolving.  And it’s only getting worse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tied Up in Knots is a no-holds-barred gut check for the sexes and a wake-up call for a society that has decayed -- faster than anyone thought possible.  It’s time to remember what we all really want out of work, love and life. Only then can we finally begin untying those knots.</description>

  <description>Beth Macy takes us into the epicenter of America's twenty-plus year struggle with opioid addiction. From distressed small communities in Central Appalachia to wealthy suburbs; from disparate cities to once-idyllic farm towns; it's a heartbreaking trajectory that illustrates how this national crisis has persisted for so long and become so firmly entrenched. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning with a single dealer who lands in a small Virginia town and sets about turning high school football stars into heroin overdose statistics, Macy endeavors to answer a grieving mother's question-why her only son died-and comes away with a harrowing story of greed and need. From the introduction of OxyContin in 1996, Macy parses how America embraced a medical culture where overtreatment with painkillers became the norm. In some of the same distressed communities featured in her bestselling book &lt;i&gt;Factory Man&lt;/i&gt;, the unemployed use painkillers both to numb the pain of joblessness and pay their bills, while privileged teens trade pills in cul-de-sacs, and even high school standouts fall prey to prostitution, jail, and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through unsparing, yet deeply human portraits of the families and first responders struggling to ameliorate this epidemic, each facet of the crisis comes into focus. In these politically fragmented times, Beth Macy shows, astonishingly, that the only thing that unites Americans across geographic and class lines is opioid drug abuse. But in a country unable to provide basic healthcare for all, Macy still finds reason to hope-and signs of the spirit and tenacity necessary in those facing addiction to build a better future for themselves and their families.</description>

  <description>The funny and talented Chip Gaines is well known to millions of people as a TV star, renovation expert, bestselling author, husband to Joanna, and father of 4 in Waco, Texas. But long before the world took notice, Chip was a serial entrepreneur who was always ready for the next challenge, even if it didn’t quite work out as planned. Whether it was buying a neighborhood laundromat or talking a bank into a loan for some equipment to start a lawn-mowing service, Chip always knew that the most important thing was to take that first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Capital Gaines&lt;/em&gt;, we walk alongside him as he relives some of his craziest antics and the lessons learned along the way. His mentors taught him to never give up and his family showed him what it meant to always have a positive attitude despite your circumstances. Throw in a natural daredevil personality and a willingness to do (or eat!) just about anything, and you have the life and daily activity of Chip Gaines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capital Gaines&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect book for anyone looking to succeed not only in business but more importantly in life. </description>

  <description>For over three decades, Ray Kurzweil has been one of the most respected and provocative advocates of the role of technology in our future. In his classic &lt;i&gt;The Age of Spiritual Machines&lt;/i&gt;, he argued that computers would soon rival the full range of human intelligence at its best. Now he examines the next step in this inexorable evolutionary process: the union of human and machine, in which the knowledge and skills embedded in our brains will be combined with the vastly greater capacity, speed, and knowledge-sharing ability of our creations.</description>

  <description>One sweltering night in 2013, four former high school classmates converge on their hometown in northeastern Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s Bill Ashcraft, a passionate, drug-abusing young activist whose flailing ambitions have taken him from Cambodia to Zuccotti Park to post-BP New Orleans, and now back home with a mysterious package strapped to the undercarriage of his truck; Stacey Moore, a doctoral candidate reluctantly confronting her family and the mother of her best friend and first love, whose disappearance spurs the mystery at the heart of the novel; Dan Eaton, a shy veteran of three tours in Iraq, home for a dinner date with the high school sweetheart he’s tried desperately to forget; and the beautiful, fragile Tina Ross, whose rendezvous with the washed-up captain of the football team triggers the novel’s shocking climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of a single evening, &lt;i&gt;Ohio &lt;/i&gt;toggles between the perspectives of these unforgettable characters as they unearth dark secrets, revisit old regrets and uncover—and compound—bitter betrayals. Before the evening is through, these narratives converge masterfully to reveal a mystery so dark and shocking it will take your breath away.</description>

  <description>Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is not the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.</description>

  <description>Around the world, populist movements are gaining traction among the white working class. Meanwhile, the professional elite—journalists, managers, and establishment politicians—is on the outside looking in, and left to argue over the reasons why. In &lt;i&gt;White Working Class&lt;/i&gt;, Joan C. Williams, described as “something approaching rock star status” in her field by the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, explains why so much of the elite’s analysis of the white working class is misguided, rooted in assumptions by what she has controversially coined “class cluelessness.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Williams explains how most analysts, and the corresponding media coverage, have conflated “working class” with “poor.” All too often, white working class motivations have been dismissed as simply racism or xenophobia. Williams explains how the term “working class” has been misapplied—it is, in fact, the elusive, purportedly disappearing middle class. This demographic often resents both the poor and the professionals. They don’t, however, tend to resent the truly rich, nor are they particularly bothered by income inequality. Their dream is not to join the upper middle class, with its different culture, but to stay true to their own values in their own communities—just with more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;White Working Class&lt;/i&gt; is a blunt, bracing narrative that sketches a nuanced portrait of millions of people throughout the world who have proven to be a potent political force. For anyone stunned by the rise in populist, nationalist movements, wondering why so many would seemingly vote against their own economic interests or simply feeling like a stranger in their own country, &lt;i&gt;White Working Class&lt;/i&gt; will be a convincing primer on how to connect with a crucial set of workers—and voters.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An explosive play that took critics and audiences by storm, &lt;i&gt;Equus&lt;/i&gt; is Peter Shaffer's exploration of the way modern society has destroyed our ability to feel passion. Alan Strang is a disturbed youth whose dangerous obsession with horses leads him to commit an unspeakable act of violence. As psychiatrist Martin Dysart struggles to understand the motivation for Alan's brutality, he is increasingly drawn into Alan's web and eventually forced to question his own sanity. &lt;i&gt;Equus&lt;/i&gt; is a timeless classic and a cornerstone of contemporary drama that delves into the darkest recesses of human existence.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The shocking true story of an American dream that turned into a nightmare beyond imagining...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In December 1975, the Lutz family moved into their new home on suburban Long Island. George and Kathleen Lutz knew that one year earlier, Ronald DeFeo had murdered his parents, brothers, and sisters in the house, but the property - complete with boathouse and swimming pool - and the price had been too good to pass up. Twenty-eight days later, the entire Lutz family fled in terror...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the spellbinding, bestselling true story that gripped the nation - the story of a house possessed by spirits, haunted by psychic phenomena too terrible to describe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Appalachian author and activist Harry Caudill published the first edition of his landmark bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Night Comes to the Cumberlands&lt;/i&gt;, in 1963 — fifty years ago this year. He dedicated the book, "With affection and respect to my wife, Anne, without whose assistance and insistence it would never have been written and to the Kentucky coalminers whose trials and tragedies are its central theme."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Frye first met Harry Caudill in 1945. She was a student at the University of Kentucky at that time, and Harry had just returned to UK after being wounded in World War II. After a brief courtship, they became engaged, then married in 1946. It was a perfect match and, as history has proven, a perfect partnership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Caudills moved to Whitesburg, Kentucky — Harry's hometown — Harry practiced law and, with Anne's assistance, wrote 10 books. Night Comes to the Cumberlands attracted world-wide attention when it was published. Thousands of visitors, including government officials, journalists, members of the media, historians, volunteers and curious individuals from all over the world traveled to Appalachia to see what "night" had wrought. Many of those visitors actually stayed in the Caudills' home — and while they were there, they swapped stories with their hosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry was a renowned storyteller, and so is Anne. In this heartwarming memoir, &lt;i&gt;The Caudills of the Cumberlands: Anne's Story of Life with Harry, Anne Caudill&lt;/i&gt; — at age 89 — tells author Terry Cummins fascinating and incredible stories from her life with Harry in Appalachia. She recalls historic visits by famous people, memorable moments with family and friends, and shares captivating accounts of regional legends and lore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, this delightful collection of Anne's personal recollections reveals the depth of the relationship she shared with Harry, her partner in love and in life for nearly 44 years: "I never remember a day that Harry didn't kiss me and tell me he loved me."</description>

  <description>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank's diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit's indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne's entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</description>

  <description>Race. You know it at a glance: he's black; she's white. They're Asian; we're Latino. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Racism. I'm better; she's worse. Those people do those kinds of things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We all know it's wrong to make these judgments, but they come faster than thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why? Where did those feelings come from? Why are they so powerful? Why have millions been enslaved, murdered, denied their rights because of the color of their skin, the shape of their eyes? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Acclaimed young-adult historian Marc Aronson tackles these and other questions in this astounding book, which traces the history of racial prejudice in Western culture back to ancient Sumer and beyond. He shows us Greeks dividing the world into civilized and barbarian, medieval men writing about the traits of monstrous men, until, finally, Enlightenment scientists scrap all those mythologies and come up with a new one: charts spelling out the traits of human races. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Aronson's journey of discovery yields many surprising discoveries. For instance, throughout most of human history, slavery had nothing to do with race. In fact, the idea of race itself did not exist in the West before the 1600s. But once the idea was established and backed up by "scientific" theory, its influence grew with devastating consequences, from the appalling lynchings in the American South to the catastrophe known as the Holocaust in Europe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With one hundred images, this is a dynamic, thought-provoking work-history as quest, written as only Marc Aronson could do it.</description>

  <description>Have you ever met a truly good person? A person who cannot only, "Talk the talk" but, "Walk the walk?" I.D. Back was such a person. Born poor in the mountains of Southeastern Kentucky, he never accumulated wealth and material riches in life. He did, however, through his willingness to be used by the Lord in any way that He saw fitting, live to become one of the most influential ministers in Kentucky. This book documents the events of his life - from his childhood days spent under the eyes of a watchful, Christian mother- to his sinful days of youth, when he engaged in drinking and mocking the very preachers who he would one day preach alongside - to his acquisition of salvation and his travels as an Old Regular Baptist minister. With anecdotes that are both humorous and touching, this book is sure to bring tears of emotion (both happy and sad), to the reader.</description>

  <description>Sigrid Núñez was an aspiring writer when she first met Susan Sontag, already a legendary figure known for her polemical essays, blinding intelligence, and edgy personal style. Sontag introduced Núñez to her son, the writer David Rieff, and the two began dating. Soon Núñez moved into the apartment that Rieff and Sontag shared. As Sontag told Núñez, “Who says we have to live like everyone else?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sontag’s influence on Núñez, who went on to become a successful novelist, would be profound. Described by Núñez as “a natural mentor,” who saw educating others as both a moral obligation and a source of endless pleasure, Sontag inevitably infected those around her with her many cultural and intellectual passions. In this poignant, intimate memoir, Núñez speaks of her gratitude for having had, as an early model, “someone who held such an exalted, unironic view of the writer’s vocation.” For Sontag, she writes, “there could be no nobler pursuit, no greater adventure, no more rewarding quest.” Núñez gives a sharp sense of the charged, polarizing atmosphere that enveloped Sontag whenever she published a book, gave a lecture, or simply walked into a room. Published more than six years after Sontag’s death, &lt;em&gt;Sempre Susan&lt;/em&gt; is a startlingly truthful portrait of this outsized personality, who made being an intellectual a glamorous occupation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The literary event of Halloween: a book of otherworldly power from Russia's preeminent contemporary fiction writer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanishings and apparitions, nightmares and twists of fate, mysterious ailments and supernatural interventions haunt these stories by the Russian master Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, heir to the spellbinding tradition of Gogol and Poe. Blending the miraculous with the macabre, and leavened by a mischievous gallows humor, these bewitching tales are like nothing being written in Russia-or anywhere else in the world-today.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sisterhood is forever…whether you like it or not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prep&lt;/i&gt; meets&lt;i&gt; Girls in White Dresses&lt;/i&gt; in Genevieve Sly Crane’s deliciously addictive, voyeuristic exploration of female friendship and coming of age that will appeal to anyone who has ever been curious about what happens in a sorority house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twinsets and pearls, secrets and kinship, rituals that hold sisters together in a sacred bond of everlasting trust. Certain chaste images spring to mind when one thinks of sororities. But make no mistake: these women are not braiding each other’s hair and having pillow fights—not by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Genevieve Sly Crane has conjured in these pages is a blunt, in your face look behind the closed doors of a house full of contemporary women—and there are no holds barred. These women have issues: self-inflicted, family inflicted, sister-to-sister inflicted—and it is all on the page. At the center of this swirl is Margot: the sister who died in the house, and each chapter is told from the points of view of the women who orbit her death and have their own reactions to it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a keen sense of character and elegant, observant prose, Crane details the undercurrents of tension in a world where perfection comes at a cost and the best things in life are painful—if not impossible—to acquire: Beauty. A mother’s love. And friendship… or at least the appearance of it. Woven throughout are glimmers of the classical myths that undercut the lives of women in Greek life. After all, the Greek goddesses did cause their fair share of destruction.</description>

  <description>With her disarming, intimate, completely accessible voice, and dry sense of humor, Nora Ephron shares with us her ups and downs in &lt;i&gt;I Feel Bad About My Neck, &lt;/i&gt; a candid, hilarious look at women who are getting older and dealing with the tribulations of maintenance, menopause, empty nests, and life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman who brought us &lt;i&gt;When Harry Met Sally . . ., Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Bewitched, &lt;/i&gt; and the author of best sellers &lt;i&gt;Heartburn, Scribble Scribble, &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Crazy Salad, &lt;/i&gt; discusses everything--from how much she hates her purse to how much time she spends attempting to stop the clock: the hair dye, the treadmill, the lotions and creams that promise to slow the aging process but never do. Oh, and she can't stand the way her neck looks. But her dermatologist tells her there's no quick fix for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ephron chronicles her life as an obsessed cook, passionate city dweller, and hapless parent. She recounts her anything-but-glamorous days as a White House intern during the JFK years ("I am probably the only young woman who ever worked in the Kennedy White House that the President did not make a pass at") and shares how she fell in and out of love with Bill Clinton--from a distance, of course. But mostly she speaks frankly and uproariously about life as a woman of a certain age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utterly courageous, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly moving in its truth telling, &lt;i&gt;I Feel Bad About My Neck&lt;/i&gt; is a book of wisdom, advice, and laugh-out-loud moments, a scrumptious, irresistible treat.</description>

  <description>Like the one-time bestseller &lt;i&gt;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/i&gt; presents a simple fable, based on simple truths and places it in a highly unique situation. And though we may sniff a bestselling formula, it is certainly not a new one: even the ancient tribal storytellers knew that this is the most successful method of entertaining an audience while slipping in a lesson or two. Brazilian storyteller Paulo Coehlo introduces Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. And so he's off: leaving Spain to literally follow his dream. &lt;p&gt; Along the way he meets many spiritual messengers, who come in unassuming forms such as a camel driver and a well-read Englishman. In one of the Englishman's books, Santiago first learns about the alchemists--men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the "Soul of the World." Of course he does eventually meet an alchemist, and the ensuing student-teacher relationship clarifies much of the boy's misguided agenda, while also emboldening him to stay true to his dreams. "My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer," the boy confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself," the alchemist replies. "And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity." &lt;i&gt;--Gail Hudson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Amarillo Slim Preston has won $300,000 from Willie Neslon playing dominoes and $2 million from Larry Flynt playing poker. He has shuffled, dealt, and bluffed with some of twentieth-century's most famous figures. He beat Minnesota Fats at pool with a broom, Bobby Riggs at table tennis with a skillet, and Evel Knievel at golf with a carpenter's hammer. Amarillo Slim has gambled with 'em all, and left most of them wishing they hadn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The memoirs of a living American icon, Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People is the story of life as a Texas road gambler and the discovery of the Wild West. It's also the story of how Slim won the World Series of Poker at Binion's Horseshoe, became a worldwide celebrity, and brought poker from smoky backrooms to mainstream America. Just let him tell it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If there's anything I'll argue about, I'll either bet on it or shut up. And since it's not very becoming for a cowboy to be arguing, I've made a few wagers in my day. But in my humble opinion, I'm no ordinary hustler. You see, neighbor, I never go looking for a sucker. I look for a champion and make a sucker out of him ..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I'm fixing to tell you a few things that I've been keeping to myself for a lot of years. If you're not careful, you just might learn how to get rich without ever having a job."</description>

  <description>In 2016, headlines declared Appalachia ground zero for America’s “forgotten tribe” of white working class voters. Journalists flocked to the region to extract sympathetic profiles of families devastated by poverty, abandoned by establishment politics, and eager to consume cheap campaign promises. &lt;i&gt;What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia&lt;/i&gt; is a frank assessment of America’s recent fascination with the people and problems of the region. The book analyzes trends in contemporary writing on Appalachia, presents a brief history of Appalachia with an eye toward unpacking Appalachian stereotypes, and provides examples of writing, art, and policy created &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; Appalachians as opposed to &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; Appalachians. The book offers a must-needed insider’s perspective on the region.</description>

  <description>To serial slayer Andrew Compton, murder is an art, &lt;i&gt;the most intimate art&lt;/i&gt;. After feigning his own death to escape from prison, Compton makes his way to the United States with the sole ambition of bringing his "art" to new heights. Tortured by his own perverse desires, and drawn to possess and destroy young boys, Compton inadvertently joins forces with Jay Byrne, a dissolute playboy who has pushed his "art" to limits even Compton hadn't previously imagined. Together, Compton and Byrne set their sights on an exquisite young Vietnamese-American runaway, Tran, whom they deem to be the perfect victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swiftly moving from the grimy streets of London's Piccadilly Circus to the decadence of the New Orleans French Quarter, and punctuated by rants from radio talk show host Lush Rimbaud, a.k.a. Luke Ransom, Tran's ex-lover, who is dying of AIDS and who intends to wreak ultimate havoc before leaving this world, &lt;i&gt;Exquisite Corpse&lt;/i&gt; unfolds into a labyrinth of murder and love. Ultimately all four characters converge on a singular bloody night after which their lives will be irrevocably changed — or terminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Z. Brite dissects the landscape of torture and invites us into the mind of a killer. &lt;i&gt;Exquisite Corpse&lt;/i&gt; confirms Brite as a writer who defies categorization. It is a novel for those who dare trespass where the sacred and profane become one.</description>

  <description>Few novels have had more influence on individuals and literary culture than J.D. Salinger’s &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt;. Published in 1951 and intended by Salinger for adults (early drafts were published in the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Colliers&lt;/i&gt;), the novel quickly became championed by youth who identified with the awkwardness and alienation of the novel’s protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Since then the book and its reclusive author have been fixtures of both popular and literary culture. &lt;i&gt;Catcher&lt;/i&gt; is perhaps the only modern novel that is revered equally by the countless Americans whom Holden Caulfield helped through high school and puberty and literary critics (such as the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;’s Adam Gopnik who insisted as recently as 2010 that &lt;i&gt;Catcher&lt;/i&gt; is a "perfect" twentieth-century novel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One premise of &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye and Philosophy&lt;/i&gt; is that the ease and sincerity with which readers identify with Holden Caulfield rests on Salinger’s attention to the nuances and qualities of experience in the modern world. Coupled with Salinger’s deft subjective, first-person style, Holden comes to seem more real than any fictional character should. This and other paradoxes raised by the novel are treated by authors who find answers in philosophy, particularly in twentieth-century phenomenology and existentialism--areas of philosophy that share Salinger’s attention to lived, as opposed to theorized, experience. Holden’s preoccupation with “phonies,” along with his constant striving to interpret and judge the motives and beliefs of those around him, also taps into contemporary interest in philosophical theories of justice and Harry Frankfurt’s recently celebrated analysis of "bullshit."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per Salinger’s request, &lt;i&gt;Catcher&lt;/i&gt; has never been made into a movie. One measure of the devotion and fanatical interest &lt;i&gt;Catcher&lt;/i&gt; continues to inspire, however, is speculation in blogs and magazines about whether movie rights may become available in the wake of Salinger’s death in 2010. These articles remain purely hypothetical, but the questions they inspire--Who would direct? And, especially, Who would star as Holden Caulfield?--are as vivid and real as Holden himself.</description>

  <description>Great fairy tales are not always stories designed for children. The lurking wolf in &lt;i&gt;Little Red Riding Hood,&lt;/i&gt; the gingerbread house that lures Hansel and Gretel, the beauty asleep in her castle—these fables represent some of our deepest, most primeval fears and satisfy our longing for good to win out over evil (preferably in the most gruesome way possible). In this captivating new collection, critically acclaimed author Jean Thompson takes the classic fairy tale and brings it into the modern age with stories that capture the magic and horror in everyday life. The downtrodden prevail, appearances deceive, and humility and virtue triumph in &lt;i&gt;The Witch&lt;/i&gt;, as lost children try to find their way home, adults cursed by past unspeakable acts are fated to experience their own horror in the present, and true love—or is it enchantment?—conquers all. &lt;i&gt;The Witch and Other Tales Re-Told&lt;/i&gt; is a haunting and deeply entertaining collection, showcasing the inimitable Thompson at the height of her storytelling prowess.</description>

  <description>"We were eight years in power" was the lament of Reconstruction-era black politicians as the American experiment in multiracial democracy ended with the return of white supremacist rule in the South. Now Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America's "first white president."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period--and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation's old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective--the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Were Eight Years in Power &lt;/i&gt;features Coates's iconic essays first published in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic, &lt;/i&gt; including &lt;i&gt;Fear of a Black President, The Case for Reparations&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration&lt;/i&gt;, along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates's own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era. &lt;i&gt;We Were Eight Years in Power&lt;/i&gt; is a vital account of modern America, from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>What does everyone in the modern world need to know? Renowned psychologist Jordan B. Peterson's answer to this most difficult of questions uniquely combines the hard-won truths of ancient tradition with the stunning revelations of cutting-edge scientific research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humorous, surprising, and informative, Dr. Peterson tells us why skateboarding boys and girls must be left alone, what terrible fate awaits those who criticize too easily, and why you should always pet a cat when you meet one on the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the nervous system of the lowly lobster have to tell us about standing up straight (with our shoulders back) and about success in life? Why did ancient Egyptians worship the capacity to pay careful attention as the highest of gods? What dreadful paths do people tread when they become resentful, arrogant, and vengeful? Dr. Peterson journeys broadly, discussing discipline, freedom, adventure, and responsibility, distilling the world's wisdom into 12 practical and profound rules for life. 12 Rules for Life shatters the modern commonplaces of science, faith, and human nature while transforming and ennobling the mind and spirit of its listeners.</description>

  <description>In the bizarre world of Franz Kafka, salesmen turn into giant bugs, apes give lectures at college academies, and nightmares probe the mysteries of modern humanity’s unhappiness. More than any other modern writer in world literature, Kafka captures the loneliness and misery that fill the lives of 20th-century humanity. The Metamorphosis and Other Stories reveals the author’s extraordinary talent in a variety of forms—prose poems, short stories, sketches, allegories, and novelettes—and showcases the straight–faced humor, startling psychological insight, and haunting imagination for which he is revered as a modern master. In this brilliant new translation, prize–winning translator Joachim Neugroschel preserves the delicate balance, rich timbre, and wondrous language of Kafka’s original works. In addition to "The Metamorphosis", this collection includes "Early Stories", "Contemplation", "The Judgement", "The Stoker", "In the Penal Colony", and "A Country Doctor".</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Hole&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alice in Chains&lt;/i&gt; are the names that come to mind when we talk about grunge. But never before has there been a complete history of grunge with razor-sharp critical analysis--until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grunge, a style of music that wed classic rock riffs with punk ethos, was the musical movement that defined the 90's and left an indelible mark on the music scene at large. But how did this musical phenomenon emerge from the Seattle underground to become a universal beacon of despair for millions of restless kids around the globe, and why did it resonate with so many disenchanted outsiders?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle Anderson answers these questions and more, examining the connection between grunge and punk, how Kurt Cobain's disdain for Axl Rose propelled Nirvana to instant success, the singer who officially killed off grunge with his trite lyrics and pseudo-grunge attitude and the band the ripped off Pearl Jam, made millions of dollars by selling out to the media and went on to become the most hated band ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Accidental Revolution&lt;/i&gt; is an essential guide to the triumphs and defeats of a musical revolution and its unforgettable icons.</description>

  <description>Celeste Price is an eighth-grade English teacher in suburban Tampa. She is attractive. She drives a red Corvette. Her husband, Ford, is rich, square-jawed and devoted to her. But Celeste has a secret. She has a singular sexual obsession - fourteen-year-old boys. It is a craving she pursues with sociopathic meticulousness and forethought.&lt;br /&gt;Within weeks of her first term at a new school, Celeste has lured the charmingly modest Jack Patrick into her web - car rides after dark, rendezvous at Jack's house while his single father works the late shift, and body-slamming encounters in Celeste's empty classroom between periods. It is bliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste must constantly confront the forces threatening their affair - the perpetual risk of exposure, Jack's father's own attraction to her, and the ticking clock as Jack leaves innocent boyhood behind. But the insatiable Celeste is remorseless. She deceives everyone, is close to no one and cares little for anything but her pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With crackling, stampeding, rampantly sexualized prose, &lt;i&gt;Tampa&lt;/i&gt; is a grand, satirical, serio-comic examination of desire and a scorching literary debut.</description>

  <description>In these four plays, Jean-Paul Sartre, the great existentialist novelist and philosopher, displays his mastery of drama. NO EXIT is an unforgettable portrayal of hell. THE FLIES is a modern reworking of the Electra-Orestes story. DIRTY HANDS is about a young intellectual torn between theory and praxis. THE RESPECTFUL PROSTITUTE is an attack on American racism.</description>

  <description>He has hunted some of the most notorious and sadistic criminals of our time: The Trailside Killer in San Francisco, the Atlanta Child murderer. He has confronted, interviewed and researched dozens of serial killers and assassins, including Charles Manson, Richard Speck, John Wayne Gacy, and James Earl Ray - for a landmark study to understand their motives. To get inside their minds. He is Special Agent John Douglas, the model for law enforcement legend Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris's thrillers &lt;i&gt;Red Dragon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt;, and the man who ushered in a new age in behavorial science and criminal profiling. Recently retired after twenty-five years of service, John Douglas can finally tell his unique and compelling story.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/i&gt;: a searingly honest memoir of food, weight, self-image, and learning how to feed your hunger while taking care of yourself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe. I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her phenomenally popular essays and long-running Tumblr blog, Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and body, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as “wildly undisciplined,” Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she explores her own past—including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life—and brings readers along on her journey to understand and ultimately save herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and power that have made her one of the most admired writers of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to learn to take care of yourself: how to feed your hungers for delicious and satisfying food, a smaller and safer body, and a body that can love and be loved—in a time when the bigger you are, the smaller your world becomes.</description>

  <description>Milo has become the most dangerous man in America by voicing truths too politically incorrect for the establishment and defending those whose free speech has been trampled not only across the country, but around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like his heroes Skeletor, Darth Vader and Joan Rivers, Milo will say anything about anyone, and he doesn't care who gets triggered by the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milo is an award-winning journalist, the hottest ticket in any town his tour stops in, and the ultimate voice for people of all ages that are proud to be a part of out glorious western civilization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dangerous&lt;/i&gt; is the first book written by Milo Yiannopoulos, and is the first of many bestsellers he will release on the Dangerous Books imprint.</description>

  <description>Innocence is lost to unforgettable experience in these brilliant stories by E. L. Doctorow, as full of mystery and meaning as any of the longer works by this American master. In “The Writer in the Family,” a young man learns the difference between lying and literature after he is induced into deceiving a relative through letters. In “Wili,” an early-twentieth-century idyll is destroyed by infidelity. In “The Foreign Legation,” a girl and an act of political anarchy collide with devastating results. These and other stories flow into the novella “Lives of the Poets,” in which the images and themes of the earlier stories become part of the narrator’s unsparing confessions about his own mind, offering a rare look at the creative process and its connection to the heart.</description>

  <description>Like Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, Isak Dinesen and Angela Carter, A. S. Byatt knows that fairy tales are for grownups. And in this ravishing collection she breathes new life into the form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Little Black Book of Stories&lt;/b&gt; offers shivers along with magical thrills. Leaves rustle underfoot in a dark wood:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;two middle-aged women, childhood friends reunited by chance, venture into a dark forest where once, many years before, they saw–or thought they saw–something unspeakable. Another woman, recently bereaved, finds herself slowly but surely turning into stone. A coolly rational ob-gyn has his world pushed off-axis by a waiflike art student with her own ideas about the uses of the body. Spellbinding, witty, lovely, terrifying, the &lt;b&gt;Little Black Book of Stories&lt;/b&gt; is Byatt at the height of her craft.</description>

It begins with the opening line, “There were once two little girls who saw, or believed they saw, a thing in the forest,” Byatt knows how to begin a story, and it involves confronting the unconscious which has come to life as a monster.

  <description>In the Deep South of the 1950s, journalist &lt;i&gt;John Howard Griffin&lt;/i&gt; decided to cross the color line. Using medication that darkened his skin to deep brown, he exchanged his privileged life as a Southern white man for the disenfranchised world of an unemployed black man. His audacious, still chillingly relevant eyewitness history is a work about race and humanity-that in this new millennium still has something important to say to every American.</description>

  <description>What if you were told that you could make a fortune just by pushing a button on a box? But pressing this button will simultaneously cause the death of another human being somewhere in the world . . . someone you don't know. Would you still push the button?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Button, Button," Richard Matheson's chilling tale of greed and temptation, is now the basis of &lt;i&gt;The Box&lt;/i&gt;, the new film from the director of &lt;i&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, this outstanding collection also contains many other unforgettable stories by Matheson, the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;I Am Legend&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;What Dreams May Come&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The inventive plots and spare but convincing portraits of ordinary men and women caught up in forces beyond their control demonstrate why Stephen King has called Matheson his most significant influence."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;--Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Set in Paris and attracting comparisons with Franz Kafka and Edgar Allan Poe, &lt;i&gt;The Pigeon&lt;/i&gt; is Patrick Süskind's tense, disturbing follow-up to the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Perfume. &lt;/i&gt;The novella tells the story of a day in the meticulously ordered life of bank security guard Jonathan Noel, who has been hiding from life since his wife left him for her Tunisian lover. When Jonathan opens his front door on a day he believes will be just like any other, he encounters not the desired empty hallway but an unwelcome, diabolical intruder . . .</description>

  <description>For most of us, that perfect retort or witty reply often escapes us when we need it most, only to come to mind with perfect clarity when it's too late to be useful. The twentieth-century writer Heywood Broun described this all-too-common phenomenon when he wrote "Repartee is what we wish we'd said."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Viva la Repartee&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Mardy Grothe, author of &lt;em&gt;Oxymoronica&lt;/em&gt;, has lovingly assembled a collection of masterfully composed -- and perfectly timed -- replies that have turned the tables on opponents and adversaries. This delightful volume is a celebration of the most impressive retorts, ripostes, rejoinders, comebacks, quips, ad-libs, bon mots, off-the-cuff comments, wisecracks, and other clever remarks ever to come out of the mouths -- and from the pens -- of people throughout history. Touching on all areas of human endeavor, including politics, the arts, literature, sports, relationships, and even the risqué, the book features contributions from Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Dorothy Parker, Mae West, Groucho Marx, Winston Churchill, Dolly Parton, and scores more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As entertaining as it is intellectually enriching, &lt;em&gt;Viva la Repartee&lt;/em&gt; is sure to capture the attention of language lovers and is the perfect antidote for anyone who's ever thought I wish I'd said that!</description>

  <description>Through extensive research and interviews with five notorious serial killers, author Joel Norris demonstrates that serial killers have specific biological and genetic makeups that can be identified as early as five years of age.  A compelling read for both the curious layman and the concerned professional.</description>

  <description>For centuries scientists have written off cannibalism as a bizarre phenomenon with little biological significance. Its presence in nature was dismissed as a desperate response to starvation or other life-threatening circumstances, and few spent time studying it. A taboo subject in our culture, the behavior was portrayed mostly through horror movies or tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life flesh-eaters. But the true nature of cannibalism--the role it plays in evolution as well as human history--is even more intriguing (and more normal) than the misconceptions we've come to accept as fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;zoologist Bill Schutt sets the record straight, debunking common myths and investigating our new understanding of cannibalism's role in biology, anthropology, and history in the most fascinating account yet written on this complex topic. Schutt takes readers from Arizona's Chiricahua Mountains, where he wades through ponds full of tadpoles devouring their siblings, to the Sierra Nevadas, where he joins researchers who are shedding new light on what happened to the Donner Party--the most infamous episode of cannibalism in American history. He even meets with an expert on the preparation and consumption of human placenta (and, yes, it goes well with Chianti).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bringing together the latest cutting-edge science, Schutt answers questions such as why some amphibians consume their mother's skin; why certain insects bite the heads off their partners after sex; why, up until the end of the twentieth century, Europeans regularly ate human body parts as medical curatives; and how cannibalism might be linked to the extinction of the Neanderthals. He takes us into the future as well, investigating whether, as climate change causes famine, disease, and overcrowding, we may see more outbreaks of cannibalism in many more species--including our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cannibalism &lt;/i&gt;places a perfectly natural occurrence into a vital new context and invites us to explore why it both enthralls and repels us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY&lt;/b&gt; is widely regarded as the most influential thinker of our time, but never before has he devoted a major book to one topic, income inequality: &lt;br /&gt;-During the Great Depression, things were much worse than they are today, but there was an expectation that things were going to get better. There was a real sense of hopefulness. There isn't today. . . . Inequality is really unprecedented. In terms of total inequality, it's like the worst periods in American history. But if you refine it more closely, the inequality comes from the extreme wealth in a tiny sector of the population, a fraction of 1 percent. . . . Not only is it extremely unjust in itself, inequality has highly negative consequences on the society as a whole because the very fact of inequality has a corrosive, harmful effect on democracy.- --&lt;b&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY&lt;/b&gt;, in &lt;i&gt;Requiem for the American Dream&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Requiem for the American Dream&lt;/i&gt; is not an essay collection but an entire work of some 70,000 words based on four years of interviews with Chomsky by the editors. Chomsky considers these to be his final, long-form documentary interviews. It is a book that makes Chomsky's breadth and depth accessible, and at the same gives us his most powerful political ideas with unprecedented, breathtaking directness. It will go down as one of his greatest and most lasting contributions. &lt;i&gt;Requiem for the American Dream&lt;/i&gt; is being produced in tandem with the film of the same name that was recently released in selected theaters to rave reviews and standing ovations and will be on Netflix and touring colleges prior to the book's release.</description>

  <description>Cain's first novel - the subject of an obscenity trial in Boston and the inspiration for Camus's &lt;i&gt;The Stranger&lt;/i&gt; - is the fever-pitched tale of a drifter who stumbles into a job, into an erotic obsession, and into a murder.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The Philosopher at the End of the Universe&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (second edition: &lt;i&gt;Sci-Phi&lt;/i&gt;) demonstrates how anyone can grasp the basic concepts of philosophy while still holding a bucket of popcorn. Mark Rowlands makes philosophy utterly relevant to our everyday lives and reveals its most potent messages using nothing more than a little humor and the plotlines of some of the most spectacular, expensive, high-octane films on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn about: The Nature of Reality from &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;, Good and Evil from &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;, Morality from &lt;i&gt;Aliens&lt;/i&gt;, Personal identity from &lt;i&gt;Total Recall&lt;/i&gt;, The Mind-Body dilemma from &lt;i&gt;Terminator&lt;/i&gt;, Free Will from &lt;i&gt;Minority Report&lt;/i&gt;, Death and the Meaning of Life from &lt;i&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/i&gt;, and much more. A search for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us with a star-studded cast that includes: Tom Cruise, Plato, Harrison Ford, Immanuel Kant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigourney Weaver, Rene Descartes, and Keanu Reeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowlands anchors his discussions in easily understood everyday terms and relates them in a manner easy to identify with interspersed with a ready joke or two, he wonderfully explains why those SciFi movies we love so much are much deeper than they appear to be on the surface. Mark Rowlands's entertaining and stimulating guide is perfect for anyone searching for knowledge of the world around us. If Keanu can understand Descartes surely everyone can.</description>

  <description>Culture maverick Jim Goad presents a thoroughly reasoned, darkly funny, and rampagingly angry defense of America's most maligned social group -- the cultural clan variously referred to as rednecks, hillbillies, white trash, crackers, and trailer trash. As &lt;i&gt;The Redneck Manifesto&lt;/i&gt; boldly points out and brilliantly demonstrates, America's dirty little secret isn't racism but classism. While pouncing incessantly on racial themes, most major media are silent about America's widening class rifts, a problem that negatively affects more people of all colors than does racism. With an unmatched ability for rubbing salt in cultural wounds, Jim Goad deftly dismantles most popular American notions about race and culture and takes a sledgehammer to our delicate glass-blown popular conceptions of government, religion, media, and history.</description>

  <description>Only Georges Bataille could write, of an eyeball removed from a corpse, that "the caress of the eye over the skin is so utterly, so extraordinarily gentle, and the sensation is so bizarre that it has something of a rooster's horrible crowing." Bataille has been called a "metaphysician of evil," specializing in blasphemy, profanation, and horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Story of the Eye&lt;/i&gt;, written in 1928, is his best-known work; it is unashamedly surrealistic, both disgusting and fascinating, and packed with seemingly endless violations. It's something of an underground classic, rediscovered by each new generation. Most recently, the Icelandic pop singer Björk Guðdmundsdóttir cites &lt;i&gt;Story of the Eye&lt;/i&gt; as a major inspiration: she made a music video that alludes to Bataille's erotic uses of eggs, and she plans to read an excerpt for an album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: &lt;i&gt;Story of the Eye&lt;/i&gt; is graphically sexual, and is only suited for adults who are not easily offended.</description>

  <description>The first look at the philosophy behind Stephenie Meyer's bestselling &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; series Bella and Edward, and their family and friends, have faced countless dangers and philosophical dilemmas in Stephenie Meyer's &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; novels. This book is the first to explore them, drawing on the wisdom of philosophical heavyweights to answer essential questions such as: What do the struggles of "vegetarian" vampires who control their biological urge for human blood say about free will? Are vampires morally absolved if they kill only animals and not people? From a feminist perspective, is Edward a romantic hero or is he just a stalker? Is Jacob "better" for Bella than Edward? As absorbing as the Meyer novels themselves, &lt;i&gt;Twilight and Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;: Gives you a new perspective on &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; characters, storylines, and themes&lt;br /&gt;Helps you gain fresh insights into the &lt;i&gt;Twilight &lt;/i&gt;novels and movies&lt;br /&gt;Features an irresistible combination of vampires, romance, and philosophy &lt;i&gt;Twilight and Philosophy&lt;/i&gt; is a must-have companion for every &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; fan, whether you're new to the series or have followed it since the beginning.</description>

  <description>The perceived breakdown of civility has in recent years become a national obsession, and our modern climate of boorishness has cultivated a host of etiquette watchdogs, like Miss Manners and Martha Stewart, who defend us against an onslaught of nastiness. Touching on aspects of both our public and private lives, including work, family, and sex, literary and social critic Mark Caldwell examines how the rules of behavior inevitably change and explains why, no matter how hard we try, we can never return to a golden era of civilized manners and mores.</description>

  <description>Billions of dollars have been hastily poured into the global banking system in a frantic attempt at financial stabilization. So why has it not been possible to bring the same forces to bear in addressing world poverty and environmental crisis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this take-no-prisoners analysis, Slavoj Žižek frames the moral failures of the modern world in terms of the epoch-making events of the first decade of this century. What he finds is the old one-two punch of history: the jab of tragedy, the right hook of farce. In the attacks of 9/11 and the global credit crunch, liberalism dies twice: as a political doctrine and as an economic theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;First as Tragedy, Then as Farce&lt;/i&gt; is a call for the Left to reinvent itself in the light of our desperate historical situation. The time for liberal, moralistic blackmail is over.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Confessions of a Mask&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Kochan, an adolescent boy tormented by his burgeoning attraction to men: he wants to be “normal.” Kochan is meek-bodied, and unable to participate in the more athletic activities of his classmates. He begins to notice his growing attraction to some of the boys in his class, particularly the pubescent body of his friend Omi. To hide his homosexuality, he courts a woman, Sonoko, but this exacerbates his feelings for men. As news of the War reaches Tokyo, Kochan considers the fate of Japan and his place within its deeply rooted propriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Confessions of a Mask&lt;/i&gt; reflects Mishima’s own coming of age in post-war Japan. Its publication in English―praised by Gore Vidal, James Baldwin, and Christopher Isherwood―propelled the young Yukio Mishima to international fame.</description>

  <description>From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a powerful account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America’s white working class&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis—that of white working-class Americans. The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love,” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance’s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is anyone out there?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ann Burden is sixteen years old and completely alone. The world as she once knew it is gone, ravaged by a nuclear war that has taken everyone from her. For the past year, she has lived in a remote valley with no evidence of any other survivors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But the smoke from a distant campfire shatters Ann's solitude. Someone else is still alive and making his way toward the valley. Who is this man? What does he want? Can he be trusted? Both excited and terrified, Ann soon realizes there may be worse things than being the last person on Earth.</description>

  <description>Prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, Vincent Bugliosi held a unique insider's position in one of the most baffling and horrifying cases of the twentieth century: the cold-blooded Tate-LaBianca murders carried out by Charles Manson and four of his followers. What motivated Manson in his seemingly mindless selection of victims, and what was his hold over the young women who obeyed his orders? Here is the gripping story of this famous and haunting crime. 50 pages of b/w photographs.</description>

It's a lousy room in a lousy part of a lousy town. But Marv doesn't care. There's an angel in the room. She says her name is Goldie. A few hours later, Goldie's dead without a mark on her perfect body, and the cops are coming before anyone but Marv could know she's been killed. Somebody paid good money for this frame . . . With a new look generating more excitement than ever before, this third edition is the perfect way to attract a whole new generation of readers to Frank Miller's masterpiece!</description>

  <description>Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did You Know?---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Landon is the name of his third son?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Nicholas Sparks recorded his own reading for the audio version of the novel?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When Andrew Offutt died, his son, Chris, inherited a desk, a rifle, and eighteen hundred pounds of pornographic fiction. Andrew had been considered the king of twentieth-century smut, with a writing career that began as a strategy to pay for his son's orthodontic needs and soon took on a life of its own, peaking during the 1970s when the commercial popularity of the erotic novel reached its height. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his dutiful wife serving as typist, Andrew wrote from their home in the Kentucky hills, locked away in an office no one dared intrude upon. In this fashion he wrote more than four hundred novels, including pirate porn, ghost porn, zombie porn, and secret agent porn. The more he wrote, the more intense his ambition became and the more difficult it was for his children to be part of his world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the long summer of 2013, Chris returned to his hometown to help his widowed mother move out of his childhood home. As he began to examine his father's manuscripts and memorabilia, journals, and letters, he realized he finally had an opportunity to gain insight into the difficult, mercurial, sometimes cruel man he'd loved and feared in equal measure. Only in his father's absence could he truly make sense of the man and his legacy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Father, the Pornographer&lt;/i&gt;, Offutt takes us on the journey with him, reading his father s prodigious literary output as both a critic and as a son seeking answers. This is a book about the life of a working writer who supports his family solely by the output of his typewriter; it's about the awful psychic burdens one generation unthinkingly passes along to the next; and it's about growing up in the Appalachian hills with a pack of fearless boys riding bicycles through the woods, happy and free."</description>

  <description>In response to &lt;i&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/i&gt;, Sam Harris received thousands of letters from Christians excoriating him for not believing in God. &lt;i&gt;Letter to A Christian Nation&lt;/i&gt; is his reply. Using rational argument, Harris offers a measured refutation of the beliefs that form the core of fundamentalist Christianity. In the course of his argument, he addresses current topics ranging from intelligent design and stem-cell research to the connections between religion and violence. In &lt;i&gt;Letter to a Christian Nation&lt;/i&gt;, Sam Harris boldly challenges the influence that faith has on public life in our nation.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Thank You for Arguing&lt;/i&gt; is your master class in the art of persuasion, taught by professors ranging from Bart Simpson to Winston Churchill. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The time-tested secrets this book discloses include Cicero’s three-step strategy for moving an audience to action—as well as Honest Abe’s Shameless Trick of lowering an audience’s expectations by pretending to be unpolished. But it’s also replete with contemporary techniques such as politicians’ use of “code” language to appeal to specific groups and an eye-opening assortment of popular-culture dodges—including The Yoda Technique, The Belushi Paradigm, and The Eddie Haskell Ploy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you’re an inveterate lover of language books or just want to win a lot more anger-free arguments on the page, at the podium, or over a beer, Thank You for Arguing is for you. Written by one of today’s most popular language mavens, it’s warm, witty, erudite, and truly enlightening. It not only teaches you how to recognize a paralipsis and a chiasmus when you hear them, but also how to wield such handy and persuasive weapons the next time you really, really want to get your own way.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Better Never to Have Been&lt;/i&gt; argues for a number of related, highly provocative, views: (1) Coming into existence is always a serious harm. (2) It is always wrong to have children. (3) It is wrong not to abort fetuses at the earlier stages of gestation. (4) It would be better if, as a result of there being no new people, humanity became extinct. These views may sound unbelievable--but anyone who reads Benatar will be obliged to take them seriously.</description>

  <description>This book presents the kind of eye-opening insights into the history and culture of race for which Sowell has become famous. As late as the 1940s and 1950s, he argues, poor Southern rednecks were regarded by Northern employers and law enforcement officials as lazy, lawless, and sexually immoral. This pattern was repeated by blacks with whom they shared a subculture in the South. Over the last half century poor whites and most blacks have moved up in class and affluence, but the ghetto remains filled with black rednecks. Their attempt to escape, Sowell shows, is hampered by their white liberal friends who turn dysfunctional black redneck culture into a sacrosanct symbol of racial identity. In addition to Black Rednecks and White Liberals, the book takes on subjects ranging from Are Jews Generic? to The Real History of Slavery.</description>

  <description>Bestselling author Chris Mooney uses cutting-edge research to explain the &lt;i&gt;psychology&lt;/i&gt; behind why today's Republicans reject reality—it's just part of who they are. From climate change to evolution, the rejection of mainstream science among Republicans is growing, as is the denial of expert consensus on the economy, American history, foreign policy and much more. Why won't Republicans accept things that most experts agree on? Why are they constantly fighting against the facts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Science writer Chris Mooney explores brain scans, polls, and psychology experiments to explain why conservatives today believe more wrong things; appear &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; likely than Democrats to oppose new ideas and &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; likely to change their beliefs in the face of new facts; and sometimes respond to compelling evidence by doubling down on their current beliefs.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes beyond the standard claims about ignorance or corporate malfeasance to discover the real, scientific reasons why Republicans reject the widely accepted findings of mainstream science, economics, and history—as well as many undeniable policy facts (e.g., there were no “death panels” in the health care bill).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explains that the political parties reflect personality traits and psychological needs—with Republicans more wedded to certainty, Democrats to novelty—and this is the root of our divide over reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by the author of &lt;i&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/i&gt;, which was the first and still the most influential book to look at conservative rejection of scientific evidence. But the rejection of science is just the beginning…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain to spark discussion and debate, &lt;i&gt;The Republican Brain&lt;/i&gt; also promises to add to the lengthy list of persuasive scientific findings that Republicans reject and deny.</description>

  <description>A stranger arrives at the remote village of Viscos, carrying with him a backpack containing a notebook and eleven gold bars. He comes searching for the ans-wer to a question that torments him: Are human beings, in essence, good or evil?

  <description>In the deft hands of Neil Gaiman, magic is no mere illusion . . . and anything is possible. In &lt;i&gt;Smoke and Mirrors&lt;/i&gt;, Gaiman's imagination and supreme artistry transform a mundane world into a place of terrible wonders—where an old woman can purchase the Holy Grail at a thrift store, where assassins advertise their services in the Yellow Pages under "Pest Control," and where a frightened young boy must barter for his life with a mean-spirited troll living beneath a bridge by the railroad tracks. Explore a new reality, obscured by smoke and darkness yet brilliantly tangible, in this extraordinary collection of short works by a master prestidigitator. It will dazzle your senses, touch your heart, and haunt your dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents &lt;br /&gt;ix • Reading the Entrails: A Rondel • (1997) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;1 • An Introduction (Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions) • (1998) • essay by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;33 • Chivalry • (1992) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;48 • Nicholas Was ... • (1990) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;49 • The Price • (1997) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;57 • Troll Bridge • (1993) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman (variant of Troll-Bridge)&lt;br /&gt;69 • Don't Ask Jack • (1995) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;72 • The Goldfish Pool and Other Stories • (1996) • novelette by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;108 • The White Road • (1995) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;120 • Queen of Knives • (1995) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;130 • Changes • (1998) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;141 • The Daughter of Owls • (1997) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman (variant of Daughter of Owls)&lt;br /&gt;144 • Shoggoth's Old Peculiar • (1998) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;156 • Virus • (1990) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;159 • Looking for the Girl • (1985) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;171 • Only the End of the World Again • (1994) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;190 • Bay Wolf • (1998) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;198 • We Can Get Them for You Wholesale • (1989) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;209 • One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock • (1994) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;224 • Cold Colors • (1990) • poem by Neil Gaiman (variant of Cold Colours)&lt;br /&gt;236 • The Sweeper of Dreams • (1996) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;238 • Foreign Parts • (1990) • novelette by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;255 • Vampire Sestina • (1989) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;257 • Mouse • (1993) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman (variant of The Mouse)&lt;br /&gt;267 • The Sea Change • (1995) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;271 • When We Went to See the End of the World by Dawnie Morningside, age 11¼ • (1998) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;278 • Desert Wind • (1998) • poem by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;281 • Tastings • (1998) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;290 • Babycakes • (1990) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;292 • Murder Mysteries • (1992) • novelette by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;325 • Snow, Glass, Apples • (1995) • shortstory by Neil Gaiman</description>

  <description>The dramatic story behind the most audacious power grab in American history&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; The financial crisis that exploded in 2008 isn’t past but prologue. The stunning rise, fall, and rescue of Wall Street in the bubble-and-bailout era was the coming-out party for the network of looters who sit at the nexus of American political and economic power. The grifter class—made up of the largest players in the financial industry and the politicians who do their bidding—has been growing in power for a generation, transferring wealth upward through increasingly complex financial mechanisms and political maneuvers. The crisis was only one terrifying manifestation of how they’ve hijacked America’s political and economic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone’&lt;/i&gt;s&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Matt Taibbi here unravels the whole fiendish story, digging beyond the headlines to get into the deeper roots and wider implications of the rise of the grifters. He traces the movement’s origins to the cult of Ayn Rand and her most influential—and possibly weirdest—acolyte, Alan Greenspan, and offers fresh reporting on the backroom deals that decided the winners and losers in the government bailouts. He uncovers the hidden commodities bubble that transferred billions of dollars to Wall Street while creating food shortages around the world, and he shows how finance dominates politics, from the story of investment bankers auctioning off America’s infrastructure to an inside account of the high-stakes battle for health-care reform—a battle the true reformers lost. Finally, he tells the story of Goldman Sachs, the “vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Taibbi has combined deep sources, trailblazing reportage, and provocative analysis to create the most lucid, emotionally galvanizing, and scathingly funny account yet written of the ongoing political and financial crisis in America. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the labyrinthine inner workings of politics and finance in this country, and the profound consequences for us all.</description>

  <description>Injected with new material and special design elements, &lt;em&gt;Invisible Monsters Remix&lt;/em&gt; fulfills Chuck Palahniuk’s original vision for his 1999 novel, turning a daring satire on beauty and the fashion industry into an even more wildly unique reading experience. Palahniuk’s fashion-model protagonist has it all—boyfriend, career, loyal best friend—until an accident destroys her face, her ability to speak, and her self-esteem. Enter Brandy Alexander, Queen Supreme, one operation away from becoming a bona-fide woman. Laced in are new chapters of memoir and further scenes with the book’s characters. Readers will jump between chapters, reread the book to understand the dissolve between fiction and fact, and decipher the playful book design, embarking on a ride they’ll never forget.</description>

  <description>FROM BEGINNING TO END&lt;br /&gt;Why "rituals"?&lt;br /&gt;My thinking was set in motion by those who, knowing I was a parish minister for many years, have asked me for advice about ceremonies and celebrations. They wanted words to use at graduations, funerals, and the welcoming of children. They inquired about grace at family meals, the reaffirmation of wedding vows, and ways to heal wounds suffered in personal conflict. People requested help with the rituals of solitude, such as meditation, prayer, and contemplation. . . .&lt;br /&gt;Rituals do not always involve words, occasions, officials, or an audience. Rituals are often silent, solitary, and self-contained. The most powerful rites of passage are reflective--when you look back on your life again and again, paying attention to the rivers you have crossed and the gates you have opened and walked on through, the thresholds you have passed over.&lt;br /&gt;I see ritual when people sit together silently by an open fire.&lt;br /&gt;Remembering.&lt;br /&gt;As human beings have remembered for thousands and thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;FULGHUM</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed author of the Orange Prize winning &lt;i&gt;Property&lt;/i&gt; comes a fresh twist on the classic Jekyll and Hyde story, a novel told from the perspective of Mary Reilly, Dr. Jekyll's dutiful and intelligent housemaid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faithfully weaving in details from Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Martin introduces an original and captivating character: Mary is a survivor-scarred but still strong-familiar with evil, yet brimming with devotion and love. As a bond grows between Mary and her tortured employer, she is sent on errands to unsavory districts of London and entrusted with secrets she would rather not know. Unable to confront her hideous suspicions about Dr. Jekyll, Mary ultimately proves the lengths to which she'll go to protect him. Through her astute reflections, we hear the rest of the classic Jekyll and Hyde story, and this familiar tale is made more terrifying than we remember it, more complex than we imagined possible.</description>

  <description>Isserley picks up hitchhikers with big muscles. She, herself, is tiny-like a kid peering up over the steering wheel. She has a remarkable face and wears the thickest corrective lenses anyone has ever seen. Her posture is suggestive of some spinal problem. Her breasts are perfect; perhaps implants. She is strangely erotic yet somehow grotesque, vulnerable yet threatening. Her hitchhikers are a mixed bunch of men-trailer trash and travelling postgrads, thugs and philosophers. But Isserley is only interested in whether they have families and whether they have muscles. Then, it's only a question of how long she can endure her pain--physical and spiritual--and their conversation. Michel Faber's work has been described as a combination of Roald Dahl and Franz Kafka, as Somerset Maugham shacking up with Ian McEwan. At once humane and horrifying, Under the Skin takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory - our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion.</description>

  <description>"Thacker's discourse on the intersection of horror and philosophy is utterly original and utterly captivating..." Thomas Ligotti, author of The Conspiracy Against the Human Race The world is increasingly unthinkable, a world of planetary disasters, emerging pandemics, and the looming threat of extinction. In this book Eugene Thacker suggests that we look to the genre of horror as offering a way of thinking about the unthinkable world. To confront this idea is to confront the limit of our ability to understand the world in which we live - a central motif of the horror genre. In the Dust of This Planet explores these relationships between philosophy and horror. In Thacker's hands, philosophy is not academic logic-chopping; instead, it is the thought of the limit of all thought, especially as it dovetails into occultism, demonology, and mysticism. Likewise, Thacker takes horror to mean something beyond the focus on gore and scare tactics, but as the under-appreciated genre of supernatural horror in fiction, film, comics, and music.</description>

  <description>Of all the literary forms, the novel is arguably the most discussed . . . and fretted over. From Miguel de Cervantes's &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; to the works of Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and today's masters, the novel has grown with and adapted to changing societies and technologies, mixing tradition and innovation in every age throughout history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas C. Foster—the sage and scholar who ingeniously led readers through the fascinating symbolic codes of great literature in his first book, &lt;em&gt;How to Read Literature Like a Professor&lt;/em&gt;—now examines the grammar of the popular novel. Exploring how authors' choices about structure—point of view, narrative voice, first page, chapter construction, character emblems, and narrative (dis)continuity—create meaning and a special literary language, &lt;em&gt;How to Read Novels Like a Professor&lt;/em&gt; shares the keys to this language with readers who want to get more insight, more understanding, and more pleasure from their reading.</description>

  <description>A Lesson Before Dying is set in a small Cajun community in the late 1940s. Jefferson, a young black man, is an unwitting party to a liquor store shoot out in which three men are killed; the only survivor, he is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Grant Wiggins, who left his hometown for the university, has returned to the plantation school to teach. As he struggles with his decision whether to stay or escape to another state, his aunt and Jefferson's godmother persuade him to visit Jefferson in his cell and impart his learning and his pride to Jefferson before his death. In the end, the two men forge a bond as they both come to understand the simple heroism of resisting and defying the expected. Ernest J. Gaines brings to this novel the same rich sense of place, the same deep understanding of the human psyche, and the same compassion for a people and their struggle that have informed his previous, highly praised works of fiction.</description>

  <description>In Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel's memoir &lt;i&gt;Night&lt;/i&gt;, a scholarly, Orthodox teenager is wracked with guilt at having survived the horror of the Holocaust &amp;amp; the genocidal campaign that consumed his family. His memories of the nightmare worlds of Auschwitz-Birkenau &amp;amp; Buchenwald present him with an intolerable question: how can the god he once so fervently believed in have allowed these monstrous events to occur? There are no easy answers in this harrowing book, which probes life's essential riddles with the lucid anguish only great literature achieves. It marks the crucial first step in Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Yiddish title: Un di Velt Hot Geshvign/And the World Remained Silent&lt;br /&gt;(Buenos Aires, 1955). Revised as La Nuit (1958) &amp;amp; translated as Night (1960).</description>

  <description>From Slapstick's "Turkey Farm" to Slaughterhouse-Five's eternity in a Tralfamadorean zoo cage with Montana Wildhack, the question of the afterlife never left Kurt Vonnegut's mind. In God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian, Vonnegut skips back and forth between life and the Afterlife as if the difference between them were rather slight. In thirty odd "interviews," Vonnegut trips down "the blue tunnel to the pearly gates" in the guise of a roving reporter for public radio, conducting interviews: with Salvatore Biagini, a retired construction worker who died of a heart attack while rescuing his schnauzer from a pit bull, with John Brown, still smoldering 140 years after his death by hanging, with William Shakespeare, who rubs Vonnegut the wrong way, and with socialist and labor leader Eugene Victor Debs, one of Vonnegut's personal heroes.&lt;br /&gt;What began as a series of ninety-second radio interludes for WNYC, New York City's public radio station, evolved into this provocative collection of musings about who and what we live for, and how much it all matters in the end. From the original portrait by his friend Jules Feiffer that graces the cover, to a final entry from Kilgore Trout, God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian remains a joy.</description>

  <description>His fiction is known to be some of the most terrifying in the genre of supernatural horror, but Thomas Ligotti's first nonfiction book may be even scarier. Drawing on philosophy, literature, neuroscience, and other fields of study, Ligotti takes the penetrating lens of his imagination and turns it on his audience, causing them to grapple with the brutal reality that they are living a meaningless nightmare, and anyone who feels otherwise is simply acting out an optimistic fallacy. At once a guidebook to pessimistic thought and a relentless critique of humanity's employment of self-deception to cope with the pervasive suffering of their existence, &lt;i&gt;The Conspiracy against the Human Race&lt;/i&gt; may just convince readers that there is more than a measure of truth in the despairing yet unexpectedly liberating negativity that is widely considered a hallmark of Ligotti's work.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;'&lt;i&gt;night, Mother&lt;/i&gt; is a taut and fluid drama that addresses different emotions and special relations. By one of America's most talented playwrights, this play won the Dramatists Guild's prestigious Hull-Warriner Award, four Tony nominations, the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, and the Pulitzer Prize in 1983. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'night, Mother &lt;/i&gt;had its world premiere at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in December 1982. It opened on Broadway in March 1983, directed by Tom Moore and starring Anne Pitoniak and Kathy Bates; a film, starring Anne Bancroft and Sissy Spacek, was released in 1986.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Just after sunset—call it dusk; call it twilight; it’s a time when human life takes on an unnatural cast, when nothing is quite as it appears, when the imagination begins to reach for shadows as they dissipate to darkness and living daylight can be scared right out of you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who but Stephen King would turn a Port-O-San into a slimy birth canal, or a roadside honky-tonk into a place for endless love? A book salesman with a grievance might pick up a mute hitchhiker, not knowing the silent man in the passenger seat listens altogether too well. Or an exercise routine on a stationary bicycle, begun to reduce bad cholesterol, might take its rider on a captivating—and then terrifying—journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set on a remote key in Florida, “The Gingerbread Girl” is a riveting tale featuring a young woman as vulnerable—and resourceful—as Audrey Hepburn’s character in "Wait Until Dark." In “Ayana,” a blind girl works a miracle with a kiss and the touch of her hand. For King, the line between the living and the dead is often blurry, and the seams that hold our reality intact might tear apart at any moment. In one of the longer stories here, “N.,” which recently broke new ground when it was adapted as a graphic digital entertainment, a psychiatric patient’s irrational thinking might create an apocalyptic threat in the Maine countryside...or keep the world from falling victim to it.</description>

  <description>A loving threesome, they ranged the dark hills and river bottoms of Cherokee country. Old Dan had the brawn.

Glory and victory were coming to them, but sadness waited too. &lt;i&gt;Where the Red Fern Grows&lt;/i&gt; is an exciting tale of love and adventure you'll never forget.</description>

  <description>After thirty years spent scratching together a middle-class life out of a dirt-poor childhood, Joe Bageant moved back to his hometown of Winchester, Virginia, where he realized that his family and neighbors were the very people who carried George W. Bush to victory. That was ironic, because Winchester, like countless American small towns, is fast becoming the bedrock of a permanent underclass. Two in five of the people in his old neighborhood do not have high school diplomas. Nearly everyone over fifty has serious health problems, and many have no health care. Credit ratings are low or nonexistent, and alcohol, overeating, and Jesus are the preferred avenues of escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A raucous mix of storytelling and political commentary, &lt;i&gt;Deer Hunting with Jesus&lt;/i&gt; is Bageant's report on what he learned by coming home. He writes of his childhood friends who work at factory jobs that are constantly on the verge of being outsourced; the mortgage and credit card rackets that saddle the working poor with debt, i.e., white trashonomics; the ubiquitous gun culture”and why the left doesn't get it; Scots Irish culture and how it played out in the young life of Lynddie England; and the blinkered magical thinking of the Christian right. (Bageant's brother is a Baptist pastor who casts out demons.) What it adds up to, he asserts, is an unacknowledged class war. By turns brutal, tender, incendiary, and seriously funny, this book is a call to arms for fellow progressives with little real understanding of the great beery, NASCAR-loving, church-going, gun-owning America that has never set foot in a Starbucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deer Hunting with Jesus&lt;/i&gt; is a potent antidote to what Bageant dubs the "American hologram" the televised, corporatized virtual reality that distracts us from the insidious realities of American life.</description>

  <description>Willy Loman, the protagonist of Death of a Salesman, has spent his life following the American way, living out his belief in salesmanship as a way to reinvent himself. But somehow the riches and respect he covets have eluded him. At age sixty-three, he searches for the moment his life took a wrong turn, the moment of betrayal that undermined his relationship with his wife and destroyed his relationship with Biff, the son in whom he invested his faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller's masterpiece has steadily seen productions all ove rthe world since its 1949 debut. As the noted Miller scholar Christopher Bigsby states in his Introduction, "if Willy's is an American dream, it is also a dream shared by all those who are aware of the gap between what they might have been and waht they are."&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>One of our most important film writers draws from a selection of his published pieces over a dozen years to examine the art, business, and future of what used to be America’s primary popular entertainment and is now an endangered species.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Denby chooses from among his much admired essays from the prestigious New Yorker to trace the radical evolution in the commerce and art of movies, which now compete more and more with television and the Internet in a global marketplace that drives the film business toward spectacle, digitalization, and perhaps eventual extinction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Examining the history of films and their centrality to our popular culture, Denby contemplates “fandom” and declares that a movie culture without star adoration is impossible to imagine. He praises the directors he admires—those who have temperament, are unique to themselves, and “make more than car crashes.” And he honors two great critics, James Agee and Pauline Kael, as he places them in the movie history they both embodied and transcended.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Denby’s essays are passionate, wry, both admiring and skeptical. He writes about films as only a lover of movies can. eBook</description>

  <description>What does it mean when a fictional hero takes a journey? Shares a meal? Gets drenched in a sudden rain shower? Often, there is much more going on in a novel or poem than is readily visible on the surface -- a symbol, maybe, that remains elusive, or an unexpected twist on a character -- and there's that sneaking suspicion that the deeper meaning of a literary text keeps escaping you.&lt;p&gt;In this practical and amusing guide to literature, Thomas C. Foster shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock those hidden truths, and to discover a world where a road leads to a quest; a shared meal may signify a communion; and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just rain. Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices, and form, &lt;i&gt;How to Read Literature Like a Professor&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect companion for making your reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Have you lost the art of reading for pleasure? Are there books you know you should read but haven't because they seem too daunting? In &lt;em&gt;The Well-Educated Mind&lt;/em&gt;, Susan Wise Bauer provides a welcome and encouraging antidote to the distractions of our age, electronic and otherwise. In her previous book, &lt;em&gt;The Well-Trained Mind&lt;/em&gt;, the author provided a road map of classical education for parents wishing to home-school their children, and that book is now the premier resource for home-schoolers. In this new book, Bauer takes the same elements and techniques and adapts them to the use of adult readers who want both enjoyment and self-improvement from the time they spend reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Well-Educated Mind&lt;/em&gt; offers brief, entertaining histories of five literary genres—fiction, autobiography, history, drama, and poetry—accompanied by detailed instructions on how to read each type. The annotated lists at the end of each chapter—ranging from Cervantes to A. S. Byatt, Herodotus to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich—preview recommended reading and encourage readers to make vital connections between ancient traditions and contemporary writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Well-Educated Mind&lt;/em&gt; reassures those readers who worry that they read too slowly or with below-average comprehension. If you can understand a daily newspaper, there's no reason you can't read and enjoy Shakespeare's Sonnets or &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;. But no one should attempt to read the "Great Books" without a guide and a plan. Susan Wise Bauer will show you how to allocate time to your reading on a regular basis; how to master a difficult argument; how to make personal and literary judgments about what you read; how to appreciate the resonant links among texts within a genre—what does &lt;em&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/em&gt; owe to &lt;em&gt;Madame Bovary&lt;/em&gt;?—and also between genres. Followed carefully, the advice in &lt;em&gt;The Well-Educated Mind&lt;/em&gt; will restore and expand the pleasure of the written word.</description>

  <description>In David Sedaris’s world, no one is safe and no cow is sacred. A manic cross between Mark Leyner, Fran Lebowitz, and the &lt;i&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/i&gt;, Sedaris’s collection of essays is a rollicking tour through the national Zeitgeist: a do-it-yourself suburban dad saves money by performing home surgery; a man who is loved too much flees the heavyweight champion of the world; a teenage suicide tries to incite a lynch mob at her funeral; a bitter Santa abuses the elves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Sedaris made his debut on NPR’s &lt;i&gt;Morning Edition&lt;/i&gt; with “SantaLand Diaries”, recounting his strange-but-true experiences as an elf at Macy’s, and soon became one of the show’s most popular commentators. With a perfect eye and a voice infused with as much empathy as wit, Sedaris writes stories and essays that target the soulful ridiculousness of our behavior. &lt;i&gt;Barrel Fever&lt;/i&gt; is like a blind date with modern life, and anything can happen.&lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>"Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red." For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the &lt;i&gt;Books of Blood&lt;/i&gt; is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present.&lt;p&gt; Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: "The Midnight Meat Train," a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; "The Yattering and Jack," about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; "In the Hills, the Cities," an unusual example of an original horror premise; "Dread," a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; "Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament," about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. &lt;i&gt;--Fiona Webster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· Introduction by Ramsey Campbell&lt;br /&gt;· The Book of Blood&lt;br /&gt;· The Midnight Meat Train&lt;br /&gt;· The Yattering and Jack&lt;br /&gt;· Pig Blood Blues&lt;br /&gt;· Sex, Death and Starshine &lt;br /&gt;· In the Hills, the Cities&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2011 Man Booker Prize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;'s Best Books I Read This Year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;A novel so compelling that it begs to be read in a single setting, &lt;i&gt;The Sense of an Ending&lt;/i&gt; has the psychological and emotional depth and sophistication of Henry James at his best, and is a stunning new chapter in Julian Barnes's oeuvre. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This intense novel follows Tony Webster, a middle-aged man, as he contends with a past he never thought much about—until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance: one of them from the grave, another maddeningly present. Tony thought he left this all behind as he built a life for himself, and his career has provided him with a secure retirement and an amicable relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, who now has a family of her own. But when he is presented with a mysterious legacy, he is forced to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world.</description>

  <description>In the fifth Vampire Chronicle, Lestat is searching for Dora, the beautiful and charismatic mortal daughter of a drug lord. Dora has moved Lestat like no other mortal ever has, and he cannot get her out of his visions. At the same time, he is increasingly aware that the Devil knows who he is and wants something from him. While torn betwen his vampire world and his passion for Dora, Lestat is sucked in by Memnoch, who claims to be the Devil himself. Memnoch presents Lestat with unimagined opportunities: to witness creation, to visit purgatory, to be treated like a prophet. Lestat faces a choice between the Devil or God. Whom does he believe in? Who does he serve? What are the element of religious belief? Lestat finds himself caught in a whirlpool of the ultimate choice</description>

  <description>Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live.</description>

  <description>The bestselling book that asks what dogs know and how they think. The answers will surprise and delight you as Alexandra Horowitz, a cognitive scientist, explains how dogs perceive their daily worlds, each other, and that other quirky animal, the human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temple Grandin meets Stephen Pinker in this engaging and informative look at what goes on inside the minds of dogs—from a cognitive scientist with a background at &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than 52 million pet dogs in America today, it’s clear we are a nation of unabashed dog-lovers. Yet the relationship between dogs and humans remains a fascinating mystery, as no one really knows what goes on in the canine mind. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Inside of a Dog&lt;/i&gt;, Alexandra Horowitz fuses her perspectives as both scientist and dog-owner to deliver a fresh look at the world of dogs—as seen from the animal’s point of view. Inspired by her years of living with her own dog, Pumpernickel, who was a constant source of delight and mystery, Horowitz’s mind became filled with questions and ideas. In crisp, clear prose, she draws on her research in the field of dog cognition to give readers a sense of a dog’s perceptual and cognitive abilities—and paints a picture of what the canine experience is like. Horowitz’s own scientific journey, and the insights she uncovered, allowed her to understand her dog better and appreciate her more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Containing up-to-the minute research and providing many moments of dog-behavior recognition, this lively and absorbing book helps dog owners to see their best friend’s behavior in a different, and revealing light, allowing them to understand their pets and enjoy their company even more.</description>

  <description>Doomed to - or blessed with - eternal life after drinking from a magic spring, the Tuck family wanders about trying to live as inconspicuously and comfortably as they can. When ten-year-old Winnie Foster stumbles on their secret, the Tucks take her home and explain why living forever at one age is less a blessing that it might seem. Complications arise when Winnie is followed by a stranger who wants to market the spring water for a fortune.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;New York Chef Tony Bourdain gives away secrets of the trade in his wickedly funny, inspiring memoir/expose. Kitchen Confidential reveals what Bourdain calls "twenty-five years of sex, drugs, bad behavior and haute cuisine." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; published Chef Bourdain's shocking, "Don't Eat Before Reading This." Bourdain spared no one's appetite when he told all about what happens behind the kitchen door. Bourdain uses the same "take-no-prisoners" attitude in his deliciously funny and shockingly delectable book, sure to delight gourmands and philistines alike. From Bourdain's first oyster in the Gironde, to his lowly position as dishwasher in a honky tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown (where he witnesses for the first time the real delights of being a chef); from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, to drug dealers in the east village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain's tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable. &lt;i&gt;Kitchen Confidential&lt;/i&gt; will make your mouth water while your belly aches with laughter. You'll beg the chef for more, please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>An engrossing, lively history of a fearsome and misunderstood virus that binds man and dog. The most fatal virus known to science, rabies — a disease that spreads avidly from animals to humans — kills nearly one hundred percent of its victims once the infection takes root in the brain. In this critically acclaimed exploration, journalist Bill Wasik and veterinarian Monica Murphy chart four thousand years of the history, science, and cultural mythology of rabies. From Greek myths to zombie flicks, from the laboratory heroics of Louis Pasteur to the contemporary search for a lifesaving treatment, &lt;i&gt;Rabid&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh and often wildly entertaining look at one of humankind’s oldest and most fearsome foes.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An enormously popular (7-million copies sold) and insightful classic of popular psychology based on Eric Berne’s theory of Transactional Analysis that has helped millions of people who never before felt OK about themselves find the freedom to change, to liberate their ADULT effectiveness, and to achieve joyful intimacy with the people in their lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transactional analysis delineates three ego-states (parent, adult and child) as the basis for the content and quality of interpersonal communication. “Happy childhood” notwithstanding, says Harris, most of us are living out the not ok feelings of a defenseless child wholly dependent on ok others (parents) for stroking and caring. At some stage early in our lives we adopt a “position” about ourselves which very significantly determines how we feel about ourselves, particularly in relation to other people. And for a huge portion of the population, that position is that I’m Not OK-You’re OK. This negative Life Position, shared by successful and unsuccessful people alike, contaminates our rational adult potential, leaving us vulnerable to the inappropriate, emotional reactions of our child and the uncritically learned behavior programmed into our parent. By exploring the four basic “life positions,” we can radically change our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can’t stop the future. &lt;br /&gt;You can’t rewind the past.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to learn the secret . . . is to press play.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a strange package with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker–his classmate and crush–who committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah’s voice tells him that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he’ll find out why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay spends the night crisscrossing his town with Hannah as his guide. He becomes a firsthand witness to Hannah’s pain, and as he follows Hannah’s recorded words throughout his town, what he discovers changes his life forever.</description>

  <description>"My Dinner with Andre" is a passionate, volatile, and humorous encounter between two friends who have not seen each other for a long time, and decide to catch up on each others' lives over dinner. Andre Gregory is an intense, highly experimental theater director and playwright in search of life's meanings and spiritual revelations. His friend, Wally Shawn, is an actor and playwright living in New York who is more preoccupied with the search for his next meal. As Andre recounts his global journeys involving esoteric theatrical experiments and mystical adventures, Wally listens with more than skepticism, as his attitudes shift among wonder, puzzlement, admiration, and anger. What finally emerges is a sensitive portrait of a friendship that survives and transcends contransting assumptions about love, death, art, and man's continuing quest for self-fulfillment.</description>

  <description>Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist is now a major television series on FOX. It remains one of the most controversial novels ever written and went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.</description>

  <description>A startling encounter on a New York subway platform leads two strangers to a run-down tenement where a life or death decision must be made. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that small apartment, Black and White, as the two men are known, begin a conversation that leads each back through his own history, mining the origins of two fundamentally opposing world views. White is a professor whose seemingly enviable existence of relative ease has left him nonetheless in despair. Black, an ex-con and ex-addict, is the more hopeful of the men though he is just as desperate to convince White of the power of faith as White is desperate to deny it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their aim is no less than this: to discover the meaning of life. Deft, spare, and full of artful tension, &lt;i&gt;The Sunset Limited&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully crafted, consistently thought-provoking, and deceptively intimate work by one of the most insightful writers of our time.</description>

  <description>From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;No god but God&lt;/i&gt; comes a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the “Kingdom of God.” The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Within decades after his shameful death, his followers would call him God.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine, an age awash in apocalyptic fervor. Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry—a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious “King of the Jews” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zealot&lt;i&gt; yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth’s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>What can the film Hoosiers teach us about the meaning of life? How can ancient Eastern wisdom traditions, such as Taoism and Zen Buddhism, improve our jump-shots? What can the "Zen Master" (Phil Jackson) and the "Big Aristotle" (Shaquille O'Neal) teach us about sustained excellence and success? Is women's basketball "better" basketball? How, ethically, should one deal with a strategic cheater in pickup basketball? With NBA and NCAA team rosters constantly changing, what does it mean to play for the "same team"? What can coaching legends Dean Smith, Rick Pitino, Pat Summitt, and Mike Krzyzewski teach us about character, achievement, and competition? What makes basketball such a beautiful game to watch and play? Basketball is now the most popular team sport in the United States; each year, more than 50 million Americans attend college and pro basketball games. When Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, first nailed two peach baskets at the opposite ends of a Springfield, Massachusetts, gym in 1891, he had little idea of how thoroughly the game would shape American -- and international -- culture. Hoops superstars such as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Yao Ming are now instantly recognized celebrities all across the planet. So what can a group of philosophers add to the understanding of basketball? It is a relatively simple game, but as Kant and Dennis Rodman liked to say, appearances can be deceiving. Coach Phil Jackson actively uses philosophy to improve player performance and to motivate and inspire his team and his fellow coaches, both on and off the court. Jackson has integrated philosophy into his coaching and his personal life so thoroughly that it is often difficult to distinguish his role as a basketball coach from his role as a philosophical guide and mentor to his players. In Basketball and Philosophy, a Dream Team of twenty-six basketball fans, most of whom also happen to be philosophers, proves that basketball is the thinking person's sport. They look at what happens when the Tao meets the hardwood as they explore the teamwork, patience, selflessness, and balanced and harmonious action that make up the art of playing basketball.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;¡n we get some reality in here? asks Judy Sheindlin, former supervising judge for Manhattan Family Court. For twenty–four years she has laid down the law as she understands it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;● If you want to eat, you have to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ● If you have children, you'd better support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;● If you break the law, you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;● If you tap the public purse, you'd better be accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she abandons all judicial restraint in a scathing critique of the system – filled with realistic hard–nosed alternatives to our bloated welfare bureaucracy and our soft–on–crime laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An enthralling and wise new collection from the author of &lt;i&gt;Century's Son&lt;/i&gt; and one of America's most respected writers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was twenty-nine years old and wanted to change before I hit thirty. Clete and I developed a plan for me . . . a plan that would work all that summer and beyond. Even after I left the mountain, it stuck.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Boswell's extraordinary range is on full display in this crackling new collection. Set mainly in small, gritty American cities no farther east than Chicago and as far west as El Paso, each of these stories is a world unto itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two marriages end, one by death, the other by divorce, and the two wives, lifelong friends, become strangers to each other. A young man's obsession with visiting a fortune-teller leaves him nearly homeless. And in the unforgettable title story, a man dubbed Keen recounts the summer he spent on a mountain with his best friend, Clete, and a loose band of slackers, living in a borrowed house, abstaining from all drugs (other than mushrooms and beer)—and ultimately asking just what kind of harm we can do to one another.</description>

  <description>This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safe for democracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else mattered—not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives...This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome...but so is war.</description>

  <description>Wall Street scandals. Fights over taxes. Racial resentments. A Lakers-Celtics championship. &lt;i&gt;The Karate Kid&lt;/i&gt; topping the box-office charts. Bon Jovi touring the country. These words could describe our current moment—or the vaunted iconography of three decades past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this wide-ranging and wickedly entertaining book, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling journalist David Sirota takes readers on a rollicking DeLorean ride back in time to reveal how so many of our present-day conflicts are rooted in the larger-than-life pop culture of the 1980s—from the “Greed is good” ethos of Gordon Gekko (and Bernie Madoff) to the “Make my day” foreign policy of Ronald Reagan (and George W. Bush) to the “transcendence” of Cliff Huxtable (and Barack Obama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today’s mindless militarism and hypernarcissism, Sirota argues, first became the norm when an ’80s generation weaned on Rambo one-liners and “Just Do It” exhortations embraced a new religion—with comic books, cartoons, sneaker commercials, videogames, and even children’s toys serving as the key instruments of cultural indoctrination. Meanwhile, in productions such as &lt;i&gt;Back to the Future, Family Ties,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Big Chill&lt;/i&gt;, a campaign was launched to reimagine the 1950s as America’s lost golden age and vilify the 1960s as the source of all our troubles. That 1980s revisionism, Sirota shows, still rages today, with Barack Obama cast as the 60s hippie being assailed by Alex P. Keaton–esque Republicans who long for a return to Eisenhower-era conservatism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The past is never dead,” William Faulkner wrote. “It’s not even past.” The 1980s—even more so. With the native dexterity only a child of the Atari Age could possess, David Sirota twists and turns this multicolored Rubik’s Cube of a decade, exposing it as a warning for our own troubled present—and possible future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, “one of America’s top cultural critics” (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;), and “The Ethicist” for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Magazine, &lt;/i&gt;comes&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;a new book of all original pieces on villains and villainy in popular culture.&lt;/b&gt;Chuck Klosterman has walked into the darkness. As a child, he rooted for conventionally good characters like wide-eyed Luke Skywalker in &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;. But as Klosterman aged, his alliances shifted—first to Han Solo and then to Darth Vader. Vader was a hero who consciously embraced evil; Vader &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; to be bad. But what, exactly, was that supposed to mean? When we classify someone as a bad person, what are we really saying (and why are we so obsessed with saying it)? In &lt;i&gt;I Wear the Black Hat&lt;/i&gt;, Klosterman questions the very nature of how modern people understand the culture of villainy. What was so Machiavellian about Machiavelli? Why don’t we see Batman the same way we see Bernhard Goetz? Who’s more worthy of our vitriol—Bill Clinton or Don Henley? What was O.J. Simpson’s &lt;i&gt;second-worst &lt;/i&gt;decision? And why is Klosterman still obsessed with some kid he knew for one week in 1985?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masterfully blending cultural analysis with self-interrogation and limitless imagination, &lt;i&gt;I Wear the Black Hat&lt;/i&gt; delivers perceptive observations on the complexity of the anti-hero (seemingly the only kind of hero America still creates). &lt;i&gt;I Wear the Black Hat&lt;/i&gt; is the rare example of serious criticism that’s instantly accessible and really, really funny. Klosterman is the only writer doing whatever it is he’s doing.</description>

  <description>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff... and it's all small stuff is a book that shows you how to keep from letting the little things in life drive you crazy. In thoughtful and insightful language, author Richard Carlson reveals ways to calm down in the midst of your incredibly hurried, stress-filled life. You can learn to put things in perspective by making the small daily changes he suggests,including advice such as "Think of your problems as potential teachers"; "Remember that when you die, your 'In' box won't be empty"; and "Do one thing at a time." You should also try to live in the present moment, let others have the glory at times, and lower your tolerance to stress. You can write down your most stubborn positions and see if you can soften them, learn to trust your intuitions, and live each day as if it might be your last. With gentle, supportive suggestions, Dr.Carlson reveals ways to make your actions more peaceful and caring, with the added benefit of making your life more calm and stress-free.</description>

  <description>The hero-narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt; is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</description>

  <description>David Sedaris plays in the snow with his sisters. He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother’s wedding. He mops his sister’s floor. He gives directions to a lost traveler. He eats a hamburger. He has his blood sugar tested. It all sounds so normal, doesn’t it? In his newest collection of essays, David Sedaris lifts the corner of ordinary life, revealing the absurdity teeming below its surface. His world is alive with obscure desires and hidden motives — a world where forgiveness is automatic and an argument can be the highest form of love. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is another unforgettable collection from one of the wittiest and most original writers at work today.&lt;br /&gt;--davidsedarisbooks.com</description>

  <description>This classic volume, long out of print, deals with the strategies of both psychotherapists and clients as they maneuver each other in the process of treatment. How a therapist induces a client to change is described within a framework of interpersonal theory and directive family therapy. This work represents a step from the study of therapy in terms of the individual to therapy as communication between at least two people. In this volume, Jay Haley acknowledges his debt to the Gregory Bateson research project exploring the nature of communication as well as to Dr. Milton H. Erickson, M.D. for the many hours of conversations and a new perspective on the nature of therapy. The reactions to this different view continue to be controversial today in the therapy field.</description>

  <description>Best-selling author Leonard Shlain explores the potential for humankind through the life, art, and mind of the first true Renaissance man, Leonardo da Vinci. The author hypothesizes that da Vinci’s staggering range of achievements demonstrates a harbinger of the future of our species. Da Vinci’s innovations as an artist, scientist, and inventor are recast through a modern lens, with Shlain applying contemporary neuroscience to illuminate da Vinci’s creative process. No other person in human history has excelled in so many areas of innovation: Shlain reveals the how and the why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shlain theorizes that Leonardo’s extraordinary mind came from a uniquely developed and integrated right and left brain, and he offers a model for how we too can evolve. Using past and current research, &lt;i&gt;Leonardo’s Brain&lt;/i&gt; presents da Vinci as the focal point for a fresh exploration of human creativity. With his lucid style and remarkable ability to discern connections among a wide range of fields, Shlain brings the reader into the world of history’s greatest mind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780140432077&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published in 1859, John Stuart Mill's &lt;i&gt;On Liberty&lt;/i&gt; presented one of the most eloquent defenses of individual freedom in nineteenth-century social and political philosophy and is today perhaps the most widely-read liberal argument in support of the value of liberty. Mill's passionate advocacy of spontaneity, individuality, and diversity, along with his contempt for compulsory uniformity and the despotism of popular opinion, has attracted both admiration and condemnation.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Is being nice overrated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we really just selfish, base animals crawling across Earth in a meaningless existence?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would reading less and watching more television be good for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is House a master of Eastern philosophy or just plain rude?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Gregory House is arguably the most complex and challenging antihero in the history of television, but is there more to this self-important genius than gray matter and ego? This book takes a deeper look at House to reveal the philosophical underpinnings of this popular medical drama and its cane-waving curmudgeon's most outrageous behavior. What emerges is a remarkable character who is part Sherlock Holmes, part Socratic philosopher, part Nietzschean superman, part Taoist rhetorician, and not at all as screwed up as you might think. With everything from Aristotle to Zen, House and Philosophy takes an engaging look at everyone's favorite misanthropic genius and his team at Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.</description>

  <description>We in America have certain ideas of what it means to be poor. Linda Tirado, in her signature brutally honest yet personable voice, takes all of these preconceived notions and smashes them to bits. She articulates not only what it is to be working poor in America (yes, you can be poor and live in a house and have a job, even two), but what poverty is truly like—on all levels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly and boldly, Tirado discusses openly how she went from lower-middle class, to sometimes middle class, to poor and everything in between, and in doing so reveals why “poor people don’t always behave the way middle-class America thinks they should.” </description>

  <description>He lives in solitude beneath the city, an exile from society, which will destroy him if he is ever seen. She dwells in seclusion, a fugitive from enemies who will do her harm if she is ever found. But the bond between them runs deeper than the tragedies that have scarred their lives. Something more than chance—and nothing less than destiny—has brought them together in a world whose hour of reckoning is fast approaching.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Stupid is the new smart—but it wasn’t always so&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Popular culture has divorced itself from the life of the mind. Who has time for great books or deep thought when there is Jersey Shore to watch, a txt 2 respond 2, and World of Warcraft to play?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, those who pursue the life of the mind have insulated themselves from popular culture. Speaking in insider jargon and writing unread books, intellectuals have locked themselves away in a ghetto of their own creation.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn’t always so. &lt;i&gt;Blue Collar Intellectuals&lt;/i&gt; vividly captures a time in the twentieth century when the everyman aspired to high culture and when intellectuals descended from the ivory tower to speak to the everyman. Author Daniel J. Flynn profiles thinkers from working-class backgrounds who played a prominent role in American life by addressing their intellectual work to a mass audience. Blue Collar Intellectuals tells the fascinating story of:he unschooled hobo who migrated from skid row anonymity to White House chats with the president and prime-time TV specials. he scandalous teacher-student romance that spawned a half-century labor of love in writing the history of the world. he Ivy League Ph.D. who held neither a high school nor college degree, and fittingly launched a renaissance in reading the great books outside of formal schools. The scholarship student who experienced the free market firsthand waiting tables and peddling socks, and who became one of capitalism’s most influential exponents. The impoverished outcast who became the poet of the pulps, elevating millions of readers along with heretofore marginal genres. Guiding us through a world now vanished, Flynn causes us to look anew at our own digital age and its nostrums: Video gaming is just a new form of literacy, Reality shows . . . Challenge our emotional intelligence, and Who cares if Johnny can’t read? The value of books is overstated. &lt;i&gt;Blue Collar Intellectuals&lt;/i&gt; shows us how much everyone intellectual and everyman alike has suffered from mass culture’s crowding out of higher things and the elite’s failure to engage the masses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Blue Collar Intellectuals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “&lt;b&gt;This book is not only an exciting story; it also corrects a terrible cultural mistake&lt;/b&gt;—the mistake of treating high culture, Great Books, and other canon-making visions of tradition as exploitative and spurious. Previous generations of intellectuals believed that our great cultural inheritance belonged to everyone, rich and poor, black and white and brown. &lt;b&gt;Daniel Flynn’s profiles revive that belief, and they mark a vital alternative to the complacent relativism of contemporary cultural stewards.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;b&gt;Mark Bauerlein&lt;/b&gt;, best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;The Dumbest Generation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Flynn’s case histories of a wonderful—and uniquely American—tradition&lt;/b&gt; of bringing learning to the masses offers us a morality tale in these times of spiraling tuition, esoteric publication, and an insular academia mostly cut off from wider society. The &lt;b&gt;fascinating portraits&lt;/b&gt; here remind us how not so long ago an interest in making knowledge known beyond the campus was not antithetical to learning but the very essence of the true intellectual.”&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;b&gt;Victor Davis Hanson&lt;/b&gt;, coauthor of &lt;i&gt;Who Killed Homer?&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Bonfire of the Humanities&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Back in the middle decades of the twentieth century, millions of Americans supped at the table of high culture, learning history, philosophy, and economics from intellectual entrepreneurs like Will and Ariel Durant, Mortimer Adler, and Eric Hoffer. &lt;b&gt;Daniel Flynn tells their story in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Blue Collar Intellectuals&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;—and tells us why we miss them today&lt;/b&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;b&gt;Michael Barone&lt;/b&gt;, senior political analyst at the &lt;i&gt;Washington Examiner&lt;/i&gt;, coauthor of &lt;i&gt;The Almanac of American Politics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Blue Collar Intellectuals&lt;/i&gt; powerfully evokes the lost era when the ‘everyman’ aspired to higher things and the defenders of high culture spoke and wrote in clear, accessible language. &lt;b&gt;Flynn’s deft historical profiles remind us that popular culture and the life of the mind need not be adversaries&lt;/b&gt;.”&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;b&gt;Brian C. Anderson&lt;/b&gt;, editor of &lt;i&gt;City Journal&lt;/i&gt; and author of &lt;i&gt;South Park Conservatives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Niccolo Machiavelli, one of the eminent minds of the Italian Renaissance, spent much of a long and active lifetime trying to determine and understand what exceptional qualities of human character-- and what surrounding elements of fortune, luck, and timing-- made great men great leaders successful in war and peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In perhaps the liveliest book on Machiavelli in years, Michael A. Ledeen measures contemporary movers and doers against the timeless standards established by the great Renaissance writer. Titans of statecraft (Margaret Thatcher, Francois Mitterrand, Pope John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton); business and finance (Bill Gates); Wall Street and investing (Warren Buffett); the military (Colin Powell), and sports (Michael Jordan) are judged by Machiavelli's precepts on leadership and the proper use of power. The result is a wide-ranging and scintillating study that illuminates the thoughts of the Renaissance master and the actions of today's truly towering figures as well as the character-challenged pretenders to greatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an exceptional book on Machiavelli and his ultra-realistic exploration of human nature-- then and now.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer brings to life the most intriguing woman in the history of the world: Cleopatra, the last queen of Egypt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and–after his murder–three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra’s supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail, epic in scope, Schiff ‘s is a luminous, deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.</description>

  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <description>Christine wakes up every morning in an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar man. She looks in the mirror and sees an unfamiliar, middle-aged face. And every morning, the man she has woken up with must explain that he is Ben, he is her husband, she is forty-seven years old, and a terrible accident two decades earlier decimated her ability to form new memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, Christine must begin again the reconstruction of her past. And the closer she gets to the truth, the more unbelievable it seems.</description>

  <description>At the time it was written, Night Comes to the Cumberlands framed an urgent appeal to the American Conscience. Today it details Appalachia's difficult past, and at the same time, presents an accurate historical backdrop for a contemporary understanding of the Appalachian region.</description>

  <description>"There is nothing gutsier to me than a person announcing that their story is one that deserves to be told," writes Lena Dunham, and it certainly takes guts to share the stories that make up her first book, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt;. These are stories about getting your butt touched by your boss, about friendship and dieting (kind of) and having two existential crises before the age of 20. Stories about travel, both successful and less so, and about having the kind of sex where you feel like keeping your sneakers on in case you have to run away during the act. Stories about proving yourself to a room of 50-year-old men in Hollywood and showing up to "an outlandishly high-fashion event with the crustiest red nose you ever saw." Fearless, smart, and as heartbreakingly honest as ever, &lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl&lt;/i&gt; establishes Lena Dunham as more than a hugely talented director, actress and producer-it announces her as a fresh and vibrant new literary voice.</description>

  <description>The New York Times best-selling Freakonomics was a worldwide sensation, selling over four million copies in thirty-five languages and changing the way we look at the world. Now, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with SuperFreakonomics, and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years in the making, SuperFreakonomics asks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk or walking drunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SuperFreakonomics challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?&lt;br /&gt;Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands?&lt;br /&gt;How much good do car seats do?&lt;br /&gt;What's the best way to catch a terrorist?&lt;br /&gt;Did TV cause a rise in crime?&lt;br /&gt;What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?&lt;br /&gt;Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?&lt;br /&gt;Can eating kangaroo save the planet?&lt;br /&gt;Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else, whether investigating a solution to global warming or explaining why the price of oral sex has fallen so drastically. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is – good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freakonomics has been imitated many times over – but only now, with SuperFreakonomics, has it met its match.</description>

  <description>In this madcap journey, a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.</description>

  <description>Niccolo Machiavelli's &lt;i&gt;The Prince&lt;/i&gt; has been one of the most widely read and quoted book about politics during the past five centuries. But in the democracies of the information age, new ideas are needed to make government prosper through the next century. Now, Dick Morris, who contributed significantly to President Clinton's reelection in 1996 and, during the previous two decades, helped many public officials (Democrats and Republicans alike) gain office, takes a hard look at our times and writes a how-to book for office-seekers, special-interest groups, and students of politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The New Prince, &lt;/i&gt;Morris advises candidates to adopt idealism as a strategy—not because of misguided altruism, but because it works. He tells politicians, advocacy groups, business leaders, and citizens how to promote their causes and get their jobs done effectively. And he offers insights into the character of the most remarkable political figures of our time and outlines what he believes will be the political agenda for the next century.</description>

  <description>What is it that makes someone stick by you, even in the darkest hour, while others run for the hills at the slightest hint that something has gone wrong?&lt;br /&gt; Research shows that an unwavering sense of loyalty can, in fact, be instilled in anyone by applying a basic psychological strategy. Whether it’s a friend, employee, or spouse, you can make anyone more loyal to you, your company, or your cause, faster and more easily than you ever thought possible. &lt;br /&gt; Of course you know the traditional, sound advice, such as using rewards, praising, showing gratitude and appreciation, and the like. These are practical and effective ideas, but with the following techniques you’re going to be able to bring to an entirely new level your ability to create iron-clad loyalty very quickly. In this book, are the components, the building blocks of loyalty used to create an unshakable allegiance. &lt;br /&gt; This book contains specific, carefully formulated psychological tactics that can be applied to any situation, with any person. These are not just ideas or theories or tricks that work only sometimes and only on some people. This book offers readers the opportunity to use the most important psychological tools governing human behavior, not just to level the playing field but to create an automatic advantage. &lt;br /&gt; Readers get techniques that work, written in the casual, to-the-point, no-fluff, no-psychobabble style that has made David Lieberman’s books so popular. They get the information first hand, because it’s Dr. Lieberman’s techniques that the FBI uses; and he’s the one who personally trains the United States military; he’s the one who teaches psychological tactics to leading state negotiators; he’s the one who works with mental health professionals; and he’s the one who works with leading business executives around the world.&lt;br /&gt; There are plenty of business books that offer “laws” and “principles” and strategies and stories. Now here’s one that gives specific solutions to real problems.&lt;br /&gt; From small business to big business to the professionals in between, the benefits are crystal clear. Readers will have the security of knowing what’s really going on at all times, the power to keep potentially devastating situations from ever unfolding, and when necessary, the ability to navigate the toughest circumstances quickly and smoothly.&lt;br /&gt; Don’t be in the dark a minute longer when find out who is out for you, and who is out to get you. Even better, turn your enemies into your most loyal allies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Peak Inside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Learn the best psychological strategy to help keep any employee or customer from ever leaving you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Get anyone—friends, co-worker, client—to instantly see you as a person of honesty and integrity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Discover the five most powerful ways to get anyone to instantly like you and trust you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Arm yourself with the sure-fire technique to get anyone to stick by you in the most difficult times . . .even when you’ve messed up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Deposit a “loyalty credit” into a person’s mind that you can use the next time he or she may be thinking of abandoning you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• If you think that someone may be sabotaging your efforts, when she appears to be cooperating, use these advanced techniques to find out whose side anyone is on, and fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Find out in less than five minutes who in your company is not loyal...and is perhaps even meeting with the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• You already know the damage caused by internal theft. What you need is the same casual interviewing techniques that the FBI uses to find out if an employee, client, or vendor is lying or stealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror.  An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London’s East End.  Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim.  And then the Ripper’s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun.  He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene.  Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper’s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called “Ripper Walks” that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel.  But to number-one &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death.  Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her—and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed&lt;/i&gt;, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history.  Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world’s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she.   Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain’s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate.  She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press.  Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man’s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;New information and startling revelations detailed in &lt;i&gt;Portrait of a Killer&lt;/i&gt; include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests—on samples drawn by Cornwell’s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents—yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...</description>

  <description>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</description>

  <description>A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>It started when she was served a soft drink laced with LSD in a dangerous party game. Within months, she was hooked, trapped in a downward spiral that took her from her comfortable home and loving family to the mean streets of an unforgiving city. It was a journey that would rob her of her innocence, her youth -- and ultimately her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Read her diary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enter her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will never forget her.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tired of swimming with the sharks? Fed up with that big ape down the hall? Real animals can teach us better ways to thrive in the workplace jungle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’re ambitious and want to get ahead, but what’s the best way to do it? Become the biggest, baddest predator? The proverbial 800-pound gorilla? Or does nature teach you to be more subtle and sophisticated?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Conniff, the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Natural History of the Rich&lt;/i&gt;, has survived savage beasts in the workplace jungle, where he hooted and preened in the corner office as a publishing executive. He’s also spent time studying how animals operate in the real jungles of the Amazon and the African bush. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he shows in &lt;i&gt;The Ape in the Corner Office&lt;/i&gt; is that nature built you to be nice. Doing favors, grooming coworkers with kind words, building coalitions—these tools for getting ahead come straight from the jungle. The stereotypical Darwinian hard-charger supposedly thinks only about accumulating resources. But highly effective apes know it’s often smarter to give them away. That doesn’t mean it’s a peaceable kingdom out there, however. Conniff shows that you can become more effective by understanding how other species negotiate the tricky balance between conflict and cooperation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conniff quotes one biologist on a chimpanzee’s obsession with rank: “His attempts to maintain and achieve alpha status are cunning, persistent, energetic, and time-consuming. They affect whom he travels with, whom he grooms, where he glances, how often he scratches, where he goes, what times he gets up in the morning.” Sound familiar? It’s the same behavior you can find written up in any issue of &lt;i&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ape in the Corner Office&lt;/i&gt; connects with the day-to-day of the workplace because it helps explain what people are really concerned about: How come he got the wing chair with the gold trim? How can I survive as that big ape’s subordinate without becoming a spineless yes-man? Why does being a lone wolf mean being a loser? And, yes, why is it that jerks seem to prosper—at least in the short run?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also available as a Random House AudioBook and an eBook&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Sun Tzu's &lt;i&gt;The Art of War&lt;/i&gt; is an acknowledged masterpiece--for the general reader. Yet the deeper truths of strategy and mind manipulation have been, until now, known only to true scholars dedicated to deciphering illegible scrolls and mastering the nuances of lost languages. Now, Dr. Haha Lung has at last gathered and fully translated these teachings from the shadows of history--the truly dangerous wisdom of the lesser-known masters--and presents them here for those daring, perhaps unwisely, to attain a higher level of dominance. You'll discover: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12 Cuts: Voritomo's Art of War &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The War Scroll of Spartacus &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musashi's 6 Ways to be Victorious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 99 Truths: Hannibal's Black Art of War &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And much more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE ADVISED: For academic study ONLY; publisher assumes NO responsibility for content use/misuse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Haha Lung&lt;/b&gt; is the author of more than a dozen books on martial arts, including &lt;i&gt;Ultimate Mind Control, Mind Penetration, Mind Fist, The Nine Halls of Death, Assassin!, Mind Manipulation, Knights of Darkness,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mind Control: The Ancient Art of Psychological Warfare. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>This is the book you've heard about. The book that leaped to the top ranks of the bestseller lists. The book that's got the business world reading, thinking, and quoting. This is the book that reveals the leadership secrets of Attila the Hun-the man who centuries ago shaped an aimless band of mercenary tribal nomads into the undisputed rulers of the ancient world, and who today offers us timeless lessons in win-directed, take-charge management.</description>

  <description>Designed to be a true alternative to traditional argument texts, Everything's an Argument takes a fresh and friendly approach to the subject by showing students that argument is everywhere. Everything's an Argument with Readings complements this approach with a uniquely broad range of examples -- from essays to billboards to emails to radio programs -- that help students recognize and respond to the arguments all around them. Andrea Lunsford and John Ruszkiewicz's instruction is fresh, elegant, and jargon-free, emphasizing inclusivity (moving beyond simple pro/con positions), humor, and visual argument to make Everything's an Argument immediately accessible. Students like this book because it helps them see and understand that a world of argument already surrounds them; instructors like it because it helps students construct their own arguments about that world.</description>

  <description>The art of the argument. It's mysterious and powerful. It's the art of having things go your way. But it's also the art of getting out of your own way. It's having the Moves. But it's also about having the Touch. Welcome to the "new normal." It's a time and place where conversations are tougher, disagreements more frequent, consensus more difficult to find than ever before. This new world demands three new "right for our times" chapters:&lt;br /&gt;-+ "Heavy Metal Moves" and "Taboo Tactics": When you're being dissed, dismissed, and dumped on. Or when you need to break through.&lt;br /&gt;-+ "Waging Peace: The Mediation, Arbitration, and Collaborative Practice Game": Because there's more conflict but less money to hire litigation lawyers.&lt;br /&gt;-+ "The World Has Gotten Smaller": Learn to identify deep-rooted cultural differences, and how to act and react.</description>

  <description>Small changes can make a big difference in your powers of persuasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What one word can you start using today to increase your persuasiveness by more than fifty percent?&lt;br /&gt;Which item of stationery can dramatically increase people's responses to your requests?&lt;br /&gt;How can you win over your rivals by inconveniencing them?&lt;br /&gt;Why does knowing that so many dentists are named Dennis improve your persuasive prowess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day we face the challenge of persuading others to do what we want. But what makes people say yes to our requests? Persuasion is not only an art, it is also a science, and researchers who study it have uncovered a series of hidden rules for moving people in your direction. Based on more than sixty years of research into the psychology of persuasion, Yes! reveals fifty simple but remarkably effective strategies that will make you much more persuasive at work and in your personal life, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowritten by the world's most quoted expert on influence, Professor Robert Cialdini, Yes! presents dozens of surprising discoveries from the science of persuasion in short, enjoyable, and insightful chapters that you can apply immediately to become a more effective persuader. Why did a sign pointing out the problem of vandalism in the Petrified Forest National Park actually increase the theft of pieces of petrified wood? Why did sales of jam multiply tenfold when consumers were offered many fewer flavors? Why did people prefer a Mercedes immediately after giving reasons why they prefer a BMW? What simple message on cards left in hotel rooms greatly increased the number of people who behaved in environmentally friendly ways?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often counterintuitive, the findings presented in Yes! will steer you away from common pitfalls while empowering you with little-known but proven wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are in advertising, marketing, management, or sales, or just curious about how to be more influential in everyday life, Yes! shows how making small, scientifically proven changes to your approach can have a dramatic effect on your persuasive powers.</description>

  <description>What if — whoosh, right now, with no explanation — a number of us simply vanished? Would some of us collapse? Would others of us go on, one foot in front of the other, as we did before the world turned upside down? That's what the bewildered citizens of Mapleton, who lost many of their neighbors, friends and lovers in the event known as the Sudden Departure, have to figure out. Because nothing has been the same since it happened — not marriages, not friendships, not even the relationships between parents and children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Garvey, Mapleton's new mayor, wants to speed up the healing process, to bring a sense of renewed hope and purpose to his traumatized community. Kevin's own family has fallen apart in the wake of the disaster: his wife, Laurie, has left to join the Guilty Remnant, a homegrown cult whose members take a vow of silence; his son, Tom, is gone, too, dropping out of college to follow a sketchy prophet named Holy Wayne. Only Kevin's teenaged daughter, Jill, remains, and she's definitely not the sweet "A" student she used to be. Kevin wants to help her, but he's distracted by his growing relationship with Nora Durst, a woman who lost her entire family on October 14th and is still reeling from the tragedy, even as she struggles to move beyond it and make a new start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heart, intelligence and a rare ability to illuminate the struggles inherent in ordinary lives, Tom Perrotta has written a startling, thought-provoking novel about love, connection and loss.</description>

  <description>For anyone who has ever wondered about the meaning of life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing his inspiration from 42 of the funniest, wisest, and quirkiest quotations on the big questions in life, Vernon offers a light-hearted look at what philosophy has to say about life, the Universe, and everything. Deftly interweaving the thoughts of the greatest minds of all time, from Socrates to Monty Python, Vernon provides a platter of witty yet profound discussions on work, love, eternal life, sex, and happiness. From the allure of cats to the nature of wisdom, this rip-roaring read is the perfect companion for the armchair philosopher, and proves that even a little introspection can transform our lives for the better!</description>
