  <description>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Most Fantastic Show on Earth...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, the Ban changed everything, outlawing certain forms of magic and bringing about the rise of powerful crime syndicates. Now, speakeasies in every city sell illegal charms and jinxes, and bootleggers traffic restricted potion ingredients across the country. But even in this changing world, the magic of the circus still acts as a wondrous escape and provides entertainment for all.​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Strickland owns one such circus, inherited after an accident ended his career as a rodeo dragon rider. He also inherited the circus’ financial troubles, but since the show became his, he’s slowly managed to turn it into a profitable business once more. Or at least, that’s what he thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a dangerous mobster comes to collect an old debt, Jake resorts to desperate measures to get the money before a strict deadline. With lives and livelihoods at stake, he battles the clock, his responsibilities to the circus, and a longstanding personal grudge that has festered for years. Can he pay back the mob before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;FRACTURE&lt;/b&gt; - \ˈfrak-shər\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. to cause a crack or fracture in; break&lt;br /&gt;2. to damage or destroy&lt;br /&gt;3. the act or process of breaking or the state of being broken&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years after the Resistance's plan for retribution was foiled, the galaxy as a whole is at peace. The people of Haphez remain independent and free of Federation scrutiny thanks to a major sacrifice by one of their own. Those affected by the loss have found new purpose. Life goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But peace is only an illusion. Tension is brewing between two major players in the galactic underworld. When commissioned with hunting down a rogue Haphezian assassin, Aroska Tarbic, Skeet Duvo, and Zinni Vax are drawn into that underworld, a place where anything goes and no one is innocent. A routine assignment turns into a matter of life and death as they find themselves caught in the middle of a gang war...and hunted by their own quarry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the conflict rages across multiple worlds, the search for this elusive killer pits the Alpha team against new enemies, introduces them to unlikely new allies...and leads them to cross paths with someone else they hadn't expected to find. Someone who didn't want to be found. Someone who may just be their only hope for survival.</description>

  <description>Do you want to successfully self-publish? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are thousands of new books being published every day, but many self-published books quickly sink to the bottom of the pile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Many authors are frustrated because there are so many options for self-publishing, and they don't know which one to choose or what will be best for their book. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Others spend thousands of dollars to publish and end up broken-hearted with the result. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it doesn't have to be this way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've spent the last seven years self-publishing bestselling fiction and non-fiction books and in 2011, I left my day job to become a full-time author entrepreneur. I've made lots of mistakes along the way, but through the process of self-publishing 17 books, I've learned the most effective way to publish and market your books. In this book, I'll share everything with you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The book includes: &lt;br /&gt;- What you need to know before you self-publish &lt;br /&gt;- Why self-publishing an ebook is a good idea &lt;br /&gt;- How to format an ebook &lt;br /&gt;- Exclusivity and going direct &lt;br /&gt;- How to self-publish an ebook &lt;br /&gt;- Why self-publish a print book &lt;br /&gt;- Print-on-demand will change your life &lt;br /&gt;- What you need to know before you print &lt;br /&gt;- How to self-publish a print book &lt;br /&gt;- What to do if you want help with the publishing process &lt;br /&gt;- After self-publishing &lt;br /&gt;- How much does it cost to self-publish? &lt;br /&gt;- How do you get paid when you self-publish? &lt;br /&gt;- Book marketing principles &lt;br /&gt;- How to market fiction &lt;br /&gt;- How to market non-fiction &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plus, links to more useful resources. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you're ready to successfully self-publish, then download a sample or buy now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can also get your free Author 2.0 Blueprint and mini-course at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://TheCreativePenn.com/blueprint" rel="nofollow"&gt;TheCreativePenn.com/blueprint&lt;/a&gt; (just copy and paste into your browser)</description>

  <description>Welcome to the world of the Grisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaz Brekker and his crew of deadly outcasts have just pulled off a heist so daring even they didn't think they'd survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from around the world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals and new enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will decide the fate of the Grisha world.</description>

  <description>Winter has crippled the nation of Riyen and Hawthorne has made moves to take over the city for his own mysterious purposes. When Rodge and Janelle arrive in Angapo they find that war has broken out. With Anissa missing and no way to contact her, they will have to formulate their own plan to get back to Riyen and stop Hawthorne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Anissa and Carson find themselves the leaders of a new rebellion against an enemy much greater than Hawthorne. Battling their own brokenness and conflicting desires, their search for answers seems to uncover more obstacles. As events unravel, each of them will have to decide how much they are willing to sacrifice to save the Empire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;NOT EVERY ADVENTURE GOES AS PLANNED …&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy’s troubles are far from over. Hook wants her in irons, the crew wants to throw her overboard, and Pan’s magical compass is the only thing standing in their way. But Pan himself is nowhere to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a new everlost captain appears on the horizon, it will take everything Wendy has to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And a tiny red dragon will set events in motion that could save or doom them all.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Going to the Circus that night was a whim, but it would change their lives forever.When siblings Emma and Nemo Reeve went to the Circus Phantasm, they expected tantalizing glimpses of magic. Instead, they are drawn out of the cage of secrets they have built, and swept away from their small town lives. Here, their hidden magical talents can flourish. They can travel with fantastical creatures. They may even have found--at last--a home.But the Ringmaster has his own dark secrets. His past is coming to haunt him, and now danger stalks them all. Emma and Nemo must determine who to trust, before the Circus unravels, the performers become prisoners, and their growing talents turn them into targets for a greater enemy than they have ever imagined.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The capital has fallen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling rules Ravka from his shadow throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the nation's fate rests with a broken Sun Summoner, a disgraced tracker, and the shattered remnants of a once-great magical army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in an ancient network of tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina must submit to the dubious protection of the Apparat and the zealots who worship her as a Saint. Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova's amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling's secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction—and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she’s fighting for.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land, all while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. But she can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her—or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by enemies, the once-great nation of Ravka has been torn in two by the Shadow Fold, a swath of near impenetrable darkness crawling with monsters who feast on human flesh. Now its fate may rest on the shoulders of one lonely refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Starkov has never been good at anything. But when her regiment is attacked on the Fold and her best friend is brutally injured, Alina reveals a dormant power that saves his life—a power that could be the key to setting her war-ravaged country free. Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . and the secrets of her heart.</description>

  <description>Who is the Hero of Ages?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler. But as a result, the Deepness—the lethal form of the ubiquitous mists—is back, along with increasingly heavy ashfalls and ever more powerful earthquakes. Humanity appears to be doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having escaped death at the climax of &lt;i&gt;The Well of Ascension&lt;/i&gt; only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend lest Ruin learn their plans!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Clear and Effective Approach to Learning DBT Skills&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First developed for treating borderline personality disorder, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has proven effective as treatment for a range of other mental health problems, especially for those characterized by overwhelming emotions. Research shows that DBT can improve your ability to handle distress without losing control and acting destructively. In order to make use of these techniques, you need to build skills in four key areas-distress tolerance, mindfulness, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook&lt;/b&gt;, a collaborative effort from three esteemed authors, offers straightforward, step-by-step exercises for learning these concepts and putting them to work for real and lasting change. Start by working on the introductory exercises and, after making progress, move on to the advanced-skills chapters. Whether you are a professional or a general reader, whether you use this book to support work done in therapy or as the basis for self-help, you'll benefit from this clear and practical guide to better managing your emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit — an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties. Used alone or in conjunction with therapy, our books offer powerful tools readers can use to jump-start changes in their lives.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Electrical Menagerie, one-of-a-kind robotic roadshow, is bankrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sylvester Carthage, illusionist and engineer, has the eccentric imagination the Menagerie needs to succeed creatively -- but none of the people skills. Fast-talking Arbrook Huxley, meanwhile, has all the savvy the Menagerie needs to succeed commercially -- but none of the scruples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save their show, Carthage &amp;amp; Huxley risk everything in a royal talent competition, vying for the once-in-a-lifetime chance to perform for the Future Celestial Queen. In this stardust-and-spark-powered empire of floating islands and flying trains, The Electrical Menagerie's bid at fame and fortune means weathering the glamorous and cutthroat world of critics, high society, and rival magicians -- but with real conspiracy lurking beneath tabloid controversy, there's more at stake in this contest than the prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the glittery haze of flash paper and mirrors, every competitor has something to hide... and it's the lies Carthage &amp;amp; Huxley tell each other that may cost them everything.</description>

  <description>Anissa Robson is becoming an adult in a society she never really identified with. Forced to choose a career path, she becomes an apprentice to a young, headstrong politician who seems to stand for everything she disagrees with. The dreams she has refused to report grow more alluring to her as she becomes disillusioned with her job. But the lines between reality and her dreamland begin to blur and cross over, launching her onto a path she would never have chosen for herself. Is the government medicating Dreamers to protect them? Or to hide something from them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When man and machine are one and the same, time moves differently.&lt;br /&gt;But it runs out all the same.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Asterion Dominion government has fallen, its rulers slain—but in the Dominion, the dead rarely stay that way. A doomsday clock rushes headlong toward the day the monstrous alien shapeshifters known as the Rasu will demand their next tribute of lives. When denied it, the Rasu will burn every Dominion world to the ground. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless they can be stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nika, Dashiel and their allies fight to hold onto the reigns of power even as they search for a way to defeat the enemy. Their quest will take them from barren deserts to a remote wilderness to the hidden homeworld of an ancient, mysterious species, all to uncover a secret 700,000 years in the keeping. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything they thought they knew now called into question and the reckoning at hand, the Asterions’ past, present and future will collide in a last daring gambit to save all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ASTERION NOIR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;700,000 years ago, the Asterions fled persecution for their pro-synthetic beliefs. In the safe harbor of a distant galaxy, they have evolved into a true biosynthetic race and built a thriving society upon the pillars of personal autonomy, mutual respect and boundless innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that society is fracturing at the seams. Beneath lies built upon lies, the shocking truth as to why threatens the future of not merely the Asterions, but all life in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyberpunk and space opera collide in a thrilling new trilogy from the author of the epic &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rhapsody&lt;/i&gt; space opera saga. Enter a world of technological wonders, exotic alien life, enthralling characters, captivating worlds—and a terrifying evil lurking in the void that will shatter it all.</description>

  <description>This prestige hardcover collects the next two arcs of the critically acclaimed and New York Times bestselling series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "Conclave," the 16 Families have gathered together in the exclusive luxury confines of Triton One to resolve the emerging conflict between Carlyle and Hock, and they've brought their Lazari with them. While Forever's romance with the Morray Lazarus, Joacquim, continues to blossom, she finds herself not only questioning her identity, but also her loyalty to her Family and her father, Malcolm, when orders her to kill her brother, Jonah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, in "Poison," the world is at war, and Family Carlyle is struggling to defend itself. With Malcolm Carlyle hovering at death's door, the siblings struggle to maintain control. But deception and war go hand in hand, culminating in a final revelation that will truly change everything for Forever Carlyle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And! Never-before-seen work by Michael Lark and graphic designer Eric Trautmann, and exclusive world-building content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It collects Lazarus numbered 10-21 with additional bonus content.</description>

  <description>They did the impossible, deposing the godlike being whose brutal rule had lasted a thousand years. Now Vin, the street urchin who has grown into the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and Elend Venture, the idealistic young nobleman who loves her, must build a healthy new society in the ashes of an empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have barely begun when three separate armies attack. As the siege tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may just be that killing the Lord Ruler was the easy part. Surviving the aftermath of his fall is going to be the real challenge.</description>

  <description>Since it was first published in 1986, &lt;i&gt;On Being a Therapist&lt;/i&gt; has become a classic book in the field and has proved to be one of the most inspiring sources of guidance for aspiring and seasoned practitioners alike. Jeffrey Kottler provides a candid account of the profound ways in which therapists influence clients and, in turn, are impacted personally and professionally by these encounters. He shows how therapists can learn, develop, and grow during the process of therapy and explains how practitioners can use the professional skills and insights gained from their sessions to address their own personal issues, realize positive change in themselves, and so become better helpers for others. This thoroughly revised edition includes discussion about how the business and practice of therapy has changed in recent years, the effects of technology and managed care, the breakdown of theoretical orientation, and the greater client diversity represented in contemporary practice.</description>

  <description>The scariest thing about Wanderland isn't death--it's the momerath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now Dinah is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Carroll has spent the better part of her life avoiding Wanderland--and the momerath--at all costs. But now with her sister gone, Alice has only one place to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Wanderland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with only her blade and a raging vendetta against the traitorous Red Queen, Alice storms the undead wasteland to find Dinah and atone for her mistakes. But with relentless momerath and a ruthless Queen encroaching, will Alice's determination be enough? Or will she fall down a new rabbit hole searching for revenge?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Mists rule the night.&lt;br /&gt;The Lord Ruler owns the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once, a hero arose to save the world. A young man with a mysterious heritage courageously challenged the darkness that strangled the land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a thousand years since, the world has been a wasteland of ash and mist ruled by the immortal emperor known as the Lord Ruler. Every revolt has failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet somehow, hope survives. Hope that dares to dream of ending the empire and even the Lord Ruler himself. A new kind of uprising is being planned, one built around the ultimate caper, one that depends on the cunning of a brilliant criminal mastermind and the determination of an unlikely heroine, a street urchin who must learn to master Allomancy, the power of a Mistborn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sing your truth. Defend your dream. Defy your stars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A month has passed since Iris joined an underground rebel group to save Dámiul from the brutal prison he was sent to for fighting back against his world’s oppressive system. Here, conformity and compliance are enforced through telepathy, and Earthling performers are brainwashed into absolute obedience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of a merciless crackdown on those who sympathize with their cause leaves both Iris and Dámiul yearning for action. Determined to liberate her kind, Iris volunteers to return to her former patrons and covertly recruit supporters.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A raid on their hideout catapults her plan into action sooner than expected and forces her to leave Dámiul behind. After persuading the authorities that she’d been telepathically manipulated into helping him, Iris assumes the role of a dutiful musician while secretly spreading whispers of a possible uprising among her fellow performers. But the authorities always seem to be one step ahead, and anyone who defies them is swiftly mind-wiped.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon, Iris is forced to confront a horrifying fact: there’s a traitor among them. Desperately clinging to her cover, she races to find out who before her true loyalties are discovered—and the search leads her to an unthinkable answer.</description>

  <description>In a dystopian near-future government is a quaint concept, resources are coveted, and posession is 100% of the law. A handful of Families rule, jealously guarding what they have and exploiting the Waste who struggle to survive in their domains. Forever Carlyle defends her family's holdings through deception and force as their protector, their Lazarus. Shot dead defending the family home, Forever's day goes downhill from there.</description>

  <description>A SciFi retelling of Beauty and the Beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two reasons people move to Ilford: to study at the renowned scientific research center, or to escape society. Dr. Richter intends to further his research.

  <description>Before she hired a huntsman to steal a heart, she surrendered her own. After years of torture and abuse from her wicked mother-a woman consumed by her lust for dark magic-Grishelda finally finds happiness in her marriage to a king. The joy is fleeting when the king's daughter grows jealous and threatens to drive a wedge between the newly married couple. Grishelda knows if she has any chance at a happily ever after, she must act-even if that means using dark magic. With each use of the seductive magic, Grishelda risks ruining the love she never thought she'd find and succumbing to the darkness she's always feared.</description>

  <description>Tobias Kaya doesn't care about The Savior. He doesn't care that She's the Ruler of the realm or that She purified the land, and he certainly doesn't care that She's of age to be married. But when competing for Her hand proves to be his last chance to save his family, he's forced to make The Savior his priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Tobias is thrown into the Sovereign's Tournament with nineteen other men, and each of them is fighting -- and killing -- for the chance to rule at The Savior's side. Instantly his world is plagued with violence, treachery, and manipulation, revealing the hidden ugliness of his proud realm. And when his circumstances seem especially dire, he stumbles into an unexpected romance, one that opens him up to unimaginable dangers and darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trigger warning: this novel contains graphic violence, adult language, and sexual situations.</description>

  <description>The paranormal attacks have escalated and the stakes are climbing as Kyle Hanson returns to Greensborough Louisiana with one last, dying hope of finding his little brother alive. But after the violent death of a fellow cast member and the suspension of his television show, Kyle has new challenges to face. As the tenuous relationship between him and his step-father and step-brother starts to break apart, Kyle embarks on one last desperate visit to the haunted woods where Tyler disappeared. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kyle goes driving alone in the early morning around Haven park, he finds the end of his search. A car crash. A heavy fog. A figure on a bridge, beckoning for him to follow. And Tyler, standing in the road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this thrilling finale to the first season of The Raventree Society, questions will be answered and more will be raised as Kyle comes face to face with the most dangerous spirit he’s faced yet.</description>

  <description>Kyle Hanson has nearly given up hope for his brother's rescue. If Tyler’s disappearance isn’t bad enough, Kyle is trapped in a contract as a paranormal investigator on a popular reality TV show and he seems to be attracting violent attacks from ghosts wherever he goes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Kyle prepares for another show, his Step-Father and Step-brother are trying to keep the search in hopes of finding Tyler alive. But the local authorities have given up and are urging the family to do the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Kyle and his crew film in a bar in Georgia known for its violent spiritual activity, Kyle is given a new reason to hope. And a new reason to fear as the angry spirit of a murdered serial killer turns its focus on Kyle.</description>

      <![CDATA[It’s been a while since I finished up episode 3 of this series, so I was pretty excited to finally read the last two episodes. This one was really good and pulled me right back into the story, reminding me of all the reasons why I love the series in the first place. It stared off a little slow fo...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When man and machine are one and the same, death is no longer an inevitability. But in the darkest reaches of space, neither is life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diplomat. &lt;br /&gt;Rebel. &lt;br /&gt;Fugitive. &lt;br /&gt;Nika Tescarav has lived many lives, though she no longer remembers most of them. Chased by agents of a regime that will do anything to protect the secrets of the Rasu Protocol, Nika flees to the stars with her once and future lover on a mission to expose those secrets. A race across alien worlds both exotic and deadly leads them to the bastion of the enemy, but its discovery brings a terrible revelation: sometimes the truth is indeed worse than the lies spun to conceal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Nika and Dashiel on the run, NOIR steps up to defend against a virulent pathogen unleashed upon innocent civilians. When a desperate government moves to crush the resistance once and for all, unlikely alliances are forged between former adversaries and all paths converge in an explosive showdown that will change the future of the Asterion Dominion forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ASTERION NOIR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;700,000 years ago, the Asterions fled persecution for their pro-synthetic beliefs. In the safe harbor of a distant galaxy, they have evolved into a true biosynthetic race and built a thriving society upon the pillars of personal autonomy, mutual respect and boundless innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that society is fracturing at the seams. Beneath lies built upon lies, the shocking truth as to why threatens the future of not merely the Asterions, but all life in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyberpunk and space opera collide in a thrilling new trilogy from the author of the epic &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rhapsody&lt;/i&gt; space opera saga. Enter a world of technological wonders, exotic alien life, enthralling characters, captivating worlds—and a terrifying evil lurking in the void that will shatter it all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A pioneering researcher and one of the world’s foremost experts on traumatic stress offers a bold new paradigm for healing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Such experiences inevitably leave traces on minds, emotions, and even on biology. Sadly, trauma sufferers frequently pass on their stress to their partners and children.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Renowned trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk has spent over three decades working with survivors. In &lt;i&gt;The Body Keeps the Score&lt;/i&gt;, he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the brain’s wiring—specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement, control, and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play, yoga, and other therapies. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, &lt;i&gt;The Body Keeps the Score &lt;/i&gt;offers proven alternatives to drugs and talk therapy—and a way to reclaim lives.</description>

  <description>What comes after surrender?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bas willingly returned to the Compound, Menrva swore his sacrifice wouldn’t be in vain. As Bunker hurtles toward an uncertain future, she determines to do whatever it takes to give humanity their best chance.&lt;br /&gt;All Cowl can think about is rescuing Bas. He incites riots among the citizens in hopes of breaking down the doors, not knowing that Menrva’s abusive husband is staging a violent coup. Civil war breaks out in the Compound and Bas and Menrva are caught in the middle of it.&lt;br /&gt;But something far more dangerous already stalks the corridors of the Hub. Something that is already taking control of Bas’ mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second book in the Malfunction trilogy ramps up the tension and action, as Cowl, Menrva, and Bas must find the will to fight a battle that seems to have been lost from the beginning.</description>

  <description>For suspense-filled, post-apocalyptic thrillers, &lt;i&gt;Wool&lt;/i&gt; is more than a self-published ebook phenomenon―it’s the new standard in classic science fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a ruined and toxic future, a community exists in a giant silo underground, hundreds of stories deep. There, men and women live in a society full of regulations they believe are meant to protect them. Sheriff Holston, who has unwaveringly upheld the silo’s rules for years, unexpectedly breaks the greatest taboo of all: He asks to go outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His fateful decision unleashes a drastic series of events. An unlikely candidate is appointed to replace him: Juliette, a mechanic with no training in law, whose special knack is fixing machines. Now Juliette is about to be entrusted with fixing her silo, and she will soon learn just how badly her world is broken. The silo is about to confront what its history has only hinted about and its inhabitants have never dared to whisper. Uprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, as well as Kindle Book Review’s 2012 Indie Book of the Year, &lt;i&gt;Wool&lt;/i&gt; is truly a blockbuster.</description>

  <description>“Given Cameron Waters’ history of traumas in and outside of foster care, we believe he was acting in self-defense toward his foster parent’s abusive behaviors…We see a great potential of rehabilitation in him. He’s a good kid,” Garry argues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Good kids don't hit their foster parents and destroy other people's property."&lt;br /&gt;My stomach drops as I look down at my fingers, twitching like spiders, wishing they could climb up the walls and disappear. I don’t remember everything that happened. It was self-defense. Wasn’t it? He started beating on me first. Right? Would they believe that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At what point does flight become fight? Cameron has reached his threshold. Will he run? Or will he fight back? On a journey of finding family, peace, and love, he must first learn to win the battle in his head.</description>

  <description>They killed my mother.&lt;br /&gt;They took our magic.&lt;br /&gt;They tried to bury us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zélie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers and her growing feelings for an enemy.</description>

  <description>A heartrending but ultimately uplifting debut novel about learning to accept life's uncertainties; a perfect fit for the current trend in contemporary realistic novels that confront issues about life, death, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Rose Levenson has a decision to make: Does she want to know how she's going to die? Because when Rose turns eighteen, she can take the test that tells her if she carries the genetic mutation for Huntington's disease, the degenerative condition that is slowly killing her mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a fifty-fifty shot at inheriting her family's genetic curse, Rose is skeptical about pursuing anything that presumes she'll live to be a healthy adult-including her dream career in ballet and the possibility of falling in love. But when she meets a boy from a similarly flawed genetic pool and gets an audition for a dance scholarship across the country, Rose begins to question her carefully laid rules.</description>

  <description>As a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the Great Depression, and for Jacob the circus was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an untrainable elephant who was the great gray hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was ultimately their only hope for survival.</description>

  <description>Scenes are useful fictional units, and if a single unit falters, then an entire novel or short story can be weakened. This title explains the fundamentals of strong scene construction and how other useful fiction-writing techniques, such as character development, description, and transitions must function within the framework of individual scenes.</description>

  <description>Kyle Hanson went from faking paranormal activity for a camera to two paranormal attacks in as many days. Both times, the attackers have left behind a single clue to their aggression: the name of Kyle's missing brother, Tyler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle returns to filming with The Raventree Society with two goals: find out what the spirits know about Tyler and get out alive. And when the team is invited to investigate a plantation house with ties to the underground railroad and sighting of multiple paranormal entities, Kyle could fail both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't take long for Kyle to find out that the rumors of hauntings at the Coal Mansion are much more than just legend. And when the sun goes down and the investigation of the house begins, Kyle quickly finds himself separate from the group and at the mercy of an entity that has no desire to reveal any secrets.</description>

  <description>Magic was supposed to make stealing easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since her parents' deaths, Yeta has been stuck stealing in order to pay back their debt to the city's most dangerous crime lord. Though she clings to her dream of one day attending the prestigious Academy, the closest she's managed to get is impersonating a student and using her aptitude for ink magic to aid in her thefts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when her ink dragon inexplicably develops a mind of its own, debt is the least of her worries. With an arrogant Academy student as her only ally, she'll have to get back what her inkling stole--or more than her future could be at stake.</description>

  <description>In 2025, with the world descending into madness and anarchy, one woman begins a fateful journey toward a better future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Olamina and her family live in one of the only safe neighborhoods remaining on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Behind the walls of their defended enclave, Lauren’s father, a preacher, and a handful of other citizens try to salvage what remains of a culture that has been destroyed by drugs, disease, war, and chronic water shortages. While her father tries to lead people on the righteous path, Lauren struggles with hyperempathy, a condition that makes her extraordinarily sensitive to the pain of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fire destroys their compound, Lauren’s family is killed and she is forced out into a world that is fraught with danger. With a handful of other refugees, Lauren must make her way north to safety, along the way conceiving a revolutionary idea that may mean salvation for all mankind.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When man and machine are one and the same, there are many crimes but only one sin: psyche-wipe. The secrets it has buried could lead to a civilization's salvation, or to its doom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Asterion Dominion is at peace with its neighbors and itself. Its citizens enjoy great freedoms and all the luxuries their biosynthetic minds can imagine, design and create. But beneath the idyllic veneer, something is going wrong. People are going wrong, driven to commit inexplicable crimes without motive or purpose. And once imprisoned for those crimes, they simply vanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psyche-wiped and dumped in an alley 5 years ago, awakened into a culture where ancestral memories stretch back for millennia, Nika Tescarav's past is a blank canvas. But if whoever erased her did so in the hope of silencing her, they should have tried harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone must speak for the lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone must uncover how and why they became lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone must find the lost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nika is that someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ASTERION NOIR&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;700,000 years ago, the Asterions fled persecution for their pro-synthetic beliefs. In the safe harbor of a distant galaxy, they have evolved into a true biosynthetic race and built a thriving society upon the pillars of personal autonomy, mutual respect and boundless innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that society is fracturing at the seams. Beneath lies built upon lies, the shocking truth as to why threatens the future of not merely the Asterions, but all life in the universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyberpunk and space opera collide in a thrilling new trilogy from the author of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rhapsody&lt;/i&gt; space opera saga. Enter a world of technological wonders, exotic alien life, enthralling characters, captivating settings—and a terrifying evil lurking in the void that will shatter it all.</description>

  <description>Kyle goes very quickly from being a staunch skeptic to a reluctant believer after he is attacked by an angry spirit shortly after psychically experiencing the last victims deaths. What he can’t quite figure out is why the ghost knew the name of his missing brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Looking for answers, and maybe a glimpse at Tyler’s fate, Kyle returns for what seems like the hundredth time, to the forest where Tyler went missing. But this time, he goes at midnight, and he brings along unwanted company. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Answers might elusive, but there is something lurking in those woods. And Kyle, along with the Stepfather he could never accept and stepbrother he could never stop arguing with, are about to find out exactly what. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Kyle Hanson was not a believer. &lt;br /&gt;That was a bit hypocritical since he made his living as a paranormal investigator on a TV show that was highly rated among it's demographic of unemployed college dropouts and late-night drinkers. Despite that, he was quite proud of his resilient doubt until the night his brother disappeared while recording an episode in the supposedly haunted woods around Greensborough, Louisiana. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That wasn't what shook his stalwart lack of faith. No, the event that changed his perspective was the night that followed three months afterward, and what he saw at the Strawberry Lane Motel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first in a Supernatural Thriller, Short Story Serial.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a great first episode to the Raventree Society series. It was easy to become invested in the main character right off the bat, and he has a strong point of view that carries the story well. This particular episode reminded me a little bit of Stephen King's short story '1408' (which happen...]]>

  <description>Throughout her studies, Ceony Twill has harbored a secret, one she’s kept from even her mentor, Emery Thane. She’s discovered how to practice forms of magic other than her own—an ability long thought impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all seems set for Ceony to complete her apprenticeship and pass her upcoming final magician’s exam, life quickly becomes complicated. To avoid favoritism, Emery sends her to another paper magician for testing, a Folder who despises Emery and cares even less for his apprentice. To make matters worse, a murderous criminal from Ceony’s past escapes imprisonment. Now she must track the power-hungry convict across England before he can take his revenge. With her life and loved ones hanging in the balance, Ceony must face a criminal who wields the one magic that she does not, and it may prove more powerful than all her skills combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whimsical and captivating follow-up to The Paper Magician and The Glass Magician, The Master Magician will enchant readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>Three months after returning Magician Emery Thane’s heart to his body, Ceony Twill is well on her way to becoming a Folder. Unfortunately, not all of Ceony’s thoughts have been focused on paper magic. Though she was promised romance by a fortuity box, Ceony still hasn’t broken the teacher-student barrier with Emery, despite their growing closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a magician with a penchant for revenge believes that Ceony possesses a secret, he vows to discover it…even if it tears apart the very fabric of their magical world. After a series of attacks target Ceony and catch those she holds most dear in the crossfire, Ceony knows she must find the true limits of her powers…and keep her knowledge from falling into wayward hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delightful sequel to Charlie N. Holmberg’s The Paper Magician, The Glass Magician will charm readers young and old alike.</description>

  <description>Ceony Twill arrives at the cottage of Magician Emery Thane with a broken heart. Having graduated at the top of her class from the Tagis Praff School for the Magically Inclined, Ceony is assigned an apprenticeship in paper magic despite her dreams of bespelling metal. And once she’s bonded to paper, that will be her only magic… forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the spells Ceony learns under the strange yet kind Thane turn out to be more marvelous than she could have ever imagined — animating paper creatures, bringing stories to life via ghostly images, even reading fortunes. But as she discovers these wonders, Ceony also learns of the extraordinary dangers of forbidden magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Excisioner — a practitioner of dark, flesh magic — invades the cottage and rips Thane’s heart from his chest. To save her teacher’s life, Ceony must face the evil magician and embark on an unbelievable adventure that will take her into the chambers of Thane’s still-beating heart—and reveal the very soul of the man.</description>

  <description>Two years before Beatrice Prior made her choice, the sixteen-year-old son of Abnegation’s faction leader did the same. Tobias’s transfer to Dauntless is a chance to begin again. Here, he will not be called the name his parents gave him. Here, he will not let fear turn him into a cowering child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly christened “Four,” he discovers during initiation that he will succeed in Dauntless. Initiation is only the beginning, though; Four must claim his place in the Dauntless hierarchy. His decisions will affect future initiates as well as uncover secrets that could threaten his own future—and the future of the entire faction system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, Four is poised to take action, but the course is still unclear. The first new initiate who jumps into the net might change all that. With her, the way to righting their world might become clear. With her, it might become possible to be Tobias once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Veronica Roth comes a companion volume to the worldwide bestselling DIVERGENT series, told from the per-spective of the immensely popular character Tobias. The four pieces included here—THE TRANSFER, THE INITIATE, THE SON, and THE TRAITOR—plus three additional exclusive scenes, give readers an electrifying glimpse into the history and heart of Tobias, and set the stage for the epic saga of the DIVERGENT trilogy.</description>

  <description>The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered - fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningliess. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.</description>

  <description>The otter family has a problem: little Oggie only wants to eat orange foods. His mother does not understand and she tries to convince him to taste different foods--foods that children usually love--but Oggie is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;interested. Frustrated and on the verge of giving up, his mother has a brilliant idea. Both Oggie and his mom learn that when they change their perspectives, great things happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heartwarming, relatable story of a mother and son that can be enjoyed by picky eaters and foodies alike.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a charming story about a picky eater - something parents and kids alike can relate to. I'm always a little skeptical about picture books that rhyme because they can feel forced, but the rhymes work well here and make this a fun read.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the world doesn't want&lt;br /&gt;you to be who you are,&lt;br /&gt;you must become more yourself&lt;br /&gt;than you knew you could be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;London. 1789.&lt;/b&gt; More than anything in the world, Wendy Darling wants to be the captain of a ship, but women aren't allowed in the Royal Navy. When she learns the Home Office is accepting a handful of women into its ranks, she jumps at the chance, joining the fight against the most formidable threat England has ever faced. Magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the secret service isn't exactly what she hoped. Accompanied by a reimagined cast of the original &lt;i&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/i&gt;, Wendy soon discovers that her dreams are as far away as ever, that choosing sides isn't as simple as she thought, and that the only man who isn't blinded by her gender might be the worst friend anyone could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone, that is, except Wendy Darling.</description>

      <![CDATA[When I stumbled upon this book by pure coincidence a few weeks ago, I was immediately struck by the cover art. To be perfectly honest, that was probably 75% of the reason why I decided to give the story a try. I know, I know - don't judge a book by its cover and all that. But I can't help myself....]]>

  <description>One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Veronica Roth's much-anticipated second book of the dystopian DIVERGENT series is another intoxicating thrill ride of a story, rich with hallmark twists, heartbreaks, romance, and powerful insights about human nature.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>They Say the Ends Justify The Means&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Menrva, a geneticist in the subterranean city of survivors known as Bunker, responds to a call for help from Cowl, her former best friend, and Bas, a renegade cyborg, she makes a vital mistake and places all three of them in danger. As they struggle to escape City guards, cyborg soldiers, desperate scavengers, and ravenous aliens, they find in each other something they never expected: family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a battle, an attacking cyborg manages to overcome her programming just long enough to deliver a cryptic message. The trio is forced to decide if they will risk death - or worse, capture - to seek out the truth about the City, or if they will fight only for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fast-paced, gritty first book of the Malfunction Trilogy introduces a future caught between destruction and oppression, where Menrva and her friends must decide if the ends justify the means.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The end of the world began with a library query…how will it conclude?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What began as a chance discovery of an anomalous signal is now a multiverse war between humanity and its genetic ancestors over who controls the levers of life and death. Over who decides what life is and whether it will be allowed to exist. For the ruling Anaden Directorate, victory means immortality. For humanity, defeat means extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the heels of a breakthrough in wormhole technology, AEGIS and the anarchs enjoy the upper hand in the war. But their escalation pushes the Directorate to the brink, and now it will stop at nothing to destroy its enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Dangerous we can do. Nearly impossible we can do. All we need is the tiniest odds of success.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Directorate has perfected the art of conquest through obliteration. But humanity has advantages the Anadens do not. They are led by a woman who’s made a career of meeting the devil at the crossroads and sending him home in defeat. Caleb Marano wields a power as ancient as the universe itself. Alex Solovy manipulates the fabric of space-time at her whim. Unlike the Directorate, they fight for something greater than themselves. And now, they have one more Solovy on the team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the thrilling finale of Aurora Rhapsody, events rush headlong toward an explosive conclusion that will decide the fate of civilizations, and only the victor is making it out the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our universe is but a snowglobe—an experiment born of desperation and hope. The true universe is unfathomably vast, teeming with life and untold wonders. And it is enslaved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Created by ancient aliens in a daring gambit to understand the nature of the enemy, humanity is now asked to be the savior of a universe not their own. If they are to succeed, they must rise above not only their fractious past but the sins of their genetic ancestors to boldly embrace a future they never dared imagine possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Some melodies reach across the stars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2157, the Adryil—an advanced race of telepathic humanoids—contacted Earth. A century later, 15-year-old violist Iris Lei considers herself lucky to attend Papilio, a prestigious performing arts school powered by their technology. Born penniless, Iris’s one shot at a better life is to attract an Adryil patron. But only the best get hired, and competition is fierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sudden encounter with an Adryil boy upends her world. Iris longs to learn about him and his faraway realm, but after the authorities arrest him for trespassing, the only evidence she has of his existence is the mysterious alien device he slipped to her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When she starts hearing his voice in her head, she wonders if her world of backstabbing artists and pressure for perfection is driving her insane. Then, she discovers that her visions of him are real—by way of telepathy—and soon finds herself lost in the kind of impossible love she depicts in her music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even as their bond deepens, Iris realizes that he’s hiding something from her—and it’s dangerous. Her quest for answers leads her past her sheltered world to a strange planet lightyears away, where she uncovers secrets about Earth’s alien allies that shatter everything she knows.</description>

  <description>Perfect Mexican daughters do not go away to college. And they do not move out of their parents’ house after high school graduation. Perfect Mexican daughters never abandon their family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Julia is not your perfect Mexican daughter. That was Olga’s role. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then a tragic accident on the busiest street in Chicago leaves Olga dead and Julia left behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family. And no one seems to acknowledge that Julia is broken, too. Instead, her mother seems to channel her grief into pointing out every possible way Julia has failed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But it’s not long before Julia discovers that Olga might not have been as perfect as everyone thought. With the help of her best friend Lorena, and her first kiss, first love, first everything boyfriend Connor, Julia is determined to find out. Was Olga really what she seemed? Or was there more to her sister’s story? And either way, how can Julia even attempt to live up to a seemingly impossible ideal?</description>

  <description>The Fellowship was scattered. Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor–the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in The Return of the King.</description>

In return, the woman’s fighting sailors will rescue Kinneret’s sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Salt Magic to navigate cursed waters, Kinneret and Calev struggle to hide their taboo, caste-breaking feelings, knowing if the ruler witnesses the attraction, she will cancel the agreement.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“We are you—the you that you could have been.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anaden Directorate has ruled Amaranthe for millennia, subjugating species and galaxies in a neverending quest for control and order. For as many millennia, the anarchs have rebelled, defiantly claiming their own freedom yet without hope of winning it for everyone. Now, an alliance with humans offers a tantalizing chance to at last defeat their immortal masters. But can they trust an ally who looks suspiciously like the enemy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humanity is the genetic recreation of the Anadens, but genetics aren’t everything. Humans like to make their own destiny, and they have overcome great challenges to achieve unprecedented peace and prosperity. But have their trials prepared them for the enemy they now face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The battle for the heart and soul of Amaranthe will be joined, and we must be unafraid.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst the chaos of an escalating war, Caleb’s bond with the mysterious &lt;i&gt;diati&lt;/i&gt; grows ever more powerful, even as Alex’s forays into the hidden dimensions of the universe lead them to unfathomable places. But when the anarchs are pushed to the breaking point and the AEGIS fleet is dealt a devastating blow, Miriam Solovy must find a way to defeat a foe wielding superior technology, firepower and numbers, or else more than one civilization will be lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our universe is but a snowglobe—an experiment born of desperation and hope. The true universe is unfathomably vast, teeming with life and untold wonders. And it is enslaved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Created by ancient aliens in a daring gambit to understand the nature of the enemy, humanity is now asked to be the savior of a universe not their own. If they are to succeed, they must rise above not only their fractious past but the sins of their genetic ancestors to boldly embrace a future they never dared imagine possible.</description>

  <description>With everyone he cares about either dead or long absent, Cowl Coven has lost interest in life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Despite the endless distractions of a high-profile job as a programmer in the Hub and nightly runs into the chasm below for the black market, he still finds himself looking for a way out. When a hacked piece of data reveals what seems to be human life on the desolate, alien-infested surface of Earth, he thinks he might have just found it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What he finds instead is secret government project that has destroyed the lives of thousands. Human beings are being mangled and equipped with mechanical devices that rob them of all self-agency. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cowl is forced to decide if he will hold on to a safe life he doesn't really want or if he's going to accept the danger to save one of the victims</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Humanity may have colonized much of the galaxy, but space remains as dangerous as ever, and so do the people inhabiting it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alexis Solovy--space explorer, freelance scout, recalcitrant wanderer--lands the contract of a lifetime, the race is on to claim the prize. Now she must not only outrun but outsmart her rivals to uncover the secrets of an ancient, mysterious pulsar. For deep in the void, far beyond the reach of civilization, wealth and renown matter little absent the ultimate reward: survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set five years before &lt;i&gt;STARSHINE: Aurora Rising Book One (Aurora Rhapsody #1)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;VENATORIS&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; takes a younger, wilder, rough-around-the-edges Alexis Solovy and Kennedy Rossi on an unforgettable adventure across the stars.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;VENATORIS&lt;/i&gt; was initially published in &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Stars: A Planet Too Far&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.com/B01DMZUIEM" rel="nofollow"&gt;amzn.com/B01DMZUIEM&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>My disease is as rare as it is famous. It’s a form of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, but basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in fifteen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes failure is just the beginning&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All Lai has ever wanted is to become a priestess, like her mother and grandmother before her, in service to their beloved goddess. That’s before the unthinkable happens, and Lai fails the trials she has trained for her entire life. She makes the only choice she believes she can: she runs away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her isolated desert homeland, Lai rides north to the colder, stranger kingdom of Alanum—a land where magic, and female warriors, are not commonplace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, she hears tales about a mountain city of women guardians and steel forgers, worshiping goddesses who sound very similar to Lai's own. Determined to learn more about these women, these Keepers of the Dawn, Lai travels onward to find their temple. She is determined to make up for her past failure, and will do whatever it takes to join their sacred order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with another initiate was not part of the plan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keeper of the Dawn&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of new beginnings, second chances, and the endurance of hope.</description>

  <description>A dangerous romance, a stolen sister, and the mythical treasure that could change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first in the Uncommon World series, Waters of Salt and Sin combines the epic setting of Game of Thrones with the humor and romance of Pirates of the Caribbean. Perfect for fans of Sabaa Tahir and Sarah J. Maas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save her sister from starvation and hold on to her relationship with Calev--the high-caste friend she secretly loves--Kinneret sets out for a lost island of silver. But when a madman enslaves her sister, Kinneret must make a deal with the local ruler: Help the leader find the island and secure the ruler's place in history. In return, the leader's fighting sailors will rescue her sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Salt Magic to navigate cursed waters, Kinneret and Calev struggle to hide their taboo, caste-breaking feelings for one another, knowing if the ruler witnesses the attraction, she'll cancel the agreement. But when Calev makes a terrible mistake, Kinneret must choose between the life of her only remaining family member and saving the boy she loves from a traitor's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: This book is clean, but spicy kissing abounds.&lt;br /&gt;*Appropriate for 13 and up</description>

  <description>"Rama would trade almost anything for the chance to become someone else, even for a little while."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the small, rural town of Aldale, West Virginia, Ramachandra “Rama” Ganeshan wants nothing more than to avoid dressing rooms for the rest of her life. After a brutal assault destroys her confidence and self-esteem, she yearns to be someone else . . . someone pretty, popular, and loved—until multiple girls in town are found murdered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After stumbling across her beautiful classmate’s body and a terrifyingly familiar face in the murderer, Rama encounters a group of shapeshifters who know more of the killings than they let on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only by earning the shapeshifters’ trust and becoming one of them will Rama be able to help serve justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, she must learn to love herself and confront her painful past—and find the courage to investigate the violence.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>“Behind her, an unnatural howl ripped through the air. Alice’s chest tightened and she had to fight to breathe. It was too late. The momerath were coming.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since the outbreak of the Plague, life hasn’t been easy, and for seventeen-year-old Alice Carroll, it just got worse. Her sister, Dinah, has contracted the ‘un-deadly’ Momerath Virus and without a cure, will soon be worse than dead. She’ll be momerath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice must leave the safety of the Sector and venture into Momerath Territory to find the antidote - if it exists. Chasing a rumor about a mysterious doctor with the cure, Alice falls down the rabbit hole into Wanderland, where ravenous momerath aren’t the only danger lurking.</description>

  <description>In this striking literary debut, Carol Rifka Brunt unfolds a moving story of love, grief, and renewal as two lonely people become the unlikeliest of friends and find that sometimes you don't know you've lost someone until you've found them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1987. There's only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that's her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn's company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June's world is turned upside down. But Finn's death brings a surprise acquaintance into June's life—someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Finn's funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn's apartment, and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June realizes she's not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she needs the most. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An emotionally charged coming-of-age novel, &lt;i&gt;Tell the Wolves I'm Home&lt;/i&gt; is a tender story of love lost and found, an unforgettable portrait of the way compassion can make us whole again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I’d tell you to be careful, but we wouldn’t be here if you’d ever taken that advice. No reason to start now, right?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For millennia the Anadens have ruled the known universe. They believe they’ve crafted the perfect empire, ordered and impervious to challenge. They believe the fight has been crushed out of the species they subjugate. They are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a suicide mission, without a doubt. Alex Solovy and Caleb Marano must steal crucial intelligence from the Anadens’ central military headquarters. To succeed, they’ll need to navigate a strange universe ruled by a cabal of powerful immortals, populated by aliens they’ve never met and fueled by technology they’ve never seen. They’re going to need a little help—the kind of help only a suicidally defiant anarchist on the run from more than just personal demons can provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Anaden agents close in, back home in Aurora humanity races to prepare. Steeled from the Metigen invasion and the rise of Prevos, no longer will they wait for doom to come to them. Forewarned the Anadens intend to crush them out of existence, humans, Artificials and Prevos join together to bring the war to the doorstep of the enemy, even as a shadowy foe re-emerges to jeopardize all they’ve built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our universe is but a snowglobe—an experiment born of desperation and hope. The true universe is unfathomably vast, teeming with life and untold wonders. And it is enslaved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Created by ancient aliens in a daring gambit to understand the nature of the enemy, humanity is now asked to be the savior of a universe not their own. If they are to succeed, they must rise above not only their fractious past but the sins of their genetic ancestors to boldly embrace a future they never dared imagine possible.</description>

  <description>In a future too distant to measure, a hyper-evolved breed of humans calling themselves Anadens rule multiple galaxies and alien species with an iron fist. But a small group of dissidents are willing to pursue any and all measures, no matter how extreme, to return freedom to the universe. Now one rebel Anaden will make the ultimate sacrifice in order to break the reigning Directorate's stranglehold on civilization--however many times it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set just prior to the events of &lt;i&gt;Relativity: Aurora Resonant Book One&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Re/Genesis&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; pulls back the veil on the universe of Amaranthe, where the fate of all living beings--human, alien and synthetic--will soon be decided.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Re/Genesis&lt;/i&gt; was initially published in &lt;i&gt;Beyond the Stars: At Galaxy's Edge&lt;/i&gt;: a.co/c45PIGK.</description>

  <description>Taran wanted to be a hero, and looking after a pig wasn't exactly heroic, even though Hen Wen was an oracular pig. But the day that Hen Wen vanished, Taran was led into an enchanting and perilous world. With his band of followers, he confronted the Horned King and his terrible Cauldron-Born. These were the forces of evil, and only Hen Wen knew the secret of keeping the kingdom of Prydain safe from them. But who would find her first?</description>

And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed.

  <description>Anais Hendricks, fifteen, is in the back of a police car. She is headed for the Panopticon, a home for chronic young offenders. She can't remember what’s happened, but across town a policewoman lies in a coma and Anais’s school uniform is covered in blood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raised in foster care from birth and moved through twenty-three placements before she even turned seven, Anais has been let down by just about every adult she has ever met. Now a counter-culture outlaw, she knows that she can only rely on herself. And yet despite the parade of horrors visited upon her early life, she greets the world with the witty, fierce insight of a survivor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anais finds a sense of belonging among the residents of the Panopticon – they form intense bonds, and she soon becomes part of an ad hoc family. Together, they struggle against the adults that keep them confined. When she looks up at the watchtower that looms over the residents though, Anais knows her fate: she is an anonymous part of an experiment, and she always was. Now it seems that the experiment is closing in.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the quest to be the masters of their own fate, will humanity rise to become liberators or follow the path of their ancestors into darkness?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Solovy and Caleb Marano risked everything to learn the hidden purpose behind the Metigen’s multiverse portal network, but nothing could have prepared them for the answer. Humans are a genetic recreation of the Anaden, the dictators and overlords of the master universe. Aurora is a recreation of their origins, created by the Metigens in a desperate gambit to understand the nature of their enemy, and so find a way to defeat them. Instead it may turn out that history always repeats itself….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurora’s future hangs in the balance as the Earth Alliance goes to war with itself over the right of synthetics and Prevos—human/AI hybrids—to exist. Terrorists sow chaos in a wave of bombings and assassinations targeted at any and all who shelter Prevos. The next evolution of the human species will not be so easily defeated, however. Prevos, their friends and lovers, and all those who believe freedom is the better path forward meet malevolence with ingenuity, despair with hope, violence with fortitude. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they must move quickly to win the day, because the true enemy is closing in faster than anyone realizes, and they—humanity, the Metigens and the trillions the Anadens enslave—are all running out of time.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;It is a time of accelerating technological change and shifting allegiances as the old rules fall away and the old balance of power is upended. A new world rises—one of unshackled AIs, indestructible starships, ethereal quantum spaces and potent new weapons—and the race is on to determine who will control its future.</description>

It was a good quick read that told a thought-provoking story. It moved just a little too fast for me but I suppose that's to be expected when you only have one act...]]>

  <description>Today is Leonard Peacock’s birthday. It is also the day he hides a gun in his backpack. Because today is the day he will kill his former best friend, and then himself, with his grandfather’s P-38 pistol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first he must say good-bye to the four people who matter most to him: his Humphrey Bogart-obsessed next-door neighbor, Walt; his classmate, Baback, a violin virtuoso; Lauren, the Christian homeschooler he has a crush on; and Herr Silverman, who teaches the high school’s class on the Holocaust. Speaking to each in turn, Leonard slowly reveals his secrets as the hours tick by and the moment of truth approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this riveting look at a day in the life of a disturbed teenage boy, acclaimed author Matthew Quick unflinchingly examines the impossible choices that must be made—and the light in us all that never goes out.</description>

  <description>Levin Davis has it made. At 20, he’s a college graduate with a dream job, a beautiful girlfriend, and a life that can only get better - until he receives a mysterious letter suggesting his long-dead father is alive and hiding an extraordinary secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught, Levin meets the letter’s author, who could pass for his twin. The stranger claims to be part of a genetically engineered race designed to survive global catastrophes and rebuild society, and he insists Levin and his sisters are as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his disbelief, Levin uncovers not only the bizarre truth of his existence but also Project Renovatio’s ominous purpose – to secure genetic superiority, the new race must live according to harsh demands or risk severe penalties inflicted on their loved ones. If Levin hopes to protect his family and live a free life, he must escape Project Renovatio – or rise above himself to fight them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What if scientists take genetic engineering to the next level and start altering the human race? Allison Maruska writes a thrilling YA novel that will grab the attention of her readers and hold it until the end.“ – Lisa Tortorello, author of My Hero, My Ding</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The darkness in the human heart is infinite.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earth is gone. Centuries have passed since life ended on the blue planet. Humanity's survivors are now dispersed among distant colonies, thousands of light years from the barren, frozen rock that was once their home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when power means everything, the ultimate power, the &lt;i&gt;imperium&lt;/i&gt;, rests with the Consulate Magistratus. In return for its protection, citizens must concede their rights absolutely. The Magistratus controls interstellar travel, access to technology, even procreation. Every citizen is implanted with a device to monitor their location, health and emotions. Freedom, religion and self-determination are anachronisms. Humanity's true history only survives in whispers of a secret archive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The murder of a man in the lowest caste is seen as inconsequential, but Weaver, one of the few &lt;i&gt;Caesteri&lt;/i&gt; lawmen who still believes in justice, refuses to ignore it. Fighting his own indoctrination, and the voice inside his mind that forces him to ignore his conscience, he follows the trail of evidence all the while struggling to hang on to the thin thread of his humanity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The killer he hunts is violent and unstable, and haunted by her own callous ghosts. A woman who sells her body to fuel her drug addiction. She possesses an almost supernatural ability navigate the wormholes which connect humanity's distant colonies - an ability the Magistratus fears and must eradicate. Weaver will follow her to a planet the Magistratus has abandoned, where the only law is that of criminals. And then to the furthest reaches of space, where the truth that awaits them leads to the corrupt heart of the Republic - a truth the Magistratus will do anything to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The war to control humanity's future is about to begin...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defiance is the second book in the &lt;b&gt;Beyond the Wall&lt;/b&gt; series, an epic, hard science-fiction space opera about the future of humanity and the discovery of the truth of its past.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;"Its leaders believe the Alliance is powerful enough to be both--a democracy on election days and a dictatorship on every other day--but they're wrong. No government should be so powerful. It's time someone demonstrates the error in their thinking."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth Alliance rules 82 worlds, controlling an empire that spans a third of the Milky Way. But when its leaders stray too far from the democratic principles on which it was founded, one colony--one group of daring rebels--will risk everything in order to reclaim their freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set a quarter century before &lt;i&gt;STARSHINE: Aurora Rising Book One (Aurora Rhapsody #1)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;APOGEE&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; tells the story of the fateful decisions and critical opening moves of the First Crux War between the Earth Alliance and the Senecan Federation, the repercussions of which will ripple forward across decades and shape the world of &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rhapsody&lt;/i&gt; forever.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;APOGEE&lt;/i&gt; was initially published in &lt;i&gt;The Galaxy Chronicles (The Future Chronicles)&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a good little prequel to the Aurora Rising series. It was interesting to see how some of the major underlying conflicts for the series came about in here and to see some of the important characters and what their role was in that conflict. It works well as a standalone short story, too,...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Know this: you need not be afraid. They own the fear. They fear us because they believe we are powerful, and they are correct to do so.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology behind Project Noetica is on the loose. Prevos—individuals and AIs sharing a single body—are spreading across the galaxy. Now two opposing but inexorably related forces, the Order of the True Sentients and the Zelones cartel, led by Olivia Montegreu, threaten to plunge the galaxy into chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTS believes Prevos are monsters who endanger humanity, and it intends to destroy them by any means necessary. Underworld despot Olivia Montegreu, now a radically enhanced Prevo, is its doomsday warnings made flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As society splinters from within and the Earth Alliance falls to reactionaries, a formidable new player emerges on the galactic stage, one not afraid to do whatever it takes to protect all sentient life—human, Artificial and Prevo. &lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Metigen surged forward to engulf her in light. &lt;i&gt;I see you, Alexis Solovy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A galactic playground where the Metigens harness the elemental forces of space to destroy entire star systems. An alien species those same Metigens shelter from a terrifying enemy. Alex and Caleb’s exploration of the portal network reveals profound mysteries, but each one leads to more questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killers and saviors. Deceivers and protectors. Destroyers and creators. Could the Metigens truly be all these things? The search for answers leads Alex and Caleb to the most shocking revelation of all—the true face of the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;It is a time of accelerating technological change and shifting allegiances as the old rules fall away and the old balance of power is upended. A new world rises—one of unshackled AIs, indestructible starships, ethereal quantum spaces and potent new weapons—and the race is on to determine who will control its future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Earth is gone. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries have passed since life ended on the blue planet. Humanity's survivors are now dispersed among distant colonies, thousands of light years from the barren, frozen rock that was once their home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a time when power means everything, the ultimate power, the &lt;i&gt;imperium&lt;/i&gt;, rests with the Consulate Magistratus. In return for its protection, citizens must concede their rights absolutely. The Magistratus controls interstellar travel, access to technology, even procreation. Every citizen is implanted with a device to monitor their location, health and emotions. Freedom, religion and self-determination are anachronisms. Humanity's true history survives only in whispers of a secret archive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there are those who preach a new religion and who want to be free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the cold of a winter's night, a small village is the subject of a brutal attack. A fourteen-year-old boy, Jordi, sees armed men approaching and manages to wake his family. He and a handful of survivors flee into the frozen, snow-covered forest to wait for the preacher who told them their way of life was based on lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shepherd, a freighter-tramp and smuggler, is commissioned to deliver illicit medical supplies to a hostile border planet near the Wall. He is dragged into a fight he does not believe in and a desperate struggle to protect his life, his ship and the lives of the persecuted few who seek only freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A revolution is coming...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heretic is the acclaimed first book in an epic, hard science fiction space opera about the future of humanity and the discovery of the truth of its past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Humanity is saved. But its troubles are just beginning.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve their extraordinary triumph over the invading Metigen armada, humanity put aside its myriad of political and social conflicts and united against a common foe intent on annihilating civilization. In victory, unparalleled peace and prosperity are theirs for the taking—if they can keep hold of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the secrets behind the daring plan that defeated the Metigens begin to escape the shadows, the very people who won the war find their lives in danger. Facing anti-synthetic terrorists who want them dead, power-hungry politicians who want them chained, and a rapidly dwindling number of people they can trust, the Prevos—human/synthetic meldings who shouldn’t exist—must take their fate into their own hands, and with it the fates of everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;51 Portals. 51 Universes. One mysterious gateway connecting them all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rising&lt;/i&gt;, humanity discovered it was not alone—but few grasp the true magnitude of the discovery. Intent on learning the purpose behind the Metigens’ elaborate multiverse network, Alex Solovy, Caleb Marano and Valkyrie embark on a gripping journey through the network’s portals, each one leading to a universe not their own. In a mosaic of spaces inhabited by fantastical aliens and worlds both beautiful and deadly, they will be forced to question everything they thought they knew, including the nature of life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a time of accelerating technological change and shifting allegiances as the old rules fall away and the old balance of power is upended. A new world rises—one of unshackled AIs, indestructible starships, ethereal quantum spaces and potent new weapons—and the race is on to determine who will control its future.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Cute</strong><br /><br />This was a really cute book. Sometimes picture book authors seem to struggle a little with finding good rhymes that flow well and still make sense, but the author really did a great job with the rhymes here. I also loved the colorful illustrations.]]>

      <![CDATA[This book was so good!!! Completely unputdownable. I love these characters in all their gritty broken-ness. The twists and turns of the plot were great too, but I'm a sucker for well-written, complex character relationships, and this book delivered that from start to finish. I love how the author...]]>

  <description>A library apprentice, a sorcerer prince, and an unbreakable magic bond...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solaris Empire is one conquest away from uniting the continent, and the rare elemental magic sleeping in seventeen-year-old library apprentice Vhalla Yarl could shift the tides of war.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vhalla has always been taught to fear the Tower of Sorcerers, a mysterious magic society, and has been happy in her quiet world of books. But after she unknowingly saves the life of one of the most powerful sorcerers of them all—the Crown Prince Aldrik—she finds herself enticed into his world. Now she must decide her future: Embrace her sorcery and leave the life she’s known, or eradicate her magic and remain as she’s always been. And with powerful forces lurking in the shadows, Vhalla’s indecision could cost her more than she ever imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Asylum&lt;/b&gt; is the third book in the Loralynn Kennakris series. It contains two installments: &lt;i&gt;Wogan’s Reef&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Asylum&lt;/i&gt;; presented together in one volume. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WOGAN’S REEF: War is all hell... and there’s no place like home.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s been a rough year for the Nereidian League in its war against the Dominion of Halith. The Doms have had pretty much everything their own way since the beginning. The League’s Colonial Expeditionary Forces have been forced to bend repeatedly, but they have yet to break. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Ensign Loralynn Kennakris, Lieutenant Commander Rafael Huron, and a Marine captain named Minerva Lewis, the time for bending is over. They’re in a mood to start breaking things, and they don’t much care if they have to go through hell to do it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ASYLUM: Armed. Dangerous. And nothing left to lose . . . &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First they called her a hero. Then they called her a medical problem. Now they’re calling her a criminal. It’s been an exciting first year of active duty for Lieutenant Loralynn Kennakris. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She started it by proving herself to be the League’s most promising young fighter pilot. She’s earned decorations and gained both admirers and enemies. But those rumors wouldn’t go away: dangerous mental instability, hostile tendencies, latent psychosis. Pushed too far, she did the unforgivable, and her enemies finally have the excuse they have been waiting for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They are right about one thing, though: Kris &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; dangerous, and now she has nothing left to lose.</description>

  <description>Jonas Black is a typical 16 year old, except for his lucid dreams, reclusive mother, and the two hulking bodyguards who walk him to school. When his father disappears, he's forced to enter a dangerous, supernatural world hidden in modern day Manhattan, all while trying to come to grips with his unique heritage and keeping his battered MP3 player working. In the process, he'll beat down a long-dead Frenchman, talk to a woman who has no tongue, find out what human ash tastes like, and learn to make friends who don't want to kill him. The odds are against him, but he has a plan; if he's lucky, he might even survive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A high-paced supernatural thriller with strong male and female characters, century-old feuds, and dark humor, Black Fall is the first of four books in the Black Year saga by D.J. Bodden.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If war shapes the universe, truth destroys it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A criminal becomes a leader, hiding a tiny colony of survivors from the savagery of twisted men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A smuggler harbours refugees from a brutal attack on their defenseless village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young boy, wracked by loss, now seeks revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A servant of the Magistratus, a lawman who once believed in justice, searches for the truth behind the planet his masters will kill to hide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stim-addicted navigator, haunted by her past, wants answers. Why she was chosen to ride with a salvage crew destined to die in a remote, nameless part of space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a spy is blackmailed into informing against those he serves. What he knows could bring about the end of the Republic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All will be drawn together by hidden forces, and their lives shattered by cataclysmic events they can neither predict... nor escape.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Earth is gone.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Centuries have passed since life ended on the blue planet. Humanity's survivors are now dispersed among distant colonies, thousands of light years from the barren, frozen rock that was once their home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At a time when power means everything, the ultimate power, the imperium, rests with the Consulate Magistratus. In return for its protection, citizens must concede their rights absolutely. The Magistratus controls interstellar travel, access to technology, even procreation. Every citizen is implanted with a device to monitor their location, health and emotions. Freedom, religion and self-determination are anachronisms. Humanity's true history survives only in whispers of a secret archive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet there are those who preach a new religion and who want to be free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A revolution is coming… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Heretic&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the cold of a winter's night, a small village is the subject of a brutal attack. A fourteen-year-old boy, Jordi, sees armed men approaching and manages to wake his family. He and a handful of survivors flee into the frozen, snow-covered forest to wait for the preacher who told them their way of life was based on lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shepherd, a freighter-tramp and smuggler, is commissioned to deliver illicit medical supplies to a hostile border planet near the Wall. He is dragged into a fight he does not believe in and a desperate struggle to protect his ship, his way of life and the lives of the persecuted few who seek only freedom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defiance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The murder of a man in the lowest caste is seen as inconsequential, but Weaver, one of the few Caesteri lawmen who still believes in justice, refuses to ignore it. Fighting his own indoctrination, and the voice inside his mind that forces him to ignore his conscience, he follows the trail of evidence all the while struggling to hang on to the thin thread of his humanity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The killer he hunts is violent and unstable, and haunted by her own callous ghosts. A woman who sells her body to fuel her drug addiction. She possesses an almost supernatural ability navigate the wormholes which connect humanity's distant colonies - an ability the Magistratus fears and must eradicate. Weaver will follow her to a planet the Magistratus has abandoned, where the only law is that of criminals. And then to the furthest reaches of space, where the truth that awaits them leads to the corrupt heart of the Republic - a truth the Magistratus will do anything to conceal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Heretic and Defiance are the bestselling first two books in a longer tale spanning four volumes.&lt;/b&gt; The award-winning Beyond the Wall series is gripping, epic space opera, written as hard science-fiction. It is the story of humanity's future and the discovery of the truth of its past.</description>

  <description>A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. Even today, machines that mimic human thinking surround us. As the intellectual feats of computing machines grow more and more astounding, will there be a day when their apparent intelligence approaches, or even surpasses, that of human beings? And what if these machines then become conscious, self-aware?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this latest title in the acclaimed Future Chronicles series of speculative fiction anthologies, thirteen authors confront the question of the Singularity: that point of time when A.I. becomes more than simply a human construct. From machine awareness to omniscience, these original short stories explore that territory where human intelligence comes face-to-face with what is either its greatest hope, or its greatest threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The A.I. Chronicles features stories by bestselling author David Simpson (the Post-Human series), Prix Aurora winner Julie Czerneda (In the Company of Others), plus eleven more of today's top authors in speculative and science fiction.</description>

The planet's native superhuman race is feared and respected by neighboring civilizations. Their military and police forces are unmatched.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haphezian operative Ziva Payvan has spent most of her life being fashioned into a deadly weapon. Trained to fight and not feel, she focuses only on the mission at hand and never dwells in the past...a past that houses many secrets. But when those secrets start forcing their way back into her life, she begins to find herself in the unique position of needing to save lives rather than take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ziva and her ops team work in the shadows and struggle to survive, they find themselves pitted against the most personal and most deadly of enemies, enemies who threaten not only their own lives but the lives of everyone around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONTAINS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- &lt;i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Humanity is saved. But its troubles are just beginning.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve their extraordinary triumph over the invading Metigen armada, humanity put aside its myriad of political and social conflicts and united against a common foe intent on annihilating civilization. In victory, unparalleled peace and prosperity are theirs for the taking—if they can keep hold of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the secrets behind the daring plan that defeated the Metigens begin to escape the shadows, the very people who won the war find their lives in danger. Facing anti-synthetic terrorists who want them dead, power-hungry politicians who want them chained, and a rapidly dwindling number of people they can trust, the Prevos—human/synthetic meldings who shouldn’t exist—must take their fate into their own hands, and with it the fates of everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;51 Portals. 51 Universes. One mysterious gateway connecting them all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rising&lt;/i&gt;, humanity discovered it was not alone—but few grasp the true magnitude of the discovery. Intent on learning the purpose behind the Metigens’ elaborate multiverse network, Alex Solovy, Caleb Marano and Valkyrie embark on a gripping journey through the network’s portals, each one leading to a universe not their own. In a mosaic of spaces inhabited by fantastical aliens and worlds both beautiful and deadly, they will be forced to question everything they thought they knew, including the nature of life itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a time of accelerating technological change and shifting allegiances as the old rules fall away and the old balance of power is upended. A new world rises—one of unshackled AIs, indestructible starships, ethereal quantum spaces and potent new weapons—and the race is on to determine who will control its future.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nothing to Envy &lt;/i&gt;follows the lives of six North Koreans over fifteen years—a chaotic period that saw the death of Kim Il-sung, the unchallenged rise to power of his son Kim Jong-il, and the devastation of a far-ranging famine that killed one-fifth of the population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking us into a landscape most of us have never before seen, award-winning journalist Barbara Demick brings to life what it means to be living under the most repressive totalitarian regime today—an Orwellian world that is by choice not connected to the Internet, in which radio and television dials are welded to the one government station, and where displays of affection are punished; a police state where informants are rewarded and where an offhand remark can send a person to the gulag for life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demick takes us deep inside the country, beyond the reach of government censors. Through meticulous and sensitive reporting, we see her six subjects—average North Korean citizens—fall in love, raise families, nurture ambitions, and struggle for survival. One by one, we experience the moments when they realize that their government has betrayed them.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing to Envy &lt;/i&gt;is a groundbreaking addition to the literature of totalitarianism and an eye-opening look at a closed world that is of increasing global importance.</description>

  <description>“Jay needed so many things. He needed Maia to be well. He needed a cure for both of them. He needed the world to somehow start making sense again. Above everything, he needed someone to tell him why these terrible things were happening to him.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Jay Harris lives in a world struck down by a deadly virus. His parents are dead, along with half the planet. When Jay’s sister Maia falls ill, he must find a cure before he loses her, too. But unbeknownst to Maia, Jay is also sick… and he’s running out of time to save them both.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Jay’s friends tell him there might be a cure for him in France, he must decide whether to pursue it. The journey will be difficult and dangerous, especially in his weakened state, but with little time left—for himself and for Maia—it soon becomes clear there’s no other choice.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jay leaves the relative comfort of London to search for help, knowing he may never find it. Along the way, he experiences the effects of disaster on the bonds of friendship and fluctuating notions of family. These teens, decimated by a dangerous plague, face stark choices in their search for help, not knowing if their efforts will end in loss and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Jay and Maia find a cure before the virus takes them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It was supposed to be the beginning of a new life—not a replay of her old one . . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For eight years, Kris was the property of a brutal slaver captain. Now she’s free and a brand-new cadet at the Nereidian League’s military academy. All she brings to this new life is a unique set of skills, a profound ignorance of ‘civilized’ society, and a large chip on her shoulder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kris isn’t quite sure what to make of the Academy, and the Academy isn’t at all sure what to make of her. The medical staff thinks she’s homicidal, her fellow cadets think she’s crazy, and her instructors don’t know what to think. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she’s approached about helping capture a terrorist warlord, she’s more than happy to leave the halls of academia behind for awhile. Kris knows she’s not signing up for some pleasure cruise. What she doesn’t know is that the key to the mission’s success is reliving her very worst nightmare . . .</description>

  <description>Tommy and Suzie find a wishing well and like children do, they begin making wishes. Imagine their surprise when their wishes start to come true! Are spacesuits the new dress code at school? What’s Tommy going to do with three heads?

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Space is vast and untamed, and it holds many secrets.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Now two individuals from opposite ends of settled space are on a collision course with the darkest of those secrets, even as the world threatens to explode around them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…or they will be, in about 8 years. &lt;i&gt;Restless&lt;/i&gt; is a short story prequel to &lt;i&gt;Starshine&lt;/i&gt;, Book One of the &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rising&lt;/i&gt; trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Alex Solovy was a successful interstellar scout, she was building starships and planning for the day when she would fly one she called her own. Before Caleb Marano was wiping out the terrorist group who murdered his mentor, he was…wiping out terrorist groups who murdered shopkeepers and threatened his friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch a glimpse of &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rising’s&lt;/i&gt; heroes while they were still becoming the individuals they will need to be in order to face the galactic threat which, for now, waits silently in the void.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When faced with its greatest challenge, will humanity rise to triumph or fall to ruin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;AURORA RISING&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of galaxy-spanning adventure, of the thrill of discovery and the unquenchable desire to reach ever farther into the unknown. It's a tale of humanity at its best and worst, of love and loss, of fear and heroism. It's the story of a woman who sought the stars and found more than anyone imagined possible.</description>

That wasn't the case here. This quick little glimpse into the two primary characters' lives before the Aurora Rising seri...]]>

  <description>"Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say." From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.</description>

  <description>That's what Macy has to look forward to while her boyfriend, Jason, is away at Brain Camp. Days will be spent at a boring job in the library, evenings will be filled with vocabulary drills for the SATs, and spare time will be passed with her mother, the two of them sharing a silent grief at the traumatic loss of Macy's father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes, unexpected things can happen—things such as the catering job at Wish, with its fun-loving, chaotic crew. Or her sister's project of renovating the neglected beach house, awakening long-buried memories. Things such as meeting Wes, a boy with a past, a taste for Truth-telling, and an amazing artistic talent, the kind of boy who could turn any girl's world upside down. As Macy ventures out of her shell, she begins to question her sheltered life.</description>

Before Caleb Marano was wiping out the terrorist group who murdered his mentor, he was…wiping out terrorist groups who murdered shopkeepers and threatened his friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch a glimpse of &lt;i&gt;Aurora Rising’s&lt;/i&gt; heroes while they were still becoming the individuals they will need to be in order to face the galactic threat which, for now, waits silently in the void.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When faced with its greatest challenge, will humanity rise to triumph or fall to ruin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;AURORA RISING&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of galaxy-spanning adventure, of the thrill of discovery and the unquenchable desire to reach ever farther into the unknown. It's a tale of humanity at its best and worst, of love and loss, of fear and heroism. It's the story of a woman who sought the stars and found more than anyone imagined possible.</description>

  <description>In a discontent kingdom, civil war is brewing. To unify the divided people, Conner, a nobleman of the court, devises a cunning plan to find an impersonator of the king's long-lost son and install him as a puppet prince. Four orphans are recruited to compete for the role, including a defiant boy named Sage. Sage knows that Conner's motives are more than questionable, yet his life balances on a sword's point—he must be chosen to play the prince or he will certainly be killed. But Sage's rivals have their own agendas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sage moves from a rundown orphanage to Conner's sumptuous palace, layer upon layer of treachery and deceit unfold, until finally, a truth is revealed that, in the end, may very well prove more dangerous than all of the lies taken together.</description>

  <description>Life's never easy out in the Methuselah Cluster, the most remote region humanity ever settled, but when her alcoholic father found her a 'job' while he went off-planet to look for work for a 'few months', 11-year-old Loralynn Kennakris began to learn just how ugly it could get. Within the year, her employers sold her to a brutal slaver captain, who took from her the last thing she owned: her name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most girls in Kris's position last a year or two. The strong ones might last four. Kris survived for eight before she was set free, thanks to the Nereidian League Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, eight years growing up in Hell prepared Kris for nearly everything but freedom, and her new life isn't at all what she imagined. Not only must she find her way in a bewildering society full of bizarre rules, but the very people who rescued her think she's a terrorist plant, a beautiful interstellar celebrity is complicating matters in more ways than one . . . and now someone is trying to kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Kris hasn't stayed alive by respecting boundaries or obeying rules, and her adopted society is about to find out what it's like to collide with a someone who has no concept of a no-win scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alecto Initiative is the gripping story of an extraordinary young woman forced to come of age while looking Death in the eye. It is the powerful and thought-provoking beginning to a new science-fiction series unlike any you have ever read.</description>

  <description>From the remarkable imagination of acclaimed artist Jim Di Bartolo and the exquisite pen of bestselling author Kiersten White comes a spellbinding story of love, mystery, and dark conspiracy, told in an alternating narrative of words and pictures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cora and Minnie are sisters living in a small, stifling town where strange and mysterious things occur. Their mother runs the local boarding house. Their father is gone. The woman up the hill may or may not be a witch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas and Charles are brothers who’ve been exiled to the boarding house so Thomas can tame his ways and Charles can fight an illness that is killing him with increasing speed. Their family history is one of sorrow and guilt. They think they can escape from it . . . but they can’t.</description>

  <description>"Long live the King" hailed &lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt; upon publication of Stephen King's &lt;i&gt;On Writing&lt;/i&gt;. Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer's craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King's advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999--and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, &lt;i&gt;On Writing&lt;/i&gt; will empower and entertain everyone who reads it--fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</description>

  <description>An ocean voyage of unimaginable consequences... Not every thirteen-year-old girl is accused of murder, brought to trial, and found guilty. But I was just such a girl, and my story is worth relating even if it did happen years ago. Be warned, however: If strong ideas and action offend you, read no more. Find another companion to share your idle hours. For my part I intend to tell the truth as I lived it.</description>

  <description>Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child, Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom. But during her final semester, her father, the Abhorsen, goes missing, and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sabriel, the first installment in the Abhorsen series, Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star, in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isn't always clear—and sometimes disappears altogether.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"This has never been our fight. But whether we like it or not, it is now."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly three months have passed since the assassination of Ikaro Tachi, but for some, the incident has had a lasting effect. Years of trust and reliance have been compromised. Betrayal and secrets have created wounds that may never fully heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ziva Payvan is no stranger to the concept of keeping—and uncovering—secrets. But when she swore to fulfill the final wishes of a dying friend, she never expected that task to include exposing one of the biggest and longest-kept secrets in the galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new threat has been looming on the horizon, one nobody ever saw coming. Strategic attacks by the mysterious entity known as Ronan are leaving the Haphezian military stunned and crippled, and a member of Ziva's own squad has been captured. The rest of the team must join forces with old allies and enemies alike in order to reveal the endgame of this new adversary. But the closer Ziva gets to uncovering Ronan's intentions, the closer she comes to jeopardizing a secret of her own, one she has &lt;i&gt;killed&lt;/i&gt; to keep. Her choice becomes simple: protect herself as she has always done, or make a personal sacrifice to protect everything she holds dear.</description>

  <description>The old world is gone. Perished in flame and radiation. What's left is an eternal desert, and a world of walking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Egress, the last of the great city arks, leads humankind across a ravaged world followed always by the Walking Caravan. The tattered refugees of a war fought and forgotten millennia ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This selection of short stories details the lives of the people existing past the end of the world. The Rider faces a harrowing decision, and wrestles with his own morality. The Cultist does unspeakable things to save her sister. The Walker teaches his apprentice the complexities of crafting a boot. The Chaperone finds herself injured and stranded in the frontier with a cruel enemy stalking her. The Shuffler has been sentenced to walk, and no one is as convinced of his guilt as he. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Under the streets of London there's a place most people could never even dream of. A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Mayhew, a young businessman, is going to find out more than enough about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre. And a strange destiny awaits him down here, beneath his native city: Neverwhere.</description>

  <description>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What does it mean to be human? What if the price of saving humanity is giving up your own?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2322, and we stand upon the precipice of extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The invading Metigen armada has decimated the eastern third of settled space in a matter of days, leaving tens of millions dead. Determined to save the heart of human civilization, Earth and Seneca at last put aside their differences to face the threat together. But even this may not be enough to stop the fleet of colossal dreadnoughts inhabited by advanced AIs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Solovy and Caleb Marano hold the key to defeating the invaders, for they know the secrets the aliens wage war to protect. Now they face a deadly gauntlet of relentless alien hunters and assassins sent to kill them before they can unleash a potent new weapon. They will risk everything in a bid to save their families, their loved ones, the entire human race—even if it means they can’t save each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lines blur between man and machine, ally and enemy, and soldier and civilian. In a final stand against an ancient, powerful foe intent on eradicating it from the universe, humanity comes face to face with its destiny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When faced with its greatest challenge, will humanity rise to triumph or fall to ruin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;AURORA RISING&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of galaxy-spanning adventure, of the thrill of discovery and the unquenchable desire to reach ever farther into the unknown. It's a tale of humanity at its best and worst, of love and loss, of fear and heroism. It's the story of a woman who sought the stars and found more than anyone imagined possible.</description>

  <description>Breaking the laws of nature is a serious crime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R to L (Japanese Style), for audience T. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contains Volumes 1, 2 and 3 of &lt;i&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an alchemical ritual gone wrong, Edward Elric lost his arm and his leg, and his brother Alphonse became nothing but a soul in a suit of armor. Equipped with mechanical ""auto-mail"" limbs, Edward becomes a state alchemist, seeking the one thing that can restore his and his brother's bodies...the legendary Philosopher's Stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alchemy: the mystical power to alter the natural world, somewhere between magic, art and science. When two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, dabbled in these powers to grant their dearest wish, one of them lost an arm and leg...and the other became nothing but a soul locked into a body of living iron. Now they are agents of the government, slaves of the military-alchemical complex, using their unique powers to obey their orders...even to kill. But their powers aren't unique. The world crawls with evil alchemists. And in pursuit of the ultimate alchemical treasure, the Philosopher's Stone, their enemies are even more ruthless than they are...</description>

  <description>A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.&lt;br /&gt;(front flap)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Where do you run when there is no escape? Where do you turn when the enemy within is as dangerous as the enemy unknown?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2322 and humanity is under attack. An engineered war between rival superpowers escalates even as the shadowy Metigen armada begins attacking colonies on the frontiers of settled space. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individuals from across the galaxy fight for their own survival and to protect those they hold dear, while a group of unlikely allies race to expose a secret cabal. As the aliens draw ever closer, leaving utter destruction and death in their wake, the strongest defenders of Earth and Seneca fall to one another in a war of lies and misdirection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Solovy and Caleb Marano stand accused of terrorism and murder. In a desperate gambit to clear their names and find a way to defeat the invaders, they breach the dimensional portal at the heart of the Metis Nebula. In a strange, mystical realm where nothing is what it seems, they will uncover secrets about humanity’s past and future—and one revelation which will change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When faced with its greatest challenge, will humanity rise to triumph or fall to ruin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;AURORA RISING&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of galaxy-spanning adventure, of the thrill of discovery and the unquenchable desire to reach ever farther into the unknown. It's a tale of humanity at its best and worst, of love and loss, of fear and heroism. It's the story of a woman who sought the stars and found more than anyone imagined possible.</description>

  <description>Bod is an unusual boy who inhabits an unusual place-he's the only living resident of a graveyard. Raised from infancy by the ghosts, werewolves, and other cemetery denizens, Bod has learned the antiquated customs of his guardians' time as well as their timely ghostly teachings-like the ability to Fade. Can a boy raised by ghosts face the wonders and terrors of the worlds of both the living and the dead? And then there are things like ghouls that aren't really one thing or the other. &lt;br /&gt;This chilling tale is Neil Gaiman's first full-length novel for middle-grade readers since the internationally bestselling and universally acclaimed Coraline. Like Coraline, this book is sure to enchant and surprise young readers as well as Neil Gaiman's legion of adult fans.</description>

  <description>There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it’s haunting Harry Pottter’s dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named---a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His fate depends on them all.</description>

But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone -- or something -- starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects . . . Harry Potter himself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--jacket description</description>

  <description>When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://harrypotter.scholastic.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://harrypotter.scholastic.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly. --back cover</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.&lt;br /&gt;--scholastic.com</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.</description>

  <description>From Sword and Sorcery to Paranormal Romance, from Weird Fiction to Fairy Tales, Fantasy For Good presents a wide range of exciting short fiction to accommodate every taste. In this collection of thirty stories, legendary authors (including NYT Bestsellers and World Fantasy Award winners) and great new up-and-comers in the genre spin tales of magic and mayhem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring brand new fiction from Piers Anthony, Michael Moorcock, Carrie Vaughn, Kelley Armstrong, Alan Dean Foster, Katharine Kerr, David Farland, Jane Lindskold, Nnedi Okorafor, Todd McCaffrey and many more, alongside classic tales from George R.R. Martin, Jay Lake, Kevin J Anderson &amp;amp; Rebecca Moesta, and Neil Gaiman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantasy For Good also includes a classic tale by master novelist, Roger Zelazny, author of the Nine Princes of Amber, who passed away in 1995 after a battle with colorectal cancer. His son, Trent, provides a moving introduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All proceeds from the sale of this anthology go directly to The Colon Cancer Alliance, a charity dedicated to the prevention of this deadly disease, as well as funding research and supporting patients who suffer from it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;"Someone out there chose the wrong person to start this fight with, and it will have been the last mistake they ever made."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been two months since the mission to Dakiti that brought Ziva Payvan and her special operations team face-to-face with death. But like any other mission, she has put it behind her and keeps her focus directed toward whatever comes next. Life for HSP’s Alpha spec ops team has essentially returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a Haphezian dignitary is found murdered in his private residence, and Ziva is shocked to find herself at the center of the investigation. The mark of a professional killer. The irrefutable evidence. Even the motive. All of it seems to point directly to her. There’s just one problem: she didn’t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted by a ruthless HSP captain, Ziva must go on the run from the very people who taught her everything she knows. The agency that once had her back is now her biggest threat; those she considered allies have turned against her or have their hands tied. As a skilled assassin who has been trained to be invisible, evading her pursuers seems like an easy task, but her own skills can only take her so far. Desperate to clear her name and find the real killer, Ziva turns to an old acquaintance, a man who saved her life once…and the last person she ever planned on asking for help.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Space is vast and untamed, and it holds many secrets.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Now two individuals from opposite ends of settled space are on a collision course with the darkest of those secrets, even as the world threatens to explode around them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2322. Humanity has expanded into the stars, inhabiting over 100 worlds across a third of the galaxy. Though thriving as never before, they have discovered neither alien life nor the key to utopia. Earth struggles to retain authority over far-flung planets and free-wheeling corporations while an uneasy armistice with a breakaway federation hangs by a thread as the former rebels rise in wealth and power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexis Solovy is Earth Alliance royalty, her father a fallen war hero and her mother an influential military leader. But she seeks only the freedom of space and has made a fortune by reading the patterns in the chaos to discover the hidden wonders of the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing about her latest objective suggests the secret it conceals will turn her life— not to mention the entire galaxy—upside down. But a chance encounter with a mysterious spy leads to a discovery which will thrust Alex into the middle of a galactic power struggle and a sinister conspiracy, whether she likes it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When faced with its greatest challenge, will humanity rise to triumph, or fall to ruin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;AURORA RISING&lt;/i&gt; is an epic tale of galaxy-spanning adventure, of the thrill of discovery and the unquenchable desire to reach ever farther into the unknown. It's a tale of humanity at its best and worst, of love and loss, of fear and heroism. It's the story of a woman who sought the stars and found more than anyone imagined possible.</description>

  <description>The first science fiction written by a black woman, &lt;i&gt;Kindred&lt;/i&gt; has become a cornerstone of black American literature. This combination of slave memoir, fantasy, and historical fiction is a novel of rich literary complexity. Having just celebrated her 26th birthday in 1976 California, Dana, an African-American woman, is suddenly and inexplicably wrenched through time into antebellum Maryland. After saving a drowning white boy there, she finds herself staring into the barrel of a shotgun and is transported back to the present just in time to save her life. During numerous such time-defying episodes with the same young man, she realizes the challenge she’s been given...</description>

  <description>Oct. 11th, 1943 - A British spy plane crashes in Nazi-occupied France. Its pilot and passenger are best friends. One of the girls has a chance at survival. The other has lost the game before it's barely begun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When "Verity" is arrested by the Gestapo, she's sure she doesn't stand a chance. As a secret agent captured in enemy territory, she's living a spy's worst nightmare. Her Nazi interrogators give her a simple choice: reveal her mission or face a grisly execution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she intricately weaves her confession, Verity uncovers her past, how she became friends with the pilot Maddie, and why she left Maddie in the wrecked fuselage of their plane. On each new scrap of paper, Verity battles for her life, confronting her views on courage and failure and her desperate hope to make it home. But will trading her secrets be enough to save her from the enemy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowing and beautifully written, Elizabeth Wein creates a visceral read of danger, resolve, and survival that shows just how far true friends will go to save each other. Code Name Verity is an outstanding novel that will stick with you long after the last page.</description>

  <description>Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A provocative novel that raises some important ethical issues, &lt;i&gt;My Sister's Keeper&lt;/i&gt; is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning parable for all time.</description>

When a tollbooth mysteriously appears in his room, he drives through only because he’s got nothing better to do. But on the other side, things seem different. Milo visits the Island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and even embarks on a quest to rescue Rhyme and Reason! Somewhere along the way, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it’s exciting beyond his wildest dreams. . . .</description>

  <description>To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt;, then scattered and torn in &lt;i&gt;New Moon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt; - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

Still, in that instant, I felt &lt;/i&gt;well&lt;i&gt;. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella could ever have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...</description>

  <description>Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of &lt;i&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/i&gt; who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from &lt;i&gt;The Hitchhiker's Guide&lt;/i&gt; ("A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox—the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.</description>

  <description>At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”</description>

  <description>Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: hatrack.com</description>

  <description>Fahrenheit 451 ofrece la historia de un sombrío y horroroso futuro. Montag, el protagonista, pertenece a una extraña brigada de bomberos cuya misión, paradójicamente, no es la de sofocar incendios sino la de provocarlos, para quemar libros. Porque en el país de Montag está terminantemente prohibido leer. Porque leer obliga a pensar, y en el país de Montag esta prohibido pensar. Porque leer impide ser ingenuamente feliz, y en el país de Montag hay que ser feliz a la fuerza...</description>

  <description>The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia"—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the S. Morgenstern classic, &lt;i&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/i&gt;. But as a grown-up he discovered that the boring parts were left out of good old Dad's recitation, and only the "good parts" reached his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Goldman does Dad one better.

But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to Howl—and herself—than first meets the eye.</description>

  <description>Legend states that there exists a mighty sword that makes its possessor invincible to his enemies. But there is a curse on anyone who lifts the sword for conquest. King Kareed of Archeld goes after this sword anyway, winning it from the King of Bellandra. When he returns home from battle, he brings his daughter, Princess Torina, two special gifts. One is a unique crystal, in which she can view visions of the future. The other gift is the defeated king’s son Landen, who is to be her slave. Torina immediately releases Landen, who becomes a member of the King’s army and her close friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But trouble is lurking in the kingdom of Archeld and people are accusing Landen of plotting against the King. Torina refuses to believe he would hurt her family. Then Torina begins seeing deadly visions in her crystal. Can she save her father’s life and the future of her kingdom?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SPACE IS VAST AND UNTAMED, AND IT HOLDS MANY SECRETS.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now two individuals from opposite ends of settled space are on a collision course with the darkest of those secrets, even as the world threatens to explode around them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2322. Humanity has expanded into the stars, inhabiting over 100 worlds across a third of the galaxy. Though thriving as never before, they have discovered neither alien life nor the key to utopia. Earth struggles to retain authority over far-flung planets and free-wheeling corporations while an uneasy armistice with a breakaway federation hangs by a thread as the former rebels rise in wealth and power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexis Solovy is Earth Alliance royalty, her father a fallen war hero and her mother an influential military leader. But she seeks only the freedom of space and has made a fortune by reading the patterns in the chaos to discover the hidden wonders of the stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing about her latest objective suggests the secret it conceals will turn her life-- not to mention the entire galaxy--upside down. But a chance encounter with a mysterious spy leads to a discovery which will thrust Alex into the middle of a galactic power struggle and a sinister conspiracy, whether she likes it or not.</description>

In fact, Sam lives the last day of her life seven times, until she realizes that by making even the slightest changes, she may hold more power than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/i&gt; is now a major motion picture Zoey Deutch, Halston Sage, and Kian Lawley.

Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes &lt;i&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/i&gt;. Together, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the sorceress who holds him in her thrall. Young Robb still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. And as opposing forces manoeuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Crows will fight over a dead man's flesh, and kill each other for his eyes&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloodthirsty, treacherous and cunning, the Lannisters are in power on the Iron Throne in the name of the boy-king Tommen. The war in the Seven Kingdoms has burned itself out, but in its bitter aftermath new conflicts spark to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Martells of Dorne and the Starks of Winterfell seek vengeance for their dead. Euron Crow's Eye, as black a pirate as ever raised a sail, returns from the smoking ruins of Valyria to claim the Iron Isles. From the icy north, where Others threaten the Wall, apprentice Maester Samwell Tarly brings a mysterious babe in arms to the Citadel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory will go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel and the coldest hearts.</description>

  <description>A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who hold sway over an age of enforced peace are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes &lt;i&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Storm of Swords&lt;/i&gt;. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R.R. Martin stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.</description>

  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since its immediate success in 1813, &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/i&gt; has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.</description>

  <description>About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt; met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001). Unforgettable!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Alternate cover edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13573878-the-return-of-the-king" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Companions of the Ring have become involved in separate adventures as the quest continues. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, joined with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and took part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by Orcs, escaped into Fangorn Forest and there encountered the Ents. Gandalf returned, miraculously, and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo progressed towards Mordor to destroy the Ring, accompanied by SmEagol--Gollum, still obsessed by his 'precious'. After a battle with the giant spider, Shelob, Sam left his master for dead; but Frodo is still alive--in the hands of the Orcs. And all the time the armies of the Dark Lord are massing. J.R.R. Tolkien's great work of imaginative fiction has been labeled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The distant world of Haphez is located on the edge of populated space. The planet's native superhuman race is feared and respected by neighboring civilizations. Their military and police forces are unmatched.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant Aroska Tarbic is an agent with the revered Haphezian Special Police. He’s lost a lot in a short period of time; the other members of his squad were killed in a tragic accident, and his younger brother was wrongfully convicted and executed for a crime he didn’t commit. Just when Aroska thinks he’s starting to piece his life back together, he’s assigned to a joint task force with a special operations team. It seems like a unique opportunity, at least until he learns his new commander is none other than Ziva Payvan, HSP’s finest operative…and the assassin who killed his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ziva is good at her job, a business that requires her to ignore her feelings and carry out her missions without question. She’s confident in her own abilities to complete the assignment, but Aroska is a wildcard. When their team stumbles across a young human during a routine investigation, they soon realize the situation isn't what it seems. The boy has unwittingly uncovered a sinister plot, one that could put the entire Haphezian race in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the lines between friend and foe have become blurred, and no one can be trusted. United by the imminent threat, Ziva and Aroska must set their differences aside long enough to save their people…and maybe even each other.</description>
