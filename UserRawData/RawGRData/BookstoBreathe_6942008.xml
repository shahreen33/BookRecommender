  <description>Evangeline Brogan grew up Broadway royalty. She commands the stage until one night, everything changes. With lifelong secrets revealed, she’s determined to find out the full story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if that means leaving everything she knows behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrogant and protective, Montague Parrish needs to be strong enough for his mother and stepfather as a family crisis comes to a head. He’s wary when fate brings Linnie into their lives at a critical moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time their relationship changes; offering light when fear is ready to consume them both. And then reality intrudes, threatening their need to survive each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, life can bring a close match, but it takes love to make it a perfect one.</description>

  <description>Blinded by anger, the man who had sworn to protect me, &lt;br /&gt;shot me in a fit of rage when I was only sixteen years old. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He thought he killed me. &lt;br /&gt;But my job wasn’t finished yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My days are spent as President of the Heavens Guardians MC. &lt;br /&gt;Nights are spent searching for the scum of the earth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rapists, Murderers, Pedophiles. &lt;br /&gt;They all answer to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought I’d seen it all. &lt;br /&gt;Thought my heart couldn’t be any darker. &lt;br /&gt;Thought I knew exactly how far I was willing to go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then a battered and broken woman was found behind our clubhouse, &lt;br /&gt;and I realized, I’ve never had a clue about the monster that lurks within. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They may call me Priest, &lt;br /&gt;but I’d sell my soul to the devil before I let anything take her away from me.</description>

  <description>Luciana Rossi is untouchable, the Principessa of the Zanetti Famiglia, until one day she becomes extremely vulnerable. Unsure of who to trust, or where to turn, she follows the man that she’s had a connection with since childhood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gavino Santoro is hungry. He craves power, control, and Luciana. Taking over the Zanetti Famiglia has been his goal since he began climbing the ranks of one of New York's most powerful families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the power he craves is within his grasp, he needs the wife that will complete his image of being the new Zanetti Boss. Even if he has to lie and manipulate the beautiful woman to bend her to his will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people doomed by circumstance. An organization in upheaval. Nothing but uncertainty in the future. Morality is nothing but a concept. This is the beginning of the Zanetti Famiglia’s new empire.</description>

  <description>As an Underboss for the Zanetti famiglia, Arlo Zanetti has agreed to marry for duty rather than love. In fact, he abhors the woman he’s forced to walk down the aisle with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, duty and the famiglia mean everything to him. He’s not a man that skirts his responsibilities, even to his own detriment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he sets his sights on Elenora Lewis. She’s everything he’s attracted to and everything he thought he could never have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elenora should run from him. She can feel the danger oozing out of Arlo’s very core. However, she has a problem, she’s fallen for him, head-over-heels. His blue eyes hold her completely captive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secrets, lies, betrayal, and infidelity plague them both. Guilt fills them, their morals are completely obliterated. Unsure if they’ll make it out alive, this is the second book in the Zanetti empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDES SHORT STORY: BECOMING HER HERO</description>

  <description>Wedding photographer Holly Freeman holds her camera up to act as a mask; blocking the world from seeing the vulnerability she never quite let go of. She still feels she owes a debt for the second chance at life she’s more than repaid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One perfect shot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firefighter Joseph Bianco lost love in a way that left deep emotional wounds. There’s no place for a personal life between the fires he fights every day and the bitterness he holds back at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scars heal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their worlds collide, they want nothing more than friendship. But it’s not long before Holly and Joe both realize they are not truly living despite the lies they tell themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will these friends-to-lovers be able to battle their pasts to find the love they deserve?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author comes a story of secrets and suspense.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mulaney&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a secret. &lt;br /&gt;And only he knows. &lt;br /&gt;He took my carefully crafted world and turned it upside down. &lt;br /&gt;Now my career hangs in the balance. &lt;br /&gt;I swore I'd never give anyone control over my life again, but I may have done something worse... &lt;br /&gt;Given him my heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easton&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a secret. &lt;br /&gt;And she doesn't know. &lt;br /&gt;What she calls a mistake, I call the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;I've been respectful. Patient. A gentleman. &lt;br /&gt;With everything on the line, including the company we've built with my family, that stops now. &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I'll forget about what we've done. &lt;br /&gt;But the truth is all secrets come to light... &lt;br /&gt;Especially the ones we want to stay buried most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Juliana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;And it wasn’t going to Paris for the semester.&lt;br /&gt;It was waiting until I had one foot out the door to tell Mitch Jacobs I was leaving.&lt;br /&gt;I never expected him to shatter my heart in retribution.&lt;br /&gt;After all the distance, the remnants of our fight still linger. The hole he left behind still bleeds.&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m back…and there’s no way I’ll be able avoid him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mitch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Lost my temper. Said things I’m not sure I really meant.&lt;br /&gt;And in the process, I lost the person who matters most along with the future we’d planned.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had four months to figure out what to say to her when she gets home. Four months to face the dreams I destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;Now she’s back…and she isn’t alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Muriella&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never been on a date.&lt;br /&gt;And I intended to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;But to save my best friends’ relationship, I agreed to three with the man I secretly long for.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t know why we can’t be. That chancing a relationship would bring everything crashing down around us.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever he makes me feel is irrelevant. Wherever he thinks this may lead, he’s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Three dates.&lt;br /&gt;That’s all I have to survive before I can put him back where he belongs…&lt;br /&gt;At arm’s length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six years.&lt;br /&gt;That’s how long I’ve waited for her.&lt;br /&gt;Now I’ve got three shots to convince her what I’ve known all along…&lt;br /&gt;We belong together.&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of my determination, each new revelation seems to pull us apart.&lt;br /&gt;With everything stacked against us, we may not even make it to date three, let alone forever.</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling authors Rebecca Zanetti, Kristen Ashley, Larissa Ione, and Laura Kaye. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four Dark Tales. Four Sensual Stories. Four Page Turners. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BLAZE ERUPTING: Scorpius Syndrome/A Brigade Novella by Rebecca Zanetti &lt;br /&gt;Hugh Johnson is nobody’s hero, and the idea of being in the limelight makes him want to growl. He takes care of his brothers, does his job, and enjoys a mellow evening hanging with his hound dog and watching the sports channel. So when sweet and sexy Ellie Smithers from his college chemistry class asks him to save millions of people from a nuclear meltdown, he doggedly steps forward while telling himself that the world hasn’t changed and he can go back to his relaxing life. One look at Ellie and excitement doesn’t seem so bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ROUGH RIDE: A Chaos Novella by Kristen Ashley &lt;br /&gt;Rosalie Holloway put it all on the line for the Chaos Motorcycle Club. Informing to Chaos on their rival club—her man’s club, Bounty—Rosalie knows the stakes. And she pays them when her man, who she was hoping to scare straight, finds out she’s betrayed him and he delivers her to his brothers to mete out their form of justice. &lt;br /&gt;But really, Rosie has long been denying that, as she drifted away from her Bounty, she’s been falling in love with Everett “Snapper” Kavanagh, a Chaos brother. Snap is the biker-boy-next door with the snowy blue eyes, quiet confidence and sweet disposition who was supposed to keep her safe…and fell down on that job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HAWKYN: A Demonica Novella by Larissa Ione &lt;br /&gt;As a special class of earthbound guardian angel called Memitim, Hawkyn is charged with protecting those whose lives are woven into the fabric of the future. His success is legendary, so when he’s given a serial killer to watch over, he sees no reason for that to change. But Hawkyn’s own future is jeopardized after he breaks the rules and rescues a beautiful woman from the killer’s clutches, setting off an explosive, demonic game of cat and mouse that pits brother against brother and that won’t end until someone dies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RIDE DIRTY: A Raven Riders Novella by Laura Kaye &lt;br /&gt;Caine McKannon is all about rules. As the Raven Riders’ Sergeant-at-Arms, he prizes loyalty to his brothers and protection of his club. As a man, he takes pleasure wherever he can get it but allows no one close—because distance is the only way to ensure people can’t hurt you. And he’s had enough pain for a lifetime. &lt;br /&gt;Kids and school are kindergarten teacher Emma Kerry’s whole life, so she’s stunned to realize she has an enemy—and even more surprised to find a protector in the intimidating man who saved her. Tall, dark, and tattooed, Caine is unlike any man Emma’s ever known, and she’s as uncertain of him as she is attracted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every Dark Nights tale is breathtakingly sexy and magically romantic. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Chance is book 15 in the Reed Security Series and should be read in order. It is also part of a 3 book arc. Sniper and Jackson need to be read first.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chance was taken when Reed Security was attacked, but he has no idea who has taken him or why. Over the course of a year, he plans his escape, knowing there is one person on the island he won't leave without. But torture breaks every man eventually and he doesn't know if he can make it until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan made a deal with the devil to get her daughter back and finds out too late that it was the wrong choice. Held captive with a man that is obsessed with her, she has to find a way to convince him that she loves him. But will she actually fall for him? And if she does, where does that leave her with Chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The men and women of Reed Security won't stop until one of their own is back home. They'll never give up, and this time, they're out for blood.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Storm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one job, get Jessica "Rabbit" Finley to sell her property to Reed Security. I could do that. I was Army Strong. Hell, I took down bad guys for a living. I could handle this sexy vixen. No problem. Except, she's a little crazy. She thinks that there are ghosts on her property, and she has the men at Reed Security believing her too. But then I found out her history and it had me wondering....Was she really crazy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jessica&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never known who I really am. My family history has been contorted into something that I can only hope to unravel in my lifetime. But then I got a clue that led me to buy this creepy insane asylum. I was told there were answers here and I'm finding them, along with ghosts that still haunt this estate. There's an upside, though. There's a sexy man here to keep me company. But the closer I get to finding my answers, the closer I get to being locked up in the asylum myself.</description>

  <description>The men and women of Reed Security are back, but after all the turmoil of the past year, how do they adapt and move forward? For some, it's easy, but others, the past year is only the beginning of what they will have to deal with. Some of them were shot and almost died. Morgan and Chance were taken and tortured in their own respects and now must deal with the after effects. Payton was torn from her mother and spent a year and a half without her. The wives lost their jobs, and many had to run from their families and friends to keep them safe. But one thing remained the same through all of this, they are each others' family and will do anything to help each other through. They are Reed Security, and they will rise from the ashes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Why settle for one sexy sports romance when you can have four?&lt;br /&gt;Alpha snowboarders. Feisty heroines. Sweet, swoon-worthy stories.&lt;br /&gt;4 full-length standalones in one complete set.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everything I Need&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley Meadows has lost nearly everything she loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to move on, Charley leaves home and abandons her true calling in life, replacing it with exhausting days of unfulfilling work. She never expected to have her newfound peace disrupted by Wes Blackman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snowboarder extraordinaire turned business owner, Wes' focus is on making Blackman Boards the industry leader in snowboard production. With his company set to launch a new series of boards, Wes finds himself back on the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he hadn't expected to find was a mysterious girl with a battered heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley is afraid to take a risk. However, Wes is irresistibly charming. If she opens her heart to vulnerability, she's worried tragedy may strike again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wes wants the opportunity to prove that no matter what happens, he'll always be there to pick up the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everything I Have&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emme James lives in darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since her abusive relationship ended in heartbreaking tragedy, she's kept herself secluded to protect herself and others. Emme's plans to remain unattached fall apart the moment Zane Cunningham sets his sights on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A professional snowboarder at the top of his game, Zane doesn't need a distraction. But when Emme walks into his life, he can't fight the pull he feels toward her and will take her any way he can get her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emme struggles to resist Zane's persistent efforts to turn their friendship into something more. Having lived a charmed life, Zane is devastated to learn the truth about the tragic incident in her past. When her ugly past doesn't deter Zane, Emme finally gives into the attraction between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Zane brings light and laughter into Emme's life, her trouble finally catches up to her, threatening her newfound happiness. Zane promises he'll keep her safe, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he knows that if he can't, Emme may be lost in darkness forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everything I Want&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When starry-eyed dancer, Monroe Archer, meets snowboarder Xander Stone, she believes she's found the man of her dreams. Searching for her fairytale romance since she was little, Monroe goes after what she wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone is a grief-stricken man. At a young age, he learned that forever doesn't exist. Ever since, he's been a tortured soul, living his life devoid of deeper connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monroe is shocked to discover that despite their attraction, Stone won't offer anything but friendship. Just as she tries to move on, he realizes his attraction to her isn't something he can so easily deny. Powerless to resist her any longer, Stone starts something with Monroe knowing he can't give her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monroe sets out to heal the wounds left on the heart of the man she loves. But it isn't long before Monroe realizes that sometimes those that love you most are the ones that hurt you the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everything I Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikki Drake was just a little girl when she experienced her first heartbreak. Many years and betrayals later, she's learned that life is what you make of it. While her past hasn't stopped her from working hard to become a confident, successful woman, it has affected one small part of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nikki refuses to give her heart to anyone ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Townsend is a man most women dream about. Underneath his tall, handsome exterior, he's charming, compassionate, sensitive, and loyal. A dedicated snowboarder, Luke knows what it means to work hard for what he wants. And what Luke wants is Nikki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having resolved to live a life without romantic love, Nikki rejects him. Luke walks away, vowing to find a way to win her heart. When Nikki decides to take a chance on Luke, he is patient while she struggles to find the courage to trust he won't hurt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once Nikki hands her heart over to him, Luke shatters her world with the truth.</description>

They’d never met, but it was fate that drew them together when he saved her life.&lt;br /&gt;Now, one year later and days away from their wedding, disasters begin to strike in tandem, threatening to ruin the entire day. Jacob and Jackie work tirelessly to put out one fire after another, wondering if these catastrophes and mishaps are a sign from the universe that perhaps they aren't meant to be after all.&lt;br /&gt;Does true love really conquer all or are curses just not meant to be broken?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adriana Locke - Crush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delaney McCallister isn’t looking for a date. She just wants clean pajamas so she can go back home, flop on the couch, and relax. As the spin cycle begins, in walks the most delectable man she’s ever seen—one that clearly doesn’t belong in her small town. She doesn’t belong in his bed, either, but a simple little crush never hurt anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shari J. Ryan - Love, Rose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t want Frankie back. I didn’t want him to stay, but I wanted him to know how much I loved him, why I loved him, and what I would have done to make him happy. Through letter after letter, I poured my heart and soul onto paper and mailed them.&lt;br /&gt;The letters never made it to Frankie. Frankie moved away, but a new man moved into his old place. His name was Colton, and he was the one who received all my letters.&lt;br /&gt;When Colton wrote back, he told me my words changed his life. He wanted to meet me.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know that meeting Colton would also change my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julie A. Richman - Reunion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two high school besties.&lt;br /&gt;Two ex-boyfriends.&lt;br /&gt;A 10-year high school reunion.&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected surprise revealing a long-kept secret&lt;br /&gt;There are just some nights you’ll never forget...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HJ Bellus - Coming Home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The My Way Gang is back together.

But one sweltering Vegas morning, a voice from beyond changes the trajectory of his life.&lt;br /&gt;“Wake up, Jonah, and go get my roses,” she says.&lt;br /&gt;On a hungover quest to fulfill his dead wife’s request, he stumbles upon Hannah Green. A struggling widow, Hannah fills her days crafting copper roses. Although he vowed to never love again, Jonah knows that his beloved Rachel came to him that morning with a purpose; and that purpose was Hannah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara Leigh - Finley and Sebastián, Wages of Sin series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a steamy summer in New York City,&lt;br /&gt;and the newest couple in the Wages of Sin&lt;br /&gt;series is burning up the pages.&lt;br /&gt;With Aislinn and Damon away,&lt;br /&gt;Finley and Sebastián will play.&lt;br /&gt;Let the games begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaylee Ryan - Whiskey &amp;amp; Roses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You met Rhett and Saylor in Hey, Whiskey.&lt;br /&gt;My outlook on life has changed in the last fifteen years. I now have a husband and a family I can lean on. I’ve paved my own path, but they’ve traveled it with me.&lt;br /&gt;Not a single day have I regretted my choice to make this small town in West Virginia my home. We’ve built a life here and raised our kids here.&lt;br /&gt;Now here we are fifteen years later, and I’m about to show my wife that even after all these years, she’s all I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Dare - Where I Escape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never know where your life will lead.

I thought it was unattainable. Until I met Finn.&lt;br /&gt;He knows of my past. He’s held me through my nightmares. I’ve never met someone so kind and patient.&lt;br /&gt;Where I escape is into the arms of Finn where everything in my world finally feels right again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haylee Thorne - Capturing Tomorrow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bachelorette party shenanigans planned √&lt;br /&gt;Hotel suites booked √&lt;br /&gt;Invites sent √&lt;br /&gt;Jet fueled √&lt;br /&gt;Have all your plans go to hell√&lt;br /&gt;Phoenix Kingsley is about to find out that sometimes even the best laid out plans fall apart…and it’s not always a bad thing…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle Windsor - Coming Up Roses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five long hours in flight.&lt;br /&gt;Four cocktails in.&lt;br /&gt;Three little words.&lt;br /&gt;Two strangers in first class.&lt;br /&gt;One unexpected connection.&lt;br /&gt;Buckle up and prepare for takeoff as Griffin Harrison and Chloe Adams find themselves encountering more than turbulence on their way to New York City. Make sure your tray tables are locked and in their upright position, cause things are gonna get bumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verlene Landon - LINE 39&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lena gave up on life and abandoned her dreams of a happily-ever-after when a freak accident took her eye, most of her vision, and left her scarred. Her only reason for living now is to make her terminally-ill father believe otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Rue is blinded by the beauty of Casterton’s newest resident, but he can’t work up the nerve to approach her. Sadly, he notices her leaving Carol’s every week with a bouquet of flowers from someone who obviously has the courage he lacks.&lt;br /&gt;Lucky for them, a happy-go-lucky golden retriever puppy helps them both to see what’s right in front of their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristin Mayer - Mine to Protect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Austin and Scarlette come together in a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJ Fields - The Way We Fell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben and Kendall, part one.&lt;br /&gt;(Brand new part of the Legacy world)&lt;br /&gt;One brilliant smile, and my heart beat for what felt like the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;One night as he held my sister and sang to her, it broke.&lt;br /&gt;Years later, his smile is different, and I curse my heart when it beats in an all too familiar way, a way it’s only ever beat for him... again.&lt;br /&gt;He was once hers, could he ever truly be mine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Brooke - Ring Me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a bully.&lt;br /&gt;At least not anymore. I’d learned my lesson even before I had all my dreams ripped away.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw her. I knew I wanted her to be mine.&lt;br /&gt;I made so many mistakes, but she let me in and gave me her heart.&lt;br /&gt;Now I want to keep it forever.&lt;br /&gt;How do I ask the woman of my dreams to spend the rest of her life with me? Simple, just ask.&lt;br /&gt;At least I thought it would be that easy.</description>

  <description>The Landry Family Series is a feel-good, heart-warming series featuring strong alpha males and smart, capable heroines. Sweet and steamy, the Landry family enjoys favorite tropes such as second-chance romance, surprise babies, office lovers, sports and military romances and more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fall madly in love with this relatable, unforgettable family by USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke. This set includes three full novels—Sway, Swing, and Switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWAY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BARRETT LANDRY has it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power, prestige, and plenty of women, the dapper politician’s life is pretty phenomenal. But in the midst of the biggest campaign of his life, he needs to focus. The last thing he can afford is a distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALISON BAKER is a work-in-progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a single mother to HUXLEY, she’s rebuilding life on her terms. She’s focused on family, faith, and a future for her son that can’t be taken away. Putting her child first means not being careless, no matter what. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter forces Barrett and Alison to redefine what they really want out of life. But everything comes at a cost ... and sometimes, even for love, it’s a price too steep to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screw him and his perfect stats.&lt;br /&gt;Sinful smirk.&lt;br /&gt;Delicious body.&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Landry probably even has game-winning stamina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d like to screw her and her perfect ass.&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous curves. &lt;br /&gt;Sweet smile.&lt;br /&gt;Ryan Danielle Ashley probably even has a game-changing personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s no denying the chemistry between them. It’s so fiery, it’s undeniable. They partake in it. Enjoy it. &lt;br /&gt;They really enjoy it. &lt;br /&gt;Attraction is not a problem. Nor is their banter, relationship status, or habits. That’s all fine. Perfect, actually. &lt;br /&gt;The problem is as tangled up as their sheets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWITCH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mallory Sims is late for her first day of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spilling her tea, she discovers she has no gas in her car. Add that her arm keeps sticking to her dress from syrup left on the console of her car, flustered feels like an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she sees her new boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham Landry is the epitome of NSFW in his custom-fit suit, black-rimmed glasses, and a look so stern her libido doesn’t stand a chance. Being flustered is just the start of her problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her punctuality is only the start of his. With a pink slip in hand, he’s been waiting on his new secretary to show up only to let her go. Then she rushes in with her doe eyes and rambling excuses, smelling like bacon and lavender. The termination paper falls to the side as she falls in his arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a disaster in the making. Not because of his pinpoint exactness or her free spirit, but because when they’re together, the sparks that fly threaten to burn the whole place down.</description>

  <description>She had everything stolen from her in a blink of an eye. He watched his mistakes turn him into a man he didn’t recognize.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Learning to fight was never on the top of Savannah’s list of things to do. Until learning to defend herself was the only option she had. To keep her focus she’s had to build walls around her heart. Trust isn’t a risk she can afford—especially when her past could catch up with her at any moment. But Liam…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liam will do whatever it takes to win Savannah’s love. But he has his own battles to wage, his own redemption to win. Trying to balance both may cost him everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When flames engulf them, will they be able to rise from the ashes?</description>

  <description>I can’t stand Tatum from the second she walks into the room. Everything about her puts me on edge—from her small delicate curves to the smile that she refuses to lose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s nothing she loves more than to piss me off. She’s infused herself in every part of my life, taking away the silence I crave. I’d walk away if I could. If I hadn’t been shot. If I didn’t need physical therapy. If I could resist her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only kiss her to shut her up. I didn’t expect it to turn into the hottest moment of my life with our clothes scattered on the floor. The one-time thing turns into something neither of us expects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my guard drops and secrets are revealed, I’ll do anything to protect Tate. We have enemies lurking around every corner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will my vow of honor cost me the one thing I can’t live without?</description>

  <description>One look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s all it takes for me to know I wanted Ava for more than one night. She takes a single look at me and only sees a player. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young, single mom doesn’t give her trust easily. Convincing her I want more than a one night stand is the best thing I’ve ever done until it all crashes down around me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I’m framed for crimes I didn’t commit, I fight to prove my innocence and battle to convince Ava and her daughter to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the stakes rise, will I be able to prove my vow of devotion?</description>

  <description>She fled from the depths of hell, her life barely in tact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris is finally living a peaceful life away from all that she fears. She’s ready to come out of hiding and start living again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He walked away from a life no one is supposed to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callan’s been looking over his shoulder for the past two years. There’s a reason they say the mafia is for life. Now, in a new city, and as the guardian of his sister, he has the chance to create a life he can be proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris’s world is rocked off its axis when she meets her new neighbor with turquoise eyes and a protective streak a mile wide. Soon the chemistry between them sparks to life and it’s not long before passion consumes them. But their pasts are never too far away…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When those he loves the most are threatened, will the cost of his sacrifice be his own life?</description>

  <description>Hadley Jacobs is over Machlan Gibson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, she’ll always be a little weak to the dimple in his right cheek and the way his five o’clock shadow makes him ruggedly handsome. But that’s not enough to cover every other thing about him because they all drive her nuts. Like how he won’t admit he’s wrong even when he knows it and how he drives his stupid car a million miles an hour on wet asphalt. As she rolls back into town and takes a seat at Crave, she won’t take the bait. She’s over him. Mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machlan isn’t over her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not because he hasn’t tried. He reminds himself over and over that she’s not the girl for him. After all, she drives him insane with her sassy attitude and the way she calls him out on everything. She beats him at poker, even though she doesn’t know the difference between a straight and a flush, and when she looks at him with her bright, blue eyes, it’s unnerving. When she climbs onto that bar stool and orders a drink, he puts it in front of her and ignores the sparkle in her eyes. He’s not over her, but she won’t know that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she does know that. And he knows she’s not as over him as she’s pretending to be. When life forces their hand this time, there’s more on the line than a pile of poker chips. It’s their forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crave is a standalone romance in a new small town, blue-collar series from USA Today bestselling author Adriana Locke. Join readers everywhere as they fall in love with the delicious Gibson Boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming October 1, 2018</description>

  <description>Crank is a standalone romance in a new small town, blue-collar series from USA Today bestselling author Adriana Locke. Join readers everywhere as they fall in love with the delicious Gibson Boys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is one mistake Sienna Landry can’t buy her way out of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Walker Gibson looks at her, then at the damage to his precious truck (that she may or may not have accidentally inflicted), she knows she’s in trouble. It’s not the busted headlight and dented grill that’s sunk her though. It’s the downright sinful man in front of her that’s the problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The small town mechanic is broody. Rough. Smells like engine grease and gasoline and Sienna isn’t sure why that’s so sexy, but it is. It so is. She’s ready to peel off her panties at the drop of his wrench. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He wants her too. She can feel it when he brushes against her. Experience it as he presses her against the wall of the shop. It’s thinly veiled in his deep, brown eyes when he looks at her like she’s everything he’s ever wanted. So why won’t he give in? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The damage to Walker’s truck is the first of many mistakes between the two of them, ending with truths that rock Sienna’s world. Nothing can fix her broken heart except the love of a man that won’t, maybe even can’t, love her back.</description>

  <description>Screw him and his perfect stats.&lt;br /&gt;Sinful smirk.&lt;br /&gt;Delicious body.&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Landry probably even has game-winning stamina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d like to screw her and her perfect ass.&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous curves. &lt;br /&gt;Sweet smile.&lt;br /&gt;Danielle Ashley probably even has a game-changing personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s no denying the chemistry between them. It’s so fiery, it’s undeniable. They partake in it. Enjoy it. &lt;br /&gt;They really enjoy it. &lt;br /&gt;Attraction is not a problem. Nor is their banter, relationship status, or habits. That’s all fine. Perfect, actually. &lt;br /&gt;The problem is as tangled up as their sheets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A STANDALONE romantic comedy from USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Alec is book 17 in the Reed Security series and it is recommended that they are read in order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alec&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been chasing this damn woman for three years. Our relationship is finally out in the open and I'm not letting this chance slip past me. I will make her mine, and there won't be any room for arguments. There's the slight problem of Craig, our other teammate. He knows what we do in the other rooms at night, or during the day, and that leaves us in a bit of a predicament. But we'll work it out. I always get my woman, and Florrie is all mine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Florrie&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took me by surprise when I fell for Alec. I hadn't intended to ever sleep with my teammate, but then one day, he was there and so damn sexy. It was just supposed to be sex, nothing more. But he kept pushing and then one day, it was out in the open. Everyone knew and there was no way for me to stop what was happening. Except, there's just one problem, I've got a secret that ensures we'll never be together in the way he wants. Now I just have to find a way to tell him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Who is he?” Hunter asked. “Just tell me and I’ll kick his a$$.” &lt;br /&gt;“I think I can do my own a$$-kicking.” &lt;br /&gt;“No. Whoever this a$$hole is, just tell us and we’ll take care of things. We’ll make sure you never see him again. If you know what I mean,” he continued. &lt;br /&gt;“I know exactly what you mean, and no, you don’t need to make him disappear.” &lt;br /&gt;“But, that’s what we do. We don’t know how to solve any other problems,” Gabe said, almost in confusion. &lt;br /&gt;Rocco groaned and held up a hand to ward off the guys. “I didn’t want to get involved, but it looks like I’m gonna have to. Why don’t you tell us about this guy. What’s he like?” &lt;br /&gt;“Smart, strong, capable…” &lt;br /&gt;“Sexy?” &lt;br /&gt;“Of course,” I huffed. “But he’s confusing. I thought that he was into me, but then nothing happened. Is it me? Am I not pretty enough?” &lt;br /&gt;“No,” Sinner said, shaking his head sharply. &lt;br /&gt;“Of course not-” Hunter snorted uncomfortably. &lt;br /&gt;“You’re beautiful,” Rocco said firmly, and the other guys joined in. &lt;br /&gt;“Sexy as hell.” &lt;br /&gt;“Nice rack.” &lt;br /&gt;“Good a$$. Nice and firm.” &lt;br /&gt;“You have nice elbows,” Sinner said. &lt;br /&gt;“What?” I asked in confusion. Hunter smacked him upside the head. &lt;br /&gt;“I panicked,” Sinner said. “You all said nice rack, good a$$. What else was left?” &lt;br /&gt;“You could have gone with beautiful eyes,” I snapped. “Or even nice legs, but nice elbows? Who the f#@k says that?” &lt;br /&gt;“Obviously not this guy you’re seeing or he’d already be dead,” Rocco muttered. &lt;br /&gt;“Did you f#@k him?” Hunter asked. “Guys always lose interest after you f#@k them.” &lt;br /&gt;“No,” I sneered. “It’s not like I just spread my legs for any guy I come across.” &lt;br /&gt;“Did you come right out and tell him you like him?” Rocco asked. “Some guys are f#@king stupid and can’t take a hint.” &lt;br /&gt;“Actually, I wrote him a note and told him that I really liked him and asked if he liked me too.” &lt;br /&gt;“Like in the song?” Sinner asked. &lt;br /&gt;“Yeah,” I snarked. “Just like in the song. I even drew boxes and asked him to check yes or no.” &lt;br /&gt;“Did he answer?” &lt;br /&gt;“No, you idiot! I didn’t actually do that. I’m not in second grade.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Alison Freeman met Keene Marshall because of a dare she wholeheartedly regrets accepting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her family's corporate lawyer, Alison discards the idea of love as quickly as she negotiates contracts. Brutally. She realizes she's been a fool over Keene—who is now intimately embedded in her family. It only adds to the enormity of emotions churning inside about her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keene Marshall is arrogant enough to know his time with Alison left a lasting impression. He has yet to determine what place she's going to hold in his life, but he knows there will be one. They burn too hot for there not to be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having closed himself off from his humanity for so long, finding Alison again presents its own set of challenges. Keene struggles with everything from his family to the walls Alison persistently builds between them. And he can't handle the emotions that come with being denied what he wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alison's wary of Keene. Something is holding her back, except every time his lips touch hers, she's flung into the race of her life for the one thing she claims she never wanted to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Although set in the same world as Free to Dream, this is a standalone, contemporary romance with dark and suspenseful undertones***</description>

  <description>Cassidy Freeman doesn’t believe dreams come true because every night her dreams trap her in a nightmare she barely escaped as a child. She maintains rigid control over all aspects of her life, giving the illusion she's strong and confident. Allowing very few close enough to see the brave heart buried beneath, she’s convinced she’ll carry her burdens alone.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the minute they met, Caleb Lockwood disrupted everything by destroying her sense of order. His patience, compassion and sensuality obliterated her defenses. It’s as if he knew her from the inside out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Helping his younger brother hire a wedding planner shouldn’t have led to this. In just a few short days, Caleb’s learned untold secrets about his family – and about the Freemans. When he demands to meet them, he doesn’t expect the pull he feels towards the petite dynamo in front of him whom life has dealt an unspeakable hand.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Caleb, Cassidy’s lost her semblance of control. Now, she's not sure she wants it back. Not if giving it up means having a chance at something she never imagined.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This is a standalone, contemporary romance with dark and suspenseful undertones***</description>

  <description>Baker Corinna Freeman cut all ties with Colby Hunt when she learned what the handsome military officer really thought about her and her cooking skills. She walked away; heartbroken, pride in tatters, keeping secrets she was far too young to shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a decade later, Corinna’s reputation is legendary — both in and out of the kitchen. This bold woman is determined to live life to its fullest while she can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one major problem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colby’s suddenly turning up everywhere acting as if nothing has changed between them in the last ten years. It infuriates her because he can still stir her up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colby Hunt never understood why Corinna walked out of his life without a word. He’s not letting this chance pass to figure out what happened with the voluptuous beauty who captured his heart. Despite his anger, he’s never really let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s something she’s hiding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Corinna’s perfect cakes, secrets fall apart. When they do, they will test the strength and courage of not only Corinna and Colby but the entire Freeman family.</description>

  <description>My story isn’t unique.&lt;br /&gt;Isn’t rare.&lt;br /&gt;Which is, I guess, what makes it so sad.&lt;br /&gt;The story about a girl who falls in love with the wrong man, lured by tender gazes, devoted promises and gentle touches. The gentle touches disappear and she’s held captive with ugly insults and brutal beatings.&lt;br /&gt;It’s common, this story. My past.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t change the past.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn’t even if I could.&lt;br /&gt;The ugliness of my past gave me a future worth living for.&lt;br /&gt;Worth dying for.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a reason to fight. To escape.&lt;br /&gt;That was my mistake. Thinking girls like me could have a choice.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t given many promises in my life that weren’t broken, but chaos is a constant promise, always kept, never broken.&lt;br /&gt;He comes amongst the chaos. Amongst the ugly.&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t promise a way out. He definitely doesn’t promise peace. But he gives me the opportunity for a different ending to my story.</description>

  <description>Gina: &lt;br /&gt;Freshly brewed tea. Earl Grey, loose leaf. &lt;br /&gt;Rain on the windowsills. The smell of library books. Escape into worlds greater than this. &lt;br /&gt;Solitude. &lt;br /&gt;Invisibility. &lt;br /&gt;A quiet life. Maybe boring, but boring was never dangerous. Until I saw what I was missing out on. Who I was missing out on. The man who shattered my boring, safe life and lay it to ruin. &lt;br /&gt;The man I’d been in love with since I was a teenager. Who I’d been invisible to since I was a teenager. &lt;br /&gt;The man who just happened to be a world-famous rock star. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam: &lt;br /&gt;Whisky. Neat. Leave the bottle. &lt;br /&gt;Crowd of hundreds of people. No, make it thousands. All shouting my name. Live fast. Die... &lt;br /&gt;Die? I’m too young, too famous and far too badass to die. Death doesn’t happen when you stop breathing, it’s what happens before that. Death is the monotony of life. The grave? Well, all the greats live there. You’re not a rock star until you die before you’re thirty. The grave doesn't bother me. &lt;br /&gt;Just the quiet. &lt;br /&gt;That is death in the life of rock. &lt;br /&gt;But then... her. &lt;br /&gt;She’d been there all along and I’d been too blind, too obsessed with the fast, loud life to realize where the real Nirvana lay. &lt;br /&gt;In the silence. &lt;br /&gt;Even the grave couldn’t hold me if I didn’t get her. &lt;br /&gt;And I’m a rock star. &lt;br /&gt;And a badass. &lt;br /&gt;And as stubborn as I am good-looking. &lt;br /&gt;I know how to get what I want. &lt;br /&gt;I also know how to kill anyone who gets in my way.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Olivia Cunning has delighted readers with her wildly popular Sinners on Tour series, the perfect blend of steamy sex, heartwarming romance, and wicked humor. &lt;br /&gt;Now, get &lt;b&gt;all five&lt;/b&gt; scorching reads for one low price: &lt;i&gt;Backstage Pass, Rock Hard, Hot Ticket, Wicked Beat&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Double Time&lt;/i&gt;.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sex is incredible and the love is even better. Each rocker has a piece of my heart."--&lt;em&gt;Night Owl Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, 5 Stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hot men, rocking music, and explosive sex? What could be better?"--&lt;em&gt;Seriously Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;About the Books in This Bundle&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;em&gt; Backstage Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been months since lead guitarist Brian Sinclair composed anything. But when sexy psychology professor Myrna Evans comes on tour to study groupie mentality, Brian finds the spark he needs to reignite his musical genius. When lust turns to love, can Brian convince Myrna that what they have is more than just a fling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Rock Hard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stage is the only place lead singer Sed Lionheart feels any passion since he lost Jessica, the law student who broke off their engagement. But trapped together on the tour bus for the summer, Sed and Jessica will rediscover their penchant for public encounters and the millions of steamy reasons they never should have called it quits...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Double Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the rebound from the tumult of his bisexual lifestyle, rhythm guitarist Trey Mills falls for sizzling new guitar sensation Reagan Elliot. Ecstatic to be on tour learning the ropes with Trey's band, Reagan finds she craves Trey just as much as the spotlight. When Reagan's ex, Ethan, returns, Trey's secret desires flare, and Reagan agrees to a hot new world of sexual experience with the two men she loves the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.&lt;em&gt; Hot Ticket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with his past, bassist Jace Seymour seeks dominatrix Aggie to help placate his inner turmoil. Aggie doesn't have much use for men, but Jace quickly steals her heart. When circumstances threaten Jace's position in Sinners, Aggie must help him regain his rightful place while showing him that time and love can heal all wounds.&lt;/p&gt; 5. &lt;i&gt;Wicked Beat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rebekah Blake becomes the Sinners' new soundboard operator, she can't wait to seduce guitarist Trey. Instead she catches the eye of red-hot drummer Eric Sticks, who sets out to prove that he is the only man who can give her everything her dirty mind desires...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Blue Bloods:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Within New York City's most elite families, there lurks a secret society: its members are powerful, wealthy and unhuman. They are the Blue Bloods, an ancient group of vampires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schuyler Van Alen has never fit in at her prestigious New York City private school. She prefers baggy, vintage clothes to Prada and pearls. But when she turns fifteen, Schuyler's life changes dramatically: haunted by the death of a classmate, she craves raw meat and finds herself the romantic interest of Jack Force, the most popular boy in school. As one discovery leads to the next, Schuyler finds herself drawn into the elusive social circle of the Blue Bloods-and a mystery that threatens to destroy them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Masquerade&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Schuyler wants an explanation for the mysterious deaths of young vampires, and travels to Italy in the hope of finding the one man who can help her grandfather. Meanwhile, back in New York, glamorous Blue Bloods prepare for the Four Hundred Ball an exclusive gala hosted by the city's powerful undead but it's at the after-party masquerade that the real danger lurks. Hidden behind the masks is a revelation that will change the course of a young vampire's destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Revelations&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schuyler's heritage is under scrutiny: is the young vampire in fact a Blue Blood, or is the sinister Silver Blood coursing through her veins? As controversy swirls, Schuyler is stranded in the Force household, trapped with her nemesis, Mimi Force, and her forbidden crush, Jack Force. But when an ancient center of power is threatened, the Blue Bloods need Schuyler on their side. Romance, glamour, and vampire lore collide in Melissa de la Cruz's best-selling Blue Bloods series.</description>

  <description>They say one action doesn’t define you. &lt;br /&gt;I killed a man. Stabbed him in the neck and licked the blood off my lips after I did it. &lt;br /&gt;Still, one action doesn’t define you. &lt;br /&gt;I could have called anyone. My father, the Prez of The Fallen MC, our family lawyer, my best friend, Lila, or my brother, King. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t. &lt;br /&gt;Instead, I called Lionel Danner, the police officer renowned for taking down the Nightstalkers MC. The man who had been my father’s arch nemesis for decades. The man who hated everything I stood for. A man who had disappeared from my life without explanation three years ago. &lt;br /&gt;I called him. &lt;br /&gt;And maybe one action doesn’t define you, but killing a bad man and calling in the good changed my life and it sure as hell changed his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The third book in the Fallen Men series. A standalone featuring Harleigh Rose and Officer Lionel Danner.</description>

  <description>I was a good girl. &lt;br /&gt;I ate my vegetables, volunteered at the local autism centre and sat in the front pew of church every Sunday. &lt;br /&gt;Then, I got cancer. &lt;br /&gt;What the hell kind of reward was that for a boring life well lived? &lt;br /&gt;I was a seventeen-year-old paradigm of virtue and I was tired of it. &lt;br /&gt;So, when I finally ran into the man I'd been writing to since he saved my life as a little girl and he offered to show me the dark side of life before I left it for good, I said yes. &lt;br /&gt;Only, I didn't know that Zeus Garro was the President of The Fallen MC and when you made a deal with a man who is worse than the devil, there was no going back... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is Daddy Zeus Garro's story from &lt;i&gt;Lessons In Corruption&lt;/i&gt;. A standalone in &lt;i&gt;The Fallen Men&lt;/i&gt; series.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>At fifteen, Jamie Murphy finds herself broken and alone, convinced she doesn't need anyone. &lt;br /&gt;Until she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear is the boy behind the fence, the one who was there for her when no one else was. &lt;br /&gt;Until he's not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left with nothing, Jamie joins the army hoping it will give her purpose. The last thing she expects is the best friend from her past to reappear in the dusty plains of a war-torn country. No longer the boy she once knew, Bear is now a man: big, bearded, and SAS—one of the army’s elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Jamie finds herself not only fighting against her enemies, but her feelings for a man who left her once before. Can she risk losing him all over again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting Absolution is a 130k friends to lovers romance. It features characters from Fighting Redemption, but is written as a standalone.</description>

  <description>She's a struggling single mom of two...&lt;br /&gt;He's a sexy but jaded single dad of one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Clara—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I've ever wanted was my Prince Charming. &lt;br /&gt;Life gave me a monster instead. &lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, my sons and I escaped his clutches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we're safe. &lt;br /&gt;Happy. &lt;br /&gt;Secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends beg me to give love a second chance. &lt;br /&gt;I only have one thing to say to that...

  <description>Gabriel Luca Maldonado, III and Francesca Leandra Solomon were meant to be. They were so in love that everybody prayed for what they had. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything was glorious. They would get married, have children and live a perfect life. She would be a doctor in the emergency room once she finished her doctorate, and he would be a badass Navy SEAL and save people for a living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then Luca is deployed across the world, and per military regulations, Frankie isn’t allowed to follow. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’ve overcome a lot in their short relationship, and they can overcome this, too. Two years was a piece of cake. She’d finish her schooling and wait for him. And when he finally returned home, they would marry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But two months into Luca’s deployment, the unthinkable happens, and Frankie is left alone and heartbroken, knowing that she’ll have to face the rest of life without Luca at her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years, and Frankie is exactly where her fiancé’s father left her, in a pit of despair that she has no hope of ever finding her way out of. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She lives life one second at a time, depressed and alone, hoping tomorrow won’t hurt like today. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She finds a job, moves, and hopes that the nightmares won’t swallow her whole. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But just as she thinks that she’s getting better, one of her nightmares walks through the doors of her ER, and that nightmare has a name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Luca Maldonado, III. In the flesh. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also healthy and whole, and definitely no longer missing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it only takes her a half a second to realize that the man that left her isn’t the same man that returned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The old one wanted her. The new one? Well, he’s definitely not interested anymore. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>He saw her from across a crowded ballpark and knew she was about to change his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, he realizes just how cliché that really is, but the moment his eyes locked on her, he knew that she was the one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, the one that royally screwed him over. The one responsible for his demotion and the subsequent disciplinary action taken against him before he’d even gotten out of the probationary period with Kilgore Police Department. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It all started with a kiss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Saylor Rae Spada tried to mind her business. She also tried to not get involved in petty disputes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, from the moment she saw him sitting next to her at a professional baseball game, a game she didn’t even want to be at but was dragged to by her blind date, she couldn’t look away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the kiss cam came on, featuring none other than her and the handsome stranger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Without missing a beat, he kissed her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then her blind date decided to pull a knife and try to stab him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that point forward, she’s done nothing but cause him trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trouble that he’s starting to find increasingly adorable. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Brooklyn Myers, Esquire. &lt;br /&gt;The name alone made me hard. &lt;br /&gt;Dressed in cheap bargain suits, she still was a knockout. &lt;br /&gt;Amber eyes that call to me like none other. &lt;br /&gt;I should have ignored her. &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t ready for the promise of simply her. &lt;br /&gt;I claimed her anyway, even if I never meant to keep her. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lucas Black, Esquire. &lt;br /&gt;The name alone was an enigma. &lt;br /&gt;Dressed in a suit that cost more than my rent. &lt;br /&gt;Green eyes that danced and a cocky smile firmly planted on kissable lips. &lt;br /&gt;The rumors about him were true. &lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t ready for all that was Lucas Black. I knew it. I didn’t care. &lt;br /&gt;I was willing to take whatever he gave me. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Nineteen-year-old Bellarosa has lived the past three years locked away in a tower, freedom, being only a myth she could fantasize about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has tried to break free of her chains but has failed at every attempt. That is, until a friend turns a blind eye and allows for her to escape her confines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The president of the Savage Beast MC is no easy role to play. Neither is being a single father. His focus has always been his club and his daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At almost forty, Dragon is convinced he will never find a woman to call his own, not unless he buys her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both lost souls searching for freedom. Both stumbling upon one another. Unsure if they can trust each other. She searches for happily ever after. He will never be her prince charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When two people who learn to trust despite their pasts come together, they become an unstoppable force, something that not even the devil could split apart.</description>

  <description>Esther has only craved to be loved by one man, the Wolfe who hides behind his broken ice blue eyes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the wild man she craves has desires that she doesn’t feel able to fill. These desires will destroy her if she allows them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wolfe, the road captain for the Savage Beast MC, is known for his ruthlessness. The forty-year-old has demons that haunt the beast inside of him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He cannot be the man who deserves to love her. He knows it’s wrong. He knows it will break her, but he cannot help himself. She wants a wild man. He is as wild as they come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two souls searching for a way to find acceptance, love, and healing in physical pleasures. Both lost. One the devil. One a fallen angel. When they finally give in to their lust, their love blossoms like neither imagined possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*INCLUDES A SHORT STORY : UnLove Me</description>

  <description>Lea was born into the Notorious Devils life. A daughter of a traitor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She fell in love at the age of fourteen, maybe even before that. She is determined to become a woman that he can love, even if she can never have him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trouble appears in her life, she is forced to call upon the Devils to save her. She reaches out to the one man that she knows she shouldn’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby knows that his relationship with Lea has only ever been platonic. Even if nobody else in the club has understood their bond, he has only ever wanted to protect her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his phone rings six years after she leaves for boarding school, he doesn’t hesitate to come to her rescue. After all, he has always vowed to have her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows it’s wrong. He cannot deny that this wild child has turned into a beautiful wild woman. One that he cannot let go. He must make her his, even if he is not available to give himself to her completely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**INCLUDES A SHORT STORY: SHOT WITH FREEDOM</description>

  <description>Guilty. ExCon. Felon. Prisoner. Criminal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Words that now represent me. &lt;br /&gt;Words that keep any decent person away from me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never gave much thought to words before now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Slut. Hussy. Whore. Homewrecker. Jezebel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Words that now reflect me. &lt;br /&gt;Words that will stay indefinitely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The evidence of those words grow inside of me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Those Words make the entire town assume they are vindicated to use them. &lt;br /&gt;I am wrong. &lt;br /&gt;They are right.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Drew is a new beginnings romance and the fourth book in the series, &lt;i&gt;For The Love Of A Good Woman.&lt;/i&gt; It can be read as a standalone, but the characters are intertwined in the whole series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Iris. I swear I could feel her on the breeze, standing here in the serenity of the country. She was my life, my dreams, my love, my wife, but above all that, she was my reason for being. I closed my eyes as memories of the smell of her perfume wafted around me, pulling me into a daydream of her walking toward me and teasing me. I could see her beautiful, huge smile that lit up my whole world. Her sharp, blue eyes sparkled as she gazed at me, my chest aching, knowing this was all a dream. Still, I kept my eyes closed, relishing in every piece of her I took with me six years ago. Her long, chestnut hair was blowing in the breeze as she walked closer to me, her voice floating in the wind. I could feel her hand resting against my chest as she leaned in to whisper in my ear. &lt;br /&gt;“I’m forever yours, Drew. Nothing can take me from you.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How do you move on when you lose the love of your life in such a tragic way? Even seven years later, getting over the woman that you planned to spend your life with and have a family with seems impossible. When that person is so ingrained in who you are, is there really any hope of creating a life you can be happy with, let alone finding someone new to love? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Sarah walked into Drew's life and interrupted his most intimate moments with his dead wife, he cursed her and vowed that he would never like this woman. She was a screw up and possessed something that was so precious to him, but just out of reach. Their paths continued to cross in ways that left him angry and confused, until one day he found himself becoming intrigued with his new neighbor and needing to know what it was that drew him to her. Could he move on from the woman he loved more than anything in this world, or would he find himself unable to let her go when the time came? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My life went from blissfully wonderful to completely devastating in a matter of hours. No longer able to live the life I once had, I was forced to become someone new. Even the gift that I was given wasn't enough to bring me out of my depressed state. Still, I had no choice but to move forward with my life and make the most of the last and greatest gift I was given. No one would ever be able to know who I am or the secrets I carry. I would forever be another woman who couldn't even properly mourn what had been lost. My new neighbor, Drew, was surly and completely hateful, at least he was with me. For some reason, I set him on edge and made him lash out at me. When we finally fell on someone even ground, would I be able to give him what he needed or were the secrets I held just too much of a burden to truly move forward?</description>

  <description>Cole &lt;br /&gt; After leaving the military as a Marine Scout Sniper, he suffered from PTSD and was barely functioning most days. Nightmares plagued him most nights and it took him three years to be a functioning part of society. While out running off a nightmare, he finds a woman stumbling out of the woods, barely alive. She looks to him for protection. She looks to him to save her. Can he overcome his own demons to keep the woman he is falling in love with out of the hands of a killer? &lt;br /&gt;Alex &lt;br /&gt;She has suffered through her parents being murdered in front of her. She spent years in foster care, shuffled from one unloving home to the next. Now she's been kidnapped and if she doesn't figure out how to escape, she will die at the hands of the man who killed her parents. She needs someone to protect her and love her. Can Cole be that man or will her kidnapper find her and take her from the man she has come to love?</description>

  <description>Revenge never tasted so sweet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had started over and made a great life for myself. Then Logan walked back into my life, but he didn't recognize me. He had walked away ten years ago and devastated me. Now I would get my revenge and make him pay for hurting me. Who says that revenge can't be fun? He's still the same cocky guy I knew, but he's also sweet and that made me question how long I could hold out for. I planned to thoroughly enjoy my time with Logan before I destroyed his life. I just hoped the cost wouldn't be too high. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've lived my life the way I wanted to, not answering to anyone else. The result was friends that don't have a very high opinion of me and a lonely life that I started to wish included someone who truly cared for me. Cece was the hottest thing I'd ever seen and the moment I had her, I knew she was not just someone that would pass through my life. My attraction to her didn't dim, even when she left me tied to a bed. Her spirit and spunky attitude didn't push me away no matter how hard she tried, but I began to question if I could truly bring this woman around or if she would be the one to tear my world apart.</description>

  <description>Jack &lt;br /&gt;I'm driving along when I see a woman sitting in a puddle on the side of the road. I stop to help her and instantly need to have her. Our chemistry is explosive, quite literally. It seems we are going to have to repair a few things. She's feisty and sexy as hell, but I keep screwing it up. &lt;br /&gt;Harper &lt;br /&gt;This day couldn't get any worse. All that's left is for lightning to strike me. And then it does, in the form of sexy mechanic, Jack. If I could keep my wits about me, I might survive him, but I seem to have verbal diarrhea around him. He brings excitement into my life and sex to my books.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the 14th book in the Reed Security Series and the 2nd book of a 3 book arc. The arc books need to be read in order and it is suggested that the rest of the series is read in order as well.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jackson Lewis saved Raegan Cartwright from a terrible situation and has been keeping her and her parents safe. Raegan knows she can trust the sexy man she's staying with, but her confidence has taken a beating. Still, she refuses to be the wilting flower that everyone expects of her. If only she could get Jackson to see that. He sees only what he wants to, sure that her refusal to talk about what happened as a sign she couldn't move on. But when all hell breaks loose at Reed Security, Raegan is pulled into one dangerous situation after another. When it is discovered that Raegan isn't just an innocent bystander but directly linked to Reed Security's current situation, she finds herself even more intertwined and is fully prepared to face her issues head-on. But this is more than just an abusive ex. This is something that involves innocent people and deadly consequences. But Reed Security is relying on her and she won't let them down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Do you want to tell me why you f*@king shot me?” &lt;br /&gt;“I didn’t…what? Where?” &lt;br /&gt;He pulled the ripped fabric away from his thigh where blood trickled sluggishly. &lt;br /&gt;“It doesn’t look that bad.” &lt;br /&gt;“It’s not, but why the f*@k were you shooting at me?” &lt;br /&gt;“Because I was trying to kill the bad guys,” I shouted. &lt;br /&gt;“Yeah, with your f*@king eyes closed! Who does that?” &lt;br /&gt;“I was scared!” &lt;br /&gt;“So, you close your eyes and hope for the best?” &lt;br /&gt;“It was a gut reaction. I didn’t mean to do it. It just happened!” &lt;br /&gt;“And did you mean to follow me and join in the action? Because you were supposed to stay right where you f*@king were while I took care of them.” &lt;br /&gt;“You didn’t say that,” I shouted incredulously. “You shoved a gun in my hand and ran away. I thought I was supposed to be your backup or something. Next time say something.” &lt;br /&gt;“There won’t be a next time. I’m not ever giving you a gun again!” &lt;br /&gt;“I’ll do better next time!” &lt;br /&gt;He scoffed. “Yeah, like you might keep your eyes open? Or you’ll try not to shoot me?” &lt;br /&gt;I scowled at him and stomped around the back of the truck and over to the passenger side of the truck, opening the door and hopping in. &lt;br /&gt;“What are you doing?” &lt;br /&gt;“We’re leaving, aren’t we?” &lt;br /&gt;“Not in that truck. There are a man’s innards all over the front. That’s not exactly being discreet.” &lt;br /&gt;“Well, I didn’t know that,” I said, hopping out of the truck and stomping back around to his side. “You could have just said, ‘Hey, Raegan, we’re going to grab a different truck since I just splattered a man against this one. See how easy that is?” &lt;br /&gt;“I would think the fact that there’s a dead man attached to the grill would have clued you in,” he scowled.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Chance "Sniper" Hendrix is all about a good time. He was married when he was serving as a Navy SEAL and it didn't work out so well for him. When his wife left him, he decided that he was going to enjoy life and do what he loved. He knows that marriage can be good, but he just doesn't want to go there again. He never intended to sleep with a stripper. He never intended to get involved in her life. But now that he has, there's no turning back. But there's nothing fun about the situation he just got himself into and there may be no way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan James is searching for her missing daughter, Payton. After months of a dead end investigation, she takes matters into her own hands. Working as a stripper, she's looking for a man named 'The Broker'. He either has the information she needs or he's the one behind the devious plot. She'll do anything to get her daughter back, but in this tangled web of lies and manipulations, who can she trust?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jules&lt;/i&gt; is the 12th book in the &lt;i&gt;Reed Security&lt;/i&gt; series. It is recommended that they are read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Julian&lt;/b&gt; swore he would always love her. He said he would never leave her. He's about to break that promise. If only she would listen. If only she would trust him. But how much crap can one man take? It's time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivy&lt;/b&gt; wants Julian more than anything, but she's won't trust anyone with her secrets. Now it's too late. He doesn't want her, but she needs him more than ever. If only she could make him understand. If only she had told him sooner how she felt, but that train has left the station and her life is going to hell. She should have told him she loved him when she had the chance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ice is the 9th book in the Reed Security Series and should be read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ice. Lady Killer. Perpetual bachelor. Until Lindsey stepped into his life, Ice had never considered having a relationship ever again. He liked his life the way it was and that was the end of that conversation. But when Ice kidnaps Lindsey to protect her, he has no choice but to bring her home with him. And that's where the problems begin. There's a very fine line between love and hate, but which side will they land on? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“What the hell is that?” I shouted. &lt;br /&gt;“My feet are cold. You keep it like an ice box in here.” &lt;br /&gt;“So, put on some damn socks, woman!” &lt;br /&gt;“No, I can’t sleep with socks on. My feet sweat and then I get uncomfortable.” &lt;br /&gt;“So, it’s okay for you to sleep how you’re comfortable, but not me?” &lt;br /&gt;“You’re sleeping naked. There’s a difference between being completely naked and sleeping without socks on.” &lt;br /&gt;“For all I know, you could have some toe fungus and I could catch if from you because you don’t have socks on.” &lt;br /&gt;“Really? A toe fungus?” &lt;br /&gt;“People get them. I don’t know you. You could be one of those people that only changes their socks once a week.” &lt;br /&gt;“This coming from the man that couldn’t remember the last time he washed his sheets,” she snorted. &lt;br /&gt;“Hey, I work out of town a lot. It’s not like I sleep in my bed every night. And I always shower before I get in bed. It’s not like I’m dirty.” &lt;br /&gt;“Sheets that aren’t washed regularly can cause acne. All that bacteria that lives in your bed can clog your hair follicles and your skin could break out.” &lt;br /&gt;“I have flawless skin. I’m not worried,” I said in irritation. &lt;br /&gt;“Do you know how many skin cells you leave behind in your bed?” She sat up and turned to me with a sneer. “You lose about 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells every minute. So, in an eight hour night of sleep, you would lose at least 14,400,000 skin cells that are just hanging out on your sheets.” &lt;br /&gt;“You have way too much time on your hands if you figured that out and remembered it.”&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lola is the eighth book in the &lt;i&gt;Reed Security&lt;/i&gt; series and the conclusion to Ryan's book in the series &lt;i&gt;For The Love Of A Good Woman&lt;/i&gt;. The books should be read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Ladies, I’m going to demonstrate how you can take out someone that is coming at you from the front. Now, Derek is going to come at me.” I motioned him forward and I saw a glint of fear in his eyes. I raised an eyebrow and motioned him forward. He ran toward me full force and I struck out with the heel of my hand, hitting him directly in the nose and sending him backward. Then I swung my foot as hard as I could into his nuts. He bent forward with a loud groan and collapsed on the floor in a lovely shade of red, breathing like he was in labor. &lt;br /&gt;One of his eyes peeked open and he nodded slightly to me, as if to say that he was giving in. I smiled sweetly and turned back to the girls. &lt;br /&gt;“The heel of your hand is your best bet. Thrust it up hard into his nose. You’ll break it, leaving him disoriented with blurry vision. Then, you take him down once more where it hurts most. Make that kick count. You don’t want him recovering too fast.” &lt;br /&gt;Claire raised her hand high in the air. &lt;br /&gt;“Yes?” &lt;br /&gt;“How long is too fast?” &lt;br /&gt;“He’ll definitely be down long enough for you to get away.” &lt;br /&gt;“But, I mean, when will his functions recover? You know, his manly bits. Because I had this scenario I wanted to try later tonight and I want to know if I have to change my plans.” &lt;br /&gt;“Change your plans,” Derek grunted. He stood slightly and shuffled off to the wall where he sank down in a tight ball. &lt;br /&gt;“One more example before you all begin. Hunter? Would you care to join me?” &lt;br /&gt;He narrowed his eyes at me and slowly shook his head. &lt;br /&gt;“Hunter, don’t be such a baby,” Lucy shouted. “Come on. This is to help us out.” &lt;br /&gt;Hunter shot a death look at his fiancée but stepped forward. &lt;br /&gt;“Okay, Hunter is going to come at me from behind and wrap his arms around me in a bear hug.” &lt;br /&gt;“No,” he said firmly. &lt;br /&gt;“What’s wrong, Hunter? Are you scared of a woman?” &lt;br /&gt;“Yes,” he said immediately.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lola "Brave" Pruitt has dealt with more nightmares in her time at Reed Security than she can handle. It's time for her to move on and really start living her life without her demons tormenting her. When she finds another lost soul, Ryan Jackson, in a bar one night, she may just find her salvation. But Ryan is just as damaged as Lola and her lifestyle is one thing that he may not be able to live with.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the seventh book in the&lt;i&gt; Reed Security&lt;/i&gt; series and it is recommended that they are read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Here’s the deal. The Blood Devils and the Night Kings have declared war on us. They attacked our homes and they tortured our women. Now, this all started with Chris’s woman and we’ve talked about how we want to deal with them.” Cap looked around the room at the men and women that were standing with us. “No mercy. By the time we’re through with them, there won’t be a single one of them still standing. What we’re going to do isn’t legal and it could land us in jail if we’re caught. If you don’t want any part of this, you can walk away. Some of you have families to think about and you won’t be thought less of for wanting to protect them. OPS can go back home and the gangs will never know that you were tied to this if something goes wrong. If you’re with Reed Security, you can stay here and be on protection detail while we’re gone. The choice is yours.” &lt;br /&gt;I looked around the room and saw that no one was backing down. No one even looked hesitant. &lt;br /&gt;“After what they did to Vanessa, you can bet your a$$ I want in,” Cazzo growled. &lt;br /&gt;“They didn’t get Claire or Lucy, but they shot up my house,” Derek said. “No one gets away with that.” &lt;br /&gt;One by one, everyone from Reed Security put in their two cents on the matter. &lt;br /&gt;“They shot my dog,” Jackson glowered. “I’m in.” &lt;br /&gt;“My pillows are destroyed,” Chance sneered. “You can bet I want to mess them up.” &lt;br /&gt;The room went silent as everyone stared at Chance. &lt;br /&gt;“What?” He looked around the room at the raised eyebrows and confused faces. “That bed cost me $3000. It was the most comfortable room in the house, and the pillows were $200 a piece. They were hypoallergenic.” &lt;br /&gt;Still, everyone just stared at him. He rolled his eyes. “Hey, I don’t have a family or a dog, but I do have creature comforts and it pisses me off that someone destroyed that.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Chris "Jack" McKay left behind the love of his life seventeen years ago. Now, when she needs him most, he'll give anything to help the woman he loves and her son. But not everyone at Reed Security trusts Alison and her intentions for their teammate. Especially when two gangs come after Reed Security and their families.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Irish is the 5th book in the&lt;i&gt; Reed Security Series&lt;/i&gt; and should be read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Not a chance in hell. I happen to like my hands wrapped around your juicy ass.” &lt;br /&gt;She reared back and looked at me in horror. “You think my ass is juicy?” &lt;br /&gt;“Uh, you’ve seen it, right? It’s big and perfect for me to grab onto.” &lt;br /&gt;She struggled to get down and then pushed me away and stalked out of the water. “I can’t believe you just said my ass was big,” she yelled over her shoulder. &lt;br /&gt;I stood there a minute trying to figure out what the hell I said that was so wrong. She had the most gorgeous ass I’d ever seen. Didn’t all girls want a big ass like that Kardashian woman? I ran after her and gripped onto her arm, swinging her around to see me. &lt;br /&gt;“I like that your ass is big.” &lt;br /&gt;She burst into tears and I stood there with wide eyes, wondering what I was supposed to do. There was a reason I didn’t date women. I didn’t know what the hell to say to them on the best of days. Sex was easy. Please them and they’ll be screaming your name the whole night. This…this was totally foreign to me. &lt;br /&gt;“Having a big ass is a good thing. Men like to know they have something to grab onto. Besides, we want to know that you’re sturdy enough that we won’t break you when we f@k you.” &lt;br /&gt;She looked up at me through her tears and cried even harder. “So, now I’m sturdy? Like a tree? Next thing, you’re going to tell me I have big thighs.” &lt;br /&gt;“Big? No, definitely not big. They’re thick and muscular.” &lt;br /&gt;“Thick?” She spun away from me and ran for the beach blanket, grabbing her stuff and throwing it in her bag. &lt;br /&gt;“I like that you’re not a stick,” I said, trying to fix this before I totally f@ked up the rest of our day. “If I wanted a model, I would go find one. But those women are all beauty and no brains.” &lt;br /&gt;She sniffed and wiped at her face. “Well, I’m glad to know that I’m thick like a tree, I have a big ass, and apparently I don’t have beauty, but I have brains.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Derek "Irish" Cortell. Badass close protection agent. Sexy, panty-melting smile. Superhero? There's &lt;br /&gt;something strange about the men at Reed Security. When socially awkward Claire Grant works up the &lt;br /&gt;nerve to talk to Derek in the grocery store, it opens up a whole new world for her in which her &lt;br /&gt;fantasies are becoming reality. Yes, she's a librarian. Yes, it's quite possible she's immersed herself in &lt;br /&gt;too many books, but her eyes couldn't possibly be deceiving her. Could they? Though Claire and &lt;br /&gt;Derek seem to have your typical romance, there is nothing typical about Derek or the people he works &lt;br /&gt;with, and soon Claire will find out just how super Derek really is.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Knight is the fourth book in the &lt;i&gt;Reed Security Series&lt;/i&gt; and should be read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I stiffened. He was here. I stood and looked around the room, but I didn’t see anything. Walking over to the window, I looked out into the dark, hoping that I could see something. I would rather know exactly where he was than wonder the whole night if he was going to come for me. &lt;br /&gt;Hot air trickled across the back of my neck. My breath hitched as I felt a hand brush against the nape of my neck as my hair was shifted over my shoulder. &lt;br /&gt;“You should be more careful when you’re leaving work.” &lt;br /&gt;His voice washed over me in that rough, deep tone that sent shivers down my spine. &lt;br /&gt;“Why did you do that?” I asked, my heart beating out of control. &lt;br /&gt;“He was hurting you.” &lt;br /&gt;“I was running away. I would have gotten away.” &lt;br /&gt;His hand brushed down my arm and then back up to rest on my shoulder. “He might have come back another night. A man like that, someone who would attack a woman just to get a fix, he doesn’t deserve to live.” &lt;br /&gt;“That’s not your decision to make,” I said shakily. &lt;br /&gt;“I made it my decision the moment he put his hands on you, and I’d do it again.” &lt;br /&gt;I spun around and faced the man that I had last seen just a week ago. “I don’t need anyone killing to protect me. I heal people and that man could have been helped.” &lt;br /&gt;“That man was scum and if he went after you, he would go after someone else. He didn’t deserve to live.” &lt;br /&gt;“Like you?” &lt;br /&gt;He took a step back and his jaw tightened. “I repaid my debt. You won’t see me again.” &lt;br /&gt;“I didn’t want to see you again to begin with.” &lt;br /&gt;He backed out of my room and was gone. I had no idea how he got in or how he left. He moved so silently that I didn’t hear even my noisy stairs creak. Even though the man had just killed someone in front of me, I couldn’t help but still want to see him again, no matter what I said. He intrigued me and terrified me all at the same time. I turned back to the window and stared out into the night, wondering if I would see him again.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s no white Knight&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hudson McGuire- Ex-Marine and good friend of Hunter “Pappy” Papacosta. &lt;br /&gt;Garrick Knight- Badass assassin on a crusade to rid the world of those he deems unworthy. &lt;br /&gt;Both men are lethal. Both men are obsessed with Kate Whittemore. Both men are the same man, but only one can convince Kate that he’s the man for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knight&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was dishonorably discharged from the military after I killed my superiors. They were profiting off soldier’s &lt;br /&gt;deaths and I wouldn’t stand for it. They were righteous kills and I stand by what I did. I was sentenced to prison, &lt;br /&gt;but Pappy made sure I never saw the inside of a prison cell. Ever since then, I’ve been working as a gun for hire, &lt;br /&gt;taking on any job that rids the world of the scum of the earth. Then I met up with Pappy again and all my plans &lt;br /&gt;went to shit. I found myself working for the good guys once again and ended up in the hands of an angel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kate&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a doctor and I own my own practice in town. I never wanted to be a part of the crazy schedules of the hospital &lt;br /&gt;and wanted to have a personal connection with my patients. That started to change a little when my cousin, &lt;br /&gt;Cole called me to take care of a woman he found in the woods.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is the third book in the &lt;i&gt;Reed Security Series&lt;/i&gt; and should be read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I don’t think I’m going to like this.” &lt;br /&gt;“Doesn’t matter. You promised you would be nice to me today, so you have to do what I say.” &lt;br /&gt;“I don’t think being nice to you equates to doing whatever you say.” &lt;br /&gt;“Come on. It’ll be fun,” she said, wiggling her eyebrows up and down. &lt;br /&gt;“That’s what Sinner used to say and then we’d end up in jail in Mexico.” &lt;br /&gt;“This is me we’re talking about. How bad could it be?” &lt;br /&gt;“If I let you do whatever it is you’re about to do, there are ground rules.” &lt;br /&gt;“Fine, lay it on me.” &lt;br /&gt;“There will be no painting any of my nails or dying my hair. I’m not an experiment for you.” &lt;br /&gt;“It’s nothing like that. I just want to give you a massage. We should try to loosen up your muscles. I bet it would really feel good after doing PT.” &lt;br /&gt;She said it like she wanted to help, but all my d!@k heard was ‘it would feel really good’. There was no way in hell this was a good idea, but I had told her I would be nice to her. &lt;br /&gt;“Fine.” &lt;br /&gt;“Yes! Okay, you go in your bedroom and strip down and put a towel around your waist. Lie on your stomach and I’ll be in as soon as I have all the stuff I need.” &lt;br /&gt;“Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn’t say anything about getting naked or laying on my bed.” &lt;br /&gt;“Are you chicken?” &lt;br /&gt;“Why are you always baiting me?” &lt;br /&gt;“Why are you afraid to lie down on a bed naked and let me touch you?” She asked innocently enough, but I could see the way her eyes trailed down my body momentarily. &lt;br /&gt;“I don’t think this is a good idea.” &lt;br /&gt;“You don’t think anything is a good idea. Now, go do what I said.” &lt;br /&gt;She turned and walked away, leaving me staring where she once stood and wondering how the hell I was going to keep my body under control with her touching me. &lt;br /&gt;“I’ll be ready in five minutes and I’ll be coming in whether you’re ready or not!”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cazzo has always been the strong man that leads his team into danger and ensures their safety. But when Cazzo is shot protecting Vanessa Adams, he finds himself feeling like half the man that he used to be. When things don’t appear to be getting better with him, Cap takes things into his own hands by forcing him to protect the woman that got him into this mess to begin with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Vanessa has always been under her father’s thumb, but when the man protecting her is almost killed, she knows that she needs to figure out what’s going on behind her father’s secretive demeanor. After finding herself under Sam’s protection once &lt;br /&gt;again, it becomes more and more difficult to decide if she wants things to move forward with him or if she wants to finally have a life of her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cap is the continuation of Sebastian and Maggie's story from the series &lt;i&gt;For The Love Of A Good Woman&lt;/i&gt; and the second book in the &lt;i&gt;Reed Security Series.&lt;/i&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Reed Security Series&lt;/i&gt; must be read in order.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;“Well, I could try, but with my sciatica flaring up, I wouldn’t get very far. Besides, Harry knows exactly where to touch to get rid of the pain,” she winked at him. &lt;br /&gt;“Eww. I forgot how much I hated hearing you two flirt.” &lt;br /&gt;“If that fella of yours ever ties you down, you’ll be us someday; humping like rabbits on your neighbors bed when she’s out of town because you just can’t help yourself.” He pulled Aggie over onto his lap and did something under the table that I didn’t want to think about. She squealed and batted at his chest. &lt;br /&gt;“Oh, Harry. You’re such a devil.” &lt;br /&gt;I looked back at my room and shivered in disgust. “I slept in that bed last night.” They didn’t hear me as they continued to flirt with each other. &lt;br /&gt;“Dear, when the urge strikes at our age, you take it. Sex is like snow; you never know how many inches you’re gonna get or how long it’s going to last.” &lt;br /&gt;“That’s... sweet, Harry. I didn’t know you had it in you.” &lt;br /&gt;“Just telling it like it is, girlie. Speaking of the urge striking, I think we’d better leave, Aggie, or Maggie is going to see a bit more than she wants to. This robe doesn’t conceal much.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cap&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My attraction to Maggie has never been the problem. Her inability to ask for help and stick around long enough to receive it is. Maggie is the type of woman that every man wants. She's independent, smart as a whip, sassy, and stunningly beautiful. But all those things don't make a relationship work and if I can't figure out how to keep her, I'll have more to worry about than the arms dealer that's trying to kill us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maggie&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been wondering for the last year where my relationship with Sebastian is going. I picked up and moved my whole life to be with him, but then we never talked about more. I don't know how much more I can take of always feeling like I'm just the live-in girlfriend. When he suggests taking a break, it starts to sound like an awfully good idea, especially now that I don't want him to find out my secret, one that I hope he never finds out. The problem is, Cap never gives up without a fight.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sinner&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the &lt;i&gt;Reed Security Series&lt;/i&gt;. It is preceded by the series &lt;i&gt;For The Love Of A Good Woman&lt;/i&gt;, and it is recommended that the series be read in order, as characters from the first appear in the second.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cara&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been broken for six years. I only started leaving my house three years ago, but I waited too long and now I'm so screwed up that I can barely stand to be around other people without freaking out. When a handsome, strong man with gorgeous eyes comes to my rescue twice, my therapist suggests he become a therapy buddy of sorts to help me. His jovial personality sets me at ease and he really does start to help me heal, but my untrustworthy nature takes over and could ruin the best thing that has ever happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sinner&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone calls me Sinner because of my reputation with the ladies. I was in Special Forces until a few years ago and now I work for Reed Security. I love my job, but it's hard on relationships, which is why I don't try. Until her. Everyone sees her as damaged, but I see her spirit, her fight. I can't seem to get enough of her, but when my relationship with her threatens my job, I'm forced to choose which I want more. I just hope I chose right.</description>

  <description>Royal St. James got her name when she was born. Not because her mother loved her royally, but because Royal was a giant pain in the ass. She’s spent her entire life fighting to live, and the last thing she needs is to deal with some pretty-boy police officer who wouldn’t know a hardship if it came up and bit him in the…you know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Justice Rector wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was raised to work hard and always fight for what he believed in. His father was a cop, and ever since he could remember, he wanted to be one, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was a complete coincidence that he ends up going undercover and meeting Royal St. James. It was just one day, a single moment in time. All routine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just do the buy, make the bust, and get out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Royal St. James, aptly named, screws everything up. Royally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden, he has a decision to make: blow his cover and save the girl, or save himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Of course, he does the most stupid thing possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By saving the girl who most assuredly did not want to be saved.</description>

Now that he’s standing in front of her—body hard and chiseled from a stint in the military, suit cut to perfection, and a smirk she could never resist—remembering all the reasons why just got a whole lot harder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ford gets Ellie isn’t his biggest fan. He just doesn’t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standing in front of him, giving him hell, she’s even prettier than he remembered. All he can think about is how she felt in his arms, the taste of her kiss, the sound of her giggle in the middle of the night. He may not know how to win her back, but he does know this: he may have let her go once, but that’s one mistake he won’t make again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SWINK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m that guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camilla Landry rustles against me, the silky fabric of her overpriced lingerie slipping along my bruised rib. The porcelain perfection of her skin is even more innocent against the colorful ink dotting my own. It’s demure meets damaged, pampered meets punctured. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, it’s obvious I’m that guy. Dominic Hughes. Her attempt at rebellion. Her bid to see what the other side of the tracks feel like. I’m okay with being used because, from where I’m sitting, the other side of the tracks have never looked so good.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes your first love needs a second chance…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A boy from the wrong side of the tracks, Trent Michaels never cared what anyone thought of him. That is, until the girl he fell in love with broke his heart in the worst way possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delaney Rogers knows she made the biggest mistake of her life when she allowed Trent to walk away from her. So, when Trent unknowingly rescues her baby fifteen years later, Delaney’s relieved she’ll finally have the chance to make things right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that Trent can’t bear to look at the woman he loved and lost. The woman who now realizes just how much damage she’s done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a series of accidental encounters, Trent soon realizes that everything is not as it seems. And Delaney is hoping for a second chance to prove that it wasn’t him who was unworthy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was her.</description>

  <description>Oakley Spurlock is dying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She only has weeks to live thanks to a freak infection that totally and completely destroyed her kidneys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite her family’s desperation, not a single one of them is a match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a last-ditch attempt, Oakley’s father takes to social media to beg for help to save his daughter’s life. &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pace Vineyard is lost. So lost, in fact, that he’s not sure he wants to be found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a beautiful woman’s face is splashed across social media, and Pace finds a spark in his soul for the first time since a bomb went off beside him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s already missing two legs. What’s one more kidney? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what he tells himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he doesn’t expect is to give his heart to the woman, too. Or for the woman to run away with it and force him to follow. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Defeated. Coward. Gutless. Weak. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perceptions define the man that I have become on the inside. &lt;br /&gt;The world may not see me this way, but this is who I am. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sullied. Contaminated. Worthless. Masked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The way I perceive myself affects every aspect of my life. &lt;br /&gt;The world may see a perfectly clean person, but on the inside, I am nothing but dirty and scarred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The world sees us one way. &lt;br /&gt;We see ourselves another. &lt;br /&gt;Perceptions are what we’ve given ourselves. &lt;br /&gt;Perceptions of what we think we deserve. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*INCLUDES THE SHORT STORY: SAVIOR</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Turns out the good girl doesn't always save the bad boy. &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Magnolia had it all, the boyfriend, the happy life, security in her surroundings. But when a split-second decision alters everything she's ever known she finds herself on the run determined to avenge her boyfriend by any means necessary. Day after day she puts one foot in front of the other. Hollow. Lifeless. Haunted. Loving him was like basking in the sun on a summer day. Living without him is like slowly burning to death. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torture.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;From cliché to risqué to mind-blowing. The events of Mag's story led her to one thing...her objective.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My arrangement with Clara had been simple.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My name is Sawyer Crown, I own Bloodlines Tattoo Parlor, despise drama, and have a penchant for broken women.It's a habit I intend to kick.My arrangement with Clara had been simple. We slept together if and when we wanted too. We were always best friends first. We raised Allie together with love. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Four years into it did people assume we were married- yes. Did people assume I was Allie's father- sure. Did I love every second of those assumptions- most definitely. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then my world exploded. Clara went for the gold. She carved out the happiness she needed, wanted.Now it's my turn. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything seemed to be going great until an epic one night stand changed my world.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16066588.A_Song_for_Julia" title="A Song for Julia" rel="nofollow"&gt;A Song for Julia&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have something to rebel against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crank Wilson left his South Boston home at sixteen to start a punk band and burn out his rage at the world. Six years later, he's still at odds with his father, a Boston cop, and doesn't ever speak to his mother. The only relationship that really matters is with his younger brother, but watching out for Sean can be a full-time job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing Crank wants in life is to be left the hell alone to write his music and drive his band to success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia Thompson left a secret behind in Beijing that exploded into scandal in Washington, DC, threatening her father's career and dominating her family's life. Now, in her senior year at Harvard, she's haunted by a voice from her past and refuses to ever lose control of her emotions again, especially when it comes to a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Julia and Crank meet at an anti-war protest in Washington in the fall of 2002, the connection between them is so powerful it threatens to tear everything apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15998521.Just_Remember_to_Breathe" title="Just Remember to Breathe" rel="nofollow"&gt;Just Remember to Breathe&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Thompson's life is following the script. A pre-law student at Columbia University, she's focused on her grades, her life and her future. The last thing she needs is to reconnect with the boy who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan Paris comes home from Afghanistan severely injured and knows that the one thing he cannot do is drag Alex into the mess he's made of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dylan and Alex are assigned to the same work study program and are forced to work side by side, they have to make new ground rules to keep from killing each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, they keep breaking the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first rule is to never, ever talk about how they fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17789913.The_Last_Hour" title="The Last Hour" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Last Hour&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-seven year old Carrie Thompson-Sherman has the life she always wanted: her PhD, a prestigious fellowship, and an amazing husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her charmed life begins to unravel as a jealous colleague puts her fellowship in jeopardy and a hideous secret Ray carried home from Afghanistan comes to light. Hanging on by a single thread, a disastrous accident puts both her husband and her sister's lives at risk. Heartbroken, Carrie will be faced with the most devastating choice of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A choice that will change everything.</description>

  <description>Piper Mackenzie first sees him shirtless, standing in front of the military plane she was about to board, with one rather large wrench in his hand. The fact that he has the plane—the one that she’s about to be flying on for hours—in pieces only minutes before she’s set to take off on it doesn’t faze her. At least not until a flippant joke about dying in mid-air leaves his lips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second time she sees him, he’s helping her from the wreckage of her car. The wreckage that he helped cause. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The third, he’s laying across from her in the same bed, and there’s no denying what happened the night before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fourth, well that time would be the first of many. Being Mrs. Jonah Crew has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jonah Crew saw her for the first time as she stared at him in awe. It was snowing, the temp was in the negative degrees, and he couldn’t think about anything but her and the look of horror on her face when he tells a badly-timed joke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second time he sees her, his heart skips a beat, but not for the reason that one might think. Mainly, it’s due in part to the fact that his truck smashed into her car so hard that his chest hits the steering wheel and his heart decides to stop working right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The third time, he’s fairly positive that he’s died and gone to heaven. At least, that’s what waking up next to a beautiful woman like her signifies, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The fourth? Well, he’s not quite sure how he got there, but he’s already said ‘I do’ so what’s a guy to do? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Willow Thompson walked into my life like a fairy tale. Prettier than any masterpiece, and years before I was ready. She stole my heart the moment our eyes met, and I've never felt more complete. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toby Matthews thinks he loved me first. I'm sure you've heard the story, he'll tell any sap who will listen. Love at first sight. My sweet boy. But that's not my truth. His... sure, but our love story started before our eyes ever met. Come, let me tell you how it really went down.....</description>

  <description>Darci's flushing pink, &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Willow's feeling blue. &lt;br /&gt;Frankie's a little, ah, frustrated, &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Archer's not amused. &lt;br /&gt;Aubrey's kissing it better, &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Toby's breaking through. &lt;br /&gt;Bennett's feeling emotional, &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Archer's less than enthused. &lt;br /&gt;Luca's second-guessing, &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Jake's irresolute. &lt;br /&gt;Annabelle's a sobbing mess, &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;Archer's now confused. &lt;br /&gt;The whole gang is together,&lt;br /&gt;it's Valentine's Day &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;what's more romantic than our favorite&lt;br /&gt;Maples, Strawberries &amp;amp; Fairy Tales?!</description>

  <description>Luca St. Kelly was a perfectly timed distraction. &lt;br /&gt;A temptation that quickly morphed into addiction. &lt;br /&gt;He’s closed off, and volatile. A self-proclaimed jerk... yet, I can’t seem to get enough. &lt;br /&gt;Hey... heartbreak... ‘sup old friend.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francesca Walker is certifiable. &lt;br /&gt;That’s one thing I’m sure of. That, and certain parts of my body really seem to like her.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah... I know that too.&lt;br /&gt;She strutted into my life, a complication I didn’t need but definitely wanted. &lt;br /&gt;I convinced myself I could handle her, problem is that measly organ beating in my chest, yeah, I didn’t quite factor him into the equation. &lt;br /&gt;Hey... heartbreak... f*ck you!!</description>

  <description>Bennett James was out of my league. Beautiful. Charismatic. Addictive. He was the type of man that women fawn over, that could have anyone his heart (or his insatiable libido) desired. He was never supposed to notice me and he sure as hell was never meant to pursue me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darci Walker is an enigma. Guarded but wild, if she lets you close enough, and therein lies my problem. My sweet, untamed addiction liked to play timid. That was her first lapse in judgment. Turned me to fire, kick-started a game of cat and mouse I couldn’t get enough of. Me, the Big Bad Wolf. Darci, my sinfully, sexy Riding Hood.</description>

  <description>Jake Dean crushed any certainties I thought I had in life. He took my perfectly sculpted existence and tipped it upside down. I let him. I actually pushed him to do it, if I’m being honest, which isn’t something I overly pride myself on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey King was never supposed to be mine. I guess even now, she’s not. Not really. She made me question my character, my morals. But I go back. Every. Single. Time. I’m addicted to her.</description>

  <description>War is violent, aggressive, destructive. &lt;br /&gt;The same could be said about my mind in the aftermath. &lt;br /&gt;Love is affection, tenderness, and warmth. &lt;br /&gt;Words that no longer reside within me. &lt;br /&gt;She promised to love me forever. &lt;br /&gt;I promised her the same. &lt;br /&gt;But forever no longer exists, it died alongside any goodness in my soul a long time ago. &lt;br /&gt;I’m broken, I’m empty and she’s nothing but a painful reminder of what I’ve lost. &lt;br /&gt;She promised to love me forever and she failed.</description>

  <description>The reclusive Ian barely participates in life, only doing so when his powers demand that he use them or pay the consequences. It seems that there’s not a single person on this planet who doesn’t want something from him, but the pain and suffering of others is nearly unbearable at times, leaving him no choice but to act. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is until Wink unwittingly walks into his life, completely unaware that she’s stepped straight into the dragon’s den. &lt;br /&gt;Wink is just trying to get home after a long day of work. Her plans for the evening do not include stumbling upon a man with blood on his hands hovering over a dead woman in her hallway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are three things that someone in Wink’s position should’ve done in that instance. &lt;br /&gt;1. Slowly back away from the hot, bearded killer and run the other way. &lt;br /&gt;2. Call the cops. &lt;br /&gt;3. Not come back until the scene was safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Instead, she stops, takes a picture—drawing the man’s attention to her—and then takes off at the speed of a fat, blind and possibly intoxicated penguin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ian tries to let her go, but the moment that she runs, every single one of his predatory instincts surge to the surface and the hunt is on. Ian always catches his prey, this time is no different. What is different is that, for the first time in his life, he is consumed with the need to keep his catch.</description>

  <description>Roxanne has spent her entire life trapped inside of her own head. Never completely alone, always struggling to be set free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the Devils knock on her neighbors door, her inability to avoid risky impulses takes control and she tags along for the wild ride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Houston is a newly patched member of the Notorious Devils MC. He is instantly attracted to the wild firefly and cannot deny the fun that she offers on their trip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One night is all that he needs. He sees her, more of her than he should. He tries to steer clear, unsure if he is prepared to take on all of this woman. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two suffering spirits that are linked together in a way that neither can deny. Hurt. Lost. Betrayed. Lonely. When two like souls crash into one another, they will either combust or meld together as one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*INCLUDES SHORT STORY - SHAKEN WITH DESIRE: NOTORIOUS DEVILS</description>

  <description>High-risk. Something that Madison had been avoiding for the last five years. After the loss of her fiancé years ago she had vowed that dating would never enter her life again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being single was safe. No danger. Zero. She had her shop and her dad's firefighting buddies to take care of to occupy her time. It was enough...most days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he barged in bringing danger with him in more ways than one. Green eyes with a body that fueled fantasies. And oh — that dirty mouth. He would burn her if she let him. All she had to do was resist his looks and the flames he was igniting. Simple, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High-risk. Something Owen Fleming had always loved. Bounty Hunter by trade, occasional bodyguard. As long as he kept bad things from happening to good people he was in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being single was a choice. He didn't have time for love with his occupation. The job wore on him more days than not, and he craved a change. It was enough...for now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he met her. It only took one powerful moment. She ignited something in him and made him burn. And now he was on the hunt to possess her while protecting her from the danger he'd brought into her life. She would be his one way or another. Simple, right?</description>

  <description>I’m kind of a lady, but definitely more of a weirdo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hearing the woman at the table behind him say that to her friend should’ve turned Logan Gibbs off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn’t. In all honesty, it only makes him listen harder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s had enough weird in his life to last a lifetime. The last thing his complicated life needs is a woman in it who has no clue what color you get when you mix yellow and blue together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, her obvious blonde moments aren’t enough to deter him. Nor is her lack of finger-painting skills. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m a cop, not a miracle worker. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hearing the man in the group behind her say that should’ve had Katy Roberts running away as fast as her feet would carry her. Katy’s father’s a cop, and it’s hard enough to live her life with Daddy trying to dictate her every move. She needs another cop in her life like she needs yet another thing to go wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To add onto that, she can’t find a job, has no love life to speak of, and has to be the oldest known virgin in Kilgore, Texas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, when she sees his painting—a painting that resembles a piece of the male anatomy more than the lighthouse they were supposed to be painting—she knows that she has to give him a chance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The very last thing the two of them expect is for her father and his boss to force them to marry after an eensy-weensy accident. An accident that, surprisingly, both of them want. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>With a famous NHL player for a stepbrother, Violet Hall is well acquainted with the playboy reputation of many a hockey star. So of course she isn't interested in legendary team captain Alex Waters or his pretty, beat-up face and rock-hard six-pack abs. But when Alex inadvertently obliterates Violet's misapprehension regarding the inferior intellect of hockey players, he becomes much more than just a hot body with the face to match. Suffering from a complete lapse in judgment, Violet discovers just how good Alex is with the hockey stick in his pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet believes her night of orgasmic magic with Alex is just that: one night. But Alex starts to call. And text. And email and send extravagant - and quirky - gifts. Suddenly he's too difficult to ignore and nearly impossible not to like. The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn't want to be part of the game.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All defenses are down in the fifth Ace Security novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Stoker.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Butler isn’t flattered. She’s angry and unnerved. She’s been getting intimate gifts from a man she barely knows. Nothing threatening yet, but there’s just a weird vibe she can’t ignore. Her recourse is Ace Security. Their solution: self-defense lessons at Rock Hard Gym with a personal, hands-on instructor. One look at the bearded, tattooed, green-eyed alpha is enough to take Sarah’s breath away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole Johnson is definitely the man for the job. He’s eager to train her. Eager to get closer. And when it comes to Sarah’s instincts, Cole knows she’s not imagining things. He’s also not imagining the intense attraction between them—and his desire to protect her is growing. But so are Sarah’s fears, the worst of which come true when she disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlisting the help of Ace Security, Cole will stop at nothing to find the love of his life…before she vanishes forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kristen Ashley comes a decadent sensual world where gorgeous alpha males are committed to fulfilling a woman's every desire…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE DEEP END&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivier isn’t sure what he’s gotten himself into when he joins the Honey Club, only that a dark part of him hungers for the lifestyle offered by this exclusive club. Here, no boundary will be left untested…and one's deepest fantasies will become an exquisite reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Amélie invites Olivier to surrender, she gives the alpha submissive what he craves. Soon they both find themselves falling harder than they ever anticipated—but as their connection deepens, the truth about Olivier’s past could destroy everything…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE FARTHEST EDGE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Branch doesn’t exist. Living off the grid, he’s looking for a way to forget his past and the guilt that plagues him. But no woman has ever been able to bring him to the edge he craves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a traumatic experience of her own, Evangeline stepped away from the decadent world of the Honey Club. But when she gets Branch’s offer—to play without boundaries or commitments—it’s too tempting for her to refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their passion ignites, Evangeline and Branch push each other to their farthest limit, fulfilling their darkest desires while falling harder and deeper than they ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE GREATEST RISK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman unable to connect, struggling to hide another part of her. A man burning to learn her truth, and make her whole. Through explosive passion and deep exploration, they are about to take the greatest risk of all. But will they be able to take that leap, and come out on the other side together?</description>

  <description>Thea Landry has always known her place in modern-day society. It’s somewhere just above the trash can her mother dumped her in as a newborn but below the class where much comes easy. With her tattered shoes and bargain-bin clothes, her life has never been full of glamour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a rich and charismatic man takes interest, she doesn’t fool herself into thinking their encounter is anything more than a one-night stand. Months later, she’s kicking herself for not getting his phone number. Or his last name. She’s given up hope of seeing him ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until one day, years later, Logan Kendrick waltzes into her life once more and turns everything she’s built upside down. This time around, she won’t make the same mistake. She’s going to fight to keep him in her life—not for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for their daughter.</description>

  <description>Her past. His secrets. They have more in common than she knows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maisy is happily content with the life she’s built for herself and her young son in small-town Prescott, Montana. Her child is thriving, her business is growing, and her family is as close as they’ve ever been. But when a handsome stranger walks into the lobby of her motel, her simple life is swept up in a wave of affection for his gentle heart. None of those feelings can be trusted, though. She made that mistake before with another man. The man she murdered. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hunter was a different man when he first saw Maisy Holt from afar. He took one look at her and ran in the opposite direction. But years later, he’s back in Montana and unable to keep his distance. He shouldn’t have tried to find her but he never was good at rejecting temptation. The promise of the good she could bring into his life is too hard to resist. Maybe if he can disguise the lies and hide the deceit, he can keep her from learning the truth. Because his only chance at a future with her is by burying his past.</description>

  <description>Life on his ranch could be their future. If they can overcome their past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Felicity’s life story reads like the script to a bad soap opera. Girl’s high-school boyfriend becomes a drug addict. Girl falls for boyfriend’s best friend. Girl leaves them both behind only to return home years later for murdered ex-boyfriend’s funeral. Now she’s back home in Montana, ready to start fresh. She’s got a long list of amends to make and relationships to rebuild, including one with the man who has owned her heart for sixteen years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silas doesn’t need much. He’s got a great horse, close friends and the Lucky Heart ranch, but something has always been missing. He’s not an idiot. He knows the missing piece is Felicity. And now that she’s returned to Prescott, he’s got a second chance to win her heart. This time, the only thing standing in his way is history. Drudging up the past is going to be about as painful as playing tug of war with barbed wire. But if they can heal old wounds, he’ll get the girl he should have had all along.</description>

  <description>One old farmhouse brought them together. It could also tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi has just uprooted her whole world to start a new life. The unexpected gift of a farmhouse in small-town Montana is just what she and her daughter need to escape big-city loneliness. The last thing she needs is attitude from the town’s sheriff, the most perfectly attractive and ruggedly handsome man she’s ever laid eyes on—and a complete jerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jess knows all about women like Gigi. Beautiful. Sexy. Scheming. She’s stolen his sanctuary, the farmhouse that should have been his. But along with a face full of freckles, she’s got a sharp wit and a backbone of steel—something he doesn’t discover until after making a complete fool of himself. If he can earn back her trust and win her heart, he might just find the home he’s always needed.</description>

  <description>You murder a man, and all of a sudden people are scared of you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Slate Solis went from being a guy that people went to in times of need to an ex-con that people crossed the street to avoid being too close to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows he’s done wrong, but out of all of his sins, only one really bothers him—coveting thy neighbor’s wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harleigh Belle—the cute little lady that never gives him a second glance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After seeing her for the first time while he was in prison, she’s stayed on his mind for three long years. Each time she comes in to visit with her friend on family day, he can’t help but stare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the day comes that he’s set free, and he’s almost disappointed that he’ll never see her again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except fate has different plans. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t been back in his house for more than three hours when he sees her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harleigh Belle in all her glory…oh, and her husband that is everything Slate isn’t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He tells himself that her being fifty feet away from him, all day every day, is a complete coincidence. One that he shouldn’t take advantage of. The more time passes, the harder it gets to stay away. Until one day, and one very ill-timed thunderstorm, ruin everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who knew that baby-making-weather was a real thing? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks fly between a die-hard romantic and a sexy cynic in this fresh, funny romance from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adriana Locke.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That cream-filled, caramel-topped doughnut should have been hers. Still, Haley Raynor can’t deny that the pastry thief with the dreamy blue eyes looks even more delicious. But moving in on a handsome devil like Trevor Kelly is bad news for a die-hard romantic like Haley. Trevor doesn’t believe in love. She does. Giving in to a fling and Trevor’s irresistible charms can’t end well. Can it? What can it hurt to give it a shot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls always fall for Trevor, and in the end, he always ends up looking like a bad-boy cad. Still, spending some time with Haley and her smart-talking, kissable mouth sounds pretty perfect. Besides, he’s only going to be in Dogwood Lane for one week. How much trouble could they possibly get into?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only answer? A “no falling in love” contract. All Trevor and Haley have to do is follow the rules and resist the attraction sizzling between them…before their hearts get completely tangled up in temptation.</description>

  <description>USA Today Bestselling author Adriana Locke brings laughter and love in this friends-to-lovers, small town romance.&lt;br /&gt;Love is crazy. &lt;br /&gt;Peck Ward, the sweet, small-town mechanic, isn’t sure it’s for everyone. Least of all him. His life is chaotic enough without adding the pressure of a relationship. Besides, unrequited love is a real thing and he’s kind of over it. &lt;br /&gt;This works out perfectly until a certain someone throws a wrench—pun intended—into his plans. As they go from adversaries to friends to possibly something more, things get complicated. After all, they know how this story ends. It’s not with them together. &lt;br /&gt;His easy grin is enough to win her over. Her unabashed personality does him in. But are they ready to accept the fact that sometimes you don’t find love where you’re looking for it? Sometimes you find it in the most unexpected, craziest places.</description>

  <description>Cross Jacobs was a screw-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knew it, especially him, and the point was hammered home when Kallie Welch drove herself right out of his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But, she’s back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing Cross wasn’t on Kallie’s to-do list. She didn’t think she could avoid him forever but trying never hurt anyone. One minute she’s standing by herself and the next she’s accosted by a rich, velvety scent that could only belong to one man: Cross. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At face value, he’s divine. All rugged and confident with a smile that melts her right where she’s standing. It doesn’t take long to find him to be charming, witty, and the owner of a few legitimate businesses. Not at all like the mischievous boy she left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He laughs and her heart flutters. With a touch of his hand, she’s dizzy. She’s fairly certain she’s going to die when he pulls her into an embrace and touches his lips to her forehead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels right. It feels so right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is it? Can it be? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Releases on May 25, 2018</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Adriana Locke comes a witty romance about first love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being burned by her dream job in New York City, sports journalist Neely Kimber suddenly finds herself jobless and paying a long-overdue visit to her hometown in Tennessee. Her plan? Relax, reset, and head back up the corporate ladder. There’s just one unexpected step. Neely’s back in Dogwood Lane for barely a day when she sees the man she ran from nine years ago: the bad boy next door who was her first kiss, her first love, and her first heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devoted single dad Dane Madden knows he hurt Neely in the worst way. He’s got a lot to make up for. And as passionate as their reconnection is, it’s a lot to hope for. Having her back in his arms feels so right. But falling in love all over again with a woman who wants to live a world away is bound to go so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s it going to take for Neely to give him—and Dogwood Lane—just one more chance?</description>

  <description>Lorenzo De Luca’s troubled past has left him a shell of a man. The blood that runs through his veins feels toxic. Determined to not let history repeat itself, Lorenzo vows to protect others from the violence that lives inside him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Jolie Moore literally stumbles into his arms and his life, Lorenzo finds himself captivated by her larger-than-life personality. Jolie’s pull is strong, making it difficult for him to keep his promise. It’s hard to resist the urge to connect with the girl who wears her heart on her sleeve, but Lorenzo knows he needs to lock his heart away to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because his legacy has the power to destroy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jolie’s never been one to back down from a challenge, and her resolve to help him heal is strong. Lorenzo is wary, already content having found peace in solitude. But it isn’t long before Jolie shows him that he’s shielded others from a man who only has the capacity to love.</description>

  <description>Zara Brooks needs a fresh start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Consumed with insecurity and damaged by betrayal, Zara leaves her old life and all the heartache it holds behind her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or so she thinks… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zara is deeply wounded and every choice she makes in her new hometown is evidence of that pain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pierce Reynolds has lived in Windsor all his life and loves the community. When multiple businesses in town are set ablaze faster than the police department can investigate, Pierce volunteers to be the lead investigator on the case. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pierce’s investigation lands him at Zara’s front door and he’s immediately taken with her. While Zara can’t deny that he’s an attractive and well-respected man, she refuses to get involved. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once tragedy strikes, leaving Zara vulnerable, Pierce learns there’s a lot of hurt hiding beneath her tough exterior and handles her with care. Shocked by the depth of Pierce’s kindness, Zara finds her heart yearns for more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Zara treads cautiously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because she knows how easy it is to get burned.</description>

  <description>Elizabeth 'Elle' Blackman never expected the balance of her carefree life to be disrupted. Discovering that someone has been in her apartment just days before she is set to go on tour, Elle makes the only sensible choice there is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right to the front door of Cunningham Security, where the owner is not only the man that is capable of keeping her safe, but also the guy she's been attracted to for months.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The downside? He refuses to pursue a relationship with her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Elle arrives at the doorstep of his firm, terrified for her safety and asking for help, Levi Cunningham's protective instincts kick in. Less than twenty-four hours into it, Levi can't fight the attraction he's had toward Elle for the last few months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Levi and his team work to solve Elle's case, the relationship between them quickly goes from strictly business to deeply personal. Will Elle's stalker succeed in destroying the beloved singer's career and newfound romance? Or will her stalker's efforts to bring her down only propel Elle to success in both her professional and personal life?</description>

  <description>When starry-eyed dancer, Monroe Archer, meets professional snowboarder Xander Stone, she believes she's found the man of her dreams. Searching for her fairytale romance since she was a little girl, Monroe uproots her life and goes after what she wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stone is a grief-stricken man. At a young age, he learned that forever doesn't exist. Ever since, he's been a tortured soul, living his life devoid of any new personal attachments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not long after Monroe moves to town, she's shocked to discover that despite their attraction, Stone is unwilling to offer anything more than just friendship. Just as Monroe tries to move on, Stone realizes his attraction to her isn't something he can so easily deny. Powerless to resist her any longer, Stone starts something with Monroe knowing he is incapable of giving her forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With her sweet and charming disposition, Monroe sets out to heal the wounds left on the heart of the man she loves. But it isn't long before Monroe realizes that sometimes those that love you most are the ones that hurt you the worst.</description>

  <description>Charley Meadows has lost nearly everything she loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coming face-to-face with adversity more times than she cares to admit, she moves from the place she's always called home. Determined to move past the events that shattered her world, Charley abandons her true calling in life and replaces it with exhausting days of mindless, unfulfilling work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she never expected to have her newfound peace disrupted by Wes Blackman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wes is a hometown hero. Snowboarder extraordinaire turned business owner, Wes' focus is on making Blackman Boards the industry leader in snowboard production. Sadly, running a successful business has prevented him from keeping up with his passion for riding. But with his company set to launch a new series of boards, Wes finds himself back on the mountain. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he hadn't expected to find was a mysterious girl with a battered heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charley is afraid to take a risk, knowing where it could lead. However, Wes is irresistibly charming. If she opens her heart to vulnerability, she's worried tragedy may strike again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wes wants the opportunity to prove that no matter what happens, he'll always be there to pick up the pieces.</description>

  <description>Nikki Drake was just a little girl when she experienced her first heartbreak. Many years and several betrayals later, she's learned that life is what you make of it. While her past hasn't stopped her from working hard and becoming a confident and successful woman, it has affected one small part of her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nikki refuses to give her heart to anyone ever again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Townsend is a man most women dream about. Underneath his tall, handsome exterior, he's charming, compassionate, sensitive, and loyal. A dedicated snowboarder, Luke knows what it means to work hard for what he wants. And what Luke wants is Nikki. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke tells Nikki he's fallen in love with her. Having resolved to live a life without romantic love, Nikki rejects him. Luke walks away, vowing to find a way to win her heart. When she decides to take a chance on Luke, he is patient and understanding while she struggles to find the courage to trust he won't hurt her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But once Nikki finally hands her heart over to him, Luke shatters her world with the truth.</description>

Unfortunately, Emme's plans to remain unattached fall apart the moment Zane Cunningham sets his sights on her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A professional snowboarder at the top of his game, Zane does not need a distraction. But when Emme walks into his life, he can't fight the pull he feels toward her and will take her any way he can get her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Emme struggles to resist Zane's persistent efforts to turn their friendship into something more. Having lived a charmed life, Zane is devastated when he learns the truth about the tragic incident in her past. Realizing the ugliness in her life hasn't deterred Zane, Emme finally gives into the attraction between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as Zane brings light and laughter into Emme's life, her trouble finally catches up to her and threatens her newfound happiness. Zane promises he'll keep her safe, no matter the cost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because he knows that if he can't, Emme may be lost in darkness forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Aurora Rose Reynolds comes a flirty romantic comedy of big love and second chances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Williams wanted forever. She got six years of empty promises, a divorce, and a well-deserved settlement that’s paid her way to Manhattan. She has a new home under renovation, a new job, and a do-over as a happy “single in the city”—until she meets an architect with designs on more than her beams. He’s also a devoted single dad, a great cook, and has dark lashes to die for. Too good to be true. Now all Courtney can do is whisper, &lt;i&gt;Oh no, not again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divorced Lucas Fremont isn’t looking to get swept away. But how can he &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; with a woman this sweet and sexy? She’s making his broken heart beat fast. His sister-in-law, Fawn, says go for it. But as cautious as Courtney is, Lucas has to do more than that. He has to fight for it. Now all he can do is think, &lt;i&gt;Don’t let this one get away&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Courtney comes with a secret. And Lucas comes with a bitter ex. If love is to stand a chance, they’re going to have to &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; a chance.</description>

  <description>Poor judgment: knowing better yet doing it anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flint Stone is a professional in every way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s a police officer with the K-9 unit and works at Gun Barrel High as the school resource officer. In his spare time, he’s working his heart out to create a successful gym from the ground up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He’s loved by every single person he ever encounters—student, faculty, and employees—Everyone but Camryn Elvis Presley. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing they have in common is their mothers’ poor excuses for names. &lt;br /&gt;Period. The end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So why is it every time she crosses his path that he has the urge to mess up her perfectly curled hair? Or unbutton a few of her prim and proper buttons? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows he should stay away, yet like the high schoolers he’s around every day, he has no choice but to react first and think about the consequences later. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Side note—bad decisions are made, leading to lapses in judgment that threaten both of their jobs. Yet when the time comes, neither one can seem to find the wherewithal to care. Why? Because being bad feels so good.</description>

  <description>Good vs Bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Light vs Dark. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Right vs Wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are always two sides to every coin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Josiah ‘Liner’ Paldecki knew the moment he laid eyes on her that there was something different about her. Something special. Something so unique that it practically poleaxed him the moment that their eyes met. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except, the next time he saw her, it was like she was a different woman altogether. There was a blankness to her eyes that concerned him. An air of menace about her that honestly scared him to death. He’s more than man enough to admit it. &lt;br /&gt;At first, Liner thinks it’s because she’s bi-polar, or possibly psychopathic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then he realizes the truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That there isn’t a single person that exhibits such different personalities, but two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two identical twin sisters, both completely different, yet exactly the same. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One with a soul, and one without. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One that has his heart, and one that only wants to destroy it.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm not even really sure where to begin with this review except to say I thoroughly enjoyed this story. More so than I expected, which is saying a lot as I am never disappointed going into one of LLV's books.  I think what I loved the most is how different it was from all her other books, of whic...]]>

      <![CDATA[For the first time in years, I went into a beloved author's book blind. Even though this was a new series, one of the main things I love about LLV's books and series is they all tie together somehow. That was not the case with Hissy Fit.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;About the Cocktales Anthology:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cocktales&lt;/i&gt; is a limited-release anthology (available *only* from May 26 – August 26, 2018) of original, never before published material, some of which is raw and unedited. Each story was specifically written for this anthology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of the Cocktales Anthology is to raise funds to fight against obstruction of creative expression.

  <description>Ghosts are real. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, technically speaking, maybe not. But the ones that haunt a man’s soul? Those are very real. So real, in fact, that there are times when Castiel would rather silence them forever in the worst way possible than to go on living with them haunting his every step. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it took was one single second in time for his attention to drift, and everything changed. &lt;br /&gt;Life as he once knew it, is over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now he’s struggling to make sense of the pieces that are left, and he’s fairly sure at least half of them are missing. &lt;br /&gt;He’s living for three things now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His club—the Bear Bottom Guardians. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His work as a police officer for Bear Bottom Police Department. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the occasional glimpse of a girl that makes his spirit feel free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite the ghosts that haunt him, he’s not willing to present them with another target. Which is why he has to stay away from her. He can’t touch her. He can’t talk to her. He can’t get anywhere near her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not and live with himself afterward. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, Turner doesn’t care what Castiel wants. She also has a solution for his ghosts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You may call her Ms. Ghostbuster. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Kristen Ashley comes a new story in her Dream Man series… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Charlotte “Lottie” McAlister is in the zone. She’s ready to take on the next chapter of her life, and since she doesn’t have a man, she’ll do what she’s done all along. She’ll take care of business on her own. Even if that business means starting a family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Lottie has a stalker. The really bad kind. The kind that means she needs a bodyguard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter Mo Morrison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enormous. Scary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mo doesn’t say much, and Lottie’s used to getting attention. And she wants Mo’s attention. Badly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Mo has a strict rule. If he’s guarding your body, that’s all he’s doing with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the longer Mo has to keep Lottie safe, the faster he falls for the beautiful blonde who has it so together, she might even be able to tackle the demons he’s got in his head that just won’t die. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But in the end, Lottie and Mo don’t only have to find some way to keep hands off until the threat is over, they have to negotiate the overprotective Hot Bunch, Lottie’s crazy stepdad, Tex, Mo’s crew of frat-boy commandos, not to mention his nutty sisters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All before Lottie finally gets her Dream Man. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Mo can lay claim to his Dream Girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</description>

  <description>Cuffing season was supposed to be about finding a hook-up to keep her warm during the cold Kentucky winter nights. T.A. wasn’t looking for Mr. Right; she just wanted Mr. Available. &lt;br /&gt;That was before she met Dalton Andrews. The widower was nursing a broken heart, and the only thing he wanted was a woman to take his grown kids’ minds off worrying about him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a trade-off—he would keep her warm and toasty during the nights, and she would put up a smokescreen in front of his kids during the days. It was a win-win situation. &lt;br /&gt;That was until the famous actor decided he wanted out of the deal and Mr. Available was a no-show during the biggest snowstorm of the year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Poor schmuck didn’t realize that all the drama he had experienced in Tinseltown was nothing compared to dealing with this bitch.</description>

  <description>When Rome Pierce moved to Bear Bottom, Texas, it was his intention to lay low. To not be seen. To find a way to heal his body and soul—as well as his son’s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nobody would know by looking at him that he used to play professional football. Not with the Bear Bottom MC cut covering his back, and definitely not with his friendly smile completely obliterated. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No longer is there charm in each smooth word that comes out of his mouth. What’s left is an angry, bitter, scared man that’s terrified one day he’s going to wake up and his entire world is going to be gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nobody knows what drove him to leave the game he loved—nobody but her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s the one person that has helped him make it through the dark days and even darker nights. She’s the bright and shining star in his pitch-black sky. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And he doesn’t even know her name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He should be afraid that she knows things that not anyone—not even his best friend—knows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet, with each encounter, he gives what little bit of his soul remains, and before he knows it only two people on this earth—one dying, and one too afraid to live—make his life worth living. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until one day he has to choose—the love of his life, or the life he brought into this world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two impossible situations. One decision that would change him forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Librarian Note - Reader Caution - This book contains triggers for the following:&lt;br /&gt;*Anyone who has recently experienced the death of their child or a child close to them.&lt;br /&gt;*Anyone whose child or other family member has recently had cancer or some other extreme illness. &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Zee + Annmarie and Tan + Jubilee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forever. No exceptions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They were to have the picture-perfect life together. Everything was all planned out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jubilee was to marry Eitan and Ezekiel was to marry Annmarie. That’s how it was always supposed to be from the moment that they met. Textbook, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eitan and Annmarie die in a freak accident that never should have happened, leaving the two survivors reeling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years later, Jubilee and Zee can’t even be in the same room with each other before things begin to deteriorate. Too many memories. Too much pain. Not enough forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They’re like hellfire and holy water, and neither one of them is willing to admit that they’re wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then one day things change, and all of a sudden, they’re looking at each other like maybe they aren’t each other’s enemies after all. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Everyone expects the fairy tale from me. &lt;br /&gt;Because on the outside, I look like I live in a fantasy. &lt;br /&gt;I'm a hopeless romantic. &lt;br /&gt;I fall in and out of love. &lt;br /&gt;I change careers, zip codes and hair colors on a whim. &lt;br /&gt;I'm a free spirit without a care in the world. &lt;br /&gt;I'm the one that loves everyone and hates no one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I've got a secret... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm not a free spirit. &lt;br /&gt;Not really. &lt;br /&gt;I'm not free at all. &lt;br /&gt;My life is only designed to look chaotically peaceful. &lt;br /&gt;I'm only designed to look like that. &lt;br /&gt;Peace is lost to me. &lt;br /&gt;Because I'm trying to escape something. &lt;br /&gt;Trying to escape him. &lt;br /&gt;My life isn't a fairy tale. &lt;br /&gt;It's time the world saw that.</description>

  <description>Through good times, bad times and times of war, Cole “Rush” Allen grew up in the Chaos Motorcycle Club. Along this journey, he watched his father, Tack, and his MC brothers fight, sweat, bleed and die to steer the Club to legitimacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they’ve got one more battle on their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A battle they have to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Rush meets the woman who put herself right in the thick of it, he knows he has to stop at nothing to get her out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebel Stapleton has lost someone she loves to murder and she’s the kind of woman who’s going to do something about it. She puts her career on the line, and her life, to bring the man who did it to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, she does this until Rush Allen intervenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaos is at war and they’re about to face the ultimate showdown. They’ll have to negotiate skeletons from the past, enemies becoming allies, and loved ones in the line of fire on their ride to be…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free.</description>

  <description>Dubbed the “American Princess” after her rescue from months in the hands of ISIS, soldier and firefighter Penelope Turner has struggled silently since her return to Texas. The media, the danger of her job, the pressure of knowing lives are in her hands…all of it and more has combined to slowly fill Penelope with seething guilt and doubt. Missing memories from her moment of capture cause even more angst. Is she responsible for the deaths of her Army patrol unit? And without knowing what happened, how can she be trusted by her fellow firefighters—or trust them in return?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse…how can she ever be worthy of the man who believes in her most? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took seeing Penelope in the hands of terrorists—in viral videos seen around the world—for Tucker “Moose” Jacobs to realize just how much he loved his fellow firefighter. He died waiting for her rescue, then died all over again when Penelope abruptly left Texas, trying to outrun her past. Now that she’s returned, the kid gloves are off. Moose is a patient man, but even he has his limits. He loves Penelope, and he knows it’s past time for her to face her fears, and remember she has an entire tribe of friends who not only have her back, but need Pen to have theirs, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, Penelope will have to trust Moose, her friends, and most of all herself, if she’s going to make peace with her past…and have any kind of future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Shelter for Penelope is the 15th and final book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings. Penelope’s story started in Protecting the Future, and over the years, she’s struggled with her inner demons. Read on to see her finally get her HEA.</description>

  <description>Benson Bayou Beauregard is the president of the Bear Bottom Guardians MC, and the grandson of the Sergeant at Arms for the Dixie Wardens MC. He’s a mountain of a man and the warden of a prison, and there’s only one thing that can scare him—being told that he’s the father of a three-year-old little girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A three-year-old little girl that has no clue who he is. Hell, he only finds out about the little cherub when a woman from child protective services comes by and rocks his world before leaving the girl in his shocked arms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every single thing he thinks he knows goes up in a cloud of smoke. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, the woman that he’s been trying to convince to give him a chance takes one look at the little girl and tells him that he’s just not in the right place to handle both of them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Bayou was never one to back down from a challenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can handle a three-year-old girl that acts exactly like him, and he can more than take on the fiery red-head that sets flame to his blood while he’s at it.</description>

  <description>January 2019&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carson is a mother who has never carried a child. She’s raised Axe as her own son. He is her responsibility, but she wouldn't want her life any other way, even if it’s not exactly what she had planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A waitress in a small town diner. A single mother. She hides in plain sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keys is a mystery to his Canadian brothers. A recent transfer from the Notorious Devils in North Dakota, and the new tech expert for the club. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His life has been one big party. No responsibilities. No relationships. No commitments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he walks into a small diner in Texas. He recognizes her. She’s the girl from his past, and yet, she’s not--she’s all grown up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hides a secret that once he discovers causes rage to flow through his veins. He cannot simply let her go. He did that once--never again. Especially now that he knows the truth. He plans on keeping her as his own.</description>

  <description>Thirty-two and single, Presley wants to start over. She’s only going through the motions--just breathing, not living. It isn’t the life she’s always imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She should be married, with a little house and a few children, maybe even a labrador to greet her after a long day of teaching third graders. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Treasurer for the Savage Beast MC, Silver lived life hard. At forty-five he’s seen and done it all--twice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A single father in need of someone who could love him, and his boy. He’s given up on ever finding a woman who fit him--fit them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two people breathing. Two people wanting to be loved. One an outlaw. One an innocent. Two people who could not be more opposite, yet when their worlds collide, so does their chemistry. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Protection leads to passion in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Stoker’s dangerously hot Mountain Mercenaries adventure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispatched to the Dominican Republic to rescue a kidnapped child, former Navy SEAL Archer “Arrow” Kane makes a startling discovery: another hostage—Morgan Byrd, a very beautiful and very well-known missing person who disappeared off the streets of Atlanta a year ago. She’s brave, resilient, and unbroken. All Arrow wants to know is why she ended up in a shack in Santo Domingo. All he feels is the desire to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morgan is done being the victim and is determined to find out who hates her so much that they want her gone—but not dead. Until then, she has Arrow, an alpha stranger who’s offering a warm and safe place to hide. But as the passion between them flares, so does the fear that whoever took Morgan will do anything to get her back. For Arrow, protecting this woman with a mysterious enemy is the most dangerous mission of his life. And it’s worth every beat of his heart.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>My mother used to have a saying for everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You can’t be pretty and lucky.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wasn’t pretty or lucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You have to kiss a lot of toads before you find your Prince Charming.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kissed too many of those. Sorry, but Prince Charming isn’t in Hicktown, Kentucky. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The good ones go to Heaven; the bad ones go to Hell.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I’m going to Hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hell is paved with good intentions.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, that one is true. Why? Because ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended to stay away from Calder Riggs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended not to fall in love with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended to find a man who wasn’t a loser or a joker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I’ve never been afraid of Hell, anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s why I’m Crazy Bitch!</description>

  <description>Revenge is a seven-letter word that isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s a word for those who have been wronged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Turner has been waiting five, long years to finally turn revenge into vengeance. Using Rider, the pretty-faced manwhore, is simply the price she is willing to pay to satiate her desire for revenge. Little does she know, she makes herself a target from the one thing Rider has sworn to give his life to protect—The Last Riders.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you wake the soldier, be prepared for the consequences. &lt;br /&gt;Rider is going to teach her a hard lesson: revenge is a double-edged sword … and it always cuts both ways.</description>

  <description>Sofia Kendrick has always cherished her tiara. As the youngest daughter of a wealthy New York family, she’s lived the life of an American princess. But after two scandalous divorces and a breakup smear her name across the society rags, the shine from her crown has dulled. People call her superficial, even gaudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s nothing more than tinsel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate for escape and starving for peace, Sofia heads to Montana for a holiday weekend with her brother. But she doesn’t get the relaxing vacation she planned. Instead, she’s put to work in a bar alongside Dakota Magee—a man who does not want her help. A man who is set on teaching her a few lessons about real life and hard work. But Sofia has a couple of life lessons of her own to teach. Like how to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words: 98,430</description>

  <description>Hoax knows two things very well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One, he’s not relationship material. Two, the nurse that treats him for erectile dysfunction is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, and practically has ‘the marrying type’ stamped on her forehead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does that stop him from wanting her? No. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, he learned a long time ago that Army Delta Force and long-lasting relationships don’t go hand in hand. &lt;br /&gt;But beautiful hazel eyes, curly blonde hair, and the prettiest lips he’s ever seen play havoc with his resolve, making him forget his earlier convictions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one teeny, tiny kiss for every shred of control he has to disappear, along with the problem in his pants. &lt;br /&gt;Soon he finds himself doing things that he knows that he shouldn’t. He doesn’t know that he’s found the woman that’s meant to be his. Nor does he realize that her father is the man he’s idolized from the moment he joined the army at the age of eighteen. Because, maybe if he had, he would’ve tried a little harder to ignore the pull he felt between them instead of making her his the night before he deployed for six months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He also might’ve tried a little harder not to knock her up. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Wade had everything he could ever want in life…then he lost it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, his life—his forever girl—is living in a house he built for her while he’s struggling to move on and find meaning where there isn’t any to be found. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Landry Hill was his girl. His everything. His first kiss. His first and only love. His old lady and wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then one day he does something monumentally stupid, and she walks away knowing she’ll never come back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years, and he’s still just as in love with her now as he was when she left. The only problem is that she’s moved on with her life, found a new man, and has seemingly forgotten him. Then there’s Wade—stuck in the same awful place where she abandoned him. The only thing he has left is his job as a police officer and the Bear Bottom MC. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just when they both think things can’t get any worse, life kicks them both in the teeth, and Landry finds out really quick that the only person she can depend on is the one that let her walk away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With that understanding comes a deal. One that Landry has no hope of ever breaking free from, and one Wade will do everything in his power to make a reality. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But one thing is still certain. The force that split them apart is still out there, and there’s no hope of escaping fate. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Beckett,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re reading this, well, you know the last-letter drill. You made it. I didn’t. Get off the guilt train, because I know if there was any chance you could have saved me, you would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need one thing from you: get out of the army and get to Telluride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My little sister Ella’s raising the twins alone. She’s too independent and won’t accept help easily, but she has lost our grandmother, our parents, and now me. It’s too much for anyone to endure. It’s not fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here’s the kicker: there’s something else you don’t know that’s tearing her family apart. She’s going to need help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I’m gone, that means I can’t be there for Ella. I can’t help them through this. But you can. So I’m begging you, as my best friend, go take care of my sister, my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don’t make her go through it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan</description>

  <description>Souls are interesting things. &lt;br /&gt;Not something you can prove you possess. Not something that can be measured, like a heartbeat. &lt;br /&gt;But something that can be destroyed by the absence of a heartbeat. &lt;br /&gt;No, you cannot prove you possess a soul. &lt;br /&gt;But once that soul dies, there doesn't need to be proof that you don't have one. &lt;br /&gt;Once that blackened pit opens inside you, the world can see it. The world cowers from it. &lt;br /&gt;Gage knew this because his soul was long gone. &lt;br /&gt;He was glad to be rid of it. &lt;br /&gt;He was filled with depraved satisfaction that he could make the world cower from him. &lt;br /&gt;That he could burn the world to the ground and he didn't have anything—like a soul or a conscience—to stop him. &lt;br /&gt;Until her. &lt;br /&gt;The woman who proved to him that she had a soul. &lt;br /&gt;That he might have something left of his. &lt;br /&gt;The woman who tricked the world, blinded it to the truth. Hid expertly what was broken and ruined inside her. &lt;br /&gt;Though he was about to prove that there was nothing more broken than him. No one more broken. &lt;br /&gt;He'd prove that by destroying them both.</description>

  <description>Rhys Rivera is the star short-stop for the Longview Lumberjacks. Many know him, even more love him. He has a pretty face, a quick smile, and an air of danger about him that everyone seems to adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s not known as the bad boy of baseball for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all started with his father, who decided to be a criminal mob boss, then die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for his uncle, Rhys wants absolutely nothing to do with the family business and runs before anyone can figure out which way is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time his uncle, the successor to his father’s criminal empire, thinks to look for him, Rhys has made too big of a name for himself to be taken out quietly, and he wants to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward eight years, and Rhys is living life one breath at a time, just waiting for the other shoe to drop. That shoe coming in the form of a nosy neighbor who has no idea just how hot she is in her mail carrier uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her sweet little body and positive outlook on life make him want to laugh at how naïve she is when it comes to the way of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The harder he tries to stay away, the weaker he seems to get, until one day he decides to put his morals on hold long enough to satisfy his cravings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time is all he needs—or so he tells himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then two pink lines change everything, and suddenly, he doesn’t have just himself to worry about anymore.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Freak. Witch. Ugly. Abomination.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having grown up with a port-wine birthmark on her face and neck, Quinn Dixon’s heard them all. Her own mother couldn’t bear to touch her, let alone strangers. Years of stares and insults from everyone from classmates to foster families have made her understandably reluctant to trust. So when John comes along, of course he couldn’t be interested in more than a brief affair. He’ll get sick of all the gawking and whispers soon enough and leave her…just like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John “Driftwood” Trettle was captivated by Quinn the moment they met. After months of skirting around their attraction, one pivotal evening finds John seizing the reins and refusing to be denied a chance to prove he’s worthy of Quinn’s time, her trust, and her love. To show her he’ll have her back, always, and defend her against anyone cruel or stupid enough to hurt his woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he can’t protect against an unknown threat. Even if it wears a familiar face…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Shelter for Quinn is the 13th book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</description>

  <description>Discovering your ex is a serial-killing religious zealot would put anyone off dating for a good long while. That’s where Hudson “Taco” Vines’s head is at when he meets Koren, a woman who looks a little too much like his ex for comfort. But he can’t deny their attraction, and the more he gets to know her, the more Taco realizes how different Koren is from his ex, in all the best ways. It’s not long before he’s feeling things for her that he’s never felt for anyone, ever. After the drama of his last relationship, maybe this is his reward…a supportive, comfortable life with a woman he’s coming to love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Koren Garner is no fan of drama, and it certainly seems Taco and his friends have all seen more than their share. So you’d think meeting him for the second time at the scene of her own car accident would be enough to warn her away. But Koren can’t resist the sexy firefighter. A little drama might be worth the risk…even when an unknown threat starts targeting Taco’s friends. Someone’s setting fires, and the danger’s escalating with each blaze. Koren and Taco can only pray the culprit is caught before their relationship—and their lives—go up in smoke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Shelter for Koren is the 14th book in the Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</description>

  <description>This book used to be titled "Assisting Aimee" and was a part of the Kindle Worlds program. It has been re-worked and updated, but the basic story has not changed. If you've purchased Assisting Aimee in the past, there is no need to re-purchase. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This book can be read at any point in the series. It's labeled as book 10, but in reality, it could be book 2, or 4, or 8. I just didn't want to re-number the entire series. :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aimee O’Brien has harbored a not-so-little crush on her school’s new first-grade teacher since the beginning of the year. Tall, muscled, with long hair and a beard, and a penchant for wearing silly ties to amuse his students…the man is too gorgeous for words. As the PE teacher, Aimee’s wardrobe consists of casual gym clothing not likely to catch anyone’s eye. So no one is more surprised than her when Tony makes his interest clear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tony Santoro’s time in the military directly influenced his new choice of career—and his choice in women. He’s looking for someone of substance, and Aimee has far more to offer than just her adorably disheveled look. He can’t wait to see what’s hiding under those sweatpants and tees—but he might have missed his chance. The very day he finally works up the nerve to ask Aimee out, is the day unspeakable violence explodes in the school. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trapped in the gym, Aimee and Tony will have to work together to get out with their lives…and the lives of the dozens of students trapped with them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Author Note: In this story, Aimee and Tony deal with a threat that’s all too real in today’s society; the subject matter may be too sensitive for some readers.</description>

  <description>Hiding from her ex is exhausting enough, but for Hope Drayden, putting her seven-year-old son through a life on the run and living on the streets has been mentally torturous. When a kind diner owner offers her a job, Hope begins to claw her way toward a new beginning for herself and Billy, one tip at a time. But since her son’s recent abduction, and with threats from her ex still fresh in her mind, she’s constantly looking over her shoulder. Then a surprising, and lucky, tip from a diner regular puts yet another target on their backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the request of a friend, medical examiner Calder Stonewall has been looking for Hope and Billy for weeks. When they unexpectedly show up at the scene of a crime, his interest soon becomes personal. He’s amazed by the beautiful, brave woman and her resilient son. He’s also surprised by his growing need to take care of them both, although winning Hope’s trust won’t be easy. But when a tragedy thrusts the couple together, Calder quickly proves he’s a man Hope can rely on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is a good thing…because she’ll need all his support, and love, to get through a threat they never saw coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love is the best defense in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Stoker’s explosive Mountain Mercenaries novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous women don’t just stumble onto Ronan Cross’s remote property. But this one—vulnerable, victimized, and needing the kind of help only Ronan can offer—tells a story that makes his blood boil almost as hot as his need to protect her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since her father’s death, Chloe Harris has become a prisoner. Her own brother, a flesh peddler and low-level player in the Denver Mafia, is forcing her to sell her body for an endgame Chloe never saw coming: control over a vast fortune. Her only way out is to run—straight into the arms of the one hard-bodied man she can trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defending Chloe could rain punishment down on the Mountain Mercenaries. Her brother has Mob connections and the local police in his pocket. But Ronan still has an edge—the unshakable loyalty of his deadly teammates. As well as an unquenchable thirst for retribution…and Chloe.</description>

  <description>Linc has two very important things on his mind—professional football and his motorcycle club. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he does not have on his mind is the woman that drives him crazy and makes him want to do stupid things, like throw caution to the wind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nope, not Linc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s the lie he tells everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In reality, every time Conleigh’s name is mentioned, he squirms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s everything that he wants, wrapped up in a cute little package that is stamped ‘hands freakin’ off.’ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s four years younger than him, in school to be a doctor, and thinks football is stupid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even more, Linc and Conleigh get along like oil and water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s not a single second that they’re in each other’s presence that they’re not at each other’s throats. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But all it takes is hearing that she’s in trouble for Linc to drop every single thing—football and MC duties alike—and head to her side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A side that he’ll remain at until they either kill each other, or finally give into the heat between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Either way you look at it, he’s well and truly screwed. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Sergei Orlov has lived a life of dark corruption. Denying himself any bit of normalcy and happiness as a way to protect his family—of blood or Bratva. He’s seen as a savior to his men, living in darkness behind closed doors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raisa was a girl sold into a life of sexual servitude. Memories of her life before—forgotten. She aspires to be cherished by a man who will forever keep her as his own, never to be sold, abused, or traded again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A favor asked, turns into something else, something unquestionably beautiful. Sergei cannot deny that Raisa stirs something inside of him. Something that he has never felt before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One fractured savior. One shattered soul. When the two collide, their lives take on new meaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Recommended for readers 18+ due to Language, Sexual Content, Violence, and Sexual Abuse Situations. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Whitley’s main goal in survival is to stay unnoticed. A shadow against a wall, and nothing else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken by a Notorious Devil in the midst of chaos, she’s no longer unseen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free, Vice President of the Devils has lived a lifetime of guilt. It consumes him, threatens to control him with every breath he takes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was resigned to a lifetime of paying his penance for the past. At least, until he sees her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scared, threatened, and young. She is his chance to lessen his guilty conscious—to protect an innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS SHORT STORY—DOUBLED WITH REGRET. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Recommended for readers 18+ due to Violence, Language, and Sexual Content.</description>

After leaving her cheating husband, Lauren moves to Carnal, Colorado, and gets a job as a waitress in a biker bar called Bubba's. It's a nothing job in a nowhere joint . . . until Tatum Jackson walks in. Lauren has never seen a man with such good looks, muscles, and attitude. But when he insults her, Lauren doesn't want anything to do with him. Too bad for Lauren he's also the bar's part owner and bartender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the rough-around-the-edges Tate meets the high-class Lauren, he thinks she won't fit in at Bubba's. Yet there's more to Lauren than meets the eye, and Tate soon sets his mind on claiming her as his own. Before long, the desire burning between them is heating up the cold mountain air. But when violence strikes the town, Tate must reveal a dark secret to Lauren-one that may put an end to their sweet dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;205,764 words</description>

A man who seems to show up every time she needs him, but she knows better than to just hand over her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Knowing his future with Hadley is on the line, Cobi begins to tie their lives together. As the invisible rope that connects them tightens and things between them heat up, an unknown threat emerges threatening to to take away their happily ever after and send them both into darkness.</description>

  <description>Harmony Mayson isn’t the kind of girl to take unnecessary risk, but after meeting Harlen MacCabe, she starts to wonder if maybe she should be. The more time she spends with the wild and free biker, the more she starts to crave the freedom he gives her... And even more, she starts to crave him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harlen lives his life on his own terms. After losing both his parents at an early age to a robbery gone bad, he knows how precious life is, and he’s determined to get as much out of it as he can. When he runs into the beautiful Harmony and finds out she’s moving to town, he knows it’s time to take his shot. She thinks he only wants to be friends, but she couldn’t be more wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Harmony and Harlen don’t know is that their time might be cut short. Revenge is in the air, and someone won’t stop until a debt is settled.</description>

  <description>What’s wrong with my butt? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She means those words to be directed toward the woman beside her, not him. But he can’t stop himself from answering. Not when her ass is the most magnificent thing he’s seen in his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apparently, answering her with ‘not a damn thing’ wasn’t what she was expecting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She likely wasn’t expecting the baseball she took to the face at his next at bat, either. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All it takes is one ill-fated foul ball, and George Hoffman, Lumberjacks center fielder, falls head over heels in love with Wrigley Field—and yes, that is her real name. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that point forward, George and Wrigley fall into a fast whirlwind love that ends with them eloping to Vegas. And he has his potty mouth, titty bar owning, pain in the ass grandmother to thank for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not that he’s complaining or anything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Who wouldn’t want to be married to a woman that made his heart race like he was in the final game of the World Series? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is trying to convince her of that.</description>

  <description>As a Rock Chick, Shirleen Jackson lived through all the kidnappings and explosions. Along the way, she also watched the dramatic love stories that came with those rides unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But long ago, Shirleen made her choice. It affected who she was and would always be. She decided to settle for what she had and not want more. She had good friends. She was raising two fine young men who weren’t hers, but she loved them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Moses Richardson crashed into her life, literally… and deliberately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moses has different ideas about Shirleen. He’s more interested in the Shirleen of now, mostly because she’s interesting. And funny. And loyal. Smart. Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Moses has a big challenge on his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has to convince Shirleen of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then convince her she deserves to have more.</description>

  <description>Baseball is life, the rest is just details. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone who’s played the game has heard those words a time or two. But Hancock has heard them his entire life from his parents. His family has lived and breathed baseball even before he started little league. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hancock “Parts” Peters has a name that inspires grins across many faces, but the moment those faces get their first look at him, those grins slide away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hancock is gruff, filterless, and doesn’t give a crap who he offends. He is the only man in baseball who doesn’t care if he gets an endorsement or not. He’s there to play the game. He’s there to win. He’s there because baseball is his life. &lt;br /&gt;People think he’s a jerk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And maybe he is. But if that’s how he has to come off to get people to leave him the hell alone so he can play in peace, so be it. The less people he has to worry about offending, the better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don’t let the fear of striking out hold you back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sway Coffman didn’t mean to rock the boat. She was just there to do her job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure, she was a woman in a man’s world. Yes, she beat out several of those men to get the job as head athletic trainer for the professional baseball team, The Texas Lumberjacks. And yeah, she now got hate mail from those men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she’s good at her job, and she earned the position. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she is not good at, however, is talking to men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Men seem to see her curvy hips, large breasts and thick thighs and automatically think she is incompetent. Because surely a fat girl couldn’t get the job treating some of the most fit and athletic men in the world, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This fat girl got the job, and she is proud of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What else did she get? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The attention of the sexiest bearded man she’d ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was enough to bring to her down to her knees…in front of that man, the hot and grumpy baseball player, Hancock Peters.</description>

  <description>Tyler Cree has never been good at the whole look and don’t touch thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the moment he was old enough to walk on his own two feet, he’s been looking for trouble. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trouble comes in many forms…quite a few of those forms being the female persuasion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tyler knows what girls want—a bad boy. And he has the bad boy image down pat. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ex-military—check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hot cop—double check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A bike between his legs and a devil may care attitude—oh, yeah. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All the girls want him, yet none of them will have him—at least not all of him, anyway. A certain appendage they can have all they want. His heart, however, is not up for grabs. The useless organ inside his chest was broken and battered, mutilated by the one woman he thought would keep it safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Spoiler alert: she ripped it to shreds and set fire to the pieces. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To protect himself, Tyler keeps everyone at arm’s length, and never lets anyone get too close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Reagan Rose Alvarez barrels into his life, and trespasses on not only his property, but straight into his abused heart. One glance is all it takes, and he’s suddenly thinking about things he hasn’t thought for quite some time—thoughts that a man like him should never have about a woman like her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One moment of weakness is all it takes, and suddenly he has no other choice but to go on the offensive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Keeping her is the only other option now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Turns out, his heart isn’t as broken as he thought it was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, now the little she-devil holds it in the palm of her hands, and she has no clue just how much power she holds. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>-You want some?- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She snarls those words at him with barely concealed hostility the moment he arrives at her window to ask for her license and registration. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a few choice words, he lets her go with not one ticket, but three. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Next time she should check the attitude at the door and realize that he’s a cop, and just doing his job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Come get some.- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a week, and he’s still unable to think about anything else but her and her bad attitude—oh, and those sexy lips, angry eyes, and her promise to make his life hell. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Knowing he should stay away, he takes a step back and tries not to think about anything that has to do with those long legs, and that mouth that could be used for much better things than spewing venom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At an interview, she rattles off a random number to use as a reference for a job that she desperately needs, and that number just happens to be Johnny’s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’ll regret being so rude, and one day she’ll think twice when she decides to throw attitude toward a man like him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Vowing to make her life hell, he decides to have a little fun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Never get enough.- &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he doesn’t expect is to fall for her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The more Johnny learns about June, the deeper he digs his hole. Soon, he doesn’t know which way is up, and he’s just fine with that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then he learns that not everyone bothers to dig past her prickly demeanor and get to the woman that lives deeper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When one too many citizens of Hostel, Texas tries to back her against the wall, he’s had enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After all, you don’t mess with what’s his.</description>
