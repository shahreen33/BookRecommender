  <description>Audrey Rose Wadsworth and her partner-in-crime-investigation, Thomas Cresswell, are en route to New York to help solve another blood-soaked mystery. Embarking on a week-long voyage across the Atlantic on the opulent RMS Etruria, they’re delighted to discover a traveling troupe of circus performers, fortune tellers, and a certain charismatic young escape artist entertaining the first-class passengers nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, privileged young women begin to go missing without explanation, and a series of brutal slayings shocks the entire ship. The disturbing influence of the Moonlight Carnival pervades the decks as the murders grow ever more freakish, with nowhere to escape except the unforgiving sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's up to Audrey Rose and Thomas to piece together the gruesome investigation as even more passengers die before reaching their destination. But with clues to the next victim pointing to someone she loves, can Audrey Rose unravel the mystery before the killer's horrifying finale?</description>

  <description>In this New York Times bestselling sequel to Kerri Maniscalco's haunting #1 debut Stalking Jack the Ripper, bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer...or has the depraved prince been brought back to life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper's true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe's best schools of forensic medicine...and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her life's dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school's forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</description>

  <description>Presented by James Patterson's new children's imprint, this deliciously creepy horror novel has a storyline inspired by the Ripper murders and an unexpected, blood-chilling conclusion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Audrey Rose Wadsworth was born a lord's daughter, with a life of wealth and privilege stretched out before her. But between the social teas and silk dress fittings, she leads a forbidden secret life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her stern father's wishes and society's expectations, Audrey often slips away to her uncle's laboratory to study the gruesome practice of forensic medicine. When her work on a string of savagely killed corpses drags Audrey into the investigation of a serial murderer, her search for answers brings her close to her own sheltered world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story's shocking twists and turns, augmented with real, sinister period photos, will make this dazzling, #1 New York Times bestselling debut from author Kerri Maniscalco impossible to forget.</description>

  <description>Witness what the gods do…after dark. The friendships and the lies, the gossip and the wild parties, and of course, forbidden love. Because it turns out, the gods aren’t so different from us after all, especially when it comes to their problems. Stylish and immersive, this is one of mythology’s greatest stories -- The Taking of Persephone -- as it’s never been told before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New episode every Sunday on Webtoons</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For generations, the princes of Ilara have married the most beautiful maidens from the ocean village of Varenia. But though every girl longs to be chosen as the next princess, the cost of becoming royalty is higher than any of them could ever imagine…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor once dreamed of seeing the wondrous wealth and beauty of Ilara, the kingdom that’s ruled her village for as long as anyone can remember. But when a childhood accident left her with a permanent scar, it became clear that her identical twin sister, Zadie, would likely be chosen to marry the Crown Prince—while Nor remained behind, unable to ever set foot on land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Zadie is gravely injured, and Nor is sent to Ilara in her place. To Nor’s dismay, her future husband, Prince Ceren, is as forbidding and cold as his home—a castle carved into a mountain and devoid of sunlight. And as she grows closer to Ceren’s brother, the charming Prince Talin, Nor uncovers startling truths about a failing royal bloodline, a murdered queen… and a plot to destroy the home she was once so eager to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save her people, Nor must learn to negotiate the treacherous protocols of a court where lies reign and obsession rules. But discovering her own formidable strength may be the one move that costs her everything: the crown, Varenia and Zadie.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s been a bad, bad rake—and it takes a governess to teach him a lesson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The accidental governess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her livelihood slips through her fingers, Alexandra Mountbatten takes on an impossible post: transforming a pair of wild orphans into proper young ladies. However, the girls don’t need discipline. They need a loving home. Try telling that to their guardian, Chase Reynaud: duke’s heir in the streets and devil in the sheets. The ladies of London have tried—and failed—to make him settle down. Somehow, Alexandra must reach his heart... without risking her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The infamous rake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-respecting libertine, Chase lives by one rule: no attachments. When a stubborn little governess tries to reform him, he decides to give her an education—in pleasure. That should prove he can’t be tamed. But Alexandra is more than he bargained for: clever, perceptive, passionate. She refuses to see him as a lost cause. Soon the walls around Chase’s heart are crumbling... and he’s in danger of falling, hard.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When girl meets Duke, their marriage breaks all the rules…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since his return from war, the Duke of Ashbury’s to-do list has been short and anything but sweet: brooding, glowering, menacing London ne’er-do-wells by night. Now there’s a new item on the list. He needs an heir—which means he needs a wife. When Emma Gladstone, a vicar’s daughter turned seamstress, appears in his library wearing a wedding gown, he decides on the spot that she’ll do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His terms are simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will be husband and wife by night only.&lt;br /&gt;- No lights, no kissing. &lt;br /&gt;- No questions about his battle scars.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s pregnant with his heir, they need never share a bed again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emma is no pushover. She has a few rules of her own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- They will have dinner together every evening.&lt;br /&gt;- With conversation.&lt;br /&gt;- And unlimited teasing.&lt;br /&gt;- Last, and most importantly… Once she’s seen the man beneath the scars, he can’t stop her from falling in love…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A story of love and demons, family and witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova Huang knows more about magic than your average teen witch. She works at her grandmothers' bookshop, where she helps them loan out spell books and investigate any supernatural occurrences in their New England town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One fateful night, she follows reports of a white wolf into the woods, and she comes across the unexpected: her childhood crush, Tam Lang, battling a horse demon in the woods. As a werewolf, Tam has been wandering from place to place for years, unable to call any town home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursued by dark forces eager to claim the magic of wolves and out of options, Tam turns to Nova for help. Their latent feelings are rekindled against the backdrop of witchcraft, untested magic, occult rituals, and family ties both new and old in this enchanting tale of self-discovery.</description>

      <![CDATA[Listened on audio!<br /><br />What a whimsical book. It truly is a modern fairytale. It was really fun to listen to on audio, and it was awesome that Neil Gaiman himself narrates it. Looking forward to watching the movie adaptation because it was one of my favorites as a kid!]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Red Rising&lt;/i&gt; in a debut young adult fantasy that's full of rivalry, romance... and dragons.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie and Lee were just children when a brutal revolution changed their world, giving everyone—even the lowborn—a chance to test into the governing class of dragonriders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they are both rising stars in the new regime, despite backgrounds that couldn’t be more different. Annie’s lowborn family was executed by dragonfire, while Lee’s aristocratic family was murdered by revolutionaries. Growing up in the same orphanage forged their friendship, and seven years of training have made them rivals for the top position in the dragonriding fleet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changes when survivors from the old regime surface, bent on reclaiming the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With war on the horizon and his relationship with Annie changing fast, Lee must choose to kill the only family he has left or to betray everything he’s come to believe in. And Annie must decide whether to protect the boy she loves . . . or step up to be the champion her city needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From debut author Rosaria Munda comes a gripping adventure that calls into question which matters most: the family you were born into, or the one you’ve chosen.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; follows three women, each at a crossroads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline’s youngest (&lt;i&gt;how &lt;/i&gt;is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline’s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline’s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn’t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.</description>

  <description>Now that high school is over, Ari is dying to move to the big city with his ultra-hip band―if he can just persuade his dad to let him quit his job at their struggling family bakery. Though he loved working there as a kid, Ari cannot fathom a life wasting away over rising dough and hot ovens. But while interviewing candidates for his replacement, Ari meets Hector, an easygoing guy who loves baking as much as Ari wants to escape it. As they become closer over batches of bread, love is ready to bloom . . . that is, if Ari doesn’t ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer Kevin Panetta and artist Savanna Ganucheau concoct a delicious recipe of intricately illustrated baking scenes and blushing young love, in which the choices we make can have terrible consequences, but the people who love us can help us grow.</description>

  <description>I’m an outcast and a loner, named for death itself. Fate wasn’t supposed to have plans for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then she came back—the girl I once kissed in a thorn-covered chapel in the woods. She came back, and I could no more resist her than I could pry out my own heart. And by some trick of fate, she wants me as much as I want her. The only problem? She also wants the man who owns Thornchapel, Auden Guest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And so do I. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eight years ago, I did something to Auden, something terrible. He hurt me back the only way he knew how, and so here we are: our hatred seasoned with pain and my loneliness seasoned with longing. The only thing we can agree on is Proserpina Markham, and she wants us to find a way to be together—all three of us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Auden wants to earn her as his submissive, then he has to earn me as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with the discovery of bones behind the altar and the carnal revel of Beltane fast approaching, it’s becoming clear that Thornchapel’s secrets are much deeper and older than any of us could have ever guessed. And no matter how bright and merry a feast of sparks may be, it’s always followed by ashes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And darkness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Feast of Sparks is Book Two in the Thornchapel series.*</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy. THE RISK takes you back to the world of hot hockey players, feisty heroines, bro banter, and steamy scenes... &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says I’m a bad girl. They’re only partly right—I don’t let fear rule me, and I certainly don’t care what people think. But I draw the line at sleeping with the enemy. As the daughter of Briar’s head hockey coach, I’d be vilified if I hooked up with a player from a rival team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that’s who Jake Connelly is. Harvard’s star forward is arrogant, annoying, and too attractive for his own good. But fate is cruel—I require his help to secure a much-coveted internship, and the sexy jerk isn’t making it easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Connelly to be my fake boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every fake date…he wants a real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means this bad girl is in big trouble. Nothing good can come from sneaking around with Jake Connelly. My father would kill me, my friends will revolt, and my post-college career is on the line. But while it’s getting harder and harder to resist Jake’s oozing sex appeal and cocky grin, I refuse to fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s the one risk I’m not willing to take.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s good at achieving her goals…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College senior Sabrina James has her whole future planned out: graduate from college, kick butt in law school, and land a high-paying job at a cutthroat firm. Her path to escaping her shameful past certainly doesn’t include a gorgeous hockey player who believes in love at first sight. One night of sizzling heat and surprising tenderness is all she’s willing to give John Tucker, but sometimes, one night is all it takes for your entire life to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But the game just got a whole lot more complicated...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucker believes being a team player is as important as being the star. On the ice, he’s fine staying out of the spotlight, but when it comes to becoming a daddy at the age of twenty-two, he refuses to be a bench warmer. It doesn’t hurt that the soon-to-be mother of his child is beautiful, whip-smart, and keeps him on his toes. The problem is, Sabrina’s heart is locked up tight, and the fiery brunette is too stubborn to accept his help. If he wants a life with the woman of his dreams, he’ll have to convince her that some goals can only be made with an assist.</description>

  <description>It starts with a stolen kiss under an English sky, and it ends with a walk down the aisle. It starts with the President sending his best friend to woo me on his behalf, and it ends with my heart split in two. It starts with buried secrets and dangerous desires…and ends with the three of us bound together with a hateful love sharper than any barbed wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Greer Galloway, and I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of an American Queen.</description>

  <description>When librarian Poe Markham takes the job at Thornchapel, she only wants two things: to stay away from Thornchapel’s tortured owner, Auden Guest, and to find out what happened to her mother twelve years ago. It should be easy enough—keep her head down while she works in the house’s crumbling private library and while she hunts down any information as to why this remote manor tucked into the fog-shrouded moors would be the last place her mother was seen alive. But Thornchapel has other plans for her... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Poe begins uncovering the house’s secrets, both new and old, she’s also pulled into the seductive, elegant world of Auden and his friends—and drawn to Auden’s worst enemy, the beautiful and brooding St. Sebastian. And as Thornchapel slowly tightens its coil of truths and lies around them, Poe, Auden and St. Sebastian start unravelling into filthy, holy pleasure and pain. Together, they awaken a fate that will either anoint them or leave them in ashes… &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;From the author of the USA Today bestselling New Camelot series comes an original fairy tale full of ancient mysteries, lantern-lit rituals, jealousy, money, murder, sacred torment, and obsessions that last for lifetimes... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;***A Lesson in Thorns is the first of four books in the Thornchapel series.*** &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Age of Darkness approaches.&lt;br /&gt;Five lives stand in its way.&lt;br /&gt;Who will stop it... or unleash it? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, the Seven Prophets guided humanity. Using their visions of the future, they ended wars and united nations―until the day, one hundred years ago, when the Prophets disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All they left behind was one final, secret prophecy, foretelling an Age of Darkness and the birth of a new Prophet who could be the world’s salvation . . . or the cause of its destruction. As chaos takes hold, five souls are set on a collision course:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince exiled from his kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;A ruthless killer known as the Pale Hand.&lt;br /&gt;A once-faithful leader torn between his duty and his heart. &lt;br /&gt;A reckless gambler with the power to find anything or anyone.&lt;br /&gt;And a dying girl on the verge of giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of them―or all of them―could break the world. Will they be savior or destroyer? Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Throne of Glass, Children of Blood and Bone&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;An Ember in the Ashes. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Sick of being the only virgin among her friends, Bliss Edwards decides the best way to deal with the problem is to lose it as quickly and simply as possible - a one-night stand. But her plan turns out to be anything but simple when she freaks out and leaves a gorgeous guy alone and naked in her bed with an excuse that no one with half-a-brain would ever believe. And as if that weren't embarrassing enough, when she arrives for her first class of her last college semester, she recognizes her new theatre professor. She'd left him naked in her bed about 8 hours earlier.</description>

  <description>He knows how to score, on and off the ice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn’t have the first clue about what she's going to do after college. To make matters worse, she’s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship. Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck won’t include the king of one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’ll take more than flashy moves to win her over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girls…he’s a ladies man, all right, and he’s yet to meet a woman who’s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire world—and now she wants to be friends? Nope. It’s not over until he says it’s over. Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it’s time to stop focusing on scoring…and shoot for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;What if America had a royal family? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When America won the Revolutionary War, its people offered General George Washington a crown. Two and a half centuries later, the House of Washington still sits on the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Princess Beatrice gets closer to becoming America's first queen regnant, the duty she has embraced her entire life suddenly feels stifling. Nobody cares about the spare except when she's breaking the rules, so Princess Samantha doesn't care much about anything, either . . . except the one boy who is distinctly off-limits to her. And then there's Samantha's twin, Prince Jefferson. If he'd been born a generation earlier, he would have stood first in line for the throne, but the new laws of succession make him third. Most of America adores their devastatingly handsome prince . . . but two very different girls are vying to capture &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A future chieftain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fie abides by one rule: look after your own. Her Crow caste of undertakers and mercy-killers takes more abuse than coin, but when they’re called to collect royal dead, she’s hoping they’ll find the payout of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fugitive prince.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Crown Prince Jasimir turns out to have faked his death, Fie’s ready to cut her losses—and perhaps his throat. But he offers a wager that she can’t refuse: protect him from a ruthless queen, and he’ll protect the Crows when he reigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A too-cunning bodyguard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawk warrior Tavin has always put Jas’s life before his, magically assuming the prince’s appearance and shadowing his every step. But what happens when Tavin begins to want something to call his own?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He's a player in more ways than one…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College junior John Logan can get any girl he wants. For this hockey star, life is a parade of parties and hookups, but behind his killer grins and easygoing charm, he hides growing despair about the dead-end road he'll be forced to walk after graduation. A sexy encounter with freshman Grace Ivers is just the distraction he needs, but when a thoughtless mistake pushes her away, Logan plans to spend his final year proving to her that he's worth a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now he's going to need to up his game…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a less than stellar freshman year, Grace is back at Briar University, older, wiser, and so over the arrogant hockey player she nearly handed her V-card to. She's not a charity case, and she's not the quiet butterfly she was when they first hooked up. If Logan expects her to roll over and beg like all his other puck bunnies, he can think again. He wants her back? He'll have to &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt; for it. This time around, she'll be the one in the driver's seat, and she plans on driving him wild.</description>

  <description>In this electrifying sixty-page companion novella to the New York Times bestselling Shatter Me series, discover the fate of the Omega Point rebels as they go up against The Reestablishment. Set during and soon after the final moments of Unravel Me, Fracture Me is told from Adam's perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Omega Point prepares to launch an all-out assault on The Reestablishment soldiers stationed in Sector 45, Adam's focus couldn't be further from the upcoming battle. He's reeling from his breakup with Juliette, scared for his best friend's life, and as concerned as ever for his brother James's safety. And just as Adam begins to wonder if this life is really for him, the alarms sound. It's time for war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battlefield, it seems like the odds are in their favor—but taking down Warner, Adam's newly discovered half brother, won't be that easy. The Reestablishment can't tolerate a rebellion, and they'll do anything to crush the resistance . . . including killing everyone Adam has ever cared about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fracture Me sets the stage for Ignite Me, the explosive finale in Tahereh Mafi's epic dystopian series. It's a novella not to be missed by fans who crave action-packed stories with tantalizing romance like Divergent by Veronica Roth, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and Legend by Marie Lu.</description>

The gentlemen’s secret society at Yale was filled with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Nathaniel Radcliffe, the bane of my existence, was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the right hand of the American Gods, he was conceited and arrogant. A dangerously handsome man in a tailored custom suit and shiny black oxford loafers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classroom was our battlefield. We made a sport out of arguing and debating, ready to do anything in order to win over the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadly opponents, deadlier minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd sworn I'd never give him the upper hand, until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret I’ve been hiding for the last three years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He just discovered it… and now he has all the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*35k Novella</description>

  <description>Everyone says opposites attract. And they must be right, because there’s no logical reason why I’m so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don’t usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I’m flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn’t help that he’s buddy-buddy with my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that his best friend has a crush on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that I just moved in with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I not mention we’re roommates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it doesn’t matter. Fitzy has made it clear he’s not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I’m not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I’m not about to start. I’ve got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he’s missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestseller Tessa Bailey launches a super sexy new series featuring the blue collar men who work for a HGTV-esq house flipping business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an injury ends Travis Ford’s major league baseball career, he returns home to start over. He just wants to hammer out his frustrations at his new construction gig and forget all about his glory days. But he can’t even walk through town without someone recapping his greatest hits. Or making a joke about his… bat. And then there’s Georgie, his buddy’s little sister, who is definitely not a kid anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Georgette Castle has crushed on her older brother’s best friend for years. The grumpy, bear of a man working for her family’s house flipping business is a far cry from the charming sports star she used to know. But a moody scowl doesn’t scare her and Georgie’s determined to show Travis he’s more than a pretty face and a batting average, even if it means putting her feelings aside to be “just friends.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travis wants to brood in peace. But the girl he used to tease is now a funny, full-of-life woman who makes him feel whole again. And he wants her. So damn bad. Except Georgie’s off limits and he knows he can’t give her what she deserves. But she’s becoming the air he breathes and Travis can’t stay away, no matter how hard he tries...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Nemesis (n.) 1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome.&lt;br /&gt;2) A person’s undoing&lt;br /&gt;3) Joshua Templeman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Hutton has always been certain that the nice girl can get the corner office. She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six, but nobody knows the reason behind their split at the absolute height of their popularity . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>Haunted by the sacrifices he made in Constantinople, Radu is called back to the new capital. Mehmed is building an empire, becoming the sultan his people need. But Mehmed has a secret: as emperor, he is more powerful than ever . . . and desperately lonely. Does this mean Radu can finally have more with Mehmed . . . and would he even want it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lada's rule of absolute justice has created a Wallachia free of crime. But Lada won't rest until everyone knows that her country's borders are inviolable. Determined to send a message of defiance, she has the bodies of Mehmed's peace envoy delivered to him, leaving Radu and Mehmed with no choice. If Lada is allowed to continue, only death will prosper. They must go to war against the girl prince. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mehmed knows that he loves her. He understands her. She must lose to him so he can keep her safe. Radu alone fears that they are underestimating his sister's indomitable will. Only by destroying everything that came before--including her relationships--can Lada truly build the country she wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claim the throne. Demand the crown. Rule the world.</description>

      <![CDATA[What a journey it's been!<br /><br />I honestly could think of no better way to end this series. This is one of the most immersive and sweeping YA historical fiction novels I've ever read. The political maneuverings are SO compelling, and I loved that we got to grow with Lada, Radu, and Mehmet an...]]>

  <description>Perfect for the fans of &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; who are desperately awaiting the release of &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt;, this novella-length digital original will bridge the gap between these two novels from the perspective of the villain we all love to hate, Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt;, Juliette escaped from The Reestablishment by seducing Warner—and then putting a bullet in his shoulder. But as she’ll learn in &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt;, Warner is not that easy to get rid of. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the base and recovering from his near-fatal wound, Warner must do everything in his power to keep his soldiers in check and suppress any mention of a rebellion in the sector. Still as obsessed with Juliette as ever, his first priority is to find her, bring her back, and dispose of Adam and Kenji, the two traitors who helped her escape. But when Warner’s father, The Supreme Commander of The Reestablishment, arrives to correct his son’s mistakes, it’s clear that he has much different plans for Juliette. Plans Warner simply cannot allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set after &lt;i&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/i&gt; and before its forthcoming sequel, &lt;i&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/i&gt; is a novella told from the perspective of Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.</description>

  <description>The thrilling second installment in New York Times bestselling author Tahereh Mafi’s Shatter Me series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have taken Juliette a single touch to kill Warner. But his mysterious immunity to her deadly power has left her shaken, wondering why her ultimate defense mechanism failed against the person she most needs protection from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and Adam were able to escape Warner’s clutches and join up with a group of rebels, many of whom have powers of their own. Juliette will finally be able to actively fight against The Reestablishment and try to fix her broken world. And perhaps these new allies can help her shed light on the secret behind Adam’s—and Warner’s—immunity to her killer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette’s world is packed with high-stakes action and tantalizing romance, perfect for fans of the Red Queen series by Victoria Aveyard and the Darkest Minds trilogy by Alexandra Bracken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ransom Riggs, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, raved: "A thrilling, high-stakes saga of self-discovery and forbidden love, the Shatter Me series is a must-read for fans of dystopian young-adult literature—or any literature!"</description>

  <description>Lada Dracul has no allies. No throne. All she has is what she’s always had: herself. After failing to secure the Wallachian throne, Lada is out to punish anyone who dares to cross her blood-strewn path. Filled with a white-hot rage, she storms the countryside with her men, accompanied by her childhood friend Bogdan, terrorizing the land. But brute force isn’t getting Lada what she wants. And thinking of Mehmed brings little comfort to her thorny heart. There’s no time to wonder whether he still thinks about her, even loves her. She left him before he could leave her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What Lada needs is her younger brother Radu’s subtlety and skill. But Mehmed has sent him to Constantinople—and it’s no diplomatic mission. Mehmed wants control of the city, and Radu has earned an unwanted place as a double-crossing spy behind enemy lines. Radu longs for his sister’s fierce confidence—but for the first time in his life, he rejects her unexpected plea for help. Torn between loyalties to faith, to the Ottomans, and to Mehmed, he knows he owes Lada nothing. If she dies, he could never forgive himself—but if he fails in Constantinople, will Mehmed ever forgive him?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As nations fall around them, the Dracul siblings must decide: what will they sacrifice to fulfill their destinies? Empires will topple, thrones will be won . . . and souls will be lost.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the sequel to New York Times bestselling &lt;i&gt;A Curse So Dark and Lonely&lt;/i&gt;, Brigid Kemmerer returns to the world of Emberfall in a lush fantasy where friends become foes and love blooms in the darkest of places.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Find the heir, win the crown.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curse is finally broken, but Prince Rhen of Emberfall faces darker troubles still. Rumors circulate that he is not the true heir and that forbidden magic has been unleashed in Emberfall. Although Rhen has Harper by his side, his guardsman Grey is missing, leaving more questions than answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Win the crown, save the kingdom. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumored to be the heir, Grey has been on the run since he destroyed Lilith. He has no desire to challenge Rhen--until Karis Luran once again threatens to take Emberfall by force. Her own daughter Lia Mara sees the flaws in her mother’s violent plan, but can she convince Grey to stand against Rhen, even for the good of Emberfall?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart-pounding, compulsively readable saga continues as loyalties are tested and new love blooms in a kingdom on the brink of war.</description>

  <description>The ruthless Empress Amara of Kraeshia has taken the Mytican throne, and now uncertainty looms over the three kingdoms. Since Lucia unleashed the fire Kindred, wreaking havoc throughout the land, Myticans have been looking for someone—anyone—they can trust. They believe in Amara, not knowing her grand promises are built on lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Paelsia, Magnus and Cleo reluctantly follow King Gaius to the home of his exiled mother, Selia. Selia is a powerful witch and claims she can help unlock the magic of the Kindred—&lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the visitors agree to her terms. When Jonas arrives from Kraeshia, he is shocked to find that his rebel army now includes his sworn enemies. Along with Nic, Felix, and the mysteriously resurrected Ashur, the contentious group agrees to cast aside old grudges—for now—and united against their common enemy: Amara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, bearing the child of a Watcher and feared by all, Princess Lucia travels across Mytica to find her family. But time is running out. The impending storm signals the dark prophecy Timotheus warned her about. Her fate is written, and it includes none other than the rebel Jonas. When their paths collied, Jonas and Lucia must decide between blindly following their destiny or fighting for their own free will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battle for power culminates at the Paelsian palace, where Amara resides. Rain pours. Blood spills. And soon all will discover that the darkest magic comes at an even darker price.</description>

  <description>In GATHERING DARKNESS, book three of the New York Times bestselling Falling Kingdoms series, the stakes have never been higher as three teams push forward on a race to find the Kindred, the four elemental crystals possessing ancient all-powerful magic, first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Magnus has just witnessed torture, death, and miracles during the bloody confrontation that decimated the rebel forces. Now he must choose between family and justice as his father, the cruel King Gaius, sets out to conquer all of Mytica. All Gaius needs now are the Kindred - the four elemental crystals that give godlike powers to their owner. But the King of Blood is not the only one hunting for this ancient, storied magic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• THE KRAESHIANS join the hunt. Ashur and Amara, the royal siblings from the wealthy kingdom across the Silver Sea, charm and manipulate their way to the Kindred, proving to be more ruthless than perhaps even the King of Blood himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• THE REBELS forge ahead. Princess Cleo and vengeful Jonas lead them, slaying with sweetness, skill, and a secret that can control Lucia's overpowering magic - all so they can use the Kindred to win back their fallen kingdoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• THE WATCHERS follow Melenia out of the Sanctuary. They ally in the flesh with King Gaius, who vows to use Lucia's powers to unveil the Kindred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only certainty in the dark times is that whoever finds the magic first will control the fate of Mytica... but fate can be fickle when magic is involved.</description>

  <description>Alosa's mission is finally complete. Not only has she recovered all three pieces of the map to a legendary hidden treasure, but the pirates who originally took her captive are now prisoners on her ship. Still unfairly attractive and unexpectedly loyal, first mate Riden is a constant distraction, but now he's under her orders. And she takes great comfort in knowing that the villainous Vordan will soon be facing her father's justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vordan exposes a secret her father has kept for years, Alosa and her crew find themselves in a deadly race with the feared Pirate King. Despite the danger, Alosa knows they will recover the treasure first . . . after all, she is the daughter of the Siren Queen.</description>

  <description>The new gut-wrenching epic from the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sky in the Deep&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, Tova has lived among the Svell, the people who found her washed ashore as a child and use her for her gift as a Truthtongue. Her own home and clan are long-faded memories, but the sacred symbols and staves inked over every inch of her skin mark her as one who can cast the rune stones and see into the future. She has found a fragile place among those who fear her, but when two clans to the east bury their age-old blood feud and join together as one, her world is dangerously close to collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in generations, the leaders of the Svell are divided. Should they maintain peace or go to war with the allied clans to protect their newfound power? And when their chieftain looks to Tova to cast the stones, she sets into motion a series of events that will not only change the landscape of the mainland forever but will give her something she believed she could never have again—a home.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The road to power... is paved with blood and magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleo&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;is now a prisoner in her own palace, forced to be an ambassador for Mytica as the evil King Gaius lies to her people.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnus&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;stands to eventually inherit the new kingdom but is still obsessed with his feelings for his adopted sister, Lucia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucia&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;is haunted by the outcome of the breathtaking display of magic that allowed her father to capture the kingdoms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jonas&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;watched at the palace gates a troop of rebels behind him, waiting for him to tell them how he plans to overtake King Gaius.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bloody siege, Auranos has been defeated, its young queen orphaned and dethroned. The three kingdoms—Auranos, Limeros, and Paelsia—are now unwillingly united as one country called Mytica. But the allure of ancient, dangerous magic beckons still, and with it the chance to rule not just Mytica, but the whole world over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the fray are four brave young people grappling for that magic and the power it promises. For Cleo, the magic would enable her to reclaim her royal seat. In Jonas's hands, it frees his nation, and in Lucia's, it fulfills the ancient prophecy of her destiny. And if the magic were Magnus's, he would finally prove his worth in the eyes of his cruel and scheming father, King Gaius, who rules Mytica with a punishing hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gaius begins to build a road into the Forbidden Mountains to physically link all of Mytica, he sparks a long-smoking fire in the hearts of the people that will forever change the face of this land. For Gaius's road is paved with blood, and its construction will have cosmic consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's about to make a deal with the college bad boy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Wells has finally found someone who turns her on. But while she might be confident in every other area of her life, she's carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction. If she wants to get her crush's attention, she'll have to step out of her comfort zone and &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; him take notice... even if it means tutoring the annoying, childish, &lt;i&gt;cocky&lt;/i&gt; captain of the hockey team in exchange for a pretend date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and it's going to be oh so good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Garrett Graham has ever wanted is to play professional hockey after graduation, but his plummeting GPA is threatening everything he's worked so hard for. If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he's all for it. But when one unexpected kiss leads to the wildest sex of both their lives, it doesn't take long for Garrett to realize that pretend isn't going to cut it. Now he just has to convince Hannah that the man she wants looks a lot like &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Love speaks in flowers. Truth requires thorns.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel to a world of dark bargains struck by moonlight, of haunted towns and hungry woods, of talking beasts and gingerbread golems, where a young mermaid's voice can summon deadly storms and where a river might do a lovestruck boy's bidding but only for a terrible price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by myth, fairy tale, and folklore, #1 New York Times–bestselling author Leigh Bardugo has crafted a deliciously atmospheric collection of short stories filled with betrayals, revenge, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for new readers and dedicated fans, these tales will transport you to lands both familiar and strange—to a fully realized world of dangerous magic that millions have visited through the novels of the Grishaverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection of six stories includes three brand-new tales, all of them lavishly illustrated with art that changes with each turn of the page, culminating in six stunning full-spread illustrations as rich in detail as the stories themselves.</description>

      <![CDATA[A perfect addition to the Grishaverse collection!<br /><br />Bardugo's writing is so well suited for these dark fairytales. They are so creepy and atmospheric, which is what Bardugo excels at. The artwork for each story is absolutely STUNNING and really enhances the reading experience. ]]>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>Echo Ridge is small-town America. Ellery's never been there, but she's heard all about it. Her aunt went missing there at age seventeen. And only five years ago, a homecoming queen put the town on the map when she was killed. Now Ellery has to move there to live with a grandmother she barely knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is picture-perfect, but it's hiding secrets. And before school even begins for Ellery, someone's declared open season on homecoming, promising to make it as dangerous as it was five years ago. Then, almost as if to prove it, another girl goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellery knows all about secrets. Her mother has them; her grandmother does too. And the longer she's in Echo Ridge, the clearer it becomes that everyone there is hiding something. The thing is, secrets are dangerous--and most people aren't good at keeping them. Which is why in Echo Ridge, it's safest to keep your secrets to yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;One of Us Is Lying&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what happens when five strangers walk into detention and only four walk out alive. Everyone is a suspect, and everyone has something to hide.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay close attention and you might solve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.&lt;br /&gt; Bronwyn, &lt;b&gt;the brain, &lt;/b&gt; is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. &lt;br /&gt; Addy, &lt;b&gt; the beauty, &lt;/b&gt; is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. &lt;br /&gt; Nate, &lt;b&gt;the criminal&lt;/b&gt;, is already on probation for dealing.&lt;br /&gt; Cooper, &lt;b&gt;the athlete&lt;/b&gt;, is the all-star baseball pitcher.&lt;br /&gt; And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Simon, &lt;b&gt; the outcast&lt;/b&gt;, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention, Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose? &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beware of the woods and the dark, dank deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’ll follow you home, and he won’t let you sleep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Sawkill Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marion: the new girl. Awkward and plain, steady and dependable. Weighed down by tragedy and hungry for love she’s sure she’ll never find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey: the pariah. Luckless and lonely, hurting but hiding it. Aching with grief and dreaming of vanished girls. Maybe she’s broken—or maybe everyone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val: the queen bee. Gorgeous and privileged, ruthless and regal. Words like silk and eyes like knives, a heart made of secrets and a mouth full of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their stories come together on the island of Sawkill Rock, where gleaming horses graze in rolling pastures and cold waves crash against black cliffs. Where kids whisper the legend of an insidious monster at parties and around campfires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where girls have been disappearing for decades, stolen away by a ravenous evil no one has dared to fight… until now.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fan favorite character Kenji Kishimoto narrates t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;his gripping companion novella to Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling Shatter Me series, set during the explosive events in &lt;em&gt;Restore Me&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette is still reeling from Warner's betrayal, and Kenji is trying to balance his friendship with her with his responsibilities as a leader of the resistance against the Reestablishment. Things get even more interesting when an unexpected person from Omega Point’s past surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending of &lt;em&gt;Restore Me &lt;/em&gt;left readers gasping, and this novella full of Kenji’s signature sass and big heart is the perfect story to tide fans over until &lt;em&gt;Defy Me&lt;/em&gt;, the shocking fifth book in the Shatter Me series, hits shelves in April 2019.</description>

  <description>A contemporary YA novel that examines rape culture through alternating perspectives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Craft knows how to kill someone. And she doesn’t feel bad about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, when her older sister, Anna, was murdered and the killer walked free, Alex uncaged the language she knows best—the language of violence. While her own crime goes unpunished, Alex knows she can’t be trusted among other people. Not with Jack, the star athlete who wants to really know her but still feels guilty over the role he played the night Anna’s body was discovered. And not with Peekay, the preacher’s kid with a defiant streak who befriends Alex while they volunteer at an animal shelter. Not anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their senior year unfolds, Alex’s darker nature breaks out, setting these three teens on a collision course that will change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Assassin Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church ministry think she’s far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she’s no closer to ending Consul Scaeva and Cardinal Duomo, or avenging her familia. And after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia begins to suspect the motives of the Red Church itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it’s announced that Scaeva and Duomo will be making a rare public appearance at the conclusion of the grand games in Godsgrave, Mia defies the Church and sells herself to a gladiatorial collegium for a chance to finally end them. Upon the sands of the arena, Mia finds new allies, bitter rivals, and more questions about her strange affinity for the shadows. But as conspiracies unfold within the collegium walls, and the body count rises, Mia will be forced to choose between loyalty and revenge, and uncover a secret that could change the very face of her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the world of Nevernight, which Publishers Weekly called “absorbing in its complexity and bold in its bloodiness,” Godsgrave will continue to thrill and satisfy fantasy fans everywhere.</description>

  <description>On the edge of town a beast haunts the woods, trapped in the Gray, its bonds loosening…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uprooted from the city, Violet Saunders doesn’t have much hope of fitting in at her new school in Four Paths, a town almost buried in the woodlands of rural New York. The fact that she’s descended from one of the town’s founders doesn’t help much, either—her new neighbours treat her with distant respect, and something very like fear. When she meets Justin, May, Isaac, and Harper, all children of founder families, and sees the otherworldly destruction they can wreak, she starts to wonder if the townsfolk are right to be afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When bodies start to appear in the woods, the locals become downright hostile. Can the teenagers solve the mystery of Four Paths, and their own part in it, before another calamity strikes?</description>

  <description>You may think you know the story. After a miserable childhood, penniless orphan Jane Eyre embarks on a new life as a governess at Thornfield Hall. There, she meets one dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite their significant age gap (!) and his uneven temper (!!), they fall in love—and, Reader, she marries him. (!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or does she?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare for an adventure of Gothic proportions, in which all is not as it seems, a certain gentleman is hiding more than skeletons in his closets, and one orphan Jane Eyre, aspiring author Charlotte Brontë, and supernatural investigator Alexander Blackwood are about to be drawn together on the most epic ghost hunt this side of Wuthering Heights.</description>

  <description>All Stevie Bell wanted was to find the key to the Ellingham mystery, but instead she found her classmate dead. And while she solved that murder, the crimes of the past are still waiting in the dark. Just as Stevie feels she’s on the cusp of putting it together, her parents pull her out of Ellingham academy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her own safety they say. She must move past this obsession with crime. Now that Stevie’s away from the school of topiaries and secret tunnels, and her strange and endearing friends, she begins to feel disconnected from the rest of the world. At least she won’t have to see David anymore. David, who she kissed. David, who lied to her about his identity—son of despised politician Edward King. Then King himself arrives at her house to offer a deal: He will bring Stevie back to Ellingham immediately. In return, she must play nice with David. King is in the midst of a campaign and can’t afford his son stirring up trouble. If Stevie’s at school, David will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tantalizing riddles behind the Ellingham murders are still waiting to be unraveled, and Stevie knows she’s so close. But the path to the truth has more twists and turns than she can imagine—and moving forward involves hurting someone she cares for. In New York Times bestselling author Maureen Johnson’s second novel of the &lt;i&gt;Truly Devious&lt;/i&gt; series, nothing is free, and someone will pay for the truth with their life.</description>

  <description>Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. "A place" he said, "where learning is a game."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym, Truly Devious. It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.</description>

  <description>Helloooo, Internet Land. Bitty here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y’all... I &lt;i&gt;might &lt;/i&gt;not be ready for this. I may be a former junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;talented amateur pâtissier, but being a freshman on the Samwell University hockey team is a whole new challenge. It’s nothing like co-ed club hockey back in Georgia! First of all? There’s &lt;em&gt;checking.&lt;/em&gt; And then, there is Jack—our very attractive but moody captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A collection of the first half of the megapopular webcomic series of the same name, &lt;i&gt;Check, Please!: #Hockey&lt;/i&gt; is the first book of a hilarious and stirring two-volume coming-of-age story about hockey, bros, and trying to find yourself during the best four years of your life.</description>

  <description>Sylvie has always known she deserves more. Out in the permanent twilight of the Dusklands, her guardians called her power to create illusions a curse. But Sylvie knows it gives her a place in Coeur d'Or, the palais of the Amber Empress and her highborn legacies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Sylvie sets off toward the Amber City, a glittering jewel under a sun that never sets, to take what is hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her hope for a better life is quickly dimmed. The empress invites her in only as part of a wicked wager among her powerful courtiers. Sylvie must assume a new name, Mirage, and begin to navigate secretive social circles and deadly games of intrigue in order to claim her spot. Soon it becomes apparent that nothing is as it appears and no one, including her cruel yet captivating sponsor, Sunder, will answer her questions. As Mirage strives to assume what should be her rightful place, she'll have to consider whether it is worth the price she must pay.</description>

  <description>All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never guessed, and a future she could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fall in love, break the curse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It once seemed so easy to Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall. Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year over and over, he knew he could be saved if a girl fell for him. But that was before he learned that at the end of each autumn, he would turn into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. That was before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever been easy for Harper Lacy. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother barely holding their family together while constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, she learned to be tough enough to survive. But when she tries to save someone else on the streets of Washington, DC, she’s instead somehow sucked into Rhen’s cursed world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break the curse, save the kingdom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince? A monster? A curse? Harper doesn’t know where she is or what to believe. But as she spends time with Rhen in this enchanted land, she begins to understand what’s at stake. And as Rhen realizes Harper is not just another girl to charm, his hope comes flooding back. But powerful forces are standing against Emberfall . . . and it will take more than a broken curse to save Harper, Rhen, and his people from utter ruin.</description>

  <description>Shane has been doing college all wrong. Pre-med, stellar grades, and happy parents…sounds ideal—but Shane's made zero friends, goes home every weekend, and romance…what’s that? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life has been dorm, dining hall, class, repeat. Time's a ticking, and she needs a change—there's nothing like moving to a new country to really mix things up. Shane signs up for a semester abroad in London. She's going to right all her college mistakes: make friends, pursue boys, and find adventure! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done. She is soon faced with the complicated realities of living outside her bubble, and when self-doubt sneaks in, her new life starts to fall apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane comes to find that, with the right amount of courage and determination one can conquer anything. Throw in some fate and a touch of magic—the possibilities are endless.</description>

  <description>Juliette hasn’t touched anyone in exactly 264 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.</description>

  <description>In this dazzling and long-awaited conclusion to the acclaimed Mortal Instruments series, Clary and her friends fight the greatest evil they have ever faced: Clary's own brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Morgenstern is on the move, systematically turning Shadowhunter against Shadowhunter. Bearing the Infernal Cup, he transforms Shadowhunters into creatures out of nightmare, tearing apart families and lovers as the ranks of his Endarkened army swell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The embattled Shadowhunters withdraw to Idris - but not even the famed demon towers of Alicante can keep Sebastian at bay. And with the Nephilim trapped in Idris, who will guard the world against demons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one of the greatest betrayals the Nephilim have ever known is revealed, Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Simon, and Alec must flee - even if their journey takes them deep into the demon realms, where no Shadowhunter has set foot before, and from which no human being has ever returned...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love will be sacrificed and lives lost in the terrible battle for the fate of the word in the thrilling final installment of the classic urban fantasy series The Mortal Instruments!</description>

      <![CDATA[Wow, if there's one thing Cassandra Clare knows how to write its a finale!!! It's taken me a few books to get into The Mortal Instruments, but this final book had me completely HOOKED. The stakes felt so much more incredibly higher than City of Glass, and the villain in the back half of the serie...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York City.&lt;br /&gt;1927.&lt;br /&gt;Lights are bright.&lt;br /&gt;Jazz is king.&lt;br /&gt;Parties are wild.&lt;br /&gt;And the dead are coming...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After battling a supernatural sleeping sickness that early claimed two of their own, the Diviners have had enough of lies. They're more determined than ever to uncover the mystery behind their extraordinary powers, even as they face off against an all-new terror. Out on Ward's Island, far from the city's bustle, sits a mental hospital haunted by the lost souls of people long forgotten--ghosts who have unusual and dangerous ties to the man in the stovepipe hat, also known as the King of Crows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With terrible accounts of murder and possession flooding in from all over, and New York City on the verge of panic, the Diviners must band together and brave the sinister ghosts invading the asylum, a fight that will bring them fact-to-face with the King of Crows. But as the explosive secrets of the past come to light, loyalties and friendships will be tested, love will hang in the balance, and the Diviners will question all that they've ever known. All the while, malevolent forces gather from every corner in a battle for the very soul of a nation--a fight that could claim the Diviners themselves.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Mortal Instruments continues—and so do the thrills and danger for Jace, Clary, and Simon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What price is too high to pay, even for love? When Jace and Clary meet again, Clary is horrified to discover that the demon Lilith’s magic has bound her beloved Jace together with her evil brother Sebastian, and that Jace has become a servant of evil. The Clave is out to destroy Sebastian, but there is no way to harm one boy without destroying the other. As Alec, Magnus, Simon, and Isabelle wheedle and bargain with Seelies, demons, and the merciless Iron Sisters to try to save Jace, Clary plays a dangerous game of her own. The price of losing is not just her own life, but Jace’s soul. She’s willing to do anything for Jace, but can she still trust him? Or is he truly lost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love. Blood. Betrayal. Revenge. Darkness threatens to claim the Shadowhunters in the harrowing fifth book of the Mortal Instruments series.</description>

  <description>In 1872, New Orleans is a city ruled by the dead. But to seventeen-year-old Celine Rousseau, New Orleans provides her a refuge after she's forced to flee her life as a dressmaker in Paris. Taken in by the sisters of the Ursuline convent along with six other girls, Celine quickly becomes enamored with the vibrant city from the music to the food to the soirées and—especially—to the danger. She soon becomes embroiled in the city's glitzy underworld, known as La Cour des Lions, after catching the eye of the group's leader, the enigmatic Sébastien Saint Germain. When the body of one of the girls from the convent is found in the lair of La Cour des Lions, Celine battles her attraction to him and suspicions about Sébastien's guilt along with the shame of her own horrible secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When more bodies are discovered, each crime more gruesome than the last, Celine and New Orleans become gripped by the terror of a serial killer on the loose—one Celine is sure has set her in his sights . . . and who may even be the young man who has stolen her heart. As the murders continue to go unsolved, Celine takes matters into her own hands and soon uncovers something even more shocking: an age-old feud from the darkest creatures of the underworld reveals a truth about Celine she always suspected simmered just beneath the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once a sultry romance and a thrilling murder mystery, master storyteller Renée Ahdieh embarks on her most potent fantasy series yet: &lt;i&gt;The Beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie worries he’ll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened.</description>

  <description>Danger and betrayal, love and loss, secrets and enchantment are woven together in the breathtaking finale to the #1 New York Times bestselling Infernal Devices Trilogy, prequel to the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE INFERNAL DEVICES WILL NEVER STOP COMING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A net of shadows begins to tighten around the Shadowhunters of the London Institute. Mortmain plans to use his Infernal Devices, an army of pitiless automatons, to destroy the Shadowhunters. He needs only one last item to complete his plan: he needs Tessa Gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Branwell, head of the London Institute, is desperate to find Mortmain before he strikes. But when Mortmain abducts Tessa, the boys who lay equal claim to her heart, Jem and Will, will do anything to save her. For though Tessa and Jem are now engaged, Will is as much in love with her as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As those who love Tessa rally to rescue her from Mortmain’s clutches, Tessa realizes that the only person who can save her is herself. But can a single girl, even one who can command the power of angels, face down an entire army?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger and betrayal, secrets and enchantment, and the tangled threads of love and loss intertwine as the Shadowhunters are pushed to the very brink of destruction in the breathtaking conclusion to the Infernal Devices trilogy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lara Jean is having &lt;i&gt;the best&lt;/i&gt; senior year.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there’s still so much to look forward to: a class trip to New York City, prom with her boyfriend Peter, Beach Week after graduation, and her dad’s wedding to Ms. Rothschild. Then she’ll be off to college with Peter, at a school close enough for her to come home and bake chocolate chip cookies on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life couldn’t be more perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what Lara Jean thinks . . . until she gets some unexpected news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the girl who dreads change must rethink all her plans—but when your heart and your head are saying two different things, which one should you listen to?</description>

  <description>The last thing Jamie Watson wants is a rugby scholarship to Sherringford, a Connecticut prep school just an hour away from his estranged father. But that’s not the only complication: Sherringford is also home to Charlotte Holmes, the famous detective’s great-great-great-granddaughter, who has inherited not only Sherlock’s genius but also his volatile temperament. From everything Jamie has heard about Charlotte, it seems safer to admire her from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they meet, there’s a tense energy between them, and they seem more destined to be rivals than anything else. But when a Sherringford student dies under suspicious circumstances, ripped straight from the most terrifying of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Jamie can no longer afford to keep his distance. Jamie and Charlotte are being framed for murder, and only Charlotte can clear their names. But danger is mounting and nowhere is safe—and the only people they can trust are each other.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was an awesome start to a gritty, dark, sci-fi graphic novel series. I loved how creative and crazy all of the different alien creatures were. And at the heart of the story is a family just trying to survive in an inter-galactic war that is trying to tear them apart. I'm excited to continue...]]>

  <description>A sweeping, evocative epic of two women's intertwined fates and their search for identity, that moves from the lavish parlors of Shanghai courtesans to the fog-shrouded mountains of a remote Chinese village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning more than forty years and two continents, The Valley of Amazement resurrects pivotal episodes in history: from the collapse of China's last imperial dynasty, to the rise of the Republic, the explosive growth of lucrative foreign trade and anti-foreign sentiment, to the inner workings of courtesan houses and the lives of the foreign "Shanghailanders" living in the International Settlement, both erased by World War II. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply evocative narrative about the profound connections between mothers and daughters, The Valley of Amazement returns readers to the compelling territory of Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. With her characteristic insight and humor, she conjures a story of inherited trauma, desire and deception, and the power and stubbornness of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now a major motion picture starring Alfre Woodard, Jessica Collins, John Heard, Jacinda Barrett, Cloris Leachman, and Talitha Bateman—in theaters October 2017!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From acclaimed author Sarah Weeks comes a touching coming-of-age story about a young girl who goes on a cross-country journey to discover the truth about her parents, which the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;called "a remarkable novel." Perfect for fans of Rebecca Stead's &lt;em&gt;When You Reach Me&lt;/em&gt; and Ali Benjamin's &lt;em&gt;The Thing About Jellyfish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn't know when her birthday is or who her father is. In fact, everything about Heidi and her mentally disabled mother's past is a mystery. When a strange word in her mother's vocabulary begins to haunt her, Heidi sets out on a cross-country journey in search of the secrets of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far away from home, pieces of her puzzling history come together. But it isn't until she learns to accept not knowing that Heidi truly arrives.</description>

  <description>When New Yorker Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home and quality time with the man she hopes to marry. But Nick has failed to give his girlfriend a few key details. One, that his childhood home looks like a palace; two, that he grew up riding in more private planes than cars; and three, that he just happens to be the country’s most eligible bachelor. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; On Nick’s arm, Rachel may as well have a target on her back the second she steps off the plane, and soon, her relaxed vacation turns into an obstacle course of old money, new money, nosy relatives, and scheming social climbers.</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A glorious empire . . .&lt;br /&gt;A desperate quest . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chaol Westfall and Nesryn Faliq have arrived in the shining city of Antica to forge an alliance with the Khagan of the Southern Continent, whose vast armies are Erilea's last hope. But they have also come to Antica for another purpose: to seek healing at the famed Torre Cesme for the wounds Chaol received in Rifthold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After enduring unspeakable horrors as a child, Yrene Towers has no desire to help the young lord from Adarlan, let alone heal him. Yet she has sworn an oath to assist those in need—and will honor it. But Lord Westfall carries shadows from his own past, and Yrene soon comes to realize they could engulf them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sweeping parallel novel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Empire of Storms&lt;/i&gt;, Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene will have to draw on every scrap of their resilience if they wish to save their friends. But while they become entangled in the political webs of the khaganate, deep in the shadows of mighty mountains where warriors soar on legendary ruks, long-awaited answers slumber. Answers that might offer their world a chance at survival—or doom them all . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kingdoms will collide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long path to the throne has only just begun for Aelin Galathynius as war looms on the horizon. Loyalties have been broken and bought, friends have been lost and gained, and those who possess magic find themselves at odds with those who don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her heart sworn to the warrior-prince by her side, and her fealty pledged to the people she is determined to save, Aelin will delve into the depths of her power to protect those she loves. But as monsters emerge from the horrors of the past, and dark forces become poised to claim her world, the only chance for salvation will lie in a desperate quest that may mark the end of everything Aelin holds dear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this breathtaking fifth installment of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Throne of Glass series, Aelin will have to choose what—and who—to sacrifice if she's to keep the world of Erilea from breaking apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Queen has returned.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone Celaena Sardothien loves has been taken from her. But she’s at last returned to the empire—for vengeance, to rescue her once-glorious kingdom, and to confront the shadows of her past…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has embraced her identity as Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen. But before she can reclaim her throne, she must fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will fight for her cousin, a warrior prepared to die for her. She will fight for her friend, a young man trapped in an unspeakable prison. And she will fight for her people, enslaved to a brutal king and awaiting their lost queen’s triumphant return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth volume in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series continues Celaena’s epic journey and builds to a passionate, agonizing crescendo that might just shatter her world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celaena Sardothien has survived deadly contests and shattering heartbreak—but at an unspeakable cost.

To defeat them, Celaena must find the strength to not only fight her inner demons but to battle the evil that is about to be unleashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The king's assassin takes on an even greater destiny and burns brighter than ever before in this follow-up to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Crown of Midnight&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"A line that should never be crossed is about to be breached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It puts this entire castle in jeopardy—and the life of your friend."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the throne of glass rules a king with a fist of iron and a soul as black as pitch. Assassin Celaena Sardothien won a brutal contest to become his Champion. Yet Celaena is far from loyal to the crown. She hides her secret vigilantly; she knows that the man she serves is bent on evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping up the deadly charade becomes increasingly difficult when Celaena realizes she is not the only one seeking justice. As she tries to untangle the mysteries buried deep within the glass castle, her closest relationships suffer. It seems no one is above questioning her allegiances—not the Crown Prince Dorian; not Chaol, the Captain of the Guard; not even her best friend, Nehemia, a foreign princess with a rebel heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one terrible night, the secrets they have all been keeping lead to an unspeakable tragedy. As Celaena's world shatters, she will be forced to give up the very thing most precious to her and decide once and for all where her true loyalties lie... and whom she is ultimately willing to fight for.</description>

  <description>Twin sisters Jack and Jill were seventeen when they found their way home and were packed off to Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the story of what happened first…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline was her mother’s perfect daughter—polite and quiet, always dressed as a princess. If her mother was sometimes a little strict, it’s because crafting the perfect daughter takes discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian was her father’s perfect daughter—adventurous, thrill-seeking, and a bit of a tom-boy. He really would have preferred a son, but you work with what you've got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were five when they learned that grown-ups can’t be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were twelve when they walked down the impossible staircase and discovered that the pretense of love can never be enough to prepare you a life filled with magic in a land filled with mad scientists and death and &lt;i&gt;choices&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Solicitations&lt;br /&gt;No Visitors&lt;br /&gt;No Quests&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere... else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy tumbled once, but now she’s back. The things she’s experienced... they change a person. The children under Miss West’s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nancy’s arrival marks a change at the Home. There’s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it’s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter the cost.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical. But when an email falls into the wrong hands, his secret is at risk of being thrust into the spotlight. Now Simon is actually being blackmailed: if he doesn’t play wingman for class clown Martin, his sexual identity will become everyone’s business. Worse, the privacy of Blue, the pen name of the boy he’s been emailing, will be compromised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some messy dynamics emerging in his once tight-knit group of friends, and his email correspondence with Blue growing more flirtatious every day, Simon’s junior year has suddenly gotten all kinds of complicated. Now, change-averse Simon has to find a way to step out of his comfort zone before he’s pushed out—without alienating his friends, compromising himself, or fumbling a shot at happiness with the most confusing, adorable guy he’s never met.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Adam Silvera reminds us that there’s no life without death and no love without loss in this devastating yet uplifting story about two people whose lives change over the course of one unforgettable day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 5, a little after midnight, Death-Cast calls Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio to give them some bad news: They’re going to die today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mateo and Rufus are total strangers, but, for different reasons, they’re both looking to make a new friend on their End Day. The good news: There’s an app for that. It’s called the Last Friend, and through it, Rufus and Mateo are about to meet up for one last great adventure—to live a lifetime in a single day.</description>

  <description>No one expects a princess to be brutal. And Lada Dragwlya likes it that way. Ever since she and her gentle younger brother, Radu, were wrenched from their homeland of Wallachia and abandoned by their father to be raised in the Ottoman courts, Lada has known that being ruthless is the key to survival. She and Radu are doomed to act as pawns in a vicious game, an unseen sword hovering over their every move. For the lineage that makes them special also makes them targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lada despises the Ottomans and bides her time, planning her vengeance for the day when she can return to Wallachia and claim her birthright. Radu longs only for a place where he feels safe. And when they meet Mehmed, the defiant and lonely son of the sultan, Radu feels that he’s made a true friend—and Lada wonders if she’s finally found someone worthy of her passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mehmed is heir to the very empire that Lada has sworn to fight against—and that Radu now considers home. Together, Lada, Radu, and Mehmed form a toxic triangle that strains the bonds of love and loyalty to the breaking point.</description>

  <description>Vika Andreyeva can summon the snow and turn ash into gold. Nikolai Karimov can see through walls and conjure bridges out of thin air. They are enchanters—the only two in Russia—and with the Ottoman Empire and the Kazakhs threatening, the tsar needs a powerful enchanter by his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so he initiates the Crown’s Game, an ancient duel of magical skill—the greatest test an enchanter will ever know. The victor becomes the Imperial Enchanter and the tsar’s most respected adviser. The defeated is sentenced to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised on tiny Ovchinin Island her whole life, Vika is eager for the chance to show off her talent in the grand capital of Saint Petersburg. But can she kill another enchanter—even when his magic calls to her like nothing else ever has?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Nikolai, an orphan, the Crown’s Game is the chance of a lifetime. But his deadly opponent is a force to be reckoned with—beautiful, whip-smart, imaginative—and he can’t stop thinking about her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when Pasha, Nikolai’s best friend and heir to the throne, also starts to fall for the mysterious enchantress, Nikolai must defeat the girl they both love…or be killed himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long-buried secrets emerge, threatening the future of the empire, it becomes dangerously clear—the Crown’s Game is not one to lose.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this sequel to the instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Furyborn&lt;/i&gt;, two queens, separated by a thousand years, connected by secrets and lies, must continue their fight amid deadly plots and unthinkable betrayals that will test their strength—and their hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rielle Dardenne has been anointed Sun Queen, but her trials are far from over. The Gate keeping the angels at bay is falling. To repair it, Rielle must collect the seven hidden castings of the saints. Meanwhile, to help her prince and love Audric protect Celdaria, Rielle must spy on the angel Corien—but his promises of freedom and power may prove too tempting to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centuries later, Eliana Ferracora grapples with her new reality: She is the Sun Queen, humanity's long-awaited savior. But fear of corruption—fear of becoming another Rielle—keeps Eliana's power dangerous and unpredictable. Hunted by all, racing against time to save her dying friend Navi, Eliana must decide how to wear a crown she never wanted—by embracing her mother's power, or rejecting it forever.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A ruthless young assassin's journey for revenge comes to a stunning end in the conclusion of this acclaimed epic fantasy trilogy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Republic of Itreya is in chaos. Mia Corvere has assassinated Cardinal Duomo and rumors of Consul Scaeva’s death ripple through the street of Godsgrave like wildfire. But buried beneath those same streets, deep in the ancient city’s bones, lies a secret that will change the Republic forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia and her brother Jonnen must journey through the depths of the ancient metropolis. Their quest will take them through the Godsgrave underdark, across the Sea of Swords, back to the library of the Quiet Mountain and the poisoned blades of Mia’s old mentors, and at last the fabled Crown of the Moon. There, Mia will at last discover the origins of the darkin, and learn the destiny that lies in store for her and her world. But with the three suns now in descent, and Truedark on the horizon, will she survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and internationally bestselling author Jay Kristoff’s writing has been praised by critics and readers alike and has won many awards, including five Aurealis Awards, an ABIA, and David Gemmell Morningstar and Legend awards.</description>

  <description>Weaving a brilliant latticework of family legend, loss, and love, Téa Obreht, the youngest of &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;’s twenty best American fiction writers under forty, has spun a timeless novel that will establish her as one of the most vibrant, original authors of her generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a Balkan country mending from years of conflict, Natalia, a young doctor, arrives on a mission of mercy at an orphanage by the sea. By the time she and her lifelong friend Zóra begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather’s recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather’s final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with “the deathless man,” a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness. “These stories,” Natalia comes to understand, “run like secret rivers through all the other stories” of her grandfather’s life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;No one believes in them. But soon no one will forget them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1889. The city is on the cusp of industry and power, and the Exposition Universelle has breathed new life into the streets and dredged up ancient secrets. Here, no one keeps tabs on dark truths better than treasure-hunter and wealthy hotelier Séverin Montagnet-Alarie. When the elite, ever-powerful Order of Babel coerces him to help them on a mission, Séverin is offered a treasure that he never imagined: his true inheritance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hunt down the ancient artifact the Order seeks, Séverin calls upon a band of unlikely experts: An engineer with a debt to pay. A historian banished from his home. A dancer with a sinister past. And a brother in arms if not blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they will join Séverin as he explores the dark, glittering heart of Paris. What they find might change the course of history--but only if they can stay alive.</description>

  <description>Simon Lewis has been a human and a vampire, and now he is becoming a Shadowhunter. But the events of &lt;i&gt;City of Heavenly Fire&lt;/i&gt; left him stripped of his memories, and Simon isn’t sure who he is anymore. He knows he was friends with Clary, and that he convinced the total goddess Isabelle Lightwood to go out with him…but he doesn’t know how. And when Clary and Isabelle look at him, expecting him to be a man he doesn’t remember…Simon can’t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the Shadowhunter Academy reopens, Simon throws himself into this new world of demon-hunting, determined to find himself again. His new self. Whomever this new Simon might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Academy is a Shadowhunter institution, which means it has some problems. Like the fact that non-Shadowhunter students have to live in the basement. And that differences—like being a former vampire—are greatly looked down upon. At least Simon is trained in weaponry—even if it’s only from hours of playing D&amp;amp;D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Simon on his journey to become a Shadowhunter, and learn about the Academy’s illustrious history along the way, through guest lecturers such as Jace Herondale, Tessa Gray, and Magnus Bane. These ten short stories give an epilogue to the Mortal Instruments series and provide glimpses of what’s in store in the Dark Artifices.</description>

  <description>The battle for the Crown has begun, but which of the three sisters will prevail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the unforgettable events of the Quickening behind them and the Ascension Year underway, all bets are off. Katharine, once the weak and feeble sister, is stronger than ever before. Arsinoe, after discovering the truth about her powers, must figure out how to make her secret talent work in her favor without anyone finding out. And Mirabella, once thought to be the strongest sister of all and the certain Queen Crowned, faces attacks like never before—ones that put those around her in danger she can’t seem to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this enthralling sequel to Kendare Blake’s New York Times bestselling &lt;i&gt;Three Dark Crowns&lt;/i&gt;, Fennbirn’s deadliest queens must face the one thing standing in their way of the crown: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kendare Blake returns with the highly anticipated third book in the Three Dark Crowns series! And while Arsinoe, Mirabella, and Katharine all have their own scores to settle, they aren’t the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; queens stirring things up on Fennbirn Island.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queen Katharine has waited her entire life to wear the crown. But now that she finally has it, the murmurs of dissent grow louder by the day. There’s also the alarming issue of whether or not her sisters are actually dead—or if they’re waiting in the wings to usurp the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirabella and Arsinoe &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; alive, but in hiding on the mainland and dealing with a nightmare of their own: being visited repeatedly by a specter they think might be the fabled Blue Queen. Though she says nothing, her rotting, bony finger pointing out to sea is clear enough: return to Fennbirn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jules, too, is in a strange place—in disguise. And her only confidants, a war-gifted girl named Emilia and her oracle friend Mathilde, are urging her to take on a role she can’t imagine filling: a legion-cursed queen who will lead a rebel army to Katharine’s doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an uprising that the mysterious Blue Queen may have more to do with than anyone could have guessed—or expected.</description>

  <description>Galaxy “Alex” Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale’s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. By age twenty, in fact, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she’s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The mesmerizing adult debut from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Leigh Bardugo.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The final battle is here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aelin Galathynius has vowed to save her people―but at a tremendous cost. Locked within an iron coffin by the Queen of the Fae, Aelin must draw upon her fiery will as she endures months of torture. The knowledge that yielding to Maeve will doom those she loves keeps her from breaking, but her resolve is unraveling with each passing day…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Aelin captured, friends and allies are scattered to different fates. Some bonds will grow even deeper, while others will be severed forever. As destinies weave together at last, all must fight if Erilea is to have any hope of salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years in the making, Sarah J. Maas's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Throne of Glass series draws to an explosive conclusion as Aelin fights to save herself―and the promise of a better world.</description>

  <description>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her younger brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</description>

We see her grapple with the new found power, and I LOVED guessing at every turn who was going to betray who. I absolutely adore Jude as a character - she is power...]]>

  <description>The story is supposed to be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon Snow did everything he was supposed to do. He beat the villain. He won the war. He even fell in love. Now comes the good part, right? Now comes the happily ever after… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So why can’t Simon Snow get off the couch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he needs, according to his best friend, is a change of scenery. He just needs to see himself in a new light…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s how Simon and Penny and Baz end up in a vintage convertible, tearing across the American West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They find trouble, of course. (Dragons, vampires, skunk-headed things with shotguns.) And they get lost. They get so lost, they start to wonder whether they ever knew where they were headed in the first place… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Wayward Son&lt;/i&gt;, Rainbow Rowell has written a book for everyone who ever wondered what happened to the Chosen One after he saved the day. And a book for everyone who was ever more curious about the second kiss than the first. It’s another helping of sour cherry scones with an absolutely decadent amount of butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Simon Snow. Your hero’s journey might be over – but your life has just begun.</description>

  <description>Originally performed at the Kennedy Center for the unveiling of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and later as a tribute to Walter Dean Myers, this stirring and inspirational poem is &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and National Book Award finalist Jason Reynolds’s rallying cry to the dreamers of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For Every One &lt;/i&gt;is just that: for every one. For every one person. For every one dream. But especially for every one kid. The kids who dream of being better than they are. Kids who dream of doing more than they almost dare to dream. Kids who are like Jason Reynolds, a self-professed dreamer. Jason does not claim to know how to make dreams come true; he has, in fact, been fighting on the front line of his own battle to make his own dreams a reality. He expected to make it when he was sixteen. Then eighteen. Then twenty-five. Now, some of those expectations have been realized. But others, the most important ones, lay ahead, and a lot of them involve kids, how to inspire them. All the kids who are scared to dream, or don’t know how to dream, or don’t dare to dream because they’ve NEVER seen a dream come true. Jason wants kids to know that dreams take time. They involve countless struggles. But no matter how many times a dreamer gets beat down, the drive and the passion and the hope never fully extinguish—because just having the dream is the start you need, or you won’t get anywhere anyway, and that is when you have to take a leap of faith.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A pitch perfect graduation, baby, or love my kid gift.</description>

Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova's amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling's secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction—and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she’s fighting for.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land, all while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. But she can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her—or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

  <description>Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most demeaning. This year, there's a ninth. And instead of paper, she's made of fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this richly developed fantasy, Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. She lives in a remote village with her father, where the decade-old trauma of watching her mother snatched by royal guards for an unknown fate still haunts her. Now, the guards are back and this time it's Lei they're after -- the girl with the golden eyes whose rumored beauty has piqued the king's interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learns the skills and charm that befit a king's consort. There, she does the unthinkable -- she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world's entire way of life. Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.</description>

  <description>In the three kingdoms of Mytica, magic has long been forgotten. And while hard-won peace has reigned for centuries, a deadly unrest now simmers below the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the rulers of each kingdom grapple for power, the lives of their subjects are brutally transformed... and four key players, royals and rebels alike, find their fates forever intertwined. Cleo, Jonas, Lucia, and Magnus are caught in a dizzying world of treacherous betrayals, shocking murders, secret alliances, and even unforeseen love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The only outcome that's certain is that kingdoms will fall. Who will emerge triumphant when all they know has collapsed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the eve of war.... Choose your side.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Princess:&lt;/b&gt; Raised in pampered luxury, Cleo must now embark on a rough and treacherous journey into enemy territory in search of magic long thought extinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rebel:&lt;/b&gt; Jonas, enraged at injustice, lashes out against the forces of oppression that have kept his country cruelly impoverished. To his shock, he finds himself the leader of a people's revolution centuries in the making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sorceress:&lt;/b&gt; Lucia, adopted at birth into the royal family, discovers the truth about her past—and the supernatural legacy she is destined to wield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heir:&lt;/b&gt; Bred for aggression and trained to conquer, firstborn son Magnus begins to realize that the heart can be more lethal than the sword....</description>

      <![CDATA[Listened on audio! 🎧<br /><br />This was a good start to a YA high fantasy series! I've heard this series being compared to a YA version of Game of Thrones, and I'd have to say that's pretty accurate. I liked the multiple perspectives and how we got to see the conflict between nations from all si...]]>

  <description>Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a &lt;i&gt;complete git&lt;/i&gt;, but he's probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here — it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Carry On - The Rise and Fall of Simon Snow&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

Now its fate may rest on the shoulders of one lonely refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Starkov has never been good at anything. But when her regiment is attacked on the Fold and her best friend is brutally injured, Alina reveals a dormant power that saves his life—a power that could be the key to setting her war-ravaged country free. Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . and the secrets of her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shadow and Bone is the first installment in Leigh Bardugo's Grisha Trilogy.</description>

      <![CDATA[My two favorite parts of this book, hands down, were the world and the Darkling. I loved the Russian-inspired world, a well defined magic system, and the dark fairytale-esque vibe of the novel. The Darkling as a character was so intriguing to me - he's manipulative and evil but I can't wait to se...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There will be plenty of time for me to beat him soundly once I’ve gotten what I came for.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent on a mission to retrieve an ancient hidden map—the key to a legendary treasure trove—seventeen-year-old pirate captain Alosa deliberately allows herself to be captured by her enemies, giving her the perfect opportunity to search their ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than a match for the ruthless pirate crew, Alosa has only one thing standing between her and the map: her captor, the unexpectedly clever and unfairly attractive first mate, Riden. But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bound as one to love, honor, or burn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago, Louise le Blanc fled her coven and took shelter in the city of Cesarine, forsaking all magic and living off whatever she could steal. There, witches like Lou are hunted. They are feared. And they are burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to the Church as a Chasseur, Reid Diggory has lived his life by one principle: &lt;i&gt;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&lt;/i&gt; His path was never meant to cross with Lou's, but a wicked stunt forces them into an impossible union—holy matrimony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war between witches and Church is an ancient one, and Lou's most dangerous enemies bring a fate worse than fire. Unable to ignore her growing feelings, yet powerless to change what she is, a choice must be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And love makes fools of us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780062878021.

  <description>A skilled painter must stand up to the ancient power of the faerie courts—even as she falls in love with a faerie prince—in this gorgeous debut novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isobel is a prodigy portrait artist with a dangerous set of clients: the sinister fair folk, immortal creatures who cannot bake bread, weave cloth, or put a pen to paper without crumbling to dust. They crave human Craft with a terrible thirst, and Isobel’s paintings are highly prized. But when she receives her first royal patron—Rook, the autumn prince—she makes a terrible mistake. She paints mortal sorrow in his eyes—a weakness that could cost him his life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Furious and devastated, Rook spirits her away to the autumnlands to stand trial for her crime. Waylaid by the Wild Hunt’s ghostly hounds, the tainted influence of the Alder King, and hideous monsters risen from barrow mounds, Isobel and Rook depend on one another for survival. Their alliance blossoms into trust, then love—and that love violates the fair folks’ ruthless laws. Now both of their lives are forfeit, unless Isobel can use her skill as an artist to fight the fairy courts. Because secretly, her Craft represents a threat the fair folk have never faced in all the millennia of their unchanging lives: for the first time, her portraits have the power to make them feel.</description>

  <description>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>They call her Traitor Kate. It’s a title Kate Brighton inherited from her father after he tried to assassinate the high king years ago. Now Kate lives as an outcast, clinging to the fringes of society as a member of the Relay, the imperial courier service. Only those most skilled in riding and bow hunting ride for the Relay; and only the fastest survive, for when dark falls, the nightdrakes—deadly flightless dragons—come out to hunt. Fortunately, Kate has a secret edge: she is a wilder, born with magic that allows her to influence the minds of animals. But it’s this magic that she needs to keep hidden, as being a wilder is forbidden, punishable by death or exile. And it’s this magic that leads her to a caravan massacred by nightdrakes in broad daylight—the only survivor her childhood friend, her first love, the boy she swore to forget, the boy who broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high king’s second son, Corwin Tormane, never asked to lead. Even as he waits for the uror—the once-in-a-generation ritual to decide which of the king’s children will succeed him—he knows it’s always been his brother who will assume the throne. And that’s fine by him. He’d rather spend his days away from the palace, away from the sight of his father, broken with sickness from the attempt on his life. But the peacekeeping tour Corwin is on has given him too much time to reflect upon the night he saved his father’s life—the night he condemned the would-be killer to death and lost the girl he loved. Which is why he takes it on himself to investigate rumors of unrest in one of the remote city-states, only for his caravan to be attacked—and for him to be saved by Kate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their paths once more entangled, Kate and Corwin have to put the past behind them. The threat of drakes who attack in the daylight is only the beginning of a darker menace stirring in the kingdom—one whose origins have dire implications for Kate’s father’s attack upon the king and will thrust them into the middle of a brewing civil war in the kingdom of Rime.</description>

  <description>Henry “Monty” Montague was born and bred to be a gentleman, but he was never one to be tamed. The finest boarding schools in England and the constant disapproval of his father haven’t been able to curb any of his roguish passions—not for gambling halls, late nights spent with a bottle of spirits, or waking up in the arms of women or men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Monty embarks on his Grand Tour of Europe, his quest for a life filled with pleasure and vice is in danger of coming to an end. Not only does his father expect him to take over the family’s estate upon his return, but Monty is also nursing an impossible crush on his best friend and traveling companion, Percy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it isn’t in Monty’s nature to give up. Even with his younger sister, Felicity, in tow, he vows to make this yearlong escapade one last hedonistic hurrah and flirt with Percy from Paris to Rome. But when one of Monty’s reckless decisions turns their trip abroad into a harrowing manhunt that spans across Europe, it calls into question everything he knows, including his relationship with the boy he adores.</description>

  <description>Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian’s secret weapon (and best friend) is the brilliant dressmaker Frances―one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect a friend? Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, &lt;i&gt;The Prince and the Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; will steal your heart.</description>

  <description>Nikolai Lantsov has always had a gift for the impossible. No one knows what he endured in his country’s bloody civil war—and he intends to keep it that way. Now, as enemies gather at his weakened borders, the young king must find a way to refill Ravka’s coffers, forge new alliances, and stop a rising threat to the once-great Grisha Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet with every day a dark magic within him grows stronger, threatening to destroy all he has built. With the help of a young monk and a legendary Grisha Squaller, Nikolai will journey to the places in Ravka where the deepest magic survives to vanquish the terrible legacy inside him. He will risk everything to save his country and himself. But some secrets aren’t meant to stay buried—and some wounds aren’t meant to heal.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23599075-throne-of-glass" rel="nofollow"&gt; ISBN13: 9781599906959&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.</description>

  <description>In a land where three suns almost never set, a fledgling killer joins a school of assassins, seeking vengeance against the powers who destroyed her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter of an executed traitor, Mia Corvere is barely able to escape her father’s failed rebellion with her life. Alone and friendless, she hides in a city built from the bones of a dead god, hunted by the Senate and her father’s former comrades. But her gift for speaking with the shadows leads her to the door of a retired killer, and a future she never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Mia is apprenticed to the deadliest flock of assassins in the entire Republic—the Red Church. If she bests her fellow students in contests of steel, poison and the subtle arts, she’ll be inducted among the Blades of the Lady of Blessed Murder, and one step closer to the vengeance she desires. But a killer is loose within the Church’s halls, the bloody secrets of Mia’s past return to haunt her, and a plot to bring down the entire congregation is unfolding in the shadows she so loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she even survive to initiation, let alone have her revenge?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From bestselling author Jon Krakauer, a stark, powerful, meticulously reported narrative about a series of sexual assaults at the University of Montana ­— stories that illuminate the human drama behind the national plague of campus rape.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Missoula, Montana, is a typical college town, with a highly regarded state university, bucolic surroundings, a lively social scene, and an excellent football team — the Grizzlies — with a rabid fan base. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year. Krakauer’s devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault — and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman’s entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In Missoula, Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula — the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor’s office and successfully defended the Grizzlies’ star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman’s case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Krakauer’s dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention. They are the victims of a terrible crime and deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When kingdom come, there will be one.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every generation on the island of Fennbirn, a set of triplets is born—three queens, all equal heirs to the crown and each possessor of a coveted magic. Mirabella is a fierce elemental, able to spark hungry flames or vicious storms at the snap of her fingers. Katharine is a poisoner, one who can ingest the deadliest poisons without so much as a stomachache. Arsinoe, a naturalist, is said to have the ability to bloom the reddest rose and control the fiercest of lions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But becoming the Queen Crowned isn’t solely a matter of royal birth. Each sister has to fight for it. And it’s not just a game of win or lose…it’s life or death. The night the sisters turn sixteen, the battle begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last queen standing gets the crown. </description>

  <description>Raised to be a warrior, seventeen-year-old Eelyn fights alongside her Aska clansmen in an ancient rivalry against the Riki clan. Her life is brutal but simple: fight and survive. Until the day she sees the impossible on the battlefield—her brother, fighting with the enemy—the brother she watched die five years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with her brother's betrayal, she must survive the winter in the mountains with the Riki, in a village where every neighbor is an enemy, every battle scar possibly one she delivered. But when the Riki village is raided by a ruthless clan thought to be a legend, Eelyn is even more desperate to get back to her beloved family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is given no choice but to trust Fiske, her brother’s friend, who sees her as a threat. They must do the impossible: unite the clans to fight together, or risk being slaughtered one by one. Driven by a love for her clan and her growing love for Fiske, Eelyn must confront her own definition of loyalty and family while daring to put her faith in the people she’s spent her life hating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part Wonder Woman, part &lt;i&gt;Vikings&lt;/i&gt;—and all heart.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The stunningly original, must-read fantasy of 2018 follows two fiercely independent young women, centuries apart, who hold the power to save their world...or doom it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When assassins ambush her best friend, Rielle Dardenne risks everything to save him, exposing herself as one of a pair of prophesied queens: a queen of light, and a queen of blood. To prove she is the Sun Queen, Rielle must endure seven elemental magic trials. If she fails, she will be executed...unless the trials kill her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thousand years later, the legend of Queen Rielle is a fairy tale to Eliana Ferracora. A bounty hunter for the Undying Empire, Eliana believes herself untouchable--until her mother vanishes. To find her, Eliana joins a rebel captain and discovers that the evil at the empire's heart is more terrible than she ever imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rielle and Eliana fight in a cosmic war that spans millennia, their stories intersect, and the shocking connections between them ultimately determine the fate of their world--and of each other.</description>

      <![CDATA[My second time reading was just as amazing as the first! This book is seriously one of my favorite fantasies ever.<br /><br />I love the juxtaposition of Rielle and Eliana's stories. This is both a villain origin story and a heroine story wrapped in one. Both of them are angry, powerful girls who...]]>

  <description>In this stunning bridge book between &lt;i&gt;Cress&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Winter&lt;/i&gt; in the bestselling Lunar Chronicles, Queen Levana’s story is finally told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mirror, mirror on the wall,&lt;br /&gt;Who is the fairest of them all?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fans of the Lunar Chronicles know Queen Levana as a ruler who uses her “glamour” to gain power. But long before she crossed paths with Cinder, Scarlet, and Cress, Levana lived a very different story – a story that has never been told . . . until now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marissa Meyer spins yet another unforgettable tale about love and war, deceit and death. This extraordinary book includes full-color art and an excerpt from &lt;i&gt;Winter&lt;/i&gt;, the next book in the Lunar Chronicles series.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was a fun little side story for the Lunar Chronicles, but definitely not something you need to pick up if you’re not totally invested in the series. Overall, it was a quick read and it was fun to delve into the mindset of the villain. ]]>

  <description>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.</description>

  <description>Welcome to the world of the Grisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaz Brekker and his crew of deadly outcasts have just pulled off a heist so daring even they didn't think they'd survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from around the world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals and new enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will decide the fate of the Grisha world.</description>

      <![CDATA[I LOVED EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT THIS BOOK.<br /><br />The characters are so distinct and intense.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Would you trade your soul mate for your soul?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Shadowhunter’s life is bound by duty. Constrained by honor. The word of a Shadowhunter is a solemn pledge, and no vow is more sacred than the vow that binds &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, warrior partners—sworn to fight together, die together, but never to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Carstairs has learned that the love she shares with her &lt;i&gt;parabatai&lt;/i&gt;, Julian Blackthorn, isn’t just forbidden—it could destroy them both. She knows she should run from Julian. But how can she when the Blackthorns are threatened by enemies on all sides?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only hope is the Black Volume of the Dead, a spell book of terrible power. Everyone wants it. Only the Blackthorns can find it. Spurred on by a dark bargain with the Seelie Queen, Emma; her best friend, Cristina; and Mark and Julian Blackthorn journey into the Courts of Faerie, where glittering revels hide bloody danger and no promise can be trusted. Meanwhile, rising tension between Shadowhunters and Downworlders has produced the Cohort, an extremist group of Shadowhunters dedicated to registering Downworlders and “unsuitable” Nephilim. They’ll do anything in their power to expose Julian’s secrets and take the Los Angeles Institute for their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Downworlders turn against the Clave, a new threat rises in the form of the Lord of Shadows—the Unseelie King, who sends his greatest warriors to slaughter those with Blackthorn blood and seize the Black Volume. As dangers close in, Julian devises a risky scheme that depends on the cooperation of an unpredictable enemy. But success may come with a price he and Emma cannot even imagine, one that will bring with it a reckoning of blood that could have repercussions for everyone and everything they hold dear.</description>

But there's nothing mystical or magical about Dustwalk, the dead-end town that Amani can't wait to escape from. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Destined to wind up "wed or dead," Amani’s counting on her sharpshooting skills to get her out of Dustwalk. When she meets Jin, a mysterious and devastatingly handsome foreigner, in a shooting contest, she figures he’s the perfect escape route. But in all her years spent dreaming of leaving home, she never imagined she'd gallop away on a mythical horse, fleeing the murderous Sultan's army, with a fugitive who's wanted for treason. And she'd never have predicted she'd fall in love with him...or that he'd help her unlock the powerful truth of who she really is.</description>

  <description>Rowan has gone rogue, and has taken it upon himself to put the Scythedom through a trial by fire. Literally. In the year since Winter Conclave, he has gone off-grid, and has been striking out against corrupt scythes—not only in MidMerica, but across the entire continent. He is a dark folk hero now—“Scythe Lucifer”—a vigilante taking down corrupt scythes in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citra, now a junior scythe under Scythe Curie, sees the corruption and wants to help change it from the inside out, but is thwarted at every turn, and threatened by the “new order” scythes. Realizing she cannot do this alone—or even with the help of Scythe Curie and Faraday, she does the unthinkable, and risks being “deadish” so she can communicate with the Thunderhead—the only being on earth wise enough to solve the dire problems of a perfect world. But will it help solve those problems, or simply watch as perfection goes into decline?</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm not usually very keen on dystopian novels, but I am LOVING this series so far. This book only upped the ante when it came to the situation that the characters are in.

  <description>Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heroes will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller &lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; continues on board the Jump Station &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt; are headed right toward &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt;—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</description>

  <description>It has been a year of change since Gemma Doyle arrived at the foreboding Spence Academy. Her mother murdered, her father a laudanum addict, Gemma has relied on an unsuspected strength and has discovered an ability to travel to an enchanted world called the realms, where dark magic runs wild. Despite certain peril, Gemma has bound the magic to herself and forged unlikely new alliances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as Gemma approaches her London debut, the time has come to test these bonds. The Order - the mysterious group her mother was once part of - is grappling for control of the realms, as is the Rakshana. Spence's burned East Wing is being rebuilt, but why now? Gemma and her friends see Pippa, but she is not the same. And their friendship faces its gravest trial as Gemma must decide once and for all what role she is meant for.</description>

  <description>Ah, Christmas! Gemma Doyle is looking forward to a holiday from Spence Academy, spending time with her friends in the city, attending ritzy balls, and on a somber note, tending to her ailing father. As she prepares to ring in the New Year, 1896, a handsome young man, Lord Denby, has set his sights on Gemma, or so it seems. Yet amidst the distractions of London, Gemma’s visions intensify–visions of three girls dressed in white, to whom something horrific has happened, something only the realms can explain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lure is strong, and before long, Gemma, Felicity, and Ann are turning flowers into butterflies in the enchanted world of the realms that Gemma alone can bring them to. To the girls’ great joy, their beloved Pippa is there as well, eager to complete their circle of friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all is not well in the realms–or out. The mysterious Kartik has reappeared, telling Gemma she must find the Temple and bind the magic, else great disaster will befall her. Gemma’s willing to do his intrusive bidding, despite the dangers it brings, for it means she will meet up with her mother’s greatest friend–and now her foe, Circe. Until Circe is destroyed, Gemma cannot live out her destiny. But finding Circe proves a most perilous task.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Messenger&lt;/i&gt; is the masterful third novel in the Giver Quartet, which began with the dystopian bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Giver,&lt;/i&gt; now a major motion picture.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matty has lived in Village and flourished under the guidance of Seer, a blind man known for his special sight. Village once welcomed newcomers, but something sinister has seeped into Village and the people have voted to close it to outsiders. Matty has been invaluable as a messenger. Now he must risk everything to make one last journey through the treacherous forest with his only weapon, a power he unexpectedly discovers within himself.</description>

  <description>Phillip is excited when the Germans invade the small island of Curaçao. War has always been a game to him, and he’s eager to glimpse it firsthand–until the freighter he and his mother are traveling to the United States on is torpedoed.&lt;br /&gt;   When Phillip comes to, he is on a small raft in the middle of the sea. Besides Stew Cat, his only companion is an old West Indian, Timothy. Phillip remembers his mother’s warning about black people: “They are different, and they live differently.”&lt;br /&gt;    But by the time the castaways arrive on a small island, Phillip’s head injury has made him blind and dependent on Timothy.</description>

  <description>"How about a story? Spin us a yarn."&lt;br /&gt;Instantly, Phoebe Winterbottom came to mind. "I could tell you an extensively strange story," I warned.&lt;br /&gt;"Oh, good!" Gram said. "Delicious!"&lt;br /&gt;And that is how I happened to tell them about Phoebe, her disappearing mother, and the lunatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Sal entertains her grandparents with Phoebe's outrageous story, her own story begins to unfold — the story of a thirteen-year-old girl whose only wish is to be reunited with her missing mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her own award-winning style, Sharon Creech intricately weaves together two tales, one funny, one bittersweet, to create a heartwarming, compelling, and utterly moving story of love, loss, and the complexity of human emotion.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? &lt;br /&gt;(back cover)</description>

  <description>The story of a mentally disabled man whose experimental quest for intelligence mirrors that of Algernon, an extraordinary lab mouse. In diary entries, Charlie tells how a brain operation increases his IQ and changes his life. As the experimental procedure takes effect, Charlie's intelligence expands until it surpasses that of the doctors who engineered his metamorphosis. The experiment seems to be a scientific breakthrough of paramount importance--until Algernon begins his sudden, unexpected deterioration. Will the same happen to Charlie?</description>

  <description>The Shadowhunters of Los Angeles star in the first novel in Cassandra Clare’s newest series, The Dark Artifices, a sequel to the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series. &lt;i&gt;Lady Midnight&lt;/i&gt; is a Shadowhunters novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been five years since the events of &lt;i&gt;City of Heavenly Fire&lt;/i&gt; that brought the Shadowhunters to the brink of oblivion. Emma Carstairs is no longer a child in mourning, but a young woman bent on discovering what killed her parents and avenging her losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with her parabatai Julian Blackthorn, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches across Los Angeles, from the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica. If only her heart didn’t lead her in treacherous directions…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making things even more complicated, Julian’s brother Mark—who was captured by the faeries five years ago—has been returned as a bargaining chip. The faeries are desperate to find out who is murdering their kind—and they need the Shadowhunters’ help to do it. But time works differently in faerie, so Mark has barely aged and doesn’t recognize his family. Can he ever truly return to them? Will the faeries really allow it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Glitz, glamours, and Shadowhunters abound in this heartrending opening to Cassandra Clare’s Dark Artifices series.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two women on either side of the Silver and Red divide tell the stories no one else knows.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discover the truth of Norta’s bloody past in these two revealing prequels to #1 &lt;/i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;i&gt; bestseller &lt;/i&gt;RED QUEEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Queen Song&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queen Coriane, first wife of King Tiberias, keeps a secret diary—how else can she ensure that no one at the palace will use her thoughts against her? Coriane recounts her heady courtship with the crown prince, the birth of a new prince, Cal, and the potentially deadly challenges that lie ahead for her in royal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steel Scars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Farley was raised to be strong, but being tasked with planting the seeds of rebellion in Norta is a tougher job than expected. As she travels the land recruiting black market traders, smugglers, and extremists for her first attempt at an attack on the capital, she stumbles upon a connection that may prove to be the key to the entire operation—Mare Barrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus a &lt;b&gt;Glass Sword&lt;/b&gt; sneak peek!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exclusive excerpt of the hotly anticipated second book in the Red Queen series, &lt;i&gt;Glass Sword&lt;/i&gt;, transports readers to the world of Silver tyranny, a Red dawn rising, and one girl’s resolve to break down the system that will hold her back no longer.</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>Mortals rule the desert nation of Miraji, but mythical beasts still roam the wild and remote areas, and rumor has it that somewhere, djinn still perform their magic.  For humans, it’s an unforgiving place, especially if you’re poor, orphaned, or female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amani Al’Hiza is all three. She’s a gifted gunslinger with perfect aim, but she can’t shoot her way out of Dustwalk, the back-country town where she’s destined to wind up wed or dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she meets Jin, a rakish foreigner, in a shooting contest, and sees him as the perfect escape route. But though she’s spent years dreaming of leaving Dustwalk, she never imagined she’d gallop away on mythical horse—or that it would take a foreign fugitive to show her the heart of the desert she thought she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rebel of the Sands&lt;/i&gt; reveals what happens when a dream deferred explodes—in the fires of rebellion, of romantic passion, and the all-consuming inferno of a girl finally, at long last, embracing her power.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark’s Eve,” Neeve said. “Either you’re his true love . . . or you killed him.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them—not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can’t entirely explain. He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she’s not so sure anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the &lt;i&gt;Shiver&lt;/i&gt; trilogy and &lt;i&gt;The Scorpio Races&lt;/i&gt;, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we’ve never been before.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>There’s no such thing as safe in a city at war, a city overrun with monsters. In this dark urban fantasy from author Victoria Schwab&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a young woman and a young man must choose whether to become heroes or villains—and friends or enemies—with the future of their home at stake. The first of two books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Harker and August Flynn are the heirs to a divided city—a city where the violence has begun to breed actual monsters. All Kate wants is to be as ruthless as her father, who lets the monsters roam free and makes the humans pay for his protection. All August wants is to be human, as good-hearted as his own father, to play a bigger role in protecting the innocent—but he’s one of the monsters. One who can steal a soul with a simple strain of music. When the chance arises to keep an eye on Kate, who’s just been kicked out of her sixth boarding school and returned home, August jumps at it. But Kate discovers August’s secret, and after a failed assassination attempt the pair must flee for their lives.</description>

  <description>In this third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, now with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, they're plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their best hope lies with Cress, a girl imprisoned on a satellite since childhood who's only ever had her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, she's just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a higher price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only hope the world has.</description>

  <description>Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mark her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana won't approve of her feelings for her childhood friend--the handsome palace guard, Jacin. But Winter isn't as weak as Levana believes her to be and she's been undermining her stepmother's wishes for years. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that's been raging for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter defeat Levana and find their happily ever afters? Fans will not want to miss this thrilling conclusion to Marissa Meyer's national bestselling Lunar Chronicles series.</description>

  <description>This introduction to computer-based problem-solving using the MATLAB(R) environment is highly recommended for students wishing to learn the concepts and develop the programming skills that are fundamental to computational science and engineering (CSE). Through a 'teaching by examples' approach, the authors pose strategically chosen problems to help first-time programmers learn these necessary concepts and skills. Each section formulates a problem and then introduces those new MATLAB(R) language features that are necessary to solve it. This approach puts problem-solving and algorithmic thinking first and syntactical details second. Each solution is followed by a 'talking point' that concerns some related, larger issue associated with CSE. Collectively, the worked examples, talking points, and 300+ homework problems build intuition for the process of discretization and an appreciation for dimension, inexactitude, visualization, randomness, and complexity. This sets the stage for further coursework in CSE areas.</description>

  <description>From queen of royal fiction Philippa Gregory comes this instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller that tells the story of the remarkable Elizabeth of York, daughter of the White Queen, and mother to the House of Tudor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Henry Tudor picks up the crown of England from the mud of Bosworth field, he knows he must marry the princess of the enemy house, Elizabeth of York, to unify a country divided by war for nearly two decades. But his bride is still in love with his slain enemy, Richard III, and her mother and half of England dream of a missing heir, sent into the unknown by the White Queen. While the new monarchy can win power, it cannot win hearts in an England that plots for the triumphant return of the House of York. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henry's greatest fear is that somewhere a prince is waiting to invade and reclaim the throne. When a young man who would be king leads his army and invades England, Elizabeth has to choose between the new husband she is coming to love and the boy who claims to be her beloved lost brother: the rose of York come home at last.</description>

  <description>A tale of art, beauty, lust, greed, deception and retribution -- set in a refined society ablaze with tulip fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1630s Amsterdam, tulipomania has seized the populace. Everywhere men are seduced by the fantastic exotic flower. But for wealthy merchant Cornelis Sandvoort, it is his young and beautiful wife, Sophia, who stirs his soul. She is the prize he desires, the woman he hopes will bring him the joy that not even his considerable fortune can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cornelis yearns for an heir, but so far he and Sophia have failed to produce one. In a bid for immortality, he commissions a portrait of them both by the talented young painter Jan van Loos. But as Van Loos begins to capture Sophia's likeness on canvas, a slow passion begins to burn between the beautiful young wife and the talented artist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the portrait unfolds, so a slow dance is begun among the household's inhabitants. Ambitions, desires, and dreams breed a grand deception--and as the lies multiply, events move toward a thrilling and tragic climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this richly imagined international bestseller, Deborah Moggach has created the rarest of novels--a lush, lyrical work of fiction that is also compulsively readable. Seldom has a novel so vividly evoked a time, a place, and a passion.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Hope warms the coldest night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.</description>

      <![CDATA[update: May 9th, 2018<br /><br />Upon further reflection now that the hype has died down I'm knocking this down a star. I still adore this series and the characters but this was kinda unnecessary fluff and there were some things that made me cringe. I do have high hopes for the next book in the s...]]>

  <description>Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling &lt;i&gt;A Court of Thorns and Roses &lt;/i&gt;series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this thrilling third book in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series from Sarah J. Maas, the earth will be painted red as mighty armies grapple for power over the one thing that could destroy them all.</description>

  <description>Feyre survived Amarantha's clutches to return to the Spring Court—but at a steep cost. Though she now has the powers of the High Fae, her heart remains human, and it can't forget the terrible deeds she performed to save Tamlin's people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor has Feyre forgotten her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court. As Feyre navigates its dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms—and she might be key to stopping it. But only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future—and the future of a world cleaved in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than a million copies sold of her beloved Throne of Glass series, Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her seductive and action-packed series to new heights.</description>

  <description>Feyre's survival rests upon her ability to hunt and kill – the forest where she lives is a cold, bleak place in the long winter months. So when she spots a deer in the forest being pursued by a wolf, she cannot resist fighting it for the flesh. But to do so, she must kill the predator and killing something so precious comes at a price ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragged to a magical kingdom for the murder of a faerie, Feyre discovers that her captor, his face obscured by a jewelled mask, is hiding far more than his piercing green eyes would suggest. Feyre's presence at the court is closely guarded, and as she begins to learn why, her feelings for him turn from hostility to passion and the faerie lands become an even more dangerous place. Feyre must fight to break an ancient curse, or she will lose him forever.</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She’s trying to break out of prison—even though if she succeeds, she’ll be the Commonwealth’s most wanted fugitive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit’s grandmother is missing. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother’s whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her &lt;i&gt;prisoner&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book has been on my radar forever and I’m so glad I finally got around to reading it! Even though it’s a retelling, I found the premise to be unique and exciting. An excellent start to the series - I’m excited to see how things develop! ]]>

  <description>Cassidy Blake's parents are The Inspecters, a (somewhat inept) ghost-hunting team. But Cass herself can REALLY see ghosts. In fact, her best friend, Jacob, just happens to be one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When The Inspecters head to ultra-haunted Edinburgh, Scotland, for their new TV show, Cass—and Jacob—come along. In Scotland, Cass is surrounded by ghosts, not all of them friendly. Then she meets Lara, a girl who can also see the dead. But Lara tells Cassidy that as an In-betweener, their job is to send ghosts permanently beyond the Veil. Cass isn't sure about her new mission, but she does know the sinister Red Raven haunting the city doesn't belong in her world. Cassidy's powers will draw her into an epic fight that stretches through the worlds of the living and the dead, in order to save herself.</description>

  <description>It's invisible. It's ever-present. Without it, you would die in minutes. And it has an epic story to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Caesar's Last Breath, New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sam Kean takes us on a journey through the periodic table, around the globe, and across time to tell the story of the air we breathe, which, it turns out, is also the story of earth and our existence on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every breath, you literally inhale the history of the world. On the ides of March, 44 BC, Julius Caesar died of stab wounds on the Senate floor, but the story of his last breath is still unfolding; in fact, you're probably inhaling some of it now. Of the &lt;i&gt;sextillions &lt;/i&gt;of molecules entering or leaving your lungs at this moment, some might well bear traces of Cleopatra's perfumes, German mustard gas, particles exhaled by dinosaurs or emitted by atomic bombs, even remnants of stardust from the universe's creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracing the origins and ingredients of our atmosphere, Kean reveals how the alchemy of air reshaped our continents, steered human progress, powered revolutions, and continues to influence everything we do. Along the way, we'll swim with radioactive pigs, witness the most important chemical reactions humans have discovered, and join the crowd at the Moulin Rouge for some of the crudest performance art of all time. Lively, witty, and filled with the astounding science of ordinary life, &lt;i&gt;Caesar's Last Breath &lt;/i&gt;illuminates the science stories swirling around us every second.</description>

  <description>HER PERFECT LIFE IS A PERFECT LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, Ani FaNelli endured a shocking, public humiliation that left her desperate to reinvent herself. Now, with a glamorous job, expensive wardrobe, and handsome blue blood fiancé, she’s this close to living the perfect life she’s worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ani has a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something else buried in her past that still haunts her, something private and painful that threatens to bubble to the surface and destroy everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a singular voice and twists you won’t see coming, Luckiest Girl Alive explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to “have it all” and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question remains: will breaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for—or, will it at long last, set Ani free?</description>

  <description>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to do. This afternoon, her planet was invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2575, and two rival megacorporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than an ice-covered speck at the edge of the universe. Too bad nobody thought to warn the people living on it. With enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra—who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to fight their way onto an evacuating fleet, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their problems are just getting started. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating, with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a tangled web of data to find the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: the ex-boyfriend she &lt;i&gt;swore&lt;/i&gt; she'd never speak to again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRIEFING NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents—including emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more—&lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a heart-stopping, high-octane trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL CRUMBLE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving &lt;i&gt;Antari&lt;/i&gt; - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL RISE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the &lt;i&gt;Night Spire&lt;/i&gt; collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is one of the best fantasy trilogies I have read in a while. The world building was phenomenal, the characters are fully fleshed out and I adore all of them, and the plot is riveting. The worst part about this series is that it’s over 😭]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A trade paperback repackage of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller V.E. Schwab's &lt;i&gt;Vicious&lt;/i&gt;, a masterful tale of ambition, jealousy, and superpowers which will include: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*A new cover by Wil Staehle, cover artist of the iconic Shades of Magic trilogy covers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Schwab's Tor.com short story set within the &lt;i&gt;Vicious&lt;/i&gt; universe, "Warm Up"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*A teaser for the upcoming sequel, &lt;i&gt;Vengeful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor and Eli started out as college roommates--brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find--aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge--but who will be left alive at the end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Vicious&lt;/i&gt;, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn't automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.</description>
