  <description>Tight: Lately, Bryan's been feeling it in all kinds of ways . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryan knows what's tight for him--reading comics, drawing superheroes, and hanging out with no drama. But drama is every day where he's from, and that gets him tight, wound up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now Bryan's friend Mike pressures him with ideas of fun that are crazy risky. At first, it's a rush following Mike, hopping turnstiles, subway surfing, and getting into all kinds of trouble. But Bryan never really feels right acting so wrong, and drama really isn't him. So which way will he go, especially when his dad tells him it's better to be hard and feared than liked?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if there's one thing Bryan's gotten from his comic heroes, it's that he has power--to stand up for what he feels . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Torrey Maldonado delivers a fast-paced, insightful, dynamic story capturing urban community life. Readers will connect with Bryan's journey as he navigates a tough world with a heartfelt desire for a different life.</description>

  <description>On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong took “one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” when the Apollo 11 landed on the moon. But it wasn’t just one man who got us to the moon. &lt;i&gt;The Moon Landing&lt;/i&gt; explores the people and technology that made the moon landing possible. Instead of examining one person’s life, it focuses on the moon landing itself, showing the events leading up to it and how it changed the world. The book takes readers through the history of rocket building: from ancient Chinese rockets, to “bombs bursting in air” during the War of 1812, to Russia’s Sputnik program, to the moon landing.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What began as a playful idea among friends has made its way around the world, inspiring laughter, high-fives, hugs, and tears from New England to Brazil. &lt;i&gt;Typewriter Rodeo &lt;/i&gt;celebrates poetry, spontaneity, and above all, the power of human connection.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both a visual feast and a reference book in the style of Brandon Stanton’s &lt;i&gt;Humans of New York&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Typewriter Rodeo&lt;/i&gt; collects custom, typewritten poems from “rodeos” worldwide, portraits of recipients, and their personal stories. Typewriter Rodeo began in Austin, Texas, when four poets brought their typewriters to a maker fair and began offering spontaneous, custom-composed poems to an enthusiastic crowd. The event quickly blossomed and rodeos began popping up all over the world.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Imagine a vault so cavernous that it could contain all the world's greatest treasures and relics, from mummified remains of ancient monarchs to glistening swords brandished by legendary warriors. Who could be in charge of such a vault and how did he come into possession of such a unique collection? Who is...Professor Brownstone?</description>

  <description>Design Observer Best Book of the Year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tubes looks behind the scenes of our digital lives at the physical heart of the Internet itself. This is a book about real places on the map: their sounds and smells, their storied pasts, their physical details, and the people who live there. Sharing tales of his on-the-ground reporting, along with lucid explanations about how the Internet works, Blum's eye-opening travelogue offers a unique perspective on the role of technology in our lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Sibert Honor–winning creator behind &lt;i&gt;The Unwanted&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Drowned City &lt;/i&gt;comes a graphic novel of one of the darkest episodes in American history: the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; New Year’s Day, 1918. America has declared war on Germany and is gathering troops to fight. But there’s something coming that is deadlier than any war.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; When people begin to fall ill, most Americans don’t suspect influenza. The flu is known to be dangerous to the very old, young, or frail. But the Spanish flu is exceptionally violent. Soon, thousands of people succumb. Then tens of thousands . . . hundreds of thousands and more. Graves can’t be dug quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; What made the influenza of 1918 so exceptionally deadly—and what can modern science help us understand about this tragic episode in history? With a journalist’s discerning eye for facts and an artist’s instinct for true emotion, Sibert Honor recipient Don Brown sets out to answer these questions and more in &lt;i&gt;Fever Year&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>In the lawless, drought-ridden lands of the Arizona Territory in 1893, two extraordinary lives unfold. Nora is an unflinching frontierswoman awaiting the return of the men in her life--her husband, who has gone in search of water for the parched household, and her elder sons, who have vanished after an explosive argument. Nora is biding her time with her youngest son, who is convinced that a mysterious beast is stalking the land around their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Lurie is a former outlaw and a man haunted by ghosts. He sees lost souls who want something from him, and he finds reprieve from their longing in an unexpected relationship that inspires a momentous expedition across the West. The way in which Lurie's death-defying trek at last intersects with Nora's plight is the surprise and suspense of this brilliant novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mythical, lyrical, and sweeping in scope, &lt;i&gt;Inland &lt;/i&gt;is grounded in true but little-known history. It showcases all of Téa Obreht's talents as a writer, as she subverts and reimagines the myths of the American West, making them entirely--and unforgettably--her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;bestselling author and iconic Hollywood producer Brian Grazer reveals a new secret to forge a happier and more successful life. Through his own personal stories, discover how eye contact&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;a power available to nearly everyone&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;can change your life too.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his bestseller &lt;i&gt;A Curious Mind: The Secret to a Bigger Life&lt;/i&gt;, Academy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer helped everyone from parents to CEOs to artists to young graduates develop their curiosity into a superpower that would expand their world. Now, he reveals a new secret. Whether you’re looking to develop a relationship, build your confidence or win a negotiation: the answer is in the eyes. Grazer delves into the power of eye contact, as he shares personal, life-changing stories and insightful advice that will help you immediately discover the secret to a more meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it might seem like second nature, Grazer proves that eye contact—really looking someone in the eyes—is one of the most transformative habits you can develop in your daily life. Eye contact has the power to offer validation, show generosity, create intimacy, and—most importantly—establish genuine human connection. Even as technology takes on a bigger and bigger role in our lives, from self-driving cars to the smartphones in our pockets, no machine will ever be able to replace the unique and powerful benefits of eye contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of the most acclaimed Hollywood producers in the world, Grazer transports you into the moments from his life where eye contact proves to be the key to unlocking power, emotion, and insight. These are moments like a high-powered CEO conference with Bill Gates; a surprise date with supermodel Kate Moss; a tough conversation with Eminem when creating the movie &lt;i&gt;8 Mile;&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;tête&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;à-tête&lt;/i&gt; with George W. Bush; and encounters with personalities like Taraji Henson, Airbnb Founder Brian Chesky, and Chance The Rapper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his flair for telling intriguing stories, Grazer’s highly readable book will give you a powerful advantage across every aspect of your life. Read this book now, and learn how a happier and more meaningful life is just a blink away.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Moon is everything Christine isn’t. She’s confident, impulsive, artistic . . . and though they both grew up in the same Chinese-American suburb, Moon is somehow unlike anyone Christine has ever known.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Moon’s family moves in next door to Christine’s, Moon goes from unlikely friend to best friend―maybe even the perfect friend. The girls share their favorite music videos, paint their toenails when Christine’s strict parents aren’t around, and make plans to enter the school talent show together. Moon even tells Christine her deepest secret: that she sometimes has visions of celestial beings who speak to her from the stars. Who reassure her that earth isn’t where she really belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they’re least expecting it, catastrophe strikes. After relying on Moon for everything, can Christine find it in herself to be the friend Moon needs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times–bestselling author-illustrator Jen Wang draws on her childhood to paint a deeply personal yet wholly relatable friendship story that’s at turns joyful, heart-wrenching, and full of hope</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow blindly the lead of other men . . . &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Darwin was, above all else, an independent thinker who continues even now to influence the way we look at the natural world. His endless curiosity and passion for detail resulted in a wealth of notebooks, diaries, correspondence, and published writings that Peter Sís transforms into a visual treasure trove. A multilayered journey through Darwin’s world, &lt;i&gt;The Tree of Life &lt;/i&gt;begins with his childhood and traces the arc of his life through university and career, following him around the globe on the voyage of the Beagle, and home to a quiet but momentous life devoted to science and family. Sís uses his own singular vision to create a gloriously detailed panorama of a genius’s trajectory through investigating and understanding the mysteries of nature. In pictures executed in fine pen and ink and lush watercolors – cameo portraits, illustrated pages of diary, cutaway views of the Beagle, as well as charts, maps, and a gatefold spread – Peter Sís has shaped a wondrous introduction to Charles Darwin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>The revered &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author returns with a novel set in 1960s Baltimore that combines modern psychological insights with elements of classic noir, about a middle-aged housewife turned aspiring reporter who pursues the murder of a forgotten young woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1966, Baltimore is a city of secrets that everyone seems to know--everyone, that is, except Madeline "Maddie" Schwartz. Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Star.&lt;/em&gt; Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleo Sherwood was a young African-American woman who liked to have a good time. No one seems to know or care why she was killed except Maddie--and the dead woman herself. Maddie's going to find the truth about Cleo's life and death. Cleo's ghost, privy to Maddie's poking and prying, wants to be left alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maddie's investigation brings her into contact with people that used to be on the periphery of her life--a jewelery store clerk, a waitress, a rising star on the Baltimore Orioles, a patrol cop, a hardened female reporter, a lonely man in a movie theater. But for all her ambition and drive, Maddie often fails to see the people right in front of her. Her inability to look beyond her own needs will lead to tragedy and turmoil for all sorts of people--including the man who shares her bed, a black police officer who cares for Maddie more than she knows.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Explore nature's history with the most visually stunning timeline of life on earth ever created.&lt;/b&gt; Created in association with the &lt;i&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/i&gt;, the 6-foot fold-out timeline stretches back 4 billion years to the first signs of life in the seas. Witness the emergence of multi-cellular life, the colonization of the land, the reign of dinosaurs, mass extinctions, the migration of mammals, and finally, the story of humanity from the first two-legged hominids to a world populated by more than 7 billion people today. An easy-to-read chronicle, written in the form of newspaper articles, highlights key moments such as understanding the science behind sight and how rocks can reveal the Earth's age. Other features include a page of letters to the editor, a fifty-question quiz, and a pocket magnifier to make it easier to dive into all the timeline's details. Perfect for 6-14 year olds, and nature lovers of any age!</description>

  <description>If asked to list the greatest innovators of modern American poetry, few of us would think to include Jay-Z or Eminem in their number. And yet hip hop is the source of some of the most exciting developments in verse today. The media uproar in response to its controversial lyrical content has obscured hip hop's revolution of poetic craft and experience: Only in rap music can the beat of a song render poetic meter audible, allowing an MC's wordplay to move a club-full of eager listeners.Examining rap history's most memorable lyricists and their inimitable techniques, literary scholar Adam Bradley argues that we must understand rap as poetry or miss the vanguard of poetry today. &lt;i&gt;Book of Rhymes&lt;/i&gt; explores America's least understood poets, unpacking their surprisingly complex craft, and according rap poetry the respect it deserves.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Best Friends&lt;/i&gt; is the vividly honest follow-up to the runaway bestselling graphic memoir &lt;i&gt;Real Friends.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth grade is supposed to be perfect. Shannon's got a sure spot in the in-crowd called The Group, and her best friend is their leader, Jen, the &lt;i&gt;most &lt;/i&gt;popular girl in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the rules are always changing, and Shannon has to scramble to keep up. She never knows which TV shows are cool, what songs to listen to, and which boys she's allowed to talk to. Who makes these rules anyway? And does Shannon have to follow them? Or should she follow her heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling creators of &lt;i&gt;Real Friends &lt;/i&gt;Shannon Hale and LeUyen Pham are back with a true story about popularity, first boyfriends, and finding your own path.</description>

  <description>It is twenty years since the events of &lt;i&gt;La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One&lt;/i&gt; unfolded and saw the baby Lyra Belacqua begin her life-changing journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is seven years since readers left Lyra and the love of her young life, Will Parry, on a park bench in Oxford's Botanic Gardens at the end of the ground-breaking, bestselling His Dark Materials sequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Secret Commonwealth&lt;/i&gt;, we meet Lyra Silvertongue. And she is no longer a child . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second volume of Sir Philip Pullman's The Book of Dust sees Lyra, now twenty years old, and her daemon Pantalaimon, forced to navigate their relationship in a way they could never have imagined, and drawn into the complex and dangerous factions of a world that they had no idea existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulled along on his own journey too is Malcolm; once a boy with a boat and a mission to save a baby from the flood, now a man with a strong sense of duty and a desire to do what is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theirs is a world at once familiar and extraordinary, and they must travel far beyond the edges of Oxford, across Europe and into Asia, in search for what is lost - a city haunted by daemons, a secret at the heart of a desert, and the mystery of the elusive Dust.</description>

  <description>Ben Folds is a celebrated American singer-songwriter, beloved for songs such as "Brick," "You Don't Know Me," "Rockin' the Suburbs," and "The Luckiest," and is the former frontman of the alternative rock band Ben Folds Five. But Folds will be the first to tell you he's an unconventional icon, more normcore than hardcore. Now, in his first book, Folds looks back at his life so far in a charming and wise chronicle of his artistic coming of age, infused with the wry observations of a natural storyteller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the title chapter, "A Dream About Lightning Bugs," Folds recalls his earliest childhood dream--and realizes how much it influenced his understanding of what it means to be an artist. In "Measure Twice, Cut Once" he learns to resist the urge to skip steps during the creative process. In "Hall Pass" he recounts his 1970s North Carolina working-class childhood, and in "Cheap Lessons" he returns to the painful life lessons he learned the hard way--but that luckily didn't kill him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his inimitable voice, both relatable and thought-provoking, Folds digs deep into the life experiences that shaped him, imparting hard-earned wisdom about both art and life. Collectively, these stories embody the message Folds has been singing about for years: Smile like you've got nothing to prove, because it hurts to grow up, and life flies by in seconds.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;AN INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER!!&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt; Must-Read Book of Summer&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Gretchen McCulloch is the internet's favorite linguist, and this book is essential reading. Reading her work is like suddenly being able to see the matrix." --Jonny Sun, author of &lt;i&gt;everyone's a aliebn when ur a aliebn too&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because Internet&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who's ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come from. It's the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that's a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Language is humanity's most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What's more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer "LOL" or "lol," why sparkly tildes succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.</description>

Will she and Adrienne stay friends? Can she stand up for herself? And is she in The Group—or out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newbery Honor author Shannon Hale and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling illustrator LeUyen Pham join forces in this graphic memoir about how hard it is to find your real friends—and why it's worth the journey.</description>

  <description>Eleven-year-old Joey's world turns inside-out when he finds himself pulled inside the walls of his own home, seemingly trapped in a strange and surreal place. As he searches for a way out, he discovers a myriad of strange, intriguing, and frightening characters, who ultimately lead him to complete the greatest journey of them all: growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fantastical trip through a strange landscape that explores the changing perspective of a young boy facing adulthood. As surreal as Alice in Wonderland, with a powerful truth underneath it all. This beautifully illustrated, watercolored tale will make readers long for the simplicity of youth while embracing the wonderful complexities of adulthood: RESPONSIBILITY, LOVE, CONSEQUENCE, and ultimately the shocking, inevitable realities of LIFE and DEATH. Written by Pierre Paquet, this honest portrayal of a moment from his own life will take readers to a land of contemplation and adventure.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A graphic memoir recounting actor/author/activist George Takei's childhood imprisoned within American concentration camps during World War II. Experience the forces that shaped an American icon -- and America itself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long before George Takei braved new frontiers in &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's -- and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1942, at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, every person of Japanese descent on the west coast was rounded up and shipped to one of ten "relocation centers," hundreds or thousands of miles from home, where they would be held for years under armed guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They Called Us Enemy&lt;/i&gt; is Takei's firsthand account of those years behind barbed wire, the joys and terrors of growing up under legalized racism, his mother's hard choices, his father's faith in democracy, and the way those experiences planted the seeds for his astonishing future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The mega-bestseller with more than 1.5 million readers that is soon to be a major television series &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He can't leave his hotel. You won't want to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Rules of Civility&lt;/i&gt;--a transporting novel about a man who is ordered to spend the rest of his life inside a luxury hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit, has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel's doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count's endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Trick Mirror&lt;/em&gt; is an enlightening, unforgettable trip through the river of self-delusion that surges just beneath the surface of our lives. This is a book about the incentives that shape us, and about how hard it is to see ourselves clearly in a culture that revolves around the self. In each essay, Jia writes about the cultural prisms that have shaped her: the rise of the nightmare social internet; the American scammer as millennial hero; the literary heroine’s journey from brave to blank to bitter; the mandate that everything, including our bodies, should always be getting more efficient and beautiful until we die.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One part Mari Andrew, one part Marjane Satrapi, &lt;i&gt;I Was Their American Dream: A Graphic Memoir &lt;/i&gt;is a triumphant tale of self-discovery, a celebration of a family's rich heritage, and a love letter to American immigrant freedom. Malaka Gharib's illustrations come alive with teenage antics and earnest questions about identity and culture, while providing thoughtful insight into the lives of modern immigrants and the generation of millennial children they raised.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malaka's upbringing will look familiar to anyone who grew up in the pre-internet era, but her particular story is a heartfelt tribute to the American immigrants who have invested their future in the promise of the American dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daughter of parents with unfulfilled dreams themselves, Malaka navigates her childhood chasing her parents' ideals, learning to code-switch between her family's Filipino and Egyptian customs, adapting to white culture to fit in, crushing on skater boys, and trying to understand the tension between holding onto cultural values and trying to be an all-American kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Was Their American Dream&lt;/i&gt; is at once a journal of growing up and a reminder of the thousands of immigrants who come to America in search for a better life for themselves and their children.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The world's most entertaining and useless self-help guide, from the brilliant mind behind the wildly popular webcomic xkcd and the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers &lt;i&gt;What If?&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thing Explainer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any task you might want to do, there's a right way, a wrong way, and a way so monumentally complex, excessive, and inadvisable that no one would ever try it. &lt;i&gt;How To&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90's kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of the book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in &lt;i&gt;What If?&lt;/i&gt;, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. Full of clever infographics and amusing illustrations, &lt;i&gt;How To&lt;/i&gt; is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day.</description>

  <description>Raina wakes up one night with a terrible upset stomach. Her mom has one, too, so it's probably just a bug. Raina eventually returns to school, where she's dealing with the usual highs and lows: friends, not-friends, and classmates who think the school year is just one long gross-out session. It soon becomes clear that Raina's tummy trouble isn't going away... and it coincides with her worries about food, school, and changing friendships. What's going on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raina Telgemeier once again brings us a thoughtful, charming, and funny true story about growing up and gathering the courage to face -- and conquer -- her fears.</description>

  <description>In July 2015, a young black woman named Sandra Bland was pulled over for a minor traffic violation in rural Texas. Minutes later she was arrested and jailed. Three days later, she committed suicide in her cell. What went wrong? &lt;i&gt;Talking to Strangers&lt;/i&gt; is all about what happens when we encounter people we don't know, why it often goes awry, and what it says about us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we make sense of the unfamiliar? Why are we so bad at judging someone, reading a face, or detecting a lie? Why do we so often fail to 'get' other people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through a series of puzzles, encounters and misunderstandings, from little-known stories to infamous legal cases, Gladwell takes us on a journey through the unexpected. You will read about the spy who spent years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon, the man who saw through the fraudster Bernie Madoff, the suicide of the poet Sylvia Plath and the false conviction of Amanda Knox. You will discover that strangers are never simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one shows us who we are like Malcolm Gladwell. Here he sets out to understand why we act the way we do, and how we all might know a little more about those we don't.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling cartoonist and master visual storyteller Harry Bliss has concocted a delightful, near wordless graphic picture book with nods to famous cartoons, cultural icons, and the secret lives that creative people make for themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace is the quiet girl in the class. And Gus is the class guinea pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace knows that Gus is lonely, and so she sets off one night to help out her furry friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wherever she goes, Grace amazes and delights as she shares her many talents, showing how one person with a little pizzazz can make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Grace for Gus&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Grace for Gus&lt;/em&gt; is so rich in smart sight gags, subtle cartoon homages, and clever visual references.” —Alison Bechdel, cartoonist and author of the Eisner Award–winning &lt;em&gt;Fun Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“He had me at Guinea Pig!” —Jamie Lee Curtis, actress and New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Today I Feel Silly &amp;amp; Other Moods That Make My Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In his usual brilliant way, Harry Bliss brings humor and detail (details, details, details) to every panel. Linger on every panel as long as you can—there’s something for everyone.” —Doreen Cronin, author of &lt;em&gt;Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An artistic collection of more than 50 drawings featuring unique, funny, and poignant foreign words that have no direct translation into English.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that the Japanese language has a word to express the way sunlight filters through the leaves of trees? Or that there’s a Finnish word for the distance a reindeer can travel before needing to rest? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;/i&gt; brings to life more than fifty words that don’t have direct English translations with charming illustrations of their tender, poignant, and humorous definitions. Often these words provide insight into the cultures they come from, such as the Brazilian Portuguese word for running your fingers through a lover’s hair, the Italian word for being moved to tears by a story, or the Swedish word for a third cup of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this clever and beautifully rendered exploration of the subtleties of communication, you’ll find new ways to express yourself while getting lost in the artistry of imperfect translation.</description>

  <description>Dakota Territory, 1866. Following the murders of a frontier fort’s politically connected sutler and his wife in their illicit off-post brothel, Lieutenant Martin Molloy and his long-suffering orderly, Corporal Daniel Kohn, are ordered to track down the killers and return with “boots for the gallows” to appease powerful figures in Washington. The men journey west to the distant outpost in a beautiful valley, where the soldiers inside the fort prove to be violently opposed to their investigations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Irish immigrant brothers Michael and Thomas O’Driscoll have returned from the brutal front lines of the Civil War. Unable to adapt to life as migrant farm laborers in peacetime Ohio, they reenlist in the army and are shipped to Fort Phil Kearny in the heart of the Powder River Valley. Here they are thrown into merciless combat with Red Cloud’s coalition of Native tribes fighting American expansion into their hunting grounds. Amidst the daily carnage, Thomas finds a love that will lead to a moment of violence as brutal as any they have witnessed in battle—a moment that will change their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending intimate historical detail and emotional acuity, &lt;em&gt;Wolves of Eden&lt;/em&gt; sets these four men on a deadly collision course in a haunting narrative that explores the cruelty of warfare and the resilience of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;The Hundreds&lt;/i&gt; Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart speculate on writing, affect, politics, and attention to processes of world-making. The experiment of the one hundred word constraint—each piece is one hundred or multiples of one hundred words long—amplifies the resonance of things that are happening in atmospheres, rhythms of encounter, and scenes that shift the social and conceptual ground. What's an encounter with anything once it's seen as an incitement to composition? What's a concept or a theory if they're no longer seen as a truth effect, but a training in absorption, attention, and framing? &lt;i&gt;The Hundreds&lt;/i&gt; includes four indexes in which Andrew Causey, Susan Lepselter, Fred Moten, and Stephen Muecke each respond with their own compositional, conceptual, and formal staging of the worlds of the book.</description>

  <description>In Miniature takes a big look at small things. It is a celebration of the obsessive, eccentric and meticulous, and welcomes us into the world of collectors, modellers and fans. Simon Garfield is a master of finding delight and fascination in unlikely places and here we discover flea circuses, 1,000 tiny Hitlers, miniature crime scenes, model villages and railways, minuscule food and a dozen more intricately examined pursuits. Each object considered plots the course of a new miniature byway, and in unexpected ways lets us see our world in a whole new light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wide-ranging exploration of the history, psychology and fanaticism attached to working and playing in tiny worlds of our own making. We bring things down to size to understand and appreciate them. This book does the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Novelist and writing teacher Jane Alison illuminates the many shapes other than the usual wavelike “narrative arc” that can move fiction forward. The stories she loves most follow other organic patterns found in nature―spirals, meanders, and explosions, among others. Alison’s manifesto for new modes of narrative will appeal to serious readers and writers alike.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jane Alison writes in the introduction to her insightful and appealing book about the craft of writing: “For centuries there’s been one path through fiction we’re most likely to travel―one we’re actually told to follow―and that’s the dramatic arc: a situation arises, grows tense, reaches a peak, subsides. . . . But: something that swells and tautens until climax, then collapses? Bit masculo-sexual, no? So many other patterns run through nature, tracing other deep motions in life. Why not draw on them, too?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W. G. Sebald’s The Emigrants was the first novel to show Alison how forward momentum can be created by way of pattern, rather than the traditional arc―or, in nature, wave. Other writers of nonlinear prose considered in her “museum of specimens” include Nicholson Baker, Anne Carson, Marguerite Duras, Jamaica Kincaid, Clarice Lispector, Gabriel García Márquez, Susan Minot, David Mitchell, Caryl Phillips, and Mary Robison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meander, Spiral, Explode is a singular and brilliant elucidation of literary strategies that also brings high spirits and wit to its original conclusions. It is a liberating manifesto that says, Let’s leave the outdated modes behind and, in thinking of new modes, bring feeling back to experimentation. It will appeal to serious readers and writers alike.</description>

  <description>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply atmospheric and ingeniously plotted, &lt;i&gt;The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle&lt;/i&gt; is a highly original debut that will appeal to fans of Kate Atkinson and Agatha Christie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also titled as The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New from syndicated comic strip artist Mark Tatulli comes a full-color middle grade graphic novel that centers on Mark's own experience in the summer after seventh grade.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a middle schooler, Mark finds himself on the smaller side of the physical spectrum--being short AND skinny has really wreaked havoc on his confidence. So to end his bullying woes and get the girl--or at least the confidence to talk to the girl--he starts to explore bulking up by way of the miracle cures in the backs of his comics. But his obsession with beefing up is soon derailed by a new obsession: Star Wars, the hottest thing to hit the summer of 1977. As he explores his creative outlets as well as his cures to body image woes, Mark sets out to make his own stamp on the film that he loves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Tatulli's graphic novel debut is a humorous and heartfelt take on body-image, finding a creative outlet, and spending a summer in the 70's.</description>

  <description>Two estranged sisters, raised in Brooklyn and each burdened with her own shocking secret, are reunited at the Springfield Armory in the early days of WWII. While one sister lives in relative ease on the bucolic Armory campus as an officer’s wife, the other arrives as a war widow and takes a position in the Armory factories as a “soldier of production.” Resentment festers between the two, and secrets are shattered when a mysterious figure from the past reemerges in their lives.</description>

  <description>Just along King Street at number 159 you will find the old storefront of the Clyde Fans Company. It's been locked up for years now and most people would naturally assume that it's completely abandoned. Look closer. Peer in through the display window into the dimly lit office and there on the far wall you will just be able to make out the black and white photographs of a pair of rather grim looking businessmen: Abraham and Simon Matchcard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were to go in further—back through that battered safety door and into the living and work spaces of the old building you would pass into the hidden world that has sustained these lonely brothers for more than five decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this, the first of two books, you will meet the Matchcard brothers and follow them through their journeys of disappointments, loss, and isolations. Two salesmen who have failed to "close."</description>

  <description>Take a tour of America's great outdoors and discover the beauty and diversity of its most iconic and majestic national parks. Explore Florida's river-laced Everglades, travel down the white water rapids of the Grand Canyon, trek across the deserts of Death Valley and scale the soaring summits of the Rocky Mountains with this book that brings you up close to nature's greatest adventures. Packed with maps and fascinating facts about the flora and fauna unique to each park, this fully-illustrated coast-to-coast journey documents the nation’s most magnificent and sacred places—and shows why they should be preserved for future generations to enjoy. With maps and information about flora and fauna found in each of the 21 icon parks portrayed, this is a fantastic celebration of the great outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Parks include: Acadia, Badlands, Big Bend, Biscayne, Bryce Canyon, Channel Islands, Death Valley, Denali, Everglades, Glacier, Glacier Bay, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky, Mountains, Hawaii volcanoes, Isle Royal, Mesa Verde, Olympic, Sequoia and Kings Canyon, Virgin Islands, Yellowstone and Yosemite.</description>

      <![CDATA[Both expansive in scope and narrow in scale, this picture book is an interesting look at the flora and fauna, and historical stories, of many National Parks, with the final message that we all have things to see outside our spaces, if we take the time and engage our curiosity. ]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition for this book can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46347126-exhalation" rel="nofollow"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From an award-winning science fiction writer (whose short story "The Story of Your Life" was the basis for the Academy Award-nominated movie &lt;i&gt;Arrival&lt;/i&gt;), the long-awaited new collection of stunningly original, humane, and already celebrated short stories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This much-anticipated second collection of stories is signature Ted Chiang, full of revelatory ideas and deeply sympathetic characters. In "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate," a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary "Exhalation," an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in "The Lifecycle of Software Objects," a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: "Omphalos" and "Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.</description>

      <![CDATA[Lots of praise has been around for this book but I didn’t quite find it as I had expected. The ideas were interesting, and his way of looking at tech and science in these stories was intriguing, but I just never found myself as hooked as I had hoped. I suspect it is my own tastes, perhaps. ]]>

  <description>Ross Gay’s &lt;i&gt;The Book of Delights&lt;/i&gt; is a genre-defying book of essays—some as short as a paragraph; some as long as five pages—that record the small joys that occurred in one year, from birthday to birthday, and that we often overlook in our busy lives. His is a meditation on delight that takes a clear-eyed view of the complexities, even the terrors, in his life, including living in America as a black man; the ecological and psychic violence of our consumer culture; the loss of those he loves. Among Gay’s funny, poetic, philosophical delights: the way Botan Rice Candy wrappers melt in your mouth, the volunteer crossing guard with a pronounced tremor whom he imagines as a kind of boat-woman escorting pedestrians across the River Styx, a friend’s unabashed use of air quotes, pickup basketball games, the silent nod of acknowledgment between black people. And more than any other subject, Gay celebrates the beauty of the natural world—his garden, the flowers in the sidewalk, the birds, the bees, the mushrooms, the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a book of how-to or inspiration, though it could be read that way. Fans of Roxane Gay, Maggie Nelson, and Kiese Laymon will revel in Gay’s voice, and his insights.&lt;i&gt; The Book of Delights &lt;/i&gt;is about our connection to the world, to each other, and the rewards that come from a life closely observed. Gay’s pieces serve as a powerful and necessary reminder that we can, and should, stake out a space in our lives for delight. </description>

  <description>If you were a national park ranger, you'd spend every day in one of the most treasured places in America. You'd have an amazing job protecting animals, the environment, and our country's natural and historical heritage, from the wilds of Denali to the Statue of Liberty!</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a lovely introduction into the work done by park rangers at our extensive and vibrant National Park Service system, and the ways ecology and preservation work together. The book is great for younger readers, as read aloud, and could be complimented with research or travel. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A global exploration of internet memes as agents of pop culture, politics, protest, and propaganda on- and offline, and how they will save or destroy us all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memes are the street art of the social web. Using social media-driven movements as her guide, technologist and digital media scholar An Xiao Mina unpacks the mechanics of memes and how they operate to reinforce, amplify, and shape today's politics. She finds that the "silly" stuff of meme culture--the photo remixes, the selfies, the YouTube songs, and the pun-tastic hashtags--are fundamentally intertwined with how we find and affirm one another, direct attention to human rights and social justice issues, build narratives, and make culture. Mina finds parallels, for example, between a photo of Black Lives Matter protestors in Ferguson, Missouri, raising their hands in a gesture of resistance and one from eight thousand miles away, in Hong Kong, of Umbrella Movement activists raising yellow umbrellas as they fight for voting rights. She shows how a viral video of then presidential nominee Donald Trump laid the groundwork for pink pussyhats, a meme come to life as the widely recognized symbol for the international Women's March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crucially, Mina reveals how, in parts of the world where public dissent is downright dangerous, memes can belie contentious political opinions that would incur drastic consequences if expressed outright. Activists in China evade censorship by critiquing their government with grass mud horse pictures online. Meanwhile, governments and hate groups are also beginning to utilize memes to spread propaganda, xenophobia, and misinformation. Botnets and state-sponsored agents spread them to confuse and distract internet communities. On the long, winding road from innocuous cat photos, internet memes have become a central practice for political contention and civic engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Memes to Movements&lt;/i&gt; unveils the transformative power of memes, for better and for worse. At a time when our movements are growing more complex and open-ended--when governments are learning to wield the internet as effectively as protestors--Mina brings a fresh and sharply innovative take to the media discourse.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a fascinating and readable look at memes as connected to social movements, with clear ideas that one (memes) does not create the other but works hand in hand. Or can. Also explored us how authoritarian governments use memes and media for their own purpose, and it's not a stretch to see ho...]]>

  <description>Rion Kwirk comes from a rather odd family. His mother named him and his sisters after her favorite constellations, and his father makes funky-flavored jelly beans for a living. One sister acts as if she’s always onstage and the other is a walking dictionary. But no one in the family is more odd than Rion’s grandfather, Papa Kwirk. He’s the kind of guy who shows up on his motorcycle only on holidays, handing out crossbows and stuffed squirrels as presents. Rion has always been fascinated by Papa Kwirk, especially since his son—Rion’s father—is the complete opposite. Where Dad is predictable, nerdy, and reassuringly boring, Papa Kwirk is mysterious, dangerous, and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why, when Rion and his family learn of Papa Kwirk’s death and pile into the car to attend his funeral and pay their respects, Rion can’t help but feel that that’s not the end of his story. That there’s so much more to Papa Kwirk to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t know how right he is.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, aliens invaded Earth and abducted everyone they deemed useful. The only ones spared were those too young, too old, or too “disabled” to be of value. Living on Earth under the aliens’ harsh authoritarian rule, humanity’s rejects do their best to survive. Their captors never considered them a threat—until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twins Sam and Wyatt are ready to chuck their labels and start a revolution. It’s time for the kids last picked to step into the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this first volume of Jason Walz's dystopian graphic novel trilogy, the kids last picked are humanity's last hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An award-winning poet offers a brilliant introduction to the joys--and challenges--of the genre&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Don't Read Poetry&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning poet and literary critic Stephanie Burt offers an accessible introduction to the seemingly daunting task of reading, understanding, and appreciating poetry. Burt dispels preconceptions about poetry and explains how poems speak to one another--and how they can speak to our lives. She shows readers how to find more poems once they have some poems they like, and how to connect the poetry of the past to the poetry of the present. Burt moves seamlessly from Shakespeare and other classics to the contemporary poetry circulated on Tumblr and Twitter. She challenges the assumptions that many of us make about "poetry," whether we think we like it or think we don't, in order to help us cherish--and distinguish among--individual poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A masterful guide to a sometimes confounding genre, &lt;i&gt;Don't Read Poetry&lt;/i&gt; will instruct and delight ingénues and cognoscenti alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From one of the most prominent music critics writing today, a page-turning and wonderfully researched history of protest music in the twentieth century and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere does pop music collide more dramatically with the wider world than in the protest song, which forces its way into the news and prompts conversations from Washington to Westminster. Rather than being merely a worthy adjunct to the business of pop, protest music is woven into its DNA. When you listen to Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Public Enemy, or the Clash, you are not sitting down to a dusty seminar; you are hearing pop music at its most thrillingly alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;33 Revolutions Per Minute &lt;/em&gt;is the story of protest music told in 33 songs. An incisive history of a wide and shape-shifting genre, Dorian Lynskey's authoritative book takes us from the days of Billie Holliday crooning “Strange Fruit” before shocked audiences to Vietnam-era crowds voicing their resentment at the sounds of Bob Dylan to the fracas over the Dixie Chicks’ comments against George W. Bush during the Iraq War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who enjoyed Alex Ross’s &lt;em&gt;The Rest is Noise&lt;/em&gt;, Bob Dylan’s &lt;em&gt;Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;, or Simon Reynolds’ &lt;em&gt;Rip It Up and Start Again&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;33 Revolutions Per Minute&lt;/em&gt; is an absorbing and moving portrait of a century when music was the people’s truest voice.</description>

  <description>Following the 18th century Chinese mysteries &lt;em&gt;Jade Dragon Mountain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;White Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, comes the next Li Du adventure in &lt;em&gt;City of Ink&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Li Du was prepared to travel anywhere in the world except for one place: home. But to unravel the mystery that surrounds his mentor’s execution, that’s exactly where he must go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plunged into the painful memories and teeming streets of Beijing, Li Du obtains a humble clerkship that offers anonymity and access to the records he needs. He is beginning to make progress when his search for answers buried in the past is interrupted by murder in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife of a local factory owner is found dead, along with a man who appears to have been her lover, and the most likely suspect is the husband. But what Li Du’s superiors at the North Borough Office are willing to accept as a crime of passion strikes Li Du as something more calculated. As past and present intertwine, Li Du’s investigations reveal that many of Beijing’s residents ― foreign and Chinese, artisan and official, scholar and soldier ― have secrets they would kill to protect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the threats begin, Li Du must decide how much he is willing to sacrifice to discover the truth in a city bent on concealing it, a city where the stroke of a brush on paper can alter the past, change the future, prolong a life, or end one.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;The White Mirror&lt;/i&gt;, the follow-up to Elsa Hart’s critically acclaimed debut, &lt;i&gt;Jade Dragon Mountain&lt;/i&gt;, Li Du, an imperial librarian and former exile in 18th century China, is now an independent traveler. He is journeying with a trade caravan bound for Lhasa when a detour brings them to a valley hidden between mountain passes. On the icy planks of a wooden bridge, a monk sits in contemplation. Closer inspection reveals that the monk is dead, apparently of a self-inflicted wound. His robes are rent, revealing a strange symbol painted on his chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the rain turns to snow, the caravan is forced to seek hospitality from the local lord while they wait for the storm to pass. The dead monk, Li Du soon learns, was a reclusive painter. According to the family, his bizarre suicide is not surprising, given his obsession with the demon world. But Li Du is convinced that all is not as it seems. Why did the caravan leader detour to this particular valley? Why does the lord’s heir sleep in the barn like a servant? And who is the mysterious woman traveling through the mountain wilds?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in the snow, surrounded by secrets and an unexplained grief that haunts the manor, Li Du cannot distract himself from memories he’s tried to leave behind. As he discovers irrefutable evidence of the painter’s murder and pieces together the dark circumstances of his death, Li Du must face the reason he will not go home and, ultimately, the reason why he must.</description>

  <description>Join Sherman, the lovable shark, and his aquatic cohorts in the comfy environs of Sherman's Lagoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherman’s Lagoon is an imaginary lagoon somewhere in the tropics, inhabited by a cast of sea creatures whose lives are curiously similar to our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sherman, the main character, is a great white shark who is completely unaware of how intimidating his species can be. He gets pushed around by the other characters, namely: Hawthorne the hermit crab, Fillmore the sea turtle, and his wife, Megan, who is another great white shark, of course.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An innovative investigation of the inner workings of Spotify that traces the transformation of audio files into streamed experience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spotify provides a streaming service that has been welcomed as disrupting the world of music. Yet such disruption always comes at a price. Spotify Teardown contests the tired claim that digital culture thrives on disruption. Borrowing the notion of “teardown” from reverse-engineering processes, in this book a team of five researchers have playfully disassembled Spotify's product and the way it is commonly understood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spotify has been hailed as the solution to illicit downloading, but it began as a partly illicit enterprise that grew out of the Swedish file-sharing community. Spotify was originally praised as an innovative digital platform but increasingly resembles a media company in need of regulation, raising questions about the ways in which such cultural content as songs, books, and films are now typically made available online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spotify Teardown combines interviews, participant observations, and other analyses of Spotify's “front end” with experimental, covert investigations of its “back end.” The authors engaged in a series of interventions, which include establishing a record label for research purposes, intercepting network traffic with packet sniffers, and web-scraping corporate materials. The authors' innovative digital methods earned them a stern letter from Spotify accusing them of violating its terms of use; the company later threatened their research funding. Thus, the book itself became an intervention into the ethics and legal frameworks of corporate behavior.</description>

  <description>On the mountainous border of China and Tibet in 1708, a detective must learn what a killer already knows: that empires rise and fall on the strength of the stories they tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Li Du was an imperial Chinese librarian. Now he is an exile. In 1780, three years of wandering have brought him to Dayan, the last Chinese town before the Tibetan border. He expects a quiet outpost barely conscious of its place within the empire, but Dayan is teeming with travelers, soldiers, and merchants. The crowds have been drawn by the promise of an unmatched spectacle; an eclipse of the sun, commanded by the Emperor himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid the frenzy, Li Du befriends an elderly Jesuit astronomer. Hours later, the man is murdered in the home of the local magistrate, and Li Du suspects it was no random killing. Everyone has secrets: the ambitious magistrate, the powerful consort, the bitter servant, the irreproachable secretary, the East India Company merchant, the nervous missionary, and the traveling storyteller who can't keep his own story straight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the sloping roofs and festival banners, Li Du can see the pass over Jade Dragon Mountain that will take him out of China forever. But he cannot ignore the murder that the town is all too eager to forget. As Li Du investigates, he begins to suspect that the murderer intends to kill again. The eclipse is coming. Li Du must solve the murder before the sun disappears. If he does not, then someone, perhaps Li Du himself, will never again see its light.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Proust and the Squid&lt;/em&gt; follows up with a lively, ambitious, and deeply informative book that considers the future of the reading brain and our capacity for critical thinking, empathy, and reflection as we become increasingly dependent on digital technologies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade ago, Maryanne Wolf’s &lt;em&gt;Proust and the Squid&lt;/em&gt; revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing deeply on this research, this book comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us—her beloved readers—to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital mediums. Wolf raises difficult questions, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will children learn to incorporate the full range of "deep reading" processes that are at the core of the expert reading brain?&lt;br /&gt;Will the mix of a seemingly infinite set of distractions for children’s attention and their quick access to immediate, voluminous information alter their ability to think for themselves?&lt;br /&gt;With information at their fingertips, will the next generation learn to build their own storehouse of knowledge, which could impede the ability to make analogies and draw inferences from what they know?&lt;br /&gt;Will all these influences, in turn, change the formation in children and the use in adults of "slower" cognitive processes like critical thinking, personal reflection, imagination, and empathy that comprise deep reading and that influence both how we think and how we live our lives?&lt;br /&gt;Will the chain of digital influences ultimately influence the use of the critical analytical and empathic capacities necessary for a democratic society?&lt;br /&gt;How can we preserve deep reading processes in future iterations of the reading brain?&lt;br /&gt;Who are the "good readers" of every epoch?&lt;br /&gt;Concerns about attention span, critical reasoning, and over-reliance on technology are never just about children—Wolf herself has found that, though she is a reading expert, her ability to read deeply has been impacted as she has become, inevitably, increasingly dependent on screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolf draws on neuroscience, literature, education, technology, and philosophy and blends historical, literary, and scientific facts with down-to-earth examples and warm anecdotes to illuminate complex ideas that culminate in a proposal for a biliterate reading brain. Provocative and intriguing, &lt;em&gt;Reader, Come Home&lt;/em&gt; is a roadmap that provides a cautionary but hopeful perspective on the impact of technology on our brains and our most essential intellectual capacities—and what this could mean for our future.</description>

  <description>The Art of Comprehension &lt;i&gt;[creates] an invisible thread that stretches across varied professional contexts to connect art, literacy, and all content areas.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;—From the forward by Dr. Mary Howard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Art of Comprehension&lt;/i&gt;, Trevor A. Bryan introduces his signature method for enhancing students’ understanding and thinking about all texts—both written and visual. By using what he calls “access lenses” (such as faces, body language, sound/silence) you can prompt all your students to became active explorers and meaning-makers. Organically and spontaneously, your classroom will become more student-centered. &lt;br /&gt;Discover inventive ways to prompt students to notice, think about, and synthesize visuals—using the same observation and comprehension skills they can bring to reading and writing.&lt;br /&gt;Learn about ways to unravel layers of meaning in picture books, chapter books, artwork, poetry, and informational text.&lt;br /&gt;Explore the book’s eclectic collection of art and illustration, by acclaimed illustrator Peter H. Reynolds, 19th century masters, and more. &lt;br /&gt;Bryan’s approach allows all students to engage meaningfully with texts and join the classroom conversation. With this comes the greatest reward of all: confidence and independence for all kinds of learners.</description>

  <description>Murder comes to a remote fishing village. No one can imagine who he is or where he came from when the killer is caught and beaten unconscious. When he wakes, he can’t remember who he is or why he is there, sending the village into chaos and uncertainty. After an age-old ritual, the killer is handed over to a young orphaned woman living on the edge of the village. Taska Valimer is deemed his keeper for a lifetime. As secrets are revealed and the villagers begin to fear the killer will turn on them all, humanity, trust, and the darkest of human nature converge. All the villagers must face the coming darkness and with it comes treachery, deceit, intrigue, and hope.</description>

  <description>An exploration of the Earth’s underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Old Ways&lt;/em&gt;, Macfarlane takes us on an journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind. Traveling through “deep time”—the dizzying expanses of geologic time that stretch away from the present—he moves from the birth of the universe to a post-human future, from the prehistoric art of Norwegian sea caves to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, from Bronze Age funeral chambers to the catacomb labyrinth below Paris, and from the underground fungal networks through which trees communicate to a deep-sunk “hiding place” where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come. Woven through Macfarlane’s own travels are the unforgettable stories of descents into the underland made across history by explorers, artists, cavers, divers, mourners, dreamers, and murderers, all of whom have been drawn for different reasons to seek what Cormac McCarthy calls “the awful darkness within the world.”</description>

  <description>What haunts us? What can’t we let go of? A tennis prodigy collapses after his wins, crediting them to an invisible, not entirely benevolent presence, until one day he vanishes. A series of ghosts appear at their former bedsides, some distraught, some fascinated, to witness their unfamiliar occupants. A woman returns from a visit to Alcatraz with an uncomfortable feeling. The spirit of a prisoner has attached himself to you, a friend tells her. He sensed the empathy you had for those men.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Years in the making, this spellbinding, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting narrative is an unforgettable portrait of 9/11.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 9/11 book like no other. Masterfully weaving together multiple strands of the events in New York; at the Pentagon; and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, &lt;i&gt;Fall and Rise&lt;/i&gt; is a mesmerizing, minute-by-minute account of that terrible day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the days and months after 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff, then a reporter for the Boston Globe, wrote about the attacks, the victims, and their families. After additional years of meticulous reporting, Zuckoff has filled &lt;i&gt;Fall and Rise&lt;/i&gt; with voices of the lost and the saved. The result is an utterly gripping book filled with intimate stories of people most affected by the events of that sunny Tuesday in September: an out-of-work actor stuck in an elevator in the North Tower of the World Trade Center; the heroes aboard Flight 93 deciding to take action; a veteran trapped in the inferno in the Pentagon; the fire chief among the first on the scene in sleepy Shanksville; a team of firefighters racing to save an injured woman and themselves; and the men, women, and children flying across the country who suddenly faced terrorists bent on murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fall and Rise&lt;/i&gt; will open new avenues of understanding for everyone who thinks they know the story of 9/11, bringing to life—and in some cases, bringing back to life—the extraordinary ordinary people who experienced the worst day in modern American history.</description>

  <description>A bold, wry, and intimate graphic memoir about American identity, interracial families, and the realities that divide us, from the acclaimed author of The Sleepwalker’s Guide to Dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“By turns hilarious and heart-rending, it’s exactly the book America needs at this moment.”—Celeste Ng&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Who taught Michael Jackson to dance?” &lt;br /&gt;“Is that how people really walk on the moon?”&lt;br /&gt;“Is it bad to be brown?” &lt;br /&gt;“Are white people afraid of brown people?”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like many six-year-olds, Mira Jacob’s half-Jewish, half-Indian son, Z, has questions about everything. At first they are innocuous enough, but as tensions from the 2016 election spread from the media into his own family, they become much, much more complicated. Trying to answer him honestly, Mira has to think back to where she’s gotten her own answers: her most formative conversations about race, color, sexuality, and, of course, love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“How brown is too brown?”&lt;br /&gt;“Can Indians be racist?”&lt;br /&gt;“What does real love between really different people look like?”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Written with humor and vulnerability, this deeply relatable graphic memoir is a love letter to the art of conversation—and to the hope that hovers in our most difficult questions.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"In what is the most comprehensive biography of the group to date, Browne compiles a fun and fast-paced music history.... an authoritative chronicle." --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first and most complete narrative biography of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, by acclaimed music journalist and &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; senior writer David Browne&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even in the larger-than-life world of rock and roll, it was hard to imagine four more different men. David Crosby, the opinionated hippie guru. Stephen Stills, the perpetually driven musician. Graham Nash, the tactful pop craftsman. Neil Young, the creatively restless loner. But together, few groups were as in sync with their times as Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Starting with the original trio's landmark 1969 debut album, the group embodied much about its era: communal musicmaking, protest songs that took on the establishment and Richard Nixon, and liberal attitudes toward partners and lifestyles. Their group or individual songs--"Wooden Ships," "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," "After the Gold Rush," "For What It's Worth" (with Stills and Young's Buffalo Springfield), "Love the One You're With," "Long Time Gone," "Just a Song Before I Go," "Southern Cross"--became the soundtrack of a generation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But their story would rarely be as harmonious as their legendary and influential vocal blend. In the years that followed, these four volatile men would continually break up, reunite, and disband again--all against a backdrop of social and musical change, recurring disagreements and jealousies, and self-destructive tendencies that threatened to cripple them both as a group and as individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: The Wild, Definitive Saga of Rock's Greatest Supergroup&lt;/i&gt;, longtime music journalist and &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; writer David Browne presents the ultimate deep dive into rock and roll's most musical and turbulent brotherhood on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Featuring exclusive interviews with David Crosby and Graham Nash along with band members, colleagues, fellow superstars, former managers, employees, and lovers-and with access to unreleased music and documents--Browne takes readers backstage and onstage, into the musicians' homes, recording studios, and psyches, to chronicle the creative and psychological ties that have bound these men together--and sometimes torn them apart. This is the sweeping story of rock's longest-running, most dysfunctional, yet pre-eminent musical family, delivered with the epic feel their story rightly deserves.</description>

  <description>The stunning story of an Alabama serial killer and the true-crime book that Harper Lee worked on obsessively in the years after &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reverend Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim. Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell’s murderer was acquitted–thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the audience during the vigilante’s trial was Harper Lee, who had traveled from New York City to her native Alabama with the idea of writing her own &lt;i&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/i&gt;, the true-crime classic she had helped her friend Truman Capote research seventeen years earlier. Lee spent a year in town reporting, and many more working on her own version of the case. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Casey Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders to the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South. At the same time, she offers a deeply moving portrait of one of the country’s most beloved writers and her struggle with fame, success, and the mystery of artistic creativity.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is an excellent piece of reporting, from a focus first on the strange murder case that pulled in Harper Lee back to Alabama as a non-fiction writer (though she never published a thing about the case) to Lee’s struggles as a writer to follow up Mockingbird with another book. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the spirit of modern-day classics like&lt;i&gt; Fish in a Tree &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Counting by 7s&lt;/i&gt; comes the story of a deaf girl's connection to a whale whose song can't be heard by his species, and the journey she takes to help him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From fixing the class computer to repairing old radios, twelve-year-old Iris is a tech genius. But she's the only deaf person in her school, so people often treat her like she's not very smart. If you've ever felt like no one was listening to you, then you know how hard that can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she learns about Blue 55, a real whale who is unable to speak to other whales, Iris understands how he must feel. Then she has an idea: she should invent a way to "sing" to him! But he's three thousand miles away. How will she play her song for him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of heart and poignancy, this affecting story by sign language interpreter Lynne Kelly shows how a little determination can make big waves.</description>

  <description>The true story behind the acclaimed movie 12 Years a Slave, this book is based on the life of Solomon Northup, a free black man from New York who was captured in the United States and sold into slavery in Louisiana.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Solomon Northup awoke in the middle of the night with his body trembling. Slowly, he realized that he was handcuffed in a dark room and his feet were chained to the floor. He managed to slip his hand into his pocket to look for his free papers that proved he was one of 400,000 free blacks in a nation where 2.5 million other African Americans were slaves. They were gone.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; This remarkable story follows Northup through his 12 years of bondage as a man kidnapped into slavery, enduring the hardships of slave life in Louisiana. But the tale also has a remarkable ending. Northup is rescued from his master's cotton plantation in the deep South by friends in New York. This is a compelling tale that looks into a little known slice of history, sure to rivet young readers and adults alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.&lt;br /&gt;Visit &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.natgeoed.org/commoncore" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.natgeoed.org/commoncore&lt;/a&gt; for more information.</description>

  <description>Texas Institute of Letters H-E-B/Jean Flynn Children's Book Award Finalist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan's surprise attack on December 7, 1941, devastated the American Naval Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and forced America into World War II. These moving accounts of the lives affected by the assault capture the scope of the day's emotions and its influence on generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Sherry Garland's thorough research provides a background to sixteen historical and representational characters that come alive on the pages of this book. Through compelling narratives and haunting imagery, readers follow along on that fateful day as a Japanese aviator wears the belt his mother stitched for luck, an American soldier tries to arm himself during the attack, a ship's cook takes charge of a powerful gun to defend his country, and a small boy watches the USS Arizona go down in flames. The generational impact is evident years later as a young girl and her grandfather seek healing at the USS Arizona Memorial. These heart-wrenching events play out against powerful illustrations that bring the people-and the story-to life.</description>

  <description>With World War II raging and his father fighting overseas in Europe, eleven-year-old Hobie Hanson is determined to do his part to help his family and his country, even if it means giving up his beloved German shepherd, Duke. Hoping to help end the war and bring his dad home faster, Hobie decides to donate Duke to Dogs for Defense, an organization that urges Americans to "loan" their pets to the military to act as sentries, mine sniffers, and patrol dogs. Hobie immediately regrets his decision and tries everything he can to get Duke back, even jeopardizing his friendship with the new boy at school. But when his father is taken prisoner by the Germans, Hobie realizes he must let Duke go and reach deep within himself to be brave. Will Hobie ever see Duke, or his father, again?&lt;br /&gt; With powerful storytelling and gripping emotion, critically acclaimed author Kirby Larson explores the many ways bravery and love help us to weather the most difficult times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the editor of Yale's &lt;i&gt;Anthology of Graphic Fiction, Cartoons, and True Stories&lt;/i&gt;, a smart and charming guide to the art of cartooning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The best cartooning is efficient visual storytelling—it is as much a matter of writing as it is of drawing. In this book, noted cartoonist and illustrator Ivan Brunetti presents fifteen distinct lessons on the art of cartooning, guiding his readers through wittily written passages on cartooning terminology, techniques, tools, and theory. Supplemented by Brunetti's own illustrations, prepared specially for this book, these lessons move the reader from spontaneous drawings to single-panel strips and complicated multipage stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through simple, creative exercises and assignments, Brunetti offers an unintimidating approach to a complex art form. He looks at the rhythms of storytelling, the challenges of character design, and the formal elements of comics while composing pages in his own iconic style and experimenting with a variety of tools, media, and approaches. By following the author's sophisticated and engaging perspective on the art of cartooning, aspiring cartoonists of all ages will hone their craft, create their personal style, and discover their own visual language.</description>

  <description>A coming-of-age middle-grade graphic novel about summer and friendships, written and illustrated by the Eisner Award–winning and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling Hope Larson.&lt;br /&gt;Thirteen-year-old Bina has a long summer ahead of her. She and her best friend, Austin, usually do everything together, but he's off to soccer camp for a month, and he's been acting kind of weird lately anyway. So it's up to Bina to see how much fun she can have on her own. At first it's a lot of guitar playing, boredom, and bad TV, but things look up when she finds an unlikely companion in Austin's older sister, who enjoys music just as much as Bina. But then Austin comes home from camp, and he's acting even weirder than when he left. How Bina and Austin rise above their growing pains and reestablish their friendship and respect for their differences makes for a touching and funny coming-of-age story.</description>

  <description>Leonard Cohen is one of the great writers, performers, and most consistently daring artists of our time. &lt;i&gt;Book of Longing &lt;/i&gt;is Cohen’s eagerly awaited new collection of poems, following his highly acclaimed 1984 title, &lt;i&gt;Book of Mercy&lt;/i&gt;, and his hugely successful 1993 publication, &lt;i&gt;Stranger Music&lt;/i&gt;, a &lt;i&gt;Globe and Mail &lt;/i&gt;national bestseller. &lt;i&gt;Book of Longing &lt;/i&gt;contains erotic, playful, and provocative line drawings and artwork on every page, by the author, which interact in exciting and unexpected ways on the page with poetry that is timeless, meditative, and at times darkly humorous. The book brings together all the elements that have brought Leonard Cohen’s artistry with language worldwide recognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, U2, Peter Gabriel, and the Neville Brothers all have something in common: some of their best albums were produced by Daniel Lanois. A French-speaking kid from Canada, Lanois was driven by his innate curiosity and intense love of music to transcend his small-town origins and become one of the world's most prolific and successful record producers, as well as a brilliant musician in his own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanois takes us through his childhood, from being one of four kids raised by a single mother on a hairdresser's salary, to his discovery by Brian Eno, to his work on albums such as U2's &lt;i&gt;The Joshua Tree&lt;/i&gt;, Bob Dylan's &lt;i&gt;Time Out of Mind&lt;/i&gt;, and Emmylou Harris's &lt;i&gt;Wrecking Ball&lt;/i&gt;. Revealing for the first time his unique recording secrets and innovations, Lanois delves into the ongoing evolution of technology, discussing his earliest sonic experiments with reel-to-reel decks, the birth of the microchip, the death of discrete circuitry, and the arrival of the download era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part technological treatise, part philosophical manifesto on the nature of artistic excellence and the overwhelming need for music, &lt;i&gt;Soul Mining &lt;/i&gt;brings the reader viscerally inside the recording studio, where the surrounding forces have always been just as important as the resulting albums. Beyond skill, beyond record budgets, beyond image and ego, Lanois's work and music show the value of dedication and soul. His lifelong quest to find the perfect mixture of tradition and innovation is inimitable and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Figuring&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; explores the complexities of love and the human search for truth and meaning through the interconnected lives of several historical figures across four centuries--beginning with the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, and ending with the marine biologist and author Rachel Carson, who catalyzed the environmental movement. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists--mostly women, mostly queer--whose public contribution has risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience, and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures--Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman--and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry, and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;2020 Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence Finalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first novel in nearly a decade from Myla Goldberg, the award-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Bee Season&lt;/i&gt;—a compelling and wholly original story about a female photographer grappling with ambition and motherhood, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;a balancing act familiar to women of every generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Feast Your Eyes&lt;/i&gt;, framed as the catalogue notes from a photography show at the Museum of Modern Art, tells the life story of Lillian Preston: “America’s Worst Mother, America’s Bravest Mother, America’s Worst Photographer, or America’s Greatest Photographer, depending on who was talking.” After discovering photography as a teenager through her high school’s photo club, Lillian rejects her parents’ expectations of college and marriage and moves to New York City in 1955. When a small gallery exhibits partially nude photographs of Lillian and her daughter Samantha, Lillian is arrested, thrust into the national spotlight, and targeted with an obscenity charge. Mother and daughter’s sudden notoriety changes the course of both of their lives and especially Lillian’s career as she continues a life-long quest for artistic legitimacy and recognition.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Narrated by Samantha, &lt;i&gt;Feast Your Eyes &lt;/i&gt;reads as a collection of Samantha’s memories, interviews with Lillian’s friends and lovers, and excerpts from Lillian’s journals and letters—a collage of stories and impressions, together amounting to an astounding portrait of a mother and an artist dedicated, above all, to a vision of beauty, truth, and authenticity.</description>

  <description>Death, deception, and a detective with quite a lot to hide stalk the pages of Anthony Horowitz’s brilliant murder mystery, the second in the bestselling series starring Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You shouldn’t be here. It’s too late . . . “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These, heard over the phone, were the last recorded words of successful celebrity-divorce lawyer Richard Pryce, found bludgeoned to death in his bachelor pad with a bottle of wine—a 1982 Chateau Lafite worth £3,000, to be precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odd, considering he didn’t drink. Why this bottle? And why those words? And why was a three-digit number painted on the wall by the killer? And, most importantly, which of the man’s many, many enemies did the deed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baffled, the police are forced to bring in Private Investigator Daniel Hawthorne and his sidekick, the author Anthony, who’s really getting rather good at this murder investigation business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Hawthorne takes on the case with characteristic relish, it becomes clear that he, too, has secrets to hide. As our reluctant narrator becomes ever more embroiled in the case, he realizes that these secrets must be exposed—even at the risk of death . . .</description>

  <description>In these pages, some of today’s most wonderful culture-makers—writers, artists, scientists, entrepreneurs, and philosophers—reflect on the joys of reading, how books broaden and deepen human experience, and the ways in which the written word has formed their own character. On the page facing each letter, an illustration by a celebrated illustrator or graphic artist presents that artist's visual response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the diverse contributions are letters from Jane Goodall, Neil Gaiman, Jerome Bruner, Shonda Rhimes, Ursula K. Le Guin, Yo-Yo Ma, Judy Blume, Lena Dunham, Elizabeth Gilbert, and Jacqueline Woodson, as well as a ninety-eight-year-old Holocaust survivor, a pioneering oceanographer, and Italy’s first woman in space. Some of the illustrators, cartoonists, and graphic designers involved are Marianne Dubuc, Sean Qualls, Oliver Jeffers, Maira Kalman, Mo Willems, Isabelle Arsenault, Chris Ware, Liniers, Shaun Tan, Tomi Ungerer, and Art Spiegelman.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This project is woven entirely of goodwill, generosity of spirit, and a shared love of books. Everyone involved has donated their time, and all profits will go to the New York Public Library systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preface by &lt;b&gt;David Remnick&lt;/b&gt;, editor, The New Yorker; Edited and introduced by &lt;b&gt;Maria Popova&lt;/b&gt;, who has been writing since 2006 about what she reads on Brain Pickings (brainpickings.org), which is now included in the Library of Congress archive of culturally valuable materials; Edited by &lt;b&gt;Claudia Bedrick&lt;/b&gt;, publisher, editorial and art director of Enchanted Lion Books.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Joe Gunther and the VBI team are investigating a murder and an arson case--both potentially related to an outbreak of ebola.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the body of a young woman is found near a trail at a popular ski mountain, the case falls to Joe Gunther and his team at the Vermont Bureau of Investigation (VBI). They quickly have a suspect, Mick Durocher, and a confession, but not everyone on the team is convinced. Despite Mick's ready admission, investigators quickly sense there might be more going on than is immediately apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, a large local business is being targeted with escalating acts of vandalism--a warehouse fire, a vandalized truck, a massive cooling system destroyed--resulting in loss of life. And either by coincidence, or not, Mick Durocher, the self-confessed murderer, was once employed by this very company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two puzzling cases--now possibly connected--are further complicated by the sidelining of a key member of VBI, Willy Kunkle, who undergoes surgery at a hospital that appears to be having an unlikely--and suspiciously timed--outbreak of Ebola.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe and his team pursue these cases, uncovering motives that might link them, while proving that trust betrayed can be a toxic virus, turning love into murderous loathing. Indeed, behind the mayhem and murder, Joe must uncover a tragic history before another victim dies.</description>

  <description>From Acorn to Weasel: a gorgeous, hand-illustrated, large-format spellbook celebrating the magic and wonder of the natural world&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All over the country, there are words disappearing from children's lives. Words like Dandelion, Otter, Bramble, Acorn and Lark represent the natural world of childhood, a rich landscape of discovery and imagination that is fading from children's minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lost Words&lt;/i&gt; stands against the disappearance of wild childhood. It is a joyful celebration of the poetry of nature words and the living glory of our distinctive, British countryside. With acrostic spell-poems by peerless wordsmith Robert Macfarlane and hand-painted illustrations by Jackie Morris, this enchanting book captures the irreplaceable magic of language and nature for all ages.</description>

  <description>The desire to create, to write, to fulfil our artistic dreams is a powerful human need. Yet the number of people who make a living solely by their pen is actually quite small. What does that mean for the rest of us, the self-described writing geeks, who are passionate about writing and who still want to sustain successful literary lives? What does it really mean to find time to build a rewarding writing life while pursuing a career, being a partner or raising a family, in the distracted, time-deprived, 21st-century? In &lt;i&gt;The Geek's Guide to the Writing Life&lt;/i&gt;, based on her &lt;i&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt; blog of the same name, Stephanie Vanderslice shares the secrets and tools to developing a successful, rewarding writing practice in a way that inspires the reader to persevere through the inevitable lows and even the highs of a literary life, so that anyone can pursue the path to realizing their artistic dreams.</description>

  <description>After writing more than one hundred books, it still amazes me that I have been lucky enough to spend most of my life doing what I truly love: writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes a writer?

  <description>Almost 100 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat, Sojourner Truth was mistreated by a streetcar conductor. She took him to court--and won! Before she was Sojourner Truth, she was known simply as Belle. Born a slave in New York sometime around 1797, she was later sold and separated from her family. Even after she escaped from slavery, she knew her work was not yet done. She changed her name and traveled, inspiring everyone she met and sharing her story until her death in 1883 at age eighty-six. In this easy-to-read biography, Yona Zeldis McDonough continues to share that remarkable story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Renowned, award-winning author Avi pens a stark, unflinching tale of ordinary boys living in wartime as tensions — and desperations — mount among them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Patryk knows little of the world beyond his tiny Polish village; the Russians have occupied the land for as long as anyone can remember, but otherwise life is unremarkable. Patryk and his friends entertain themselves by coming up with dares — some more harmful than others — until the Germans drop a bomb on the schoolhouse and the Great War comes crashing in. As control of the village falls from one nation to another, Jurek, the ringleader of these friends, devises the best dare yet: whichever boy steals the finest military button will be king. But as sneaking buttons from uniforms hanging to dry progresses to looting the bodies of dead soldiers — and as Jurek’s obsession with being king escalates — Patryk begins to wonder whether their “button war” is still just a game. When devastation reaches their doorstep, the lines between the button war and the real war blur, especially for the increasingly callous Jurek. Master of historical fiction Avi delivers a fierce account of the boys of one war-torn village who are determined to prove themselves with a simple dare that spins disastrously out of control.</description>

  <description>How does one pay homage to A Tribe Called Quest? The seminal rap group brought jazz into the genre, resurrecting timeless rhythms to create masterpieces such as &lt;i&gt;The Low End Theory&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Midnight Marauders&lt;/i&gt;. Seventeen years after their last album, they resurrected themselves with an intense, socially conscious record, &lt;i&gt;We Got It from Here . . . Thank You 4 Your Service&lt;/i&gt;, which arrived when fans needed it most, in the aftermath of the 2016 election. Poet and essayist Hanif Abdurraqib digs into the group's history and draws from his own experience to reflect on how its distinctive sound resonated among fans like himself. The result is as ambitious and genre-bending as the rap group itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdurraqib traces the Tribe's creative career, from their early days as part of the Afrocentric rap collective known as the Native Tongues, through their first three classic albums, to their eventual breakup and long hiatus. Their work is placed in the context of the broader rap landscape of the 1990s, one upended by sampling laws that forced a reinvention in production methods, the East Coast-West Coast rivalry that threatened to destroy the genre, and some record labels' shift from focusing on groups to individual MCs. Throughout the narrative Abdurraqib connects the music and cultural history to their street-level impact. Whether he's remembering &lt;i&gt;The Source&lt;/i&gt; magazine cover announcing the Tribe's 1998 breakup or writing personal letters to the group after bandmate Phife Dawg's death, Abdurraqib seeks the deeper truths of A Tribe Called Quest; truths that--like the low end, the bass--are not simply heard in the head, but felt in the chest.</description>

  <description>Witty and moving, this debut memoir in essays from the dynamic rapper and singer Dessa, is a candid account of her life in the van as a hard-touring musician, her determination to beat long odds to make a name for herself as a performing artist, and her struggle to fall out of love with someone in her band. In a literary, honest style, evoking Amanda Palmer and Miranda July, Dessa demonstrates just how far the mind can travel while the body is on the six-hour ride to the next rap show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dessa defies category--she is an academic with an international rap career; a lyrical writer fascinated by behavioral science; and a funny, charismatic performer dogged by blue moods and a perseverant case of heartache. In "The Fool That Bets Against Me," Dessa wonders if the romantic anguish that's helped her write so many sad songs might be an insurable professional asset. To find out, she applies to Geico for coverage. "A Ringing in the Ears" tells the story of her father building an airplane in their backyard garage--a task that took him almost seven years. The essay titled "Congratulations" reflects on recording a song for The Hamilton Mixtape in a Minneapolis basement, straining for a high note and hoping for a break. The last piece in the collection, "Call off Your Ghost," relays the fascinating project Dessa undertook with a team of neuroscientists that employed fMRI technology and neurofeedback to try to clinically excise her romantic feelings for an old flame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her onstage and backstage stories are offset by her varied fascinations--she studies sign language, algebra, neuroanatomy--and this collection is a prism of her intellectual life. Her writing is infused with fascinating bits of science and sociology, philosophical insights, and an abiding tenderness for the people she tours with and the people she leaves behind to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dessa's music has been praised as "forceful and whip-smart" (NPR) with a sound "like no one else" (The Los Angeles Times); and My Own Devices is as uncompromising and brilliant. Dessa finds unconventional approaches to all of her subjects--braiding her lived experience with academic research and a poet's tone and timing. In the vein of thinkers who defy categorization, we get the debut of a deft, likable, and unusual voice.</description>

  <description>The legend of Bruce Springsteen may well outlast rock ’n’ roll itself. And for all the muscle and magic of his life-shaking concerts with the E Street Band, his legendary status comes down to the songs. He is an acknowledged master of music and lyrics, with decades of hits, from “Blinded by the Light” and “Born to Run” to “Hungry Heart,” “Dancing in the Dark,” and “The Rising.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Bruce Springsteen: The Stories Behind the Songs, &lt;/i&gt;longtime &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; writer Brian Hiatt digs into the writing and recording of these songs and all the others on Springsteen’s studio albums, from 1973’s &lt;i&gt;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. &lt;/i&gt;to 2014’s &lt;i&gt;High Hopes&lt;/i&gt; (plus all the released outtakes), and offers a unique look at the legendary rocker’s methods, along with historical context, scores of colorful anecdotes, and more than 180 photographs. Hiatt has interviewed Springsteen five times in the past and has conducted numerous new interviews with his collaborators, from longtime producers to the E Street Band, to create an authoritative and lushly illustrated journey through Springsteen’s entire songbook and career.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>Rose Howard has Asperger’s syndrome, and an obsession with homonyms (even her name is a homonym). She gave her dog Rain a name with two homonyms (Reign, Rein), which, according to Rose’s rules of homonyms, is very special. Rain was a lost dog Rose’s father brought home. Rose and Rain are practically inseparable. And they are often home alone, as Rose’s father spends most evenings at a bar, and doesn’t have much patience for his special-needs daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a storm hits town, Rain goes missing. Rose’s father shouldn’t have let Rain out. Now Rose has to find her dog, even if it means leaving her routines and safe places to search. Rose will find Rain, but so will Rain’s original owners.</description>

  <description>The first twelve awe-inspiring issues of the most awesomely off beat series off all time - collected in one sense-staggering volume. Twelve titanic tales of triumph and tragedy in the mighty Marvel tradition! Spanning from: What if Spider-Man Joined the Fantastic Four? to: What if the Fantastic Four had Diff erent Super-Powers? Daredevil's secret exposed? The identity of Thor passed down to another? A new Hulk? Multiple Spider-Men? Some of the ideas that shook Marvel's foundation got their start right in the realm of remote possibility overseen by the wondering Watcher! But can even Uatu believe his eyes when Jack "King" Kirby rewrites himself and his fellow legends as the Fantastic Four?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLLECTING: &lt;/b&gt;WHAT IF?

  <description>Newbery Medalist Christopher Paul Curtis brings his trademark humor and heart to the story of a boy struggling to do right in the face of history's cruelest evils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve-year-old Charlie is down on his luck: His dad just died, the share crops are dry, and the most fearsome man in Possum Moan, Cap’n Buck, says Charlie’s dad owed him a lot of money. Fearing for his life, Charlie strikes a deal to repay his father’s debt by accompanying Cap’n Buck to Detroit in pursuit of some folks who have stolen from him. It’s not too bad of a bargain for Charlie . . . until he comes face-to-face with the fugitives and discovers that they escaped slavery years ago and have been living free. Torn between his guilty conscience and his survival instinct, Charlie needs to figure out his next move—and soon. It’s only a matter of time before Cap’n Buck catches on . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Bookends&lt;/i&gt;, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon offers a compilation of pieces about literature - age-old classics as well as his own - that presents a unique look into his literary origins and influences, the books that shaped his taste and formed his ideas about writing and reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chabon asks why anyone would write an introduction or, for that matter, read one. His own daughter Rose prefers to skip them. Chabon's answer is simple and simultaneously profound: "a hope of bringing pleasure for the reader". Likewise, afterwords - they are all about shared pleasure, about the "pure love" of a work of art that has inspired, awakened, transformed the reader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this thought-provoking compendium is a series of love letters and thank-you notes, unified by the simple theme of the shared pleasure of discovery, whether it's the boyhood revelation of the most important story in Chabon's life (Ray Bradbury's "The Rocket Man"); a celebration of "the greatest literary cartographer of the planet Mars" (Edgar Rice Burroughs, with his character John Carter); a reintroduction to a forgotten master of ghost stories (M. R. James, ironically "the happiest of men"); the recognition that the worlds of Wes Anderson's films are reassembled scale models of our own broken reality (as is all art); Chabon's own rude awakening from the muse as he writes his debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&lt;/i&gt;; or a playful parody of lyrical interpretation in the liner notes for Mark Ronson's &lt;i&gt;Uptown Special&lt;/i&gt;, the true purpose of which, Chabon insists, is to "spread the gospel of sensible automotive safety and maintenance practices".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Galaxies away from academic or didactic, Bookends celebrates wonder - and like the copy of &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Tollbooth&lt;/i&gt; handed to young Michael by a friend of his father he never saw again, it is a treasured gift.</description>

      <![CDATA[It’s kinda strange to read intros and outros isolated and out of context but I like Chabon enough to appreciate his writing, and the book’s profits benefit a writing organization, so there’s that. The best for me was an intro for Summerland, a fav of mine]]>

  <description>This novel-in-verse plunges readers into the heart of the experience of the March on Washington, capturing the emotions of the day from multiple points of view. Throughout this moving, beautifully crafted collection of poems, six “soloists” tell their personal tales of how the March changed them. These voices are interwoven with those of more than 35 others, combining to share one incredible story of that important day. From a woman singing through a terrifying bus ride to DC to a young child riding above the crowd on her father’s shoulders, each voice brings something different and fresh to the story, making the March completely accessible to young readers. Based on extensive research, Poet Laureate J. Patrick Lewis and highly-lauded poet George Ella Lyon have crafted a unique and beautiful account of this important moment in our history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A collection of confessional, hilarious, heartbreaking notes written anonymously on a public typewriter for fans of &lt;i&gt;PostSecret &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Other People's Love Letters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Michael Gustafson and his wife Hilary opened Literati Bookstore in Ann Arbor, Michigan, they put out a typewriter for anyone to use. They had no idea what to expect. Would people ask metaphysical questions? Write mean things? Pour their souls onto the page? Yes, no, and &lt;i&gt;did they ever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, people of all ages sit down at the public typewriter. Children perch atop grandparents' knees, both sets of hands hovering above the metal keys: &lt;i&gt;I LOVE YOU.&lt;/i&gt; Others walk in alone on Friday nights and confess their hopes: &lt;i&gt;I will find someone someday.&lt;/i&gt; And some leave funny asides for the next person who sits down: &lt;i&gt;I dislike people, misanthropes, irony, and ellipses ... and lists too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Notes from a Public Typewriter&lt;/i&gt; Michael and designer Oliver Uberti have combined their favorite notes with essays and photos to create an ode to community and the written word that will surprise, delight, and inspire.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Step back to British-held Boston and hear the voices of citizens, militiamen, and redcoats at a turning of the tide in the American Revolution, brought to life in Roxane Orgill's deft verse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the summer of 1775. The British occupy Boston and its busy harbor, holding residents captive and keeping a strong military foothold. The threat of smallpox looms, and the town is cut off, even from food supplies. Following the battles of Lexington and Concord, Congress unanimously elects George Washington commander in chief of the American armed forces, and he is sent to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to transform the ragtag collection of volunteer militiamen into America's first army. So far the war is nothing more than a series of intermittent skirmishes, but Washington is in constant fear of attack — until he takes the offensive with results that surprise everyone, the British most of all.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A boy tries to steer a safe path through the projects in Harlem in the wake of his brother’s death in this outstanding debut novel that celebrates community and creativity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Christmas Eve in Harlem, but twelve-year-old Lolly Rachpaul and his mom aren’t celebrating. They’re still reeling from his older brother’s death in a gang-related shooting just a few months earlier. Then Lolly’s mother’s girlfriend brings him a gift that will change everything: two enormous bags filled with Legos. Lolly’s always loved Legos, and he prides himself on following the kit instructions exactly. Now, faced with a pile of building blocks and no instructions, Lolly must find his own way forward.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His path isn’t clear—and the pressure to join a “crew,” as his brother did, is always there. When Lolly and his friend are beaten up and robbed, joining a crew almost seems like the safe choice. But building a fantastical Lego city at the community center provides Lolly with an escape—and an unexpected bridge back to the world. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;David Barclay Moore paints a powerful portrait of a boy teetering on the edge—of adolescence, of grief, of violence—and shows how Lolly’s inventive spirit helps him build a life with firm foundations and open doors.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six: The band's album &lt;i&gt;Aurora&lt;/i&gt; came to define the rock 'n' roll era of the late seventies, and an entire generation of girls wanted to grow up to be Daisy. But no one knows the reason behind the group's split on the night of their final concert at Chicago Stadium on July 12, 1979 . . . until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it’s the rock 'n' roll she loves most. By the time she’s twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she’s pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

  <description>It’s one of the first things we discover as children, reading and drawing: Maps have a unique power to transport us to distant lands on wondrous travels. Put a map at the start of a book, and we &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;an adventure is going to follow. Displaying this truth with beautiful full-color illustrations, &lt;i&gt;The Writer’s Map &lt;/i&gt;is an atlas of the journeys that our most creative storytellers have made throughout their lives. This magnificent collection encompasses not only the maps that appear in their books but also the many maps that have inspired them, the sketches that they used while writing, and others that simply sparked their curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Philip Pullman recounts the experience of drawing a map as he set out on one of his early novels, &lt;i&gt;The Tin Princess&lt;/i&gt;. Miraphora Mina recalls the creative challenge of drawing up ”The Marauder’s Map” for the &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/i&gt;films. David Mitchell leads us to the Mappa Mundi by way of &lt;i&gt;Cloud Atlas &lt;/i&gt;and his own sketch maps. Robert Macfarlane reflects on the cartophilia that has informed his evocative nature writing, which was set off by Robert Louis Stevenson and his map of &lt;i&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/i&gt;. Joanne Harris tells of her fascination with Norse maps of the universe. Reif Larsen writes about our dependence on GPS and the impulse to map our experience. Daniel Reeve describes drawing maps and charts for &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/i&gt;film trilogy. This exquisitely crafted and illustrated atlas explores these and so many more of the maps writers create and are inspired by—some real, some imagined—in both words and images.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Amid a cornucopia of 167 full-color images, we find here maps of the world as envisaged in medieval times, as well as maps of adventure, sci-fi and fantasy, nursery rhymes, literary classics, and collectible comics. An enchanting visual and verbal journey, &lt;i&gt;The Writer’s Map &lt;/i&gt;will be irresistible for lovers of maps, literature, and memories—and anyone prone to flights of the imagination.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>In the first novel in Marlon James's Dark Star trilogy, myth, fantasy, and history come together to explore what happens when a mercenary is hired to find a missing child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: "He has a nose," people say. Engaged to track down a mysterious boy who disappeared three years earlier, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a group that comes together to search for the boy. The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written an adventure that's also an ambitious, involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf explores the fundamentals of truths, the limits of power, the excesses of ambition, and our need to understand them all.</description>

With &lt;i&gt;Bluets&lt;/i&gt;, Maggie Nelson has entered the pantheon of brilliant lyric essayists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie Nelson is the author of numerous books of poetry and nonfiction, including &lt;i&gt;Something Bright, Then Holes&lt;/i&gt; (Soft Skull Press, 2007) and &lt;i&gt;Women, the New York School, and Other True Abstractions&lt;/i&gt; (University of Iowa Press, 2007).

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lessons, demonstrations, definitions, and tips on what to expect in art school, what it means to make art, and how to think like an artist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the first thing to learn in art school? "Art can be anything." The second thing? "Learn to draw." With &lt;i&gt;101 Things to Learn in Art School&lt;/i&gt;, artist and teacher Kit White delivers and develops such lessons, striking an instructive balance between technical advice and sage concepts. These 101 maxims, meditations, and demonstrations offer both a toolkit of ideas for the art student and a set of guiding principles for the artist. Complementing each of the 101 succinct texts is an equally expressive drawing by the artist, often based on a historical or contemporary work of art, offering a visual correlative to the written thought. "Art can be anything" is illustrated by a drawing of Duchamp's famous urinal; a description of chiaroscuro art is illuminated by an image "after Caravaggio"; a lesson on time and media is accompanied by a view of a Jenny Holzer projection; advice about surviving a critique gains resonance from Piero della Francesca's arrow-pierced Saint Sebastian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;101 Things to Learn in Art School &lt;/i&gt;offers advice about the issues artists confront across all artistic media, but this is no simple handbook to making art. It is a guide to understanding art as a description of the world we live in, and it is a guide to using art as a medium for thought. And so this book belongs on the reading list of art students, art teachers, and artists, but it also belongs in the library of everyone who cares about art as a way of understanding life.</description>

  <description>In 2009, while thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, Robert Moor began to wonder about the paths that lie beneath our feet: &lt;i&gt;How do they form? Why do some improve over time while others fade? What makes us follow or strike off on our own? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the next seven years, Moor traveled the globe, exploring trails of all kinds, from the miniscule to the massive. He learned the tricks of master trail-builders, hunted down long-lost Cherokee trails, and traced the origins of our road networks and the Internet. In each chapter, Moor interweaves his adventures with findings from science, history, philosophy, and nature writing—combining the nomadic joys of Peter Matthiessen with the eclectic wisdom of Lewis Hyde’s &lt;i&gt;The Gift&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, Moor reveals how this single topic—the oft-overlooked trail—sheds new light on a wealth of age-old questions: How does order emerge out of chaos? How did animals first crawl forth from the seas and spread across continents? How has humanity’s relationship with nature and technology shaped world around us? And, ultimately, how does each of us pick a path through life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moor has the essayist’s gift for making new connections, the adventurer’s love for paths untaken, and the philosopher’s knack for asking big questions. With a breathtaking arc that spans from the dawn of animal life to the digital era, &lt;i&gt;On Trails&lt;/i&gt; is a book that makes us see our world, our history, our species, and our ways of life anew.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How online affinity networks expand learning and opportunity for young people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boyband One Direction fanfiction writers, gamers who solve math problems together, Harry Potter fans who knit for a cause. Across subcultures and geographies, young fans have found each other and formed community online, learning from one another along the way. From these and other in-depth case studies of online affinity networks, Affinity Online considers how young people have found new opportunities for expanded learning in the digital age. These cases reveal the shared characteristics and unique cultures and practices of different online affinity networks, and how they support "connected learning"--learning that brings together youth interests, social activity, and accomplishment in civic, academic, and career relevant arenas. Although involvement in online communities is an established fixture of growing up in the networked age, participation in these spaces show how young people are actively taking up new media for their own engaged learning and social development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While providing a wealth of positive examples for how the online world provides new opportunities for learning, the book also examines the ways in which these communities still reproduce inequalities based on gender, race, and socioeconomic status. The book concludes with a set of concrete suggestions for how the positive learning opportunities offered by online communities could be made available to more young people, at school and at home. Affinity Online explores how online practices and networks bridge the divide between in-school and out-of-school learning, finding that online affinity networks are creating new spaces of opportunity for realizing the ideals of connected learning.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Using humor as the common denominator, a multicultural cast of YA authors steps up to the mic to share stories touching on race.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen in as ten YA authors -- some familiar, some new -- use their own brand of humor to share their stories about growing up between cultures. Henry Choi Lee discovers that pretending to be a tai chi master or a sought-after wiz at math wins him friends for a while -- until it comically backfires. A biracial girl is amused when her dad clears seats for his family on a crowded subway in under a minute flat, simply by sitting quietly in between two uptight white women. Edited by acclaimed author and speaker Mitali Perkins, this collection of fiction and nonfiction uses a mix of styles as diverse as their authors, from laugh-out-loud funny to wry, ironic, or poingnant, in prose, poetry, and comic form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitali Perkins&lt;br /&gt;David Yoo&lt;br /&gt;Cherry Cheva&lt;br /&gt;Varian Johnson&lt;br /&gt;G. Neri&lt;br /&gt;Naomi Shihab Nye&lt;br /&gt;Olugbemisola Rhuday-Perkovich&lt;br /&gt;Debbie Rigaud&lt;br /&gt;Francisco X. Stork&lt;br /&gt;Gene Luen Yang</description>

  <description>Washington Black is an eleven-year-old field slave who knows no other life than the Barbados sugar plantation where he was born. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his master's eccentric brother chooses him to be his manservant, Wash is terrified of the cruelties he is certain await him. But Christopher Wilde, or "Titch," is a naturalist, explorer, scientist, inventor, and abolitionist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He initiates Wash into a world where a flying machine can carry a man across the sky; where two people, separated by an impossible divide, might begin to see each other as human; and where a boy born in chains can embrace a life of dignity and meaning. But when a man is killed and a bounty is placed on Wash's head, Titch abandons everything to save him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is their flight along the eastern coast of America, and, finally, to a remote outpost in the Arctic, where Wash, left on his own, must invent another new life, one which will propel him further across the globe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the sultry cane fields of the Caribbean to the frozen Far North, &lt;i&gt;Washington Black&lt;/i&gt; tells a story of friendship and betrayal, love and redemption, of a world destroyed and made whole again--and asks the question, what is true freedom?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Smart, hilarious, and engaging, MATH WITH BAD DRAWINGS is a delightful &lt;i&gt;re&lt;/i&gt;-education in math that empowers readers with a joyful appreciation and powerful understanding of how math works in our daily lives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;MATH WITH BAD DRAWINGS&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; Ben Orlin answers math's three big questions: Why do I need to learn this? When am I ever going to use it? Why is it so hard? The answers come in various forms-cartoons, drawings, jokes, and the stories and insights of an empathetic teacher who believes that math should belong to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eschewing the tired old curriculum that begins in the wading pool of addition and subtraction and progresses to the shark infested waters of calculus (AKA the Great Weed Out Course), Orlin instead shows us how to think&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;like a mathematician by teaching us a new game of Tic-Tac-Toe, how to understand an economic crisis by rolling a pair of dice, and the mathematical reason why you should never buy a second lottery ticket. &lt;br /&gt; Every example in the book is illustrated with his trademark "bad drawings," which convey both his humor and his message with perfect pitch and clarity. Organized by unconventional but compelling topics such as "Statistics: The Fine Art of Honest Lying," "Design: The Geometry of Stuff That Works," and "Probability: The Mathematics of Maybe," MATH WITH BAD DRAWINGS is a perfect read for fans of illustrated popular science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From the award-winning author of All the Broken Pieces and Serafina's Promise comes a new novel-in-verse that is a gripping, transcendent story about a little-known piece of slave history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day Grace is called from the slave cabins to work in the Big House, Mama makes her promise to keep her eyes down. Uncle Jim warns her to keep her thoughts tucked private in her mind or they could bring a whole lot of trouble and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more Grace sees of the heartless Master and hateful Missus, the more a rightiness voice clamors in her head-asking how come white folks can own slaves, sell them on the auction block, and separate families forever. When that voice escapes without warning, it sets off a terrible chain of events that prove Uncle Jim's words true. Suddenly, Grace and her family must flee deep into the woods, where they brave deadly animals, slave patrollers, and the uncertainty of ever finding freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With candor and compassion, Ann E. Burg unearths a startling chapter of American history -- the remarkable story of runaways who sought sanctuary in the wilds of the Great Dismal Swamp -- and creates a powerful testament to the right of every human to be free.</description>

  <description>In the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;Wonder,&lt;/i&gt; readers were introduced to memorable English teacher Mr. Browne and his love of precepts. Simply put, precepts are principles to live by, and Mr. Browne has compiled 365 of them—one for each day of the year—drawn from popular songs to children’s books to inscriptions on Egyptian tombstones to fortune cookies. His selections celebrate kindness, hopefulness, the goodness of human beings, the strength of people’s hearts, and the power of people’s wills. Interspersed with the precepts are letters and emails from characters who appeared in &lt;i&gt;Wonder.&lt;/i&gt; Readers hear from Summer, Jack, Charlotte, Julian, and Amos.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; There’s something for everyone here, with words of wisdom from such noteworthy people as Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., Confucius, Goethe, Sappho—and over 100 readers of &lt;i&gt;Wonder&lt;/i&gt; who sent R. J. Palacio their own precepts.</description>

  <description>Did you know that Nintendo started in the mid-19th century as a playing card company and that the Japanese giant also sold rice and operated taxi cabs? And did you know that the very first video game was called &lt;i&gt;Tennis for Two&lt;/i&gt; and was created by a US government scientist named William Higinbotham? Today, video games play a gigantic role in our culture and none of this would have been possible without people like Shigeru Miyamoto, the creative mastermind that turned a failed business venture into the game that eventually inspired him to build &lt;i&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mario Bros.&lt;/i&gt;, or Donna Bailey, who created the arcade video game sensation &lt;i&gt;Centipede&lt;/i&gt;. With full-color illustrations and lively text, and chock-full of interesting facts, &lt;i&gt;Awesome Minds: Video Game Creators&lt;/i&gt; tells the stories of these amazing men and women who turned a small hobby into a multimillion-dollar industry that changed the way we play and interact, from our living rooms to the arcades, on our computers to our handheld devices. &lt;i&gt;Awesome Minds: Video Game Creators&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect read for those with creative spirits, curious minds, and a love of technology and video games.</description>

  <description>Thirteen hundred gates have opened to solar systems around the galaxy. But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries and threats grow deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed, and to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father's godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cortázar and the Mephistophelian prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue, but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father the emperor doesn't guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of the Rocinante fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte's authoritarian regime. Memory of the old order falls away, and a future under Laconia's eternal rule -- and with it, a battle that humanity can only lose - seems more and more certain. Because against the terrors that lie between worlds, courage and ambition will not be enough...</description>

  <description>The Free Navy – a violent group of Belters in black-market military ships – has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence among the outer planets. The colony ships heading for the thousand new worlds on the far side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains strong enough to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Holden and his crew know the strengths and weaknesses of this new force better than anyone. Outnumbered and outgunned, the embattled remnants of the old political powers call on the Rocinante for a desperate mission to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the new alliances are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power has only just begun. As the chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens. Pirate fleets, mutiny, and betrayal may be the least of the Rocinante’s problems. And in the uncanny spaces past the ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate people may determine the fate of more than just humanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The idea was deceptively simple: &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author A.J. Jacobs decided to thank every single person involved in producing his morning cup of coffee. The resulting journey takes him across the globe, transforms his life, and reveals secrets about how gratitude can make us all happier, more generous, and more connected.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author A.J. Jacobs discovers that his coffee—and every other item in our lives—would not be possible without hundreds of people we usually take for granted: farmers, chemists, artists, presidents, truckers, mechanics, biologists, miners, smugglers, and goatherds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By thanking these people face to face, Jacobs finds some much-needed brightness in his life. Gratitude does not come naturally to Jacobs—his disposition is more Larry David than Tom Hanks—but he sets off on the journey on a dare from his son. And by the end, it’s clear to him that scientific research on gratitude is true. Gratitude’s benefits are legion: It improves compassion, heals your body, and helps battle depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacobs gleans wisdom from vivid characters all over the globe, including the Minnesota miners who extract the iron that makes the steel used in coffee roasters, to the Madison Avenue marketers who captured his wandering attention for a moment, to the farmers in Colombia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Jacobs provides wonderful insights and useful tips, from how to focus on the hundreds of things that go right every day instead of the few that go wrong. And how our culture overemphasizes the individual over the team. And how to practice the art of “savoring meditation” and fall asleep at night. &lt;i&gt;Thanks a Thousand&lt;/i&gt; is a reminder of the amazing interconnectedness of our world. It shows us how much we take for granted. It teaches us how gratitude can make our lives happier, kinder, and more impactful. And it will inspire us to follow our own “Gratitude Trails.”</description>

  <description>FOREWORD BY SHERYL SANDBERG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve almost certainly laughed at Scovell’s jokes—you just didn’t know it until now.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just the Funny Parts&lt;/em&gt; is a juicy and scathingly funny insider look at how pop culture gets made. For more than thirty years, writer, producer and director Nell Scovell worked behind the scenes of iconic TV shows, including &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons, Late Night with David Letterman, Murphy Brown,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;NCIS,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Muppets,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&lt;/em&gt;, which she created and executive produced.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2009, Scovell gave up her behind-the-scenes status when the David Letterman sex scandal broke. Only the second woman ever to write for his show, Scovell used the moment to publicly call out the lack of gender diversity in late-night TV writers’ rooms. “One of the boys” came out hard for “all of the girls.” Her criticisms fueled a cultural debate. Two years later, Scovell was collaborating with Sheryl Sandberg on speeches and later on&lt;em&gt; Lean In&lt;/em&gt;, which resulted in a worldwide movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Scovell is opening up with this fun, honest, and often shocking account. Scovell knows what it’s like to put words in the mouths of President Barack Obama, Mark Harmon, Candice Bergen, Bob Newhart, Conan O’Brien, Alyssa Milano, and Kermit the Frog, among many others. Through her eyes, you’ll sit in the Simpson writers’ room… stand on the Oscar red carpet… pin a tail on Miss Piggy…bond with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;’s Leonard Nimoy… and experience a Stephen King-like encounter with Stephen King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just the Funny Parts&lt;/em&gt; is a fast-paced account of a nerdy girl from New England who fought her way to the top of the highly-competitive, male-dominated entertainment field. The book delivers invaluable insights into the creative process and tricks for navigating a difficult workplace. It's part memoir, part how-to, and part survival story. Or, as Scovell puts it, “It’s like &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt;, but funnier and with slightly less torture.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Kampung Boy &lt;/i&gt;is a favorite of millions of readers in Southeast Asia. With masterful economy worthy of Charles Schultz, Lat recounts the life of Mat, a Muslim boy growing up in rural Malaysia in the 1950s: his adventures and mischief-making, fishing trips, religious study, and work on his family's rubber plantation. Meanwhile&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;the traditional way of life in his village (or &lt;i&gt;kampung&lt;/i&gt;) is steadily disappearing, with tin mines and factory jobs gradually replacing family farms and rubber small-holders. When Mat himself leaves for boarding school, he can only hope that his familiar &lt;i&gt;kampung&lt;/i&gt; will still be there when he returns. &lt;i&gt;Kampung Boy&lt;/i&gt; is hilarious and affectionate, with brilliant, super-expressive artwork that opens a window into a world that has now nearly vanished.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; National Book Award finalist Sy Montgomery reflects on the personalities and quirks of 13 animals--her friends--who have profoundly affected her in this stunning, poetic, and life-affirming memoir featuring illustrations by Rebecca Green.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding someone who belongs to another species can be transformative. No one knows this better than author, naturalist, and adventurer Sy Montgomery. To research her books, Sy has traveled the world and encountered some of the planet's rarest and most beautiful animals. From tarantulas to tigers, Sy's life continually intersects with and is informed by the creatures she meets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This restorative memoir reflects on the personalities and quirks of thirteen animals--Sy's friends--and the truths revealed by their grace. It also explores vast themes: the otherness and sameness of people and animals; the various ways we learn to love and become empathetic; how we find our passion; how we create our families; coping with loss and despair; gratitude; forgiveness; and most of all, how to be a good creature in the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hilarious collection inspired by a former &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt; writer's real experiences in Hollywood, chronicling the absurdity of fame and the humanity of failure in a world dominated by social media influencers and reality TV stars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon Rich is "one of the funniest writers in America" (Daily Beast)--a humorist who draws comparisons to Douglas Adams (&lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;) and James Thurber and P.G. Wodehouse (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;). With &lt;i&gt;Hits and Misses&lt;/i&gt;, he's back with a hilarious new collection of stories about dreaming big and falling flat, about ordinary people desperate for stardom and the stars who are bored by having it all.&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by Rich's real experiences in Hollywood, &lt;i&gt;Hits and Misses&lt;/i&gt; chronicles all the absurdity of fame and success alongside the heartbreaking humanity of failure. From a bitter tell-all by the horse Paul Revere rode to greatness to a gushing magazine profile of everyone's favorite World War II dictator, these stories roam across time and space to skewer our obsession with making it big--from the days of ancient Babylon to the age of TMZ.</description>

  <description>The seventh novel in James S. A. Corey's New York Times bestselling Expanse series--now a major television series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AN OLD ENEMY RETURNS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the thousand-sun network of humanity's expansion, new colony worlds are struggling to find their way. Every new planet lives on a knife edge between collapse and wonder, and the crew of the aging gunship Rocinante have their hands more than full keeping the fragile peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the vast space between Earth and Jupiter, the inner planets and belt have formed a tentative and uncertain alliance still haunted by a history of wars and prejudices. On the lost colony world of Laconia, a hidden enemy has a new vision for all of humanity and the power to enforce it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New technologies clash with old as the history of human conflict returns to its ancient patterns of war and subjugation. But human nature is not the only enemy, and the forces being unleashed have their own price. A price that will change the shape of humanity -- and of the Rocinante -- unexpectedly and forever...</description>

  <description>Rebecca Solnit is the author of more than twenty books including the international bestseller &lt;em&gt;Men Explain Things to Me&lt;/em&gt;. Called “the voice of the resistance” by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, she has emerged as an essential guide to our times, through incisive commentary on feminism, violence, ecology, hope, and everything in between.&lt;p&gt;In this powerful and wide-ranging collection of essays, Solnit turns her attention to the war at home. This is a war, she says, “with so many casualties that we should call it by its true name, this war with so many dead by police, by violent ex-husbands and partners and lovers, by people pursuing power and profit at the point of a gun or just shooting first and figuring out who they hit later.” To get to the root of these American crises, she contends that “to acknowledge this state of war is to admit the need for peace,” countering the despair of our age with a dose of solidarity, creativity, and hope.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this freewheeling collection of short stories and vignettes, the famed French&lt;br /&gt;cartoonist examines not only the music, but the nature of the jazz sub-culture.&lt;br /&gt;The grumpy festival goer, the curmudgeonly collector, and many other fan&lt;br /&gt;“types” are the targets of his unerring gimlet eye. Drawn in a range of styles as&lt;br /&gt;improvisational as Coltrane and Mingus — everything from loose linework&lt;br /&gt;to tight pen and ink to gestural pencils — Blutch captures the excitement of&lt;br /&gt;live performance, the lovelorn, and the Great Jazz Detective, who is out but&lt;br /&gt;not down.</description>

  <description>Food. Shelter. Warmth. Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people’s voices, singing – the fifth essential necessity of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick Coleman’s new book is an exploration of what singing means and how it works. What does it do to us to listen hard and habitually to somebody else’s singing? And why is the singing of others so essential to human life? Why do we love it so?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book asks many other questions too. What was Roy Orbison’s problem? Who does Joni Mitchell think she is? Why did Jagger and Lennon sing like that (and not like this)? What did Aretha Franklin do to deserve the title ‘Queen of Soul’? For that matter, what is 'soul’? What is the point of crooning? What does it say about you if Frank Sinatra leaves you cold? Billie, Janis, Amy: must the voices of anguish always dissolve into spectacle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The history of post-war popular music is traditionally told sociologically or in terms of musicological influence and innovation in style. &lt;i&gt;Voices&lt;/i&gt; takes a different tack. In ten discrete but cohering essays Coleman tackles the arc of that history as if it were an emotional experience with real psychological consequences – as chaotic, random, challenging and unpredictable as life itself. It is the story of what it is to listen and learn. Above all, it is a story of what it means to feel.</description>

  <description>Toby is a happy-go-lucky charmer who's dodged a scrape at work and is celebrating with friends when the night takes a turn that will change his life: he surprises two burglars who beat him and leave him for dead. Struggling to recover from his injuries, beginning to understand that he might never be the same man again, he takes refuge at his family's ancestral home to care for his dying uncle Hugo. Then a skull is found in the trunk of an elm tree in the garden - and as detectives close in, Toby is forced to face the possibility that his past may not be what he has always believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Witch Elm&lt;/i&gt; asks what we become, and what we're capable of, when we no longer know who we are.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the essay "Feel Me" by Roxane Gay:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Niche dating sites are interesting. You can go to JDate or Christian Mingle or Black People Meet or any number of dating websites. If you have certain criteria, you can find people who look like you or share your faith or enjoy having sex in furry costumes. No one is alone in their interests. When you go to these niche dating sites, you can hope you are working with a known quantity. You can hope that in love online, a lingua franca will make all things possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the essay "An American Sex Tourist in Thailand" by Alex Jung:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;After I booked a plane ticket to Bangkok, the first thing I did was type "gay Thailand" into the Google search bar.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frequencies &lt;/i&gt;is a biannual journal of artful essays, sharply illustrated by artist John Gagliano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Volume 2 &lt;/i&gt;features Roxane Gay writing on issues of belonging in middle class black America, Alex Jung on the gay tourist sex trade in Thailand, and Kate Zambreno on the brief career but lasting impact of actress and director Barbara Loden. Plus: much more to come!</description>

  <description>Time moves slowly on vacation. And for someone who has spent a long time entertaining themselves and has had the garden, the kitchen, forest paths, the lake, and even Grandpa all to herself, it can be hard to invite another in on the fun. So when a young girl’s grandfather brings an elephant home to stay, she is not pleased at all. Nostalgic and often dreamlike, this wordless story is about interrupted solitude, learning to be together with another, and how the choices we make deeply affect our lives.</description>

  <description>In the male-dominated field of animation, Mel Vaught and Sharon Kisses are a dynamic duo, the friction of their differences driving them: Sharon, quietly ambitious but self-doubting; Mel, brash and unapologetic, always the life of the party. Best friends and artistic partners since the first week of college, where they bonded over their working-class roots and obvious talent, they spent their twenties ensconced in a gritty Brooklyn studio. Working, drinking, laughing. Drawing: Mel, to understand her tumultuous past, and Sharon, to lose herself altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a decade of striving, the two are finally celebrating the release of their first full-length feature, which transforms Mel’s difficult childhood into a provocative and visually daring work of art. The toast of the indie film scene, they stand at the cusp of making it big. But with their success come doubt and destruction, cracks in their relationship threatening the delicate balance of their partnership. Sharon begins to feel expendable, suspecting that the ever-more raucous Mel is the real artist. During a trip to Sharon’s home state of Kentucky, the only other partner she has ever truly known—her troubled, charismatic childhood best friend, Teddy—reenters her life, and long-buried resentments rise to the surface, hastening a reckoning no one sees coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The inimitably witty David Rakoff, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Don’t Get Too Comfortable&lt;/i&gt;, defends the commonsensical notion that you should always assume the worst, because you’ll never be disappointed. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In this deeply funny (and, no kidding, wise and poignant) book, Rakoff examines the realities of our sunny,  gosh­ everyone-can-be-a-star contemporary culture and finds that, pretty much as a universal rule, the best is not yet to come, adversity will triumph, justice will not be served, and your dreams won’t come true. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The book ranges from the personal to the universal, combining stories from Rakoff’s reporting and accounts of his own experi­ences: the moment when being a tiny child no longer meant adults found him charming but instead meant other children found him a fun target; the perfect late evening in Manhattan when he was young and the city seemed to brim with such pos­sibility that the street shimmered in the moonlight—as he drew closer he realized the streets actually flickered with rats in a feeding frenzy. He also weaves in his usual brand Oscar Wilde–worthy cultural criticism (the tragedy of Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, for instance). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether he’s lacerating the musical &lt;i&gt;Rent &lt;/i&gt;for its cutesy depic­tion of AIDS or dealing with personal tragedy, his sharp obser­vations and humorist’s flair for the absurd will have you positively reveling in the power of negativity.</description>

  <description>In an age of confusion, fear, and loss, Hanif Abdurraqib's is a voice that matters. Whether he's attending a Bruce Springsteen concert the day after visiting Michael Brown's grave, or discussing public displays of affection at a Carly Rae Jepsen show, he writes with a poignancy and magnetism that resonates profoundly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of the nightclub attacks in Paris, he recalls how he sought refuge as a teenager in music, at shows, and wonders whether the next generation of young Muslims will not be afforded that opportunity now. While discussing the everyday threat to the lives of black Americans, Abdurraqib recounts the first time he was ordered to the ground by police officers: for attempting to enter his own car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essays that have been published by the New York Times, MTV, and Pitchfork, among others—along with original, previously unreleased essays—Abdurraqib uses music and culture as a lens through which to view our world, so that we might better understand ourselves, and in so doing proves himself a bellwether for our times.</description>

  <description>Novelist, comics writer, scriptwriter, poet and occasional artist, there are few creative avenues Neil Gaiman hasn't venture down - from unforgettable books like The ocean at the end of the lane and American gods to groundbreaking comics and graphic novels like The Sandman and Violent cases; from big screen fantasies like Coraline and Stardust to small screen epics like Doctor Who and Neverwhere; and from short stories to songwriting, stage plays to radio plays, journalism to filmmaking, and all points in-between. This tells the full story of his amazing creative life. Never-before-seen manuscripts, notes, cartoons, drawings and personal photographs from Neil's own archive are complemented by artwork and sketches from all of his major works, and his own intimate recollections. Each project is examined from genesis to fruition, and positioned in the wider narrative of Gaiman's crative life, affording unparalleled access to the inner workings of the writers mind</description>

  <description>Test your musical knowledge with this fun compilation, filled with 100 beautifully designed infographics, that pays homage to the songs we can’t get out of our heads—inspired by lyrics from artists such as Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Paul Simon, TLC, Bob Dylan, Weezer, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge friends and family to "name that tune" with this entertaining collection of references to pop lyrics. Featuring a minimalist and artful design, &lt;em&gt;Pop Charts&lt;/em&gt; reinterprets lines from songs that have become part of the zeitgeist. Classics, earworms, and cult hits are reimagined with cool, playful infographic designs—from David Bowie’s &lt;em&gt;Space Oddity&lt;/em&gt; to the Beastie Boys’ &lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt; and Beyoncé’s &lt;em&gt;Run the World.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an appealing retro look, the full-page designs of &lt;em&gt;Pop Charts&lt;/em&gt; give a clever new twist to pop music’s most hummable songs. The flip side of each designed page includes the tune’s name, and the book includes a full bibliography of every song included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pop Charts&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for music and pop culture enthusiasts and modern design fans.</description>

  <description>Whether she is contemplating the history of walking as a cultural and political experience over the past two hundred years (&lt;i&gt;Wanderlust&lt;/i&gt;), or using the life of photographer Eadweard Muybridge as a lens to discuss the transformations of space and time in late nineteenth-century America (&lt;i&gt;River of Shadows&lt;/i&gt;), Rebecca Solnit has emerged as an inventive and original writer whose mind is daring in the connections it makes. &lt;i&gt;A Field Guide to Getting Lost&lt;/i&gt; draws on emblematic moments and relationships in Solnit's own life to explore the issues of wandering, being lost, and the uses of the unknown. The result is a distinctive, stimulating, and poignant voyage of discovery.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Junior Library Guild Selection * Kids’ Indie Next List Pick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Leslie Connor, award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Waiting for Normal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Crunch&lt;/em&gt;, comes a soaring and heartfelt story about love, forgiveness, and how innocence makes us all rise up. &lt;em&gt;All Rise for the Honorable Perry T. Cook&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful story, perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Wonder&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;When You Reach Me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven-year-old Perry was born and raised by his mom at the Blue River Co-ed Correctional Facility in tiny Surprise, Nebraska. His mom is a resident on Cell Block C, and so far Warden Daugherty has made it possible for them to be together. That is, until a new district attorney discovers the truth—and Perry is removed from the facility and forced into a foster home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Perry moves to the “outside” world, he feels trapped. Desperate to be reunited with his mom, Perry goes on a quest for answers about her past crime. As he gets closer to the truth, he will discover that love makes people resilient no matter where they come from . . . but can he find a way to tell everyone what home truly means?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The official behind-the-scenes companion guide to the first two seasons of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; and beyond, featuring exclusive color photos and stunning concept art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This book has been designed to mimic a used book. The marks, scuffs, and tears on the cover and pages are an intentional design element.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger things have happened. . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; debuted on Netflix in the summer of 2016, the show struck a nerve with millions of viewers worldwide and received broad critical acclaim. The series has gone on to win six Emmy Awards, but its success was driven more than anything by word of mouth, resonating across generations. Viewers feel personal connections to the characters. Now fans can immerse themselves in the world—or worlds—of Hawkins, Indiana, like never before. Inside you’ll find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• original commentary and a foreword from creators Matt and Ross Duffer&lt;br /&gt;• exclusive interviews with the stars of the show, including Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, and David Harbour&lt;br /&gt;• the show’s earliest drafts, pitches to Netflix, and casting calls&lt;br /&gt;• insights into the Duffers’ creative process from the entire crew—from costume and set designers to composers and visual-effects specialists&lt;br /&gt;• deep dives into the cultural artifacts and references that inspired the look and feel of the show&lt;br /&gt;• a map of everyday Hawkins—with clues charting the network of the Upside Down&lt;br /&gt;• the Morse code disk Eleven uses, so you can decipher secret messages embedded throughout the text&lt;br /&gt;• a look into the future of the series—including a sneak preview of season three!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding whole new layers to enrich the viewing experience, this keepsake is essential reading for anyone and everyone who loves &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>For John Borne's family, hunting has nothing to do with sport or manliness. It's a matter of survival. Every fall John and his grandfather go off into the woods to shoot the deer that puts meat on the table over the long Minnesota winter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But this year John's grandfather is dying, and John must hunt alone. John tracks a doe for two days, but as he closes in on his prey, he realizes he cannot shoot her. For John, the hunt is no longer about killing, but about life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Combining Neil Gaiman's extraordinary words with Chris Riddell's deft and striking illustrations, &lt;i&gt;Art Matters&lt;/i&gt; will inspire its readers to seize the day in the name of art. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil Gaiman once said that 'the world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before'. This little book is the embodiment of that vision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn together from speeches, poems and creative manifestos, &lt;i&gt;Art Matters&lt;/i&gt; will explore how reading, imagining and creating can change the world. A creative call to arms, the book will champion freedom of ideas, making art in the face of adversity and choosing to be bold. It will be inspirational to young and old, and will encourage glorious, creative rebellion.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows there are different kinds of teachers. The good ones. The not-so-good ones. The boring ones, the mean ones, the ones who try too hard. The ones you’ll never remember, and the ones you want to forget. But Ms. Bixby is none of these. She’s the sort of teacher who makes you feel like the indignity of school is worthwhile. Who makes the idea of growing up less terrifying. Who you never want to disappoint. What Ms. Bixby is, is one of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Topher, Brand, and Steve know this better than anyone. And so when Ms. Bixby unexpectedly announces that she is very sick and won’t be able to finish the school year, they come up with a plan. Through the three very different stories they tell, we begin to understand just what Ms. Bixby means to Topher, Brand, and Steve—and what they are willing to go to such great lengths to tell her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;John David Anderson, the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Sidekicked&lt;/em&gt;, returns with a story of three kids, a very special teacher, and one day that none of them will ever forget.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Subverting convention, award-winning creators M. T. Anderson and Eugene Yelchin pair up for an anarchic, outlandish, and deeply political saga of warring elf and goblin kingdoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uptight elfin historian Brangwain Spurge is on a mission: survive being catapulted across the mountains into goblin territory, deliver a priceless peace offering to their mysterious dark lord, and spy on the goblin kingdom — from which no elf has returned alive in more than a hundred years. Brangwain’s host, the goblin archivist Werfel, is delighted to show Brangwain around. They should be the best of friends, but a series of extraordinary double crosses, blunders, and cultural misunderstandings throws these two bumbling scholars into the middle of an international crisis that may spell death for them — and war for their nations. Witty mixed media illustrations show Brangwain’s furtive missives back to the elf kingdom, while Werfel’s determinedly unbiased narrative tells an entirely different story. A hilarious and biting social commentary that could only come from the likes of National Book Award winner M. T. Anderson and Newbery Honoree Eugene Yelchin, this tale is rife with thrilling action and visual humor . . . and a comic disparity that suggests the ultimate victor in a war is perhaps not who won the battles, but who gets to write the history.</description>

  <description>Before our history began, another now forgotten civilization thrived. The people who roamed Early Earth were much like us: curious, emotional, funny, ambitious, and vulnerable. In this series of illustrated and linked tales, Isabel Greenberg chronicles the explorations of a young man as he paddles from his home in the North Pole to the South Pole. There, he meets his true love, but their romance is ill-fated. Early Earth's unusual and finicky polarity means the lovers can never touch. &lt;br /&gt;     As intricate and richly imagined as the work of Chris Ware, and leavened with a dry wit that rivals Kate Beaton's in &lt;i&gt;Hark! A Vagrant&lt;/i&gt;, Isabel Greenberg's debut will be a welcome addition to the thriving graphic novel genre.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From award-winning author Jewell Parker Rhodes, a powerful novel set fifteen years after the 9/11 attacks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her fifth-grade teacher hints that a series of lessons about home and community will culminate with one big answer about two tall towers once visible outside their classroom window, Deja can't help but feel confused. She sets off on a journey of discovery, with new friends Ben and Sabeen by her side. But just as she gets closer to answering big questions about who she is, what America means, and how communities can grow (and heal), she uncovers new questions, too. Like, why does Pop get so angry when she brings up anything about the towers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Award-winning author Jewell Parker Rhodes tells a powerful story about young people who weren't alive to witness this defining moment in history, but begin to realize how much it colors their every day.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A panoramic experience that tells the story of Beastie Boys, a book as unique as the band itself--by band members ADROCK and Mike D, with contributions from Amy Poehler, Colson Whitehead, Spike Jonze, Wes Anderson, Luc Sante, and more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formed as a New York City hardcore band in 1981, Beastie Boys struck an unlikely path to global hip hop superstardom. Here is their story, told for the first time in the words of the band. Adam "ADROCK" Horovitz and Michael "Mike D" Diamond offer revealing and very funny accounts of their transition from teenage punks to budding rappers; their early collaboration with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin; the debut album that became the first hip hop record ever to hit #1, &lt;i&gt;Licensed to Ill&lt;/i&gt;--and the album's messy fallout as the band broke with Def Jam; their move to Los Angeles and rebirth with the genre-defying masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Paul's Boutique; &lt;/i&gt;their evolution as musicians and social activists over the course of the classic albums &lt;i&gt;Check Your Head, Ill Communication, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Hello Nasty &lt;/i&gt;and the Tibetan Freedom Concert benefits conceived by the late Adam "MCA" Yauch; and more. For more than thirty years, this band has had an inescapable and indelible influence on popular culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a style as distinctive and eclectic as a Beastie Boys album, &lt;i&gt;Beastie Boys Book &lt;/i&gt;upends the typical music memoir. Alongside the band narrative you will find rare photos, original illustrations, a cookbook by chef Roy Choi, a graphic novel, a map of Beastie Boys' New York, mixtape playlists, pieces by guest contributors, and many more surprises.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;This is a powerful and timely story about one boy's epic journey across Africa to Europe, a graphic novel for all children with glorious colour artwork throughout. From Eoin Colfer, previously Irish Children's Laureate, and the team behind his bestselling Artemis Fowl graphic novels. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebo: alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His sister left months ago. Now his brother has disappeared too, and Ebo knows it can only be to make the hazardous journey to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebo's epic journey takes him across the Sahara Desert to the dangerous streets of Tripoli, and finally out to the merciless sea. But with every step he holds on to his hope for a new life, and a reunion with his sister.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A Kirkus Best Middle Grade Book of 2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddle up for a life-defining, death-defying adventure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Johnson has lost just about everyone he's ever loved. He lost his pa in an accident. He lost his ma and his little sister to sickness. And now, he's lost his pony--fast, fierce, beautiful Sarah, taken away by a man who had no right to take her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph can sure enough get her back, though. The odds are stacked against him, but he isn't about to give up. He will face down deadly animals, dangerous men, and the fury of nature itself on his quest to be reunited with the only family he has left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Joseph Johnson may have lost just about everything; but he hasn't lost hope. And he hasn't lost the fire in his belly that says he's getting his Sarah back--no matter what.</description>

  <description>Isaiah Quintabe--IQ for short--has never been more successful, or felt more alone. A series of high-profile wins in his hometown of East Long Beach have made him so notorious that he can hardly go to the corner store without being recognized. Dodson, once his sidekick, is now his full-fledged partner, hell-bent on giving IQ's PI business some real legitimacy: a Facebook page, and IQ's promise to stop accepting Christmas sweaters and carpet cleanings in exchange for PI services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when a young painter approaches IQ for help tracking down her missing mother, it's not just the case Isaiah's looking for, but the human connection. And when his new confidant turns out to be connected to a dangerous paramilitary operation, IQ falls victim to a threat even a genius can't see coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for Isaiah around every corner is Seb, the Oxford-educated African gangster who was responsible for the death of his brother, Marcus. Only, this time, Isaiah's not alone. Joined by a new love interest and his familiar band of accomplices, IQ is back--and the adventures are better than ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The singer, guitarist, and songwriter, best known for this work with Wilco, opens up about his past, his songs, the music, and the people that have inspired him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few bands have inspired as much devotion as the Chicago rock band Wilco, and it's thanks, in large part, to the band's singer, songwriter, and guiding light: Jeff Tweedy. But while his songs and music have been endlessly discussed and analyzed, Jeff has rarely talked so directly about himself, his life, and his artistic process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. In his long-awaited memoir, Jeff will tell stories about his childhood in Belleville, Illinois; the St. Louis record store, rock clubs, and live-music circuit that sparked his songwriting and performing career; and the Chicago scene that brought it all together. He'll also talk in-depth about his collaborators in Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, and more; and write lovingly about his parents, wife Sue, and sons, Spencer and Sam. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honest, funny, and disarming, Tweedy's memoir will bring readers inside both his life and his musical process, illuminating his singular genius and sharing his story, voice, and perspective for the first time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Blending scholarly evidence and the experiences of numerous families, The Art of Screen Time is a well-researched and reassuring guide to raising kids in a world where technology is everywhere." -danah boyd, author of &lt;i&gt;It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally there's a no-nonsense, don't-panic, evidence-based guide to one of the biggest challenges facing parents today: managing a world where screens are everywhere we look.&lt;br /&gt;With this book, Anya Kamenetz--a journalist, an award-winning expert on both education and technology, and a mother of two young children--takes a refreshingly practical approach. She surveys both the experts and hundreds of fellow parents to find out how they really manage screensat home--for their children and themselves. Cutting through a thicket of inconclusive studies and overblown claims, she hones a simple message, a riff on Michael Pollan's well-known "food rules": Enjoy Screens. Not too much. Mostly with others.&lt;br /&gt;Realistic, wise, and disarmingly candid, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Screen Time&lt;/i&gt; shows us how to set aside our digital anxiety and create space for a happy, healthy family life.</description>

  <description>Essays on Storytelling. In over 30 essays, written over 20 years, one of the world's great story-tellers meditates on story-telling. Warm, funny, generous, entertaining, and above all, deeply considered, they offer thoughts on a wide variety of topic, including the origin and composition of Philip's own stories, the craft of writing and the story-tellers who have meant the most to him. The art of story-telling is everywhere present in the essays themselves, in the instantly engaging tone, the vivid imagery and the striking phrases, the resonant anecdotes, the humour and learnedness. Together, they are greater than the sum of their parts.</description>

  <description>On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; reporter and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt;, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witness the fate of beloved heroes - and enemies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS FINALLY TIPPED...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precarious equilibrium among four Londons has reached its breaking point. Once brimming with the red vivacity of magic, darkness casts a shadow over the Maresh Empire, leaving a space for another London to rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL CRUMBLE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell - once assumed to be the last surviving &lt;i&gt;Antari&lt;/i&gt; - begins to waver under the pressure of competing loyalties. And in the wake of tragedy, can Arnes survive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL RISE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila Bard, once a commonplace - but never common - thief, has survived and flourished through a series of magical trials. But now she must learn to control the magic, before it bleeds her dry. Meanwhile, the disgraced Captain Alucard Emery of the &lt;i&gt;Night Spire&lt;/i&gt; collects his crew, attempting a race against time to acquire the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHO WILL TAKE CONTROL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And an ancient enemy returns to claim a crown while a fallen hero tries to save a world in decay.</description>

  <description>A startling and eye-opening look into America’s First Family, &lt;i&gt;Never Caught&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful narrative of Ona Judge, George and Martha Washington’s runaway slave who risked it all to escape the nation’s capital and reach freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When George Washington was elected president, he reluctantly left behind his beloved Mount Vernon to serve in Philadelphia, the temporary seat of the nation’s capital, after a brief stay in New York. In setting up his household he took Tobias Lear, his celebrated secretary, and nine slaves, including Ona Judge, about which little has been written. As he grew accustomed to Northern ways, there was one change he couldn’t get his arms around: Pennsylvania law required enslaved people be set free after six months of residency in the state. Rather than comply, Washington decided to circumvent the law. Every six months he sent the slaves back down south just as the clock was about to expire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Ona Judge lived a life of relative comfort, the few pleasantries she was afforded were nothing compared to freedom, a glimpse of which she encountered first-hand in Philadelphia. So, when the opportunity presented itself one clear and pleasant spring day in Philadelphia, Judge left everything she knew to escape to New England. Yet freedom would not come without its costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At just twenty-two-years-old, Ona became the subject of an intense manhunt led by George Washington, who used his political and personal contacts to recapture his property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impeccably researched, historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar weaves a powerful tale and offers fascinating new scholarship on how one young woman risked it all to gain freedom from the famous founding father.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The much-awaited third installment in Riad Sattouf's graphic memoir--which has been translated into fifteen languages and become an international phenomenon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Arab of the Future&lt;/i&gt; is the widely acclaimed, internationally bestselling graphic memoir that tells the story of Riad Sattouf's peripatetic childhood in the Middle East. In the first volume, which covers the years 1978-1984, his family moves between rural France, Libya, and Syria, where they eventually settle in his father's native village of Ter Maaleh, near Homs. The second volume recounts young Riad's first year attending school in Syria (1984-1985), where he dedicates himself to becoming a true Syrian in the country of Hafez al-Assad. In this third volume, (1985-1987), Riad's mother, fed up with the grinding reality of daily life in the village, decides she cannot take it any longer. When she resolves to move back France, young Riad sees his father torn between his wife's aspirations and the weight of family traditions.</description>

  <description>A JUNIOR LIBRARY GUILD SELECTION&lt;br /&gt;Do you believe everything you read in the newspaper?&lt;br /&gt;Early in August 1937, a news flash came: a sea monster had been spotted lurking off the shore of Nantucket Island. Historically, the Massachusetts island had served as port for whaling ships. Eyewitnesses swore this wasn’t a whale, but some new, fearsome creature. As eyewitness account piled up, newspaper stories of the sea monster spread quickly. Across the nation, people shivered in fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, footprints were found on a Nantucket beach. Photographs were sent to prominent biologists for their opinion. Discussion swirled about raising a hunting party.&lt;br /&gt;On August 18, news spread across the island: the sea monster had been captured. Islanders ran to the beach and couldn’t believe their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nonfiction picture book is a perfect tool to discuss non-political fake news stories.&lt;br /&gt;Back matter discusses the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Quotes from Thomas Jefferson make it clear that fake news has always been one of the costs of a free press. A Timeline lists actual events in the order they occurred. A vocabulary list defines relevant words.</description>

  <description>Originally performed at the Kennedy Center for the unveiling of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and later as a tribute to Walter Dean Myers, this stirring and inspirational poem is &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author and National Book Award finalist Jason Reynolds’s rallying cry to the dreamers of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For Every One &lt;/i&gt;is just that: for every one. For every one person. For every one dream. But especially for every one kid. The kids who dream of being better than they are. Kids who dream of doing more than they almost dare to dream. Kids who are like Jason Reynolds, a self-professed dreamer. Jason does not claim to know how to make dreams come true; he has, in fact, been fighting on the front line of his own battle to make his own dreams a reality. He expected to make it when he was sixteen. Then eighteen. Then twenty-five. Now, some of those expectations have been realized. But others, the most important ones, lay ahead, and a lot of them involve kids, how to inspire them. All the kids who are scared to dream, or don’t know how to dream, or don’t dare to dream because they’ve NEVER seen a dream come true. Jason wants kids to know that dreams take time. They involve countless struggles. But no matter how many times a dreamer gets beat down, the drive and the passion and the hope never fully extinguish—because just having the dream is the start you need, or you won’t get anywhere anyway, and that is when you have to take a leap of faith.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A pitch perfect graduation, baby, or love my kid gift.</description>

  <description>Multimedia artist Charles Glaubitz delivers his first graphic novel, a work of mythical, pictorial, illustrative, and cosmological components, while combining elements of myth, religion, and spirituality with comics, hermetic ideas, alchemy and science. Light travels through space and brings a prophecy of the awakening of the Crystal Sigil. At the same time, the secret society of Illuminati steals from the four elements to create a new fifth element that has the power to become any object of desire. The ensuing epic battle pits the warrior-like Starseed Children — who are the end result of the evolution of revolution within our system of genetics, philosophy, science, and art — against the Illuminati and their masters, the Annunaki, and the coming of the black darkness. </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;With contributions from Cheryl Strayed, Mark Cuban, Ta-Nahesi Coates, Melinda Gates, Joss Whedon, James Patterson, and many more--this fascinating collection gives us a peek into 150 personal treasures and the secret histories behind them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us have that one object that holds deep meaning--something that speaks to our past, that carries a remarkable story. Bestselling author Bill Shapiro collected this sweeping range of stories--he talked to everyone from renowned writers to &lt;em&gt;Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt; hosts, from blackjack dealers to teachers, truckers, and nuns, even a reformed counterfeiter--to reveal the often hidden, always surprising lives of objects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Adam Resnick, an Emmy Award-winning writer for NBC’s &lt;i&gt;Late Night with David Letterman, &lt;/i&gt;has spent his entire life trying to avoid interaction with people. While courageously admitting to being "euphorically antisocial" and "sick in the head," he allows us to plunge even deeper into his troubled psyche in this unabashedly uproarious memoir-in-essays where we observe Resnick’s committed indifference to family, friends, strangers, and the world at large. His mind shaped by such touchstone events as a traumatic Easter egg hunt when he was six (which solidified his hatred of parties) and overwrought by obsessions, including one with a plastic shopping bag (which solidified his hatred for change), he refuses to be burdened by chores like basic social obligation and personal growth, living instead by his own steadfast rule: "I refuse to do anything I don’t want to do."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cut from a similar (if somewhat stranger) cloth as Albert Brooks or Louis C.K., Resnick is the crazy, miserable bastard you can’t help rooting for, and the brilliant &lt;i&gt;Will Not Attend &lt;/i&gt;showcases this seasoned comedy writer at his brazenly hilarious best.</description>

  <description>In celebration of &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; thirtieth anniversary, the show’s longest-serving writer and producer offers a humorous look at the writing and making of the legendary Fox series that has become one of the most revered artistic achievements in television history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four-time Emmy winner Mike Reiss—who has worked on&lt;em&gt; The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; continuously since episode one in 1989—shares stories, scandals, and gossip about working with America’s most iconic cartoon family ever. Reiss explains how the episodes are created, and provides an inside look at the show’s writers, animators, actors and celebrity guests. He answers a range of questions from &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; fans and die-hards, and reminisces about the making of perennially favorite episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his freewheeling, irreverent comic style, Reiss reflects on his lifetime inside &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt;—a personal highlights reel of his achievements, observations, and favorite stories. &lt;em&gt;Springfield Confidential&lt;/em&gt; exposes why Matt Groening decided to make all of the characters yellow; dishes on what it’s like to be crammed in a room full of funny writers sixty hours a week; and tells what Reiss learned after traveling to seventy-one countries where &lt;em&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; is watched (ironic note: there’s no electricity in many of these places); and even reveals where Springfield is located! He features unique interviews with Judd Apatow, who also provided the foreword, and Conan O'Brien, as well as with Simpsons legends Al Jean, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Cary Elwes’ &lt;em&gt;As You Wish&lt;/em&gt;, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong’s &lt;em&gt;Seinfeldia&lt;/em&gt;, and Chris Smith’s &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show: An Oral History&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Springfield Confidential&lt;/em&gt; is a funny, informational, and exclusive look at one of the most beloved programs in all of television land.</description>

      <![CDATA[Interesting look at how the show gets written and made, and certainly has funny moments. I found the writing — of the book, not the show — to be a bit weak. Which is strange. Still, an easy fun read.]]>

  <description>Comprising a selection of essays, &lt;i&gt;Upstream&lt;/i&gt; finds beloved poet Mary Oliver reflecting on her astonishment and admiration for the natural world and the craft of writing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she contemplates the pleasure of artistic labor, finding solace and safety within the woods, and the joyful and rhythmic beating of wings, Oliver intimately shares with her readers her quiet discoveries, boundless curiosity, and exuberance for the grandeur of our world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This radiant collection of her work, with some pieces published here for the first time, reaffirms Oliver as a passionate and prolific observer whose thoughtful meditations on spiders, writing a poem, blue fin tuna, and Ralph Waldo Emerson inspire us all to discover wonder and awe in life's smallest corners.</description>

  <description>It has been four months since a mysterious obsidian stone fell into Kell's possession. Four months since his path crossed with Delilah Bard. Four months since Prince Rhy was wounded, and since the nefarious Dane twins of White London fell, and four months since the stone was cast with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, restless after having given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws closer, carrying old friends back into port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone in the night will reappear in the morning. But the balance of magic is ever perilous, and for one city to flourish, another London must fall.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;Roller Girl&lt;/i&gt; is back with a graphic novel about starting middle school, surviving your embarrassing family, and the Renaissance Faire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eleven-year-old Imogene (Impy) has grown up with two parents working at the Renaissance Faire, and she's eager to begin her own training as a squire. First, though, she'll need to prove her bravery. Luckily Impy has just the quest in mind--she'll go to public school after a life of being homeschooled! But it's not easy to act like a noble knight-in-training in middle school. Impy falls in with a group of girls who seem really nice (until they don't) and starts to be embarrassed of her thrift shop apparel, her family's unusual lifestyle, and their small, messy apartment. Impy has always thought of herself as a heroic knight, but when she does something really mean in order to fit in, she begins to wonder whether she might be more of a dragon after all.</description>

  <description>Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.</description>

  <description>In this timely and essential book that offers a fresh take on the qualms of modern day life, Professor Alan Lightman investigates the creativity born from allowing our minds to freely roam, without attempting to accomplish anything and without any assigned tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are all worried about wasting time. Especially in the West, we have created a frenzied lifestyle in which the twenty-­four hours of each day are carved up, dissected, and reduced down to ten minute units of efficiency. We take our iPhones and laptops with us on vacation. We check email at restaurants or our brokerage accounts while walking in the park. When the school day ends, our children are overloaded with “extras.” Our university curricula are so crammed our young people don’t have time to reflect on the material they are supposed to be learning. Yet in the face of our time-driven existence, a great deal of evidence suggests there is great value in “wasting time,” of letting the mind lie fallow for some periods, of letting minutes and even hours go by without scheduled activities or intended tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gustav Mahler routinely took three or four-­hour walks after lunch, stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook. Carl Jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he visited his country house. In his 1949 autobiography, Albert Einstein described how his thinking involved letting his mind roam over many possibilities and making connections between concepts that were previously unconnected. With &lt;i&gt;In Praise of Wasting Time&lt;/i&gt;, Professor Alan Lightman documents the rush and heave of the modern world, suggests the technological and cultural origins of our time-­driven lives, and examines the many values of “wasting time”—for replenishing the mind, for creative thought, and for finding and solidifying the inner self. Break free from the idea that we must not waste a single second, and discover how sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The fourth novel in James S.A. Corey’s New York Times bestselling Expanse series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them, the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the gates and the protomolecule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Holden and his crew must also contend with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden - with help from the ghostly Detective Miller - can find the cure.</description>

  <description>With passion and curiosity, Alan Lightman explores the emotional and philosophical questions raised by recent discoveries in science. He looks at the dialogue between science and religion; the conflict between our human desire for permanence and the impermanence of nature; the possibility that our universe is simply an accident; the manner in which modern technology has separated us from direct experience of the world; and our resistance to the view that our bodies and minds can be explained by scientific logic and laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind all of these considerations is the suggestion--at once haunting and exhilarating--that what we see and understand of the world is only a tiny piece of the extraordinary, perhaps unfathomable whole. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 internationally bestselling author of the Department Q series is back, with a terrifyingly relevant stand-alone novel about an America in chaos&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The president has gone way too far. . . . These are practically dictatorial methods we're talking about.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years before Democratic Senator Bruce Jansen was elected president of the United States, a PR stunt brought together five very different people: fourteen-year-old Dorothy "Doggie" Rogers, small-town sheriff T. Perkins, single mother Rosalie Lee, well-known journalist John Bugatti, and the teenage son of one of Jansen's employees, Wesley Barefoot. In spite of their differences, the five remain bonded by their shared experience and devotion to their candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Doggie, who worked the campaign trail with Wesley, Jansen's election is a personal victory: a job in the White House, proof to her Republican father that she was right to support Jansen, and the rise of an intelligent, clear-headed leader with her same ideals. But the triumph is short-lived: Jansen's pregnant wife is assassinated on election night, and the alleged mastermind behind the shooting is none other than Doggie's own father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jansen ascends to the White House, he is a changed man, determined to end gun violence by any means necessary. Rights are taken away as quickly as weapons. International travel becomes impossible. Checkpoints and roadblocks destroy infrastructure. The media is censored. Militias declare civil war on the government. The country is in chaos, and Jansen's former friends each find themselves fighting a very different battle, for themselves, their rights, their country . . . and, in Doggie's case, the life of her father, who just may be innocent.</description>

  <description>A master of the novel, short story, and memoir, the best-selling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Everybody's Fool now gives us his very first collection of personal essays, ranging throughout writing and reading and living. &lt;br /&gt;In these nine essays, Richard Russo provides insight into his life as a writer, teacher, friend, and reader. From a commencement speech he gave at Colby College, to the story of how an oddly placed toilet made him reevaluate the purpose of humor in art and life, to a comprehensive analysis of Mark Twain's value, to his harrowing journey accompanying a dear friend as she pursued gender-reassignment surgery, The Destiny Thief reflects the broad interests and experiences of one of America's most beloved authors. Warm, funny, wise, and poignant, the essays included here traverse Russo's writing life, expanding our understanding of who he is and how his singular, incredibly generous mind works. An utter joy to read, they give deep insight into the creative process from the prospective of one of our greatest writers.</description>

  <description>“Magical prose stylist” Michael Chabon (Michiko Kakutani, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) delivers a collection of essays—heartfelt, humorous, insightful, wise—on the meaning of fatherhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the September 2016 issue of &lt;em&gt;GQ,&lt;/em&gt; Michael Chabon wrote a piece about accompanying his son Abraham Chabon, then thirteen, to Paris Men’s Fashion Week. Possessed with a precocious sense of style, Abe was in his element chatting with designers he idolized and turning a critical eye to the freshest runway looks of the season; Chabon Sr., whose interest in clothing stops at “thrift-shopping for vintage western shirts or Hermès neckties,” sat idly by, staving off yawns and fighting the impulse that the whole thing was a massive waste of time. Despite his own indifference, however, what gradually emerged as Chabon ferried his son to and from fashion shows was a deep respect for his son’s passion. The piece quickly became a viral sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt; story as its centerpiece, and featuring six additional essays plus an introduction, &lt;em&gt;Pops&lt;/em&gt; illuminates the meaning, magic, and mysteries of fatherhood as only Michael Chabon can.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“This is a tough, sharp history of comedy and competitiveness, of rising stars and brilliant upstarts. Of difficult egos, awful behavior, fragile friendships, bursts of inspiration, and blizzards of cocaine―told by the survivors and shaped by Chris Nashawaty's welcome insight and perspective.”&lt;br /&gt;― &lt;i&gt;Mark Harris, New York Times bestselling author of Pictures at a Revolution and Five Came Back&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caddyshack is one of the most beloved comedies of all time, a classic snobs vs. slobs story of working class kids and the white collar buffoons that make them haul their golf bags in the hot summer sun. It has sex, drugs and one very memorable candy bar, but the movie we all know and love didn’t start out that way, and everyone who made it certainly didn’t have the word “classic” in mind as the cameras were rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Caddyshack:The Making of a Hollywood Cinderella Story film critic for Entertainment Weekly Chris Nashawaty goes behind the scenes of the iconic film, chronicling the rise of comedy’s greatest deranged minds as they form The National Lampoon, turn the entertainment industry on its head, and ultimately blow up both a golf course and popular culture as we know it. Caddyshack is at once an eye-opening narrative about one of the most interesting, surreal, and dramatic film productions there’s ever been, and a rich portrait of the biggest, and most revolutionary names in Hollywood. So, it’s got that going for it…which is nice.</description>

  <description>Abaddon's Gate is the third book in the New York Times bestselling Expanse series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For generations, the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt - was humanity's great frontier. Until now. The alien artefact working through its program under the clouds of Venus has emerged to build a massive structure outside the orbit of Uranus: a gate that leads into a starless dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military ships going out to examine the artefact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.</description>

  <description>Your Black Friend and Other Strangers is a collection of culturally charged comics by cartoonist Ben Passmore, including the Eisner Award nominated and Ignatz Award-winning "Your Black Friend," named one of NPR's 100 favorite comics of all time in 2017. Passmore masterfully tackles comics about race, gentrification, the prison system, online dating, gross punks, bad street art, kung fu movie references, beating up God, and lots of other grown-up stuff with refreshing doses of humor and lived relatability. The comics in this 112-page collection include works previously published by The Nib, VICE, and the As You Were anthology, along with brand new and unreleased material. These comics are essential, humorous, and accessible, told through Passmore's surreal lens in the vibrant full-color hues of New Orleans.</description>

  <description>A young girl in Harlem discovers slam poetry as a way to understand her mother’s religion and her own relationship to the world. Debut novel of renowned slam poet Elizabeth Acevedo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xiomara Batista feels unheard and unable to hide in her Harlem neighborhood. Ever since her body grew into curves, she has learned to let her fists and her fierceness do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Xiomara has plenty she wants to say, and she pours all her frustration and passion onto the pages of a leather notebook, reciting the words to herself like prayers—especially after she catches feelings for a boy in her bio class named Aman, who her family can never know about. With Mami’s determination to force her daughter to obey the laws of the church, Xiomara understands that her thoughts are best kept to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when she is invited to join her school’s slam poetry club, she doesn’t know how she could ever attend without her mami finding out, much less speak her words out loud. But still, she can’t stop thinking about performing her poems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in the face of a world that may not want to hear her, Xiomara refuses to be silent.</description>

  <description>Phil Klay's Redeployment takes readers to the frontlines of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, asking us to understand what happened there, and what happened to the soldiers who returned. Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith, guilt and fear, helplessness and survival, the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "Redeployment", a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia, surrounded by people "who have no idea where Fallujah is, where three members of your platoon died." In "After Action Report", a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn't commit, in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains - of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity, and his ability to provide solace through religion, tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic "Money as a Weapons System", a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony, bureaucracy, comradeship and violence that make up a soldier's daily life at war, and the isolation, remorse, and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents, Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss. Written with a hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth, this work marks Phil Klay as one of the most talented new voices of his generation.</description>
