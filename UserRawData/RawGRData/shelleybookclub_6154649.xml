  <description>In post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, dreams come true. So do nightmares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since a shift in reality twenty years ago, peoples' dreams and nightmares come alive, spreading chaos and destruction. Monsters ravage cities, bottomless chasms split roads, and gold rains from the sky - the possibilities are limitless, unpredictable and often deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden Maybrey is a hunter of these "shades". When a friend tasks her with tracking down and eliminating an evil shade, the hunt threatens to expose Eden's deepest, darkest secret. To find her prey, she is forced to team up with Vaughn Taylor, a hunter who hates shades with a passion - and who won't hesitate to put a bullet in Eden's head should he figure out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book 1 in a new urban fantasy series with a twist: no vamps or weres - instead, dreams and nightmares coming alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you really want your dreams to come true?</description>

  &lt;i&gt;The start of something wonderful…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Jones loves her little bookshop at Herring Cove. She’ll never give it up to big property developer, Alexander Fletcher – no matter how handsome he might be…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet beneath Alex’s sharp suit and persuasive manner, there’s something about him that makes Sophie want to trust him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when he offers to help make her little shop a success again, she wonders whether this could be the start of something wonderful for both Sophie and Alex – together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Caroline Roberts, Cathy Bramley and Heidi Swain.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Magic, murder, adventure, and romance combine in this second novel in the exciting Crown of Shards saga from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jennifer Estep.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everleigh Blair might be the new gladiator queen of Bellona, but her problems are far from over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Evie has to deal with a court full of arrogant, demanding nobles, all of whom want to get their greedy hands on her crown. As if that wasn’t bad enough, an assassin tries to kill Evie in her own throne room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the dangers, Evie goes ahead with a scheduled trip to the neighboring kingdom of Andvari in order to secure a desperately needed alliance. But complicating matters is the stubborn Andvarian king, who wants to punish Evie for the deaths of his countrymen during the Seven Spire massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark forces are at work inside the Andvarian palace, and Evie soon realizes that no one is safe. Worse, Evie’s immunity to magic starts acting in strange, unexpected ways, which makes her wonder whether she is truly strong enough to be a Winter Queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Evie’s magic, life, and crown aren’t the only things in danger—so is her heart, thanks to Lucas Sullivan, the Andvarian king’s bastard son and Evie’s . . . well, Evie isn’t quite sure what Sullivan is to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing is certain—protecting a prince might be even harder than killing a queen…</description>

  <description>Anne Williams is a seer—the rarest and possibly most dangerous kind of magician--gifted with the ability to divine the past, present and future. Her overprotective family hid her true nature from the rest of magician society to protect her from those who would abuse her prophetic powers. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a new group of hunters unleashes a deadly campaign of kidnapping, experimentation and execution targeting magicians, Anne can no longer stay in the shadows. But just as she steps up the plate to help her people, someone tries to take her out of the game--permanently. On the brink of death, Anne is rushed to chronicler Simon St. Jerome for help, but with one touch he plunges Anne into a web of secrets and lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon spent centuries concealing his past while recording the history of magician society, but nothing can hide the truth from a seer. Anne is determined to discover everything he's hidden--including his scarred heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As danger closes in around them, Anne and Simon must overcome the pain of their pasts or risk never seeing their futures.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mary Burton comes a gritty, suspenseful story in the Criminal Profiler series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI special agent Zoe Spencer uses skeletal remains to recreate the faces of murder victims through sculpture. Though highly scientific, the process is also sensitive and intimate; she becomes attached to the individuals she identifies, desperate to find justice for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Zoe examines old remains, she sees a teenage girl looking back at her—the victim in a cold case from over a decade ago. Zoe wants nothing more than to tell this young woman’s story and to bring her killer to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe’s case leads her to the victim’s hometown and to homicide detective William Vaughan, Zoe’s on-again, off-again lover. As the two become more involved in the case, they quickly realize that it isn’t as cold as they first believed: someone’s still out there hunting women. And with more women gone missing, time’s running out. Can they work together and stop this madman before he kills again?</description>

  <description>Alasdair Cynster known to his intimates as Lucifer decides to rusticate in the country before the matchmaking skills of London′s mamas become firmly focused on him, the last unwed Cynster. But an escape to Devonshire leads him straight to his destiny in the irresistible form of Phyllida Tallent, a willful, independent beauty of means who brings all his masterful Cynster instincts rioting to the fore. Lucifer isn′t about to deny his desire for Phyllida, and he′s determined to use all his seductive skills to enjoy the benefits of destiny′s choice without submitting to the parson′s noose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phyllida has had a bevy of suitors, her charm and wit are well known throughout the countryside, but none of them has tempted her the way Lucifer does. His offer to teach her all about the ways of love is almost too tantalising to resist. And though she′s not yet completely surrendered, she knows only a fool stands against a Cynster...and Phyllida is no one′s fool.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries features an irresistible family in a series to savor, as the grown children of a thrice-married dowager duchess piece together the stories of their fathers--while pursuing passions of their own . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Gwyn Drake has long protected her family's reputation by hiding an imprudent affair from her youth. But when her former suitor appears at Armitage Hall, manhandling the heiress and threatening to go public with her secrets, it's Gwyn who needs protecting. Her twin brother, Thorn, hires Joshua Wolfe, the estate's gamekeeper, to keep her safe in London during her debut. As a war hero, Joshua feels obligated to fulfill the assignment he has accepted. But as a man, it's torment to be so very close to the beauty he's fought to ignore . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With handsome Joshua monitoring her every move, Gwyn would prefer to forget both the past &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the parade of money-seeking bachelors at her coming out. But Joshua is unmoved by her attempts at flirtation, and the threat of blackmail still hangs over her. With danger closing in, Gwyn must decide which is the greater risk: deflecting a scoundrel's attempts to sabotage her--or revealing her whole heart to the rugged bodyguard she can't resist . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Molly Harper’s Changeling is masterful fantasy—a spunky Cinderella story with a heroine who’s equal parts compassion, determination, and pure magical delight.” —&lt;i&gt;Rachel Vincent, author of the Soul Screamers series and The Stars Never Rise, on Changeling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days away from becoming completing her first year at &lt;i&gt;Miss Castwell’s Institute for the Magical Instruction of Young Ladies&lt;/i&gt;, Changeling-born Sarah Smith might just get away with posing as an upper-class Guardian girl named Cassandra Reed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But strange visions of a Lightbourne destroyed by Miss Morton’s revenant army keep Sarah from enjoying her achievement. Plus, the Mother Book, Sarah’s one secret advantage and the ultimate entrée in Guardian society, suddenly stops revealing itself to her…putting her in a precarious position with the Guild. On top of all that, her former lady’s maid left &lt;i&gt;Miss Castwell’s&lt;/i&gt;, and the new hire is, well, taking some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren’t for her two best friends, Alicia McCray and Ivy Cowel, who will do anything to protect her secret, Sarah doesn’t know if she’ll make it another year. When the three girls take summer holiday with Alicia’s family (chaperoned by an exacting and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; disapproving Mrs. McCray), a relaxing vacation in Scotland is the last thing they’ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Winter is thrilled that Sarah is spending time with the influential McCray family, but Sarah can’t help but feel that her real purpose is to find other Changeling children like her, and free them to realize their own magic. Can she find genuine satisfaction in her accomplishments when she knows there are others like her out there who need her help? Will the three girls uncover the deeply-held secrets they’re looking for in the mysterious mountains of Scotland? Will the Mother Book finally start talking to her again? And will Sarah come to understand the importance of her connection with Ivy and Alicia, and the true nature of her own power…before it’s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Witty and classic, Changeling had everything I wanted from a coming of age story: friendship, scandal, and a heroine learning to flex her magical muscles. If you liked Harry Potter, you will love CHANGELING!” —&lt;i&gt;Kristen Simmons, critically acclaimed author of the Article 5 series, on Changeling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller Allison Brennan's latest novel featuring FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;finds her on the trail of a serial killer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a background in psychology, FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid is good at getting into the heads of killers and victims both. Still, her latest case is leaving her stumped. A third body has turned up in San Antonio—and it bears the same unique and troubling M.O. as the first two. The killer is clearly trying to send a message. But what is it—and to whom? All roads keep leading Lucy down a dead end. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victims are all married men who led honest lives alongside their adoring wives, but have nothing else in common. When Lucy catches each widow in a lie, she realizes that things are not at all as they seem. What begins as a seemingly straightforward investigation turns into something far darker and more sinister than Lucy could have ever imagined. Can she solve this case before more lives are lost. . . including her own husband?</description>

  <description>Things finally seem to be going well for FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid. She's just finished training for Hostage Rescue, her husband's relationship with his son is back on track, and her tense relationship with her boss, Rachel Vaughn, has become much more bearable. That is, until her first hostage case throws everything off track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a man who appears under the influence and mentally unstable holds a group of people hostage and dies in a shootout with the FBI, Lucy is assigned to investigate what happened. His descent doesn't make any sense - he was an upstanding citizen a year ago and only started declining after a series of blackouts and strange occurrences. Even his autopsy seems suspicious, and the body has been cremated without the proper approval. As Lucy investigates, she realizes that this story may be more complicated than she thinks, and that her own life might be in danger.</description>

  <description>Bella Caruso survived a nightmare of abuse and betrayal. Today, she has dedicated her life to saving other young women from the hell that almost killed her—first as an officer of the law, then by stepping outside the law and into the darkness where true evil dwells. Now, it appears that the darkness has taken her once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JT Caruso often worries about his sister, given her line of work. This time, when he learns that Bella is working undercover to find a missing girl involved in a dangerous prostitution ring, JT asks FBI Special Agent Lucy Kincaid for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with Lucy’s extensive experience in running down human traffickers, finding Bella will not be easy. Not only because she is in too deep. But because Bella, who will not rest until she saves the girl, doesn’t &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to be found…</description>

  <description>Lucy Kincaid and Sean Rogan are finally tying the knot. Two weeks before their wedding, a surprise visitor shows up at their door: Eden, Sean's estranged sister from Europe. She claims she's in town for the wedding and wants to mend fences. Lucy invites Eden to stay with them after all, family is family but her boss, SSA Noah Armstrong, knows far more about Eden's sketchy past than he's let on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Lucy is focused on her investigation tracking down dozens of children sold through illegal adoptions, Noah begins a quiet investigation of Eden and her elusive twin, Liam. He's certain that, since they're both thieves, they're here for a job or a heist. But they are up to something far more sinister than even Noah can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam has a score to settle with his family, and Sean has something he wants. The twins will do anything to get it including putting Lucy's life in danger. It'll take everyone—Kincaids and Rogans alike—to stop Liam before someone dies. Unfortunately, Liam's treachery has unforeseen consequences for Sean and Lucy, as a longtime enemy of the Rogan family hellbent on revenge sees an opportunity to make them all pay...</description>

  <description>Lucy Kincaid understands the dangers of corruption. As an FBI agent, she has witnessed some very bad deeds committed by seemingly good people. That's why she's glad to see corrupt DEA Agent Nicole Rollins behind bars for murder, conspiracy, and gunrunning. But when Rollins makes a daring escape—jeopardizing a busload of children and killing five officers—Lucy becomes the key to the biggest manhunt in Texas history...and the target of a brilliant killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some believe Rollins has fled the country. But Lucy suspects her plan is far more sinister—a taunting game of cat and mouse that hits much closer to home. First, an FBI agent with a connection to Texas is killed in Washington. Then, Kane Rogan disappears on a mission. When Rollins ups the ante again, Lucy is determined to save the people she loves—before her enemy strikes again. Time is running out. The body count is rising. Rollins wants more than revenge—she wants to destroy everything Lucy holds dear...</description>

  <description>FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid takes on her most explosive case yet in New York Times bestseller Allison Brennan's Dead Heat &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assigned to San Antonio’s Violent Crimes unit, Lucy Kincaid joins a team of seasoned veterans and newer agents for a task force called Operation Heatwave. It’s supposed to be a simple sweep of known offenders with outstanding warrants. But when Lucy and her team try to bust two local brothers for jumping bail, she walks into a hotbed of pure evil. Their names are George and Jaime Sanchez. They are charged with murder, drug trafficking, and worse. And one of them is still out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE HEAT IS ON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lucy races to capture Jaime Sanchez, more shocking evidence comes to light. The brothers have been using their basement as a holding cell for children they kidnapped for the cartels. When George agrees to turn on his brother, he is murdered behind bars. Now Lucy has no choice but to go outside the law. Enlisting the help of her boyfriend Sean Rogan and his mercenary brother Kane, she will risk her career—and both of their lives—to bring down a crime lord’s empire…before more innocent lives go up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Knife-edged tension and clever twists. The Lucy Kincaid/Sean Rogan novels just keep getting better!” —RT Book Reviews</description>

  <description>A new trainee at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Lucy Kincaid has already seen more than her share of murder and mayhem. Still reeling from the sex-crime case that sealed her reputation, she's found a true friend and mentor in Agent Tony Presidio. No matter what goes down at the bureau, Tony's got her back-until she's called to New York to help investigate the murder of a reporter with ties to Lucy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reporter might not be the first victim of a patient killer with a penchant for revenge, and she's definitely not the last. Connections between closed cases, a missing person, and Tony himself lead Lucy to fear for those she cares for most. When the FBI is rocked by the death of one of their own, Lucy seeks the help of her bf, PI Sean Rogan, to help put together the puzzle-and puts her career in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the harder she pushes for answers, the clearer the truth becomes: There's a killer inside Quantico. Watching her every move. Waiting to kill again...</description>

  <description>USA TODAY bestselling author Sarah Morgan returns with this heartwarming novel about the power of friendship, love and what happens when an ending is just the beginning…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Grace has planned the surprise of a lifetime for her husband—a romantic getaway to Paris. But she never expected he’d have a surprise of his own: he wants a divorce. Reeling from the shock but refusing to be broken, a devastated Grace makes the bold decision to go to Paris alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey, a young woman from London, has left behind a heartache of her own when she arrives in Paris. A job in a bookshop is her ticket to freedom, but with no money and no knowledge of the French language, suddenly a summer spent wandering the cobbled streets alone seems much more likely…until she meets Grace, and everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace can’t believe how daring Audrey is. Audrey can’t believe how cautious newly single Grace is. Living in neighboring apartments above the bookshop, this unlikely pair offer each other just what they’ve both been missing. They came to Paris to find themselves, but finding this unbreakable friendship might be the best thing that’s ever happened to them…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A ruthless tycoon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Savage ambition has brought common-born Rhys Winterborne vast wealth and success. In business and beyond, Rhys gets exactly what he wants. And from the moment he meets the shy, aristocratic Lady Helen Ravenel, he is determined to possess her. If he must take her virtue to ensure she marries him, so much the better…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A sheltered beauty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen has had little contact with the glittering, cynical world of London society. Yet Rhys’s determined seduction awakens an intense mutual passion. Helen’s gentle upbringing belies a stubborn conviction that only she can tame her unruly husband. As Rhys’s enemies conspire against them, Helen must trust him with her darkest secret. The risks are unthinkable… the reward, a lifetime of incomparable bliss. And it all begins with…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marrying Mr. Winterborne&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A twist of fate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devon Ravenel, London's most wickedly charming rake, has just inherited an earldom. But his powerful new rank in society comes with unwanted responsibilities... and more than a few surprises. His estate is saddled with debt, and the late earl's three innocent sisters are still occupying the house... along with Kathleen, Lady Trenear, a beautiful young widow whose sharp wit and determination are a match for Devon's own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clash of wills...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen knows better than to trust a ruthless scoundrel like Devon. But the fiery attraction between them is impossible to deny—and from the first moment Devon holds her in his arms, he vows to do whatever it takes to possess her. As Kathleen finds herself yielding to his skillfully erotic seduction, only one question remains:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she keep from surrendering her heart to the most dangerous man she's ever known?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries comes a sparkling new series about an oft-widowed mother’s grown children, who blaze through society in their quest for the truth about their fathers . . . and in the process find that love just might conquer all . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A series of stepfathers and a difficult childhood have left Fletcher “Grey” Pryde, 5th Duke of Greycourt, with a guarded heart, enviable wealth, and the undeserved reputation of a rogue. Grey’s focus on expanding his dukedom allows him little time to find a wife. But when his mother is widowed yet again and he meets the charmingly unconventional woman managing his stepfather’s funeral, he’s shocked to discover how much they have in common. Still, Grey isn’t interested in love, no matter how pretty, or delightfully outspoken, the lady . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beatrice Wolfe gave up on romance long ago, and the arrogant Duke of Greycourt with his rakish reputation isn’t exactly changing her mind. Then Grey agrees to assist his grief-stricken mother with her latest “project”: schooling spirited, unfashionable Beatrice for her debut. Now that Beatrice is seeing through Grey’s charms to his wounded heart, she’s having trouble keeping him at arm’s length. But once Grey starts digging into her family’s secrets, she must decide whether her loyalties lie with her family . . . or with the man whose lessons capture her heart . . .   &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>After ten years of adventure, Colin Smith, the bastard son of a viscount, returns to the place he most despises ––London. But only until he can sell off some of his treasures. He has no use for the stifling rules of the ton, but he’s more than happy to play the game if it gets him what he wants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Claire, daughter of a marquess, is everything Colin loathes about the ton, but she is determined to win him over. Her life is a catalogue of dances and evening gowns, and thanks to an eidetic memory, she can remember every blasted, boring second of it. A treasure hunt for the Cleopatra Emerald promises adventure, but Claire wants more. If she can convince Colin Smith to take her with him as he travels the world, then she’ll have the life she’s always dreamed of. There’s just one problem, he doesn’t seem to like her much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lady Claire loves a good challenge and the intellectual beauty may be on her way to the grandest adventure of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Join USA TODAY bestselling author Sheila Roberts for a seaside escape to the beaches of Moonlight Harbor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celeste Jones has plans for a perfect summer with her boyfriend (and hopefully soon-to-be fiancé)—until he dumps her to be with the woman he’s had on the side for months. Heartbroken and furious, Celeste resolves to move on. When the going gets tough, the tough…okay, the not-so-tough go to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as school lets out for the summer, she waves goodbye to her first-graders, packs up her bikini and heads for Moonlight Harbor, where she knows her big sister, Jenna, will receive her with open arms. Jenna could probably use some help at the Driftwood Inn, and Celeste is happy to do chores around the place in exchange for a relaxing summer escape. She just needs something—or someone—to distract her from her troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding The One can be tricky, and Jenna is determined to make sure Celeste gets it right this time around. Not that Jenna’s an expert. She’s still trying to sort out her own love life. But if both sisters listen to their hearts, eventually they’re bound to discover that life—and love—is good at the beach.</description>

  <description>Former quarterback Lance Quaid just inherited the most losing team in the NFL. He’s got only a few weeks until draft day to turn things around, and after firing more than half his staff, he can’t do it alone. Thankfully, his HR manager is more than capable, if only she’d stop focusing on “due diligence” and stop looking so sexy while she’s yelling at him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte James has made a life out of following the rules. But nothing could have prepared her for Lance Quaid––he’s a human resources nightmare. The man is brash, has no filter, and, as her new boss, is constantly relying on her to cover his ass. Which is admittedly quite nice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Lance begs her to join him on a trip down the coast for his brother’s wedding so they can finalize details––on a strictly business basis––she agrees...after they fill out the necessary forms, of course. Away from the office, though, sparks start flying as the team starts coming together. But both of them know anything more than the weekend would be a colossally bad idea––after all, the extra paperwork would be a nightmare.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of the #Lovestruck novels comes a rousing romance about following your dreams, second chances, and playing the game of love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgraced college quarterback Logan Hunt was on his way to NFL stardom when he messed up big-time. Now the Texas star player with a bad temper has a new option: Seattle’s EOL College—as in &lt;i&gt;End of the Line&lt;/i&gt;, to his fellow misfit recruits. It’s Logan’s last chance. &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; he can follow the rules. No parties, no fighting, no swearing, and oh, no dating the coach’s daughter, Jess. Simple. Yeah, right. For Logan, there has never been a rule he’s more tempted to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deal is “just friends.” The pretty, confident, and fiercely smart math whiz is fine with pizza, tutoring, and keeping Logan in line. But the closer Jess gets, the more receptive she is to his warm heart and spirit—not to mention his irresistible off-field passes. With defenses down, they’re both heading into the danger zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s more than thrilling. It’s love. It’s also a game changer that could sideline Logan’s NFL goals—and more important, a future with Jess. But dreams are worth fighting for, right?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A brand new series from debut author Lucy Gilmore, featuring service puppies who might just be matchmakers in the making...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie Vasquez runs Puppy Promise, a service puppy training organization. Sophie's always been treated as the frail baby of the family—a thing she hates but doesn't know how to change. Until, that is, she meets her newest client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrison Parks is a wildfire firefighter who isn't allowed back in the field unless he finds a service dog. Reluctantly, he agrees, never expecting to be assigned a skittish Pomeranian and the equally skittish woman who's supposed to wrangle them both into order. As it turns out, they all have something to prove…and more than enough room in their hearts for a little puppy love.</description>

  <description>The predator becomes the prey in the newest thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling series featuring homicide detective Eve Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She calls herself Lady Justice. And once she has chosen a man as her target, she turns herself into a tall blonde or a curvaceous redhead, makes herself as alluring and seductive as possible to them. Once they are in her grasp, they are powerless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first victim is wealthy businessman Nigel McEnroy. His company’s human resources department has already paid out settlements to a couple of his young victims—but they don’t know that his crimes go far beyond workplace harassment. Lady Justice knows. And in one shocking night of brutality, she makes him pay a much steeper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Eve Dallas and her husband, Roarke, are combing through the evidence of McEnroy’s secret life. His compulsive need to record his misdeeds provides them with a wide range of suspects, but the true identity of Lady Justice remains elusive. It’s a challenging case, made even more difficult by McEnroy’s widow, who reacts to the investigation with fury, denial, and threats. Meanwhile, Lady Justice’s criminal crusade is escalating rapidly, and if Eve can’t stop this vigilante, there’s no telling how much blood may be spilled…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; bestselling author Carla Neggers has captivated readers with Knights Bridge--a scenic New England town where families and friends experience joy and face challenges together. With its world of inns, old houses, wonderful, quirky characters, romance and adventure, it's a town you won't want to leave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrienne Portale has never settled in one place for long, but takes a job as innkeeper in tiny Knights Bridge, Massachusetts, to spend some time getting to know the father she only recently found. When three small boys get lost in the wilderness that borders the inn, Adam Sloan leads the search. His family ties to the town go back generations. Adrienne sees the bond that people in a small town have as they band together to find the missing children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam is impressed with her calm strength, but he's sure she won't find what she's looking for in his quiet hometown.Despite their differences, Adam and Adrienne discover they have more in common than they'd expected. They love to explore old stone walls and bridges, and she adores his dog. As summer bleeds into the gorgeous New England fall, the attraction between them grows, and they must decide where--and who--makes a place home.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Baxter sisters come from a long line of women with disastrous luck in love. But this summer, Sunshine and Margot will turn disasters into destiny…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an etiquette coach, Margot teaches her clients to fit in. But she’s never faced a client like Bianca, an aging movie star who gained fame—and notoriety—through a campaign of shock and awe. Schooling Bianca on the fine art of behaving like a proper diplomat’s wife requires intensive lessons, forcing Margot to move into the monastery turned mansion owned by the actress’s intensely private son. Like his incredible home, Alec’s stony exterior hides secret depths Margot would love to explore. But will he trust her enough to let her in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunshine has always been the good-time sister, abandoning jobs to chase after guys who used her, then threw her away. No more. She refuses to be “that girl” again. This time, she’ll finish college, dedicate herself to her job as a nanny, and she 100 percent will not screw up her life again by falling for the wrong guy. Especially not the tempting single dad who also happens to be her boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Master storyteller Susan Mallery weaves threads of family drama, humor, romance and a wish-you-were-there setting into one of the most satisfying books of the year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The California sunshine’s not quite so bright for three sisters who get dumped in the same week…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finola, a popular LA morning show host, is famously upbeat until she’s blindsided on live TV by news that her husband is sleeping with a young pop sensation who has set their affair to music. While avoiding the tabloids and pretending she’s just fine, she’s crumbling inside, desperate for him to come to his senses and for life to go back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zennie’s breakup is no big loss. Although the world insists she pair up, she’d rather be surfing. So agreeing to be the surrogate for her best friend is a no-brainer—after all, she has an available womb and no other attachments to worry about. Except…when everyone else, including her big sister, thinks she’s making a huge mistake, being pregnant is a lot lonelier—and more complicated—than she imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never the tallest, thinnest or prettiest sister, Ali is used to being overlooked, but when her fiancé sends his disapproving brother to call off the wedding, it’s a new low. And yet Daniel continues to turn up “for support,” making Ali wonder if maybe—for once—someone sees her in a way no one ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But side by side by side, these sisters will start over and rebuild their lives with all the affection, charm and laugh-out-loud humor that is classic Susan Mallery.</description>

  <description>Declan James has been Brockton Point’s most ineligible bachelor––happy with his short-term relationships and focusing on his business. But now that his closest friends have found their happily-ever-afters, he can’t help but wonder what that might be like. And then Sophia Strombi shows up on his doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia’s life is––well there’s no other word for it––a mess. She’s grateful to have some work at her brother’s best friend’s bar, and a place to stay. Since she’s working hard to get her life back on track, she’s desperately trying to ignore the fact her boss makes her heart pound in a good way. Wait––no. That’s not good at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, she has a huge secret she’s keeping from everyone––one that’s a life-changer.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Megan Montgomery has always been the careful type. Except...one time at her cousin's wedding when she threw caution to the wind and had the steamiest hook-up of her life. But that was two years ago— why can't she stop thinking about it? So when Megan accepts a job at her cousin's company, she does everything she can to avoid Alex—knowing he'll shake up her carefully crafted world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Rebat's been living a good life. He loves his career and friends, but like Megan, hasn't been able to stop thinking about their passionate encounter. And once Megan moves to town, Alex makes it his personal goal to show her that maybe it's time to start taking a few more risks...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Eliza Herman has spent years avoiding her calling as a Descendant of Eros. After all, happily-ever-afters are a myth. But when a family crisis requires her to fill in at her family's Cupid-for-hire shop, Eliza finds herself enchanting couples under the watchful eye of her mentor, Jake Sanders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Eliza accidentally enchants Jake instead, they set rules to keep his arrow-struck desire at bay. But some rules are meant to be broken, and before long Eliza is rethinking her stance on true love...until they discover a conspiracy that could destroy thousands of relationships--including their own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Returning to their hometown isn't something the Bradshaw brothers ever thought they'd do. But a family tragedy has reunited them in Benevolence, Washington--where second chances, reignited dreams, and real love are never far away . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas rancher Flynn Bradshaw has his work cut out for him. His sister-in-law, Sunday, is finally home after the car crash that killed her husband and left her critically injured. But Flynn still has to get her failing ancestral farm up and running while looking after his six nieces and nephews. He prefers wide open spaces and working solo. Yet as he tries to get the grieving Sunday to care about her life again, he's finding a chance for love that's closer than he ever expected . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even before the accident, Sunday struggled to keep the farm afloat as her once-happy marriage crumbled. Now with her body still recovering, she can't seem to get back the hope she once had. But as she reconnects with her children, Flynn's dedication, love for the land, and caring slowly inspire her to dream again. Is their growing affection enough to help them through unresolved pain--and risk trying for a future together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Shirlee McCoy's &lt;i&gt;Home with You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Enjoyable . . . worth reading."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming, escapist romantic novel for fans of Elin Hilderbrand, Nora Roberts and Nancy Thayer.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Natalie isn’t a romantic. She doesn’t believe in true love, or destiny. She thinks that people are just plain lucky if they happen to find someone. It’s coincidence and nothing more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a wedding dress designer though, she knows she has to keep these feelings under wraps. Even if she’s suspicious that Harper, the bride she’s working with, might secretly agree with her. Because if Harper admitted she wasn’t sure about love, it might also mean giving up on a millionaire husband-to-be and the lavish island wedding of her dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, for Natalie, as her feelings develop for both her on-off boyfriend Chad, and for the boy-next-door Brayden, she starts to fear that her heart might not be as immune to love as she claims… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Could love have been there all along? And as the wedding approaches, who will find a happy-ever-after, who will find their way to themselves, and who will get left behind? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Readers love Laura Briggs:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Sure to put a smile on your face!&lt;/b&gt;… This book is really like spending a long afternoon gossiping with your girlfriends… &lt;b&gt;Absolutely recommend if you are a fan of books about strong women with strong female friendships with a splash of romance.’ &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Audio Killed the Bookmark&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Everything I wanted it to be and then some more&lt;/b&gt;. I absolutely loved this gorgeous story, straight from the beginning I was hooked on the characters and the storyline&lt;b&gt;…. a wonderful, sweet, feel-good read…&lt;/b&gt; Get whisked away by Laura to the charming town and enjoy your stay there.’ Katie’s Book Cave, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I loved this book, it was &lt;b&gt;just what the doctor ordered&lt;/b&gt;… filling you with happiness and hope for the future.’ &lt;i&gt;Zooloo’s Book Diary&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;A gorgeous, comforting, cosy read&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Waggy Tales&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A wonderful sense of humour which shines through… &lt;b&gt;a joy to read… I felt completely immersed… the perfect novel to read curled up on the sofa&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Portable Magic&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Romantic and funny&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;B for Bookreview&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;You know when you near the end of a story and wish it could carry on&lt;/b&gt;, well this is exactly what I was feeling when I was reading those last few chapters… &lt;b&gt;Beautiful, sweet and romantic!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Rae Reads&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ‘Loved this book very much. It had just enough &lt;b&gt;sweet romance and the storyline was great&lt;/b&gt;! I highly recommend!’ Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Light hearted and entertaining, as well as tender and loving throughout… Such a lovely romantic book’ &lt;i&gt;Stardust Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Hopeless romantic Elena Mason doesn’t often hate people, but she hates her ex-fiancé’s insufferable best man, Lucas Albright III. She just knows Lucas is the one who talked her ex out of getting married—so Lucas is clearly the cause of all her problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now she’s expected to work with him? Oh, heck no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas Albright wants nothing more than to make partner at his advertising firm, and he knows he works best alone. But then Elena ends up as his partner on an account that could win him a promotion. He had a great reason to end her engagement, not that she’d ever believe him. Still, he’s willing to try working as a team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, his new “partner” wants him dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elena knows she’s going to have to give in and work with her nemesis, though nobody said it had to be easy for him. But what happens when fighting starts feeling a whole lot like falling in love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this gritty and gripping new novel in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series, Eve Dallas fights to save the innocent—and serve justice to the guilty—on the streets of New York.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homicide cop Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband, Roarke, are building a brand-new school and youth shelter. They know that the hard life can lead kids toward dangerous crossroads—and with this new project, they hope to nudge a few more of them onto the right path. For expert help, they hire child psychologist Dr. Rochelle Pickering—whose own brother pulled himself out of a spiral of addiction and crime with Rochelle’s support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyle is living with Rochelle while he gets his life together, and he’s thrilled to hear about his sister’s new job offer. But within hours, triumph is followed by tragedy. Returning from a celebratory dinner with her boyfriend, she finds Lyle dead with a syringe in his lap, and Eve’s investigation confirms that this wasn’t just another OD. After all his work to get clean, Lyle’s been pumped full of poison—and a neighbor with a peephole reports seeing a scruffy, pink-haired girl fleeing the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Eve and Roarke must venture into the gang territory where Lyle used to run, and the ugly underground world of tattoo parlors and strip joints where everyone has taken a wrong turn somewhere. They both believe in giving people a second chance. Maybe even a third or fourth. But as far as they’re concerned, whoever gave the order on Lyle Pickering’s murder has run out of chances…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the Worthington least likely to wed may find her perfect match . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marriage has worked out quite nicely for her older sisters, yet Lady Augusta Vivers is certain it would end her studies in languages and geography, and stop her from travelling. But when her mother thwarts her plan to attend the only university in Europe that accepts women—in Italy—she is forced to agree to one London Season. Spending her time at parties proves an empty diversion—until she encounters the well-traveled Lord Phineas Carter-Wood. Still, Europe awaits . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Phineas has studied architecture all over the world, yet Augusta is his most intriguing discovery yet. How can he resist a woman who loves maps and far-off lands? But her longing for all things foreign hinders any hope of courtship. When he learns her cousins have offered a trip to Europe, he secretly arranges to join their party. For he is determined to show Augusta that a real union is a thrilling adventure of its own. And when their journey is beset by dangerous obstacles, he gets far more opportunity than he bargained for . . .</description>

That is, until one day, Sarah accidentally levitates Mrs. Winter’s favorite vase in the parlor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Snipes aren’t supposed to have magical powers…and the existence of a magical Snipe threatens the world order dictated during the Guardians’ Restoration years ago. If she wants to keep her family safe and protect her own skin, Sarah must figure out how to fit into posh Guardian society, master her newfound magical powers and discover the truth about how an ordinary girl can become magical.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, Jackson Hardy joined the Marines, leaving behind a woman he still dreams about. When he's called home to care for his ten-year-old nephew, no one is more shocked than he to run into Emma again. Or to still have those same feelings. But Jackson isn't looking for love, and neither is Emma, especially not with him. His precocious nephew, though, and a retriever named Bandit, are about to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if Emma Mercer is an overachiever? She has plans to get her doctorate in psychology and create a no-kill shelter for the EST dogs she trains. Which leaves absolutely no time for romance. She's fine with a furry family—dogs don't teach you to love and then rip your heart to shreds. But young Matty's situation tugs at her heartstrings and there's no way she can't help him…and Jackson. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She may have hotter-than-ever chemistry with the soldier, but forgetting the past isn't easy.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Brenda Novak returns to Silver Springs, where no past mistake is so big the heart can’t find a way to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jada Brooks couldn’t have known how her life would change when she fell for bad boy Maddox Richardson back in high school. She couldn’t have known his troubled brother would leave hers forever crippled. Or that she’d be forced to shun Maddox completely—only to discover she was carrying his child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Maddox was devastated by the events that transpired that fateful night, losing Jada was the worst of it. He’s back in Silver Springs, ready to make amends and provide the kind of youth outreach that once saved him. If he’d known Jada was in town, too, he would never have come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jada has returned to Silver Springs to be with family after her father’s death. But when she sees Maddox, every tough decision she’s made concerning their now twelve-year-old daughter begins to haunt her. Falling for him again is so tempting, but not only does she stand to alienate her family—if he finds out about Maya, she could lose what matters most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sure to delight fans of Betty Hechtman and Maggie Sefton, A Crafter Hooks a Killer is the second installment in Holly Quinn’s Handcrafted mysteries.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Community Craft proprietor Sammy Kane suspects that a tantalizing thread links the deaths of her best friend and a bestselling author. But can she weave together the clues?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha “Sammy” Kane is settling into her new life in idyllic Heartsford, Wisconsin, running her late friend Kate Allen’s craft shop, Community Craft when one early June day, bestselling crochet author Jane Johnson visits Heartsford. Captivated by Community Craft, Jane devotes a chapter in her new book, &lt;i&gt;Behind the Seams&lt;/i&gt;, to the store. Sammy is honored, though satisfaction quickly turns to shock when she finds Jane strangled to death―her cold hands clutching a copy of her most recently published book, with the words “THE END” raggedly scratched into the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavens to Etsy! Not only must Sammy contend with the author’s inauspicious demise, she has to untie some knotty details from her own past. It turns out Kate’s death was not what it seemed, and instead somehow hooked to Jane Johnson’s demise. Handsome Detective Liam Nash is on the “skein”, more than happy to see the shop owner again, if less than enamored by her sleuthing interventions. But this was Sammy’s best friend―she has to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Sammy has a “lace” in the hole. As a child, she formed the S.H.E. detective team with her cousin, Heidi, and her sister, Ellie. Having already reconstituted their partnership, the S.H.E. team searches for a pattern behind the latest death. As the case starts to unravel, will Sammy and team be able to sidestep Liam quick enough to stitch together the clues?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s hunting. He’s watching.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Agent Macy Crow is a survivor. After a vicious hit-and-run nearly kills her, she gets right back to work, and now she’s gunning for a spot on the FBI’s elite profiling team. As an audition, she offers to investigate the recently discovered bones of Tobi Turner, a high school girl who disappeared fifteen years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While investigating with local sheriff Mike Nevada, a former colleague and onetime lover, Macy discovers a link between Tobi’s case and several others that occurred around the same time as her disappearance. As Macy interviews victims and examines old cases, she uncovers a sinister picture of a stalker who graduated to sexual assault—and then murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macy and Nevada race to put this monster behind bars before he can come out of hiding. But the murderer’s had years to hone his skills, and soon Macy herself becomes a target. She’s no stranger to pain and terror, but will Macy’s first profiling case be her last?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three friends who met at an elite English boarding school take on the town—and the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;—one by one, in this sparkling new series about love, loss, and lustrous gemstones, from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jane Feather...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FINE ROMANCE…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana Sommerville seems to have it all—beauty, brains, and vast wealth, thanks to her family's ownership of a diamond mine abroad. But when her beloved brother dies in battle and leaves a lion's share of his estate to his best friend, Diana finds herself in a situation that seems scripted for the stage: Sharing her family home with the man she used to love—and now loathes. Worse, her unfaithful former fiancé has already moved in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OR AN EXCELLENT FAKE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rupert Lacey didn't expect Diana to take the news without a fight. Still, he didn't expect her to bring the battle directly to their newly shared doorstep—complete with a full set of trunks, and a full set of orders to the staff. Yet there she is, bold, regal...magnificent as ever. Now they would face a formidable challenge: to ignore each other—and the unanswered questions that stood between them. The only sure thing is their still blazing desire. But with a woman like Diana, it will take nothing less than a momentous misunderstanding, a missing prized mare, and a shocking revelation to restore a love that hasn't lost its shine.</description>

  <description>Petite, kind, brilliant, and young, Stevie is nothing like the usual women bodyguard Shen Li is interested in. Even more surprising, the youngest of the lethal, ball-busting, and beautiful MacKilligan sisters is terrified of bears. But she’s not terrified of pandas. She loves pandas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which means that whether Shen wants her to or not, she simply won’t stop cuddling him. He isn’t some stuffed Giant Panda, ya know! He is a Giant Panda shifter. He deserves respect and personal space. Something that little hybrid is completely ignoring.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Stevie has a way of finding trouble. Like going undercover to take down a scientist experimenting on other shifters. For what, Shen doesn’t want to know, but they’d better find out. And fast. Stevie might be the least violent of the honey badger sisters, but she’s the most dangerous to Shen’s peace of mind. Because she has absolutely no idea how much trouble they’re in . . . or just how damn adorable she is.</description>

  <description>In the snowy Highlands of Scotland, Suzanne McBride is dreaming of the perfect cozy Christmas. Her three adopted daughters are coming home for the holidays and she can’t wait to see them. But tensions are running high…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Workaholic Hannah knows she can’t avoid spending the holidays with her family two years in a row. But it’s not the weight of their expectations that’s panicking her—it’s the life-changing secret she’s hiding. Stay-at-home mom Beth is having a personal crisis. All she wants for Christmas is time to decide if she’s ready to return to work—seeing everyone was supposed to help her stress levels, not increase them! Posy isn’t sure she’s living her best life, but with her parents depending on her, making a change seems risky. But not as risky as falling for gorgeous new neighbor Luke…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Suzanne’s dreams of the perfect McBride Christmas unravel, she must rely on the magic of the season to bring her daughters together. But will this new togetherness teach the sisters that their close-knit bond is strong enough to withstand anything—including a family Christmas?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wings of silver. Wings of blue. Mortal heart. Broken dreams. Shatter. Shatter. Shatter. A sundering. A grave. I see the end. I see. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world is in chaos as the power surge of the Cascade rises to a devastating crescendo. In furiously resisting its attempts to turn Elena into a vessel for Raphael’s power, Elena and her archangel are irrevocably changed. . .far beyond the prophecy of a cursed Ancient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, violent and eerie events around the world threaten to wipe out entire populations. And in the Archangel Lijuan’s former territory, an unnatural fog weaves through the land, leaving only a bone-chilling silence in its wake. Soon it becomes clear that even the archangels are not immune to this deadly evil. This time, even the combined power of the Cadre may not be enough. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This war could end them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Return to New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh’s darkly passionate Guild Hunter world, where human-turned-angel Elena Deveraux, consort to Archangel Raphael, is thrust center stage into an eons-old prophecy….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight and dawn, Elena’s wings are unique among angelkind…and now they’re failing. The first mortal to be turned into an immortal in angelic memory, she’s regressing. Becoming more and more human. Easier to hurt. Easier to kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elena and Raphael must unearth the reason for the regression before it’s too late and Elena falls out of the sky. Yet even as they fight a furious battle for Elena’s very survival, violent forces are gathering in New York and across the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In China, the Archangel Favashi is showing the first signs of madness. In New York, a mysterious sinkhole filled with lava swallows a man whole. In Africa, torrential monsoon rains flood rolling deserts. And in Elena’s mind whispers a haunting voice that isn’t her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, survival may not be possible…not even for the consort of an archangel.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us on a new adventure in this next novel of the Psy-Changeling Trinity series…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of Silence was supposed to create a better world for future generations. But trust is broken, and the alliance between Psy, Changeling, and human is thin. The problems that led to Silence are back in full force. Because Silence fixed nothing, just hid the problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, the Psy have to find a real answer to their problems–if one exists. Or their race will soon go extinct in a cascade of violence. The answer begins with an empath who is attuned to monsters–and who is going to charm a wolf into loving her despite his own demons.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nalini Singh dives beneath the surface of her Psy-Changeling world into a story of passionate devotion and selfless love...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security specialist Bowen Knight has come back from the dead. But there's a ticking time bomb in his head: a chip implanted to block telepathic interference that could fail at any moment--taking his brain along with it. With no time to waste, he should be back on land helping the Human Alliance. Instead, he's at the bottom of the ocean, consumed with an enigmatic changeling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaia Luna may have traded in science for being a chef, but she won't hide the facts of Bo's condition from him or herself. She's suffered too much loss in her life to fall prey to the dangerous charm of a human who is a dead man walking. And she carries a devastating secret Bo could never imagine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Kaia is taken by those who mean her deadly harm, all bets are off. Bo will do anything to get her back--even if it means striking a devil's bargain and giving up his mind to the enemy...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Enter New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh’s breathtakingly passionate Guild Hunter world with the story of a woman who isn’t a vampire or an angel…or human…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once a broken girl known as Sorrow, Holly Chang now prowls the shadowy gray underground of the city for the angels. But it’s not her winged allies who make her a wanted woman—it’s the unknown power coursing through her veins. Brutalized by an insane archangel, she was left with the bloodlust of a vampire, the ability to mesmerize her prey, and a poisonous bite. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, someone has put a bounty on her head… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venom is one of the Seven, Archangel Raphael’s private guard, and he’s as infuriating as he is seductive. A centuries-old vampire, his fangs dispense a poison deadlier than Holly’s. But even if Venom can protect Holly from those hunting her, he might not be able to save himself—because the strange, violent power inside Holly is awakening… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is safe.</description>

  <description>Control. Precision. Family. These are the principles that drive Silver Mercant. At a time when the fledgling Trinity Accord seeks to unite a divided world, with Silver playing a crucial role as director of a worldwide emergency response network, wildness and chaos are the last things she needs in her life. But that's exactly what Valentin Nikolaev, alpha of the StoneWater bears, brings with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valentin has never met a more fascinating woman. Though Silver is ruled by Silence--her mind clear of all emotion--Valentin senses a whisper of fire around her. That's what keeps him climbing apartment buildings to be near her. But when a shadow assassin almost succeeds in poisoning Silver, the stakes become deadly serious...and Silver finds herself in the heart of a powerful bear clan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her would-be assassin has no idea what their poison has unleashed...</description>

  <description>Gladiator meets Game of Thrones: a royal woman becomes a skilled warrior to destroy her murderous cousin, avenge her family, and save her kingdom in this first entry in a dazzling fantasy epic from the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of the Elemental Assassin series—an enthralling tale that combines magic, murder, intrigue, adventure, and a hint of romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a realm where one’s magical power determines one’s worth, Lady Everleigh’s lack of obvious ability relegates her to the shadows of the royal court of Bellona, a kingdom steeped in gladiator tradition. Seventeenth in line for the throne, Evie is nothing more than a ceremonial fixture, overlooked and mostly forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark forces are at work inside the palace. When her cousin Vasilia, the crown princess, assassinates her mother the queen and takes the throne by force, Evie is also attacked, along with the rest of the royal family. Luckily for Evie, her secret immunity to magic helps her escape the massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced into hiding to survive, she falls in with a gladiator troupe. Though they use their talents to entertain and amuse the masses, the gladiators are actually highly trained warriors skilled in the art of war, especially Lucas Sullivan, a powerful magier with secrets of his own. Uncertain of her future—or if she even has one—Evie begins training with the troupe until she can decide her next move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the bloodthirsty Vasilia exerts her power, pushing Bellona to the brink of war, Evie’s fate becomes clear: she must become a fearsome gladiator herself . . . and kill the queen.</description>

  <description>Stieg Engstrom, Angriest Viking Ever, has got big problems. The human Viking Clans of earth are in danger of being obliterated—along with the rest of the world—and the only one who may be able to save them is a super pain-in-the-ass Crow. Most people annoy Stieg, but this is the one woman he really can’t stand…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin Amsel loves being a Crow! Why wouldn’t she when the other Viking Clans are so hilariously arrogant and humorless? She’s not about to let all that come to an end! She just didn’t expect to be shoulder to shoulder in battle with Stieg. Then again, he’s so easy to torment—and also kind of cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the future of the world riding on them, Stieg knows he’ll have to put aside his desperate need to kiss the smirk right off Erin’s face. Wait. What? He didn’t mean that—did he? No! They have one goal: To conquer the idiots. Because nothing bugs Stieg more than when idiots win. If only he can keep himself from suddenly acting like one….</description>

  <description>Just when Nevada Baylor has finally come to accept the depths of her magical powers, she also realizes she’s fallen in love. Connor “Mad” Rogan is in many ways her equal when it comes to magic, but she’s completely out of her elements when it comes to her feelings for him. To make matters more complicated, an old flame comes back into Rogan’s life…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan knows there’s nothing between him and his ex-fiance, Rynda Sherwood. But as Nevada begins to learn more about her past, her power, and her potential future, he knows she will be faced with choices she never dreamed of and the promise of a life spent without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Nevada and Rogan race to discover the whereabouts of Rynda’s kidnapped husband and are forced to confront Nevada’s grandmother, who may or may not have evil motives, these two people must decide if they can trust in each other or allow everything to go up in smoke.</description>

  <description>Nevada Baylor has a unique and secret skill—she &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; when people are lying—and she's used that magic (along with plain, hard work) to keep her colorful and close-knit family's detective agency afloat. But her new case pits her against the shadowy forces that almost destroyed the city of Houston once before, bringing Nevada back into contact with Connor "Mad" Rogan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rogan is a billionaire Prime—the highest rank of magic user—and as unreadable as ever, despite Nevada’s “talent.” But there’s no hiding the sparks between them. Now that the stakes are even higher, both professionally and personally, and their foes are unimaginably powerful, Rogan and Nevada will find that nothing burns like ice …</description>

  <description>Special Agent Gideon Reynolds has tried hard to put his past behind him. He escaped the violence of his cult upbringing when he was just thirteen, and since then routine and discipline have been his way of making sense of the world. But when a petite blonde woman crashes into his life, he begins to realize that a little bit of chaos might not be so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Dawson has had more than her fair share of pain too—but she's done being a victim. Daisy's determined to explore every new experience she can—including getting to know the dark and serious FBI investigator she meets when she fights off a masked attacker one night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soon becomes clear that Daisy's attack was just the beginning. Now the bloodied bodies of young women are showing up all over California, and, as Gideon tries to find the killer, it's clear that Daisy is in more danger than they ever realised...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A ruthless gang leader. A deadly vendetta. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karen Rose returns with the break-neck follow-up to MONSTER IN THE CLOSET, and the sixth book in the heart-pounding Baltimore Series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gwyn Weaver is as resilient as anyone could be. Having survived an attempted murder, she has rebuilt her life and reclaimed her dignity and strength. She's always known about her feelings for defence attorney Thomas Thorne, but as her friend and a colleague there could be no chance of anything more... or could there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thorne has known violence and pain all his life. He's overcome the hardships that have been thrown at him thanks to his own steel, and the love of his loyal friends. Now he's thinking it might finally be time to let his guard down, and allow himself to let in the woman he's always admired from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Thorne's whole world is torn apart — he is found unconscious in his own bed, the lifeless body of a stranger lying next to him, her blood on his hands. Knowing Thorne could never have committed such a terrible crime, Gwyn and his friends rally round to clear his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But this is just the beginning — the beginning of a brutal campaign to destroy Thorne, and everything he holds dear...&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The fourth and final book in Karen Rose's nail-biting Cincinnati Series revisits your favourite characters battling crime in the city's dark underbelly. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homicide detective Adam Kimble is no stranger to battling demons. But Meredith Fallon is a different kind of weakness: one that could actually be good for him, if only he would let himself depend on her. Meredith has loved Adam for a year, and seeing how hard he's worked to deal with his PTSD makes her feelings only stronger, but she respects his needs. Her work keeps her busy anyway: she counsels sexually abused women like Mallory Martin to help them reintegrate into the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But someone doesn't want Meredith helping women like Mallory, and Meredith finds herself in the crosshairs of a very determined killer. Adam would risk anything for her, but they'll soon find out she isn't the only target...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Monster in the Closet&lt;/i&gt; reunites readers with characters from Karen Rose's bestselling Baltimore series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother is dead, and now her killer hunts the child that witnessed the brutal crime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Private Investigator Clay Maynard locates missing children for clients, but has nearly given up hope of finding his own daughter, cruelly stolen from him by his ex-wife twenty-three years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equine therapist Taylor Dawson has chosen to intern at Daphne Montgomery-Carter's stables so that she can observe the program's security director - her father, Clay Maynard. Trying to reconcile the wonderful man she's getting to know with the monster her mother always described, Taylor never expects to become the target of a real monster, the man who murdered the mother of the little girls she works with at the stable. Neither does she expect to fall for Ford Elkhart, Daphne's handsome son, who is dealing with his own demons. As family and friends gather for a wedding, Taylor starts to imagine a permanent life in Baltimore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not if the real monster gets to her first...</description>

  <description>As the new music box store owner and resident of Keepsake Cove, a quaint town full of collectible shops on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Callie Reed is eager to get more involved in her community. She volunteers to plan the Fall street decorations and welcome a visiting author who's come for a special book signing. But the celebratory mood is cut short when the local B&amp;amp;B owner is found dead, killed by a pair of vintage scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspicion is cast on the victim's estranged wife, Dorothy, who owns Keepsake Cove's vintage sewing shop. Callie is sure Dorothy is innocent, and the visiting author agrees. Together, they begin their own investigation, only to discover that many people in Keepsake Cove have secrets. Secrets that are worth killing to keep quiet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Susan Mallery, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Fool’s Gold romances, proves there’s nowhere better than Happily Inc to rekindle first love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver Tesdal has a head for business and a mouth made for kissing, and banker Drew Lovato has his eye on both. But ever since he was dumb enough to let her go, she’s kept him at a distance. When the bank turns her down for a loan, Drew sees a double opportunity—he can finance her brilliant, unique idea to rock Happily Inc’s wedding industry &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; win back her trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her reputation, Silver’s not as tough as she seems. Losing Drew nearly destroyed her. Still, his kisses are as tempting as his offer to invest in her business. If she can’t quite get over him, maybe she should get &lt;i&gt;under&lt;/i&gt; him and knock him out of her system once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her best laid plans begin to unravel as Silver finds herself falling even harder than when they were high school sweethearts. Which means that she’ll have to come clean about the secret she’s been hiding from him for years—and risk losing him forever.</description>

  <description>The #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Fool's Gold romances invites you to visit Happily Inc., a wedding destination founded on a fairy tale &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sculptor Nick Mitchell grew up in a family of artists and learned from his volatile father that passion only leads to pain. As he waits on a new commission, he takes a day job as a humble carpenter at a theme wedding venue. The job has its perks—mainly the venue's captivating owner, Pallas Saunders. Although he won't let love consume him, for ecstasy with an expiration date, he's all in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pallas adores Weddings in a Box. But if she can't turn the floundering business around, she'll have no choice but cave to her domineering mother and trade taffeta for trust funds working at the family's bank. Then when a desperate bride begs Pallas for something completely out of the box, her irresistible new hire inspires her. Nick knows she doesn't belong behind a desk, and she knows in her heart that he's right—where she really belongs is in his arms.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following the &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Lost and Found Sisters&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;Rainy Day Friends&lt;/i&gt;, Jill Shalvis’ moving story of heart, loss, betrayal, and friendship.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months after Lanie Jacobs’ husband’s death, it’s hard to imagine anything could deepen her sense of pain and loss. But then Lanie discovers she isn’t the only one grieving his sudden passing. A serial adulterer, he left behind several other women who, like Lanie, each believe she was his legally wedded wife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocked by the infidelity, Lanie is left to grapple with searing questions. How could she be so wrong about a man she thought she knew better than anyone? Will she ever be able to trust another person? Can she even trust herself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to make a fresh start, Lanie impulsively takes a job at the family-run Capriotti Winery. At first, she feels like an outsider among the boisterous Capriottis. With no real family of her own, she’s bewildered by how quickly they all take her under their wing and make her feel like she belongs. Especially Mark Capriotti, a gruffly handsome Air Force veteran turned deputy sheriff who manages to wind his way into Lanie’s cold, broken heart—along with the rest of the clan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is finally going well for her, but the arrival of River Green changes all that. The fresh-faced twenty-one-year old seems as sweet as they come…until her dark secrets come to light—secrets that could destroy the new life Lanie’s only just begun to build.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Susan Mallery welcomes you to Happily Inc, where true love isn’t just for fairy tales…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Kaleta will do anything for the artists at her gallery, including risk life, limb and the effect of humidity on her naturally curly hair. Braving a downpour to check on reclusive Ronan Mitchell, Natalie gets stranded by a mudslide at his mountain home, where the brooding glass artist reveals his playful side, sending her inconvenient crush from under-the-radar to over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a secret tore apart his family and made him question his sense of self, Ronan fled his hometown for Happily Inc, but the sunny small town can’t fix his damaged heart. He won’t give in to his attraction for beautiful, perpetually cheerful Natalie. She’s untouched by darkness—or so he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie knows that when a heart goes through the flame, it comes out stronger. Life may not be a fairy tale, but sometimes dreams do come true. Why not this one? Why not tonight?</description>

  <description>Lieutenant Eve Dallas puzzles over a bizarre suicide bombing in a Wall St. office building in the latest in the #1 New York Times bestselling series…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the airline executives finalizing a merger that would make news in the business world, the nine a.m. meeting would be a major milestone. But after marketing VP Paul Rogan walked into the plush conference room, strapped with explosives, the headlines told of death and destruction instead. The NYPSD’s Eve Dallas confirms that Rogan was cruelly coerced by two masked men holding his family hostage. His motive was saving his wife and daughter―but what was the motive of the masked men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the chaos and bad publicity, blowing up one meeting isn’t going to put the brakes on the merger. All it’s accomplished is shattering a lot of innocent lives. Now, with the help of her billionaire husband Roarke, Eve must untangle the reason for an inexplicable act of terror, look at suspects inside and outside both corporations, and determine whether the root of this crime lies in simple sabotage, or something far more complex and twisted.</description>

He does—if I find him one, too.&lt;br /&gt;Since we own Stupid Cupid, it should be easy, right? And it is.&lt;br /&gt;My date is perfect. His date is perfect. Everything is perfect. &lt;br /&gt;Until he kisses me…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three dates.&lt;br /&gt;One kiss.&lt;br /&gt;And a big-ass mess…</description>

  <description>1.Hate-screw my high school nemesis.&lt;br /&gt;2.Remember to hate him.&lt;br /&gt;3.Prove my brother wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It should be easy.&lt;br /&gt;It isn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the owner of Pick-A-D*ck, New Orleans’ premier hook-up website, my job is simple. Connect two people for a no-strings, no-expectations hook-up. The plus for my clients is that I’m the one who gets to sift through the d*ck pics—except this time, they're required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem? My brother, co-owner of Pick-A-D*ck’s sister dating site, doesn’t believe it’s possible to hook up with someone three times and not fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;I disagree. I know it’s possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my disagreement is exactly how I end up reconnected with my high school nemesis, Elliott Sloane. The guy who asked me to junior prom and then stood me up. Who egged my car when I rejected him, and convinced my senior homecoming date to ghost me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be easy to hate-screw him. If only he was still that person, instead of a hot-as-hell single dad, working as a builder to make ends’ meet, fighting for custody of his daughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three hook-ups.&lt;br /&gt;One outcome.&lt;br /&gt;Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;The Hook-Up Experiment&lt;/i&gt; is book one of the &lt;i&gt;Experiment&lt;/i&gt; duet. If you've read &lt;i&gt;The Upside to Being Single&lt;/i&gt;, this is Peyton's story.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>RUMORS AND GOSSIP... THE LIFEBLOOD OF LONDON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Olivia Bevelstoke is told that her new neighbor may have killed his fiancee, she doesn't believe it for a second, but, still, how can she help spying on him, just to be sure? So she stakes out a spot near her bedroom window, cleverly concealed by curtains, watches, and waits... and discovers a most intriguing man, who is definitely up to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Harry Valentine works for the boring branch of the War Office, translating documents vital to national security. He's not a spy, but he's had all the training, and when a gorgeous blonde begins to watch him from her window, he is instantly suspicious. But just when he decides that she's nothing more than an annoyingly nosy debutante, he discovers that she might be engaged to a foreign prince, who might be plotting against England. And when Harry is roped into spying on Olivia, he discovers that he might be falling for her himself...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Beard With Me’ is the origin story of Billy Winston and Scarlet St. Claire (aka Claire McClure) and is just the beginning of their epic love story. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at surviving than Scarlet St. Claire and making the best out of circumstances beyond her control is Scarlet’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, she’d be the last person on earth, hermitting like a pro, singing along to her CD Walkman, and dancing like no one is watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet is clever, Scarlet is careful, and Scarlet is smart . . . except when it comes to Billy Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at fighting than Billy Winston and raging against his circumstances—because nothing is beyond his control—is Billy’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, he’d be the first person on earth to lead others to safety, overcome catastrophe, or die trying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy is fearless, Billy is disciplined, and Billy is honorable . . . except when it comes to Scarlet St. Claire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are three things you need to know about Kat Tanner (aka Kathleen Tyson.&lt;/b&gt; . . and yes, she is *that* Kathleen Tyson): 1) She’s determined to make good decisions, 2) She must get married ASAP, and 3) She knows how to knit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a billionaire heiress isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Determined to live a quiet life, Kat Tanner changed her identity years ago and eschewed her family’s legacy. But now, Kat’s silver spoon past has finally caught up with her, and so have her youthful mistakes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid imminent disaster, she must marry immediately; it is essential that the person she chooses have no romantic feelings for her whatsoever and be completely trustworthy. Fortunately, she knows exactly who to ask. Dan O’Malley checks all the boxes: single, romantically indifferent to her, completely trustworthy. Sure, she might have a wee little crush on Dan the Security Man, but with clear rules, expectations, and a legally binding contract, Kat is certain she can make it through this debacle with her sanity—and heart—all in one piece. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except, what happens when Dan O’Malley isn’t as indifferent—or as trustworthy—as she thought?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ Goodreads Choice Award Semi-Finalist for Best Romance ★★★★★&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marriage of Inconvenience is book #7 in the Knitting in the City series. Each book is a standalone, full length (110k words), contemporary romantic comedy novel, and follows the misadventures and exploits of seven friends in Chicago, all members of the same knitting group.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;ARE YOU READY TO GET CUFFED?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cop, Levi Kincaid is all about discipline and control... in the bedroom, and out of it, and he's always been very careful about choosing women who abide by his rules. Hot sex and intense pleasure? No problem. Emotional commitment and forever promises? No way. But he never anticipates falling for a blue eyed angel who makes him want to cuff her to his bed and do dirty, sexy things to her. And that control of his? It doesn't stand a chance against Sarah Robins, the one woman he can't resist...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;If you’re planning on falling in love…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the confident, charismatic Caleb Parker, Sadie Lane feels the spark—the kind that comes from rubbing each other the wrong way. She’s a tattoo artist, he’s a straight-laced mogul. But after they accidentally co-rescue an abandoned dog from a storm, Sadie sees a vulnerable side to the seemingly invincible hottie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;you’d better be sure…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb doesn’t do emotions. Growing up the underdog, he’s learned the hard way to build up an impenetrable wall. Perfect for business. Disastrous for relationships. He’s never worried about it before—not until he finally gets behind Sadie’s armor and begins to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;… someone is there to catch you.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both guarded and vulnerable, Sadie and Caleb are complete opposites. Or are they? Shocked at their undeniable connection, can they ever admit to wanting more? That all depends on what they’re each willing to risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Who needs mistletoe?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people wouldn't think of a bad Santa case as the perfect Christmas gift. Then again, Molly Malone, office manager at Hunt Investigations, isn't most people, and she could really use a distraction from the fantasies she's been having since spending the night with her very secret crush, Lucas Knight. Nothing happened, not that Lucas knows that — but Molly just wants to enjoy being a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;naughty for once...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiskey and pain meds for almost-healed bullet wounds don't mix. Lucas needs to remember that next time he's shot on the job, which may be sooner rather than later if Molly's brother, Joe, finds out about them. Lucas can't believe he's drawing a blank on his (supposedly) passionate tryst with Molly, who's the hottest, smartest, strongest woman he's ever known. Strong enough to kick his butt if she discovers he's been assigned to babysit her on her first case. And hot enough to melt his cold heart this Christmas.</description>

  <description>Blood might be thicker than water, but venom is stronger than just about anything …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to be a nice, quiet, simple dinner with friends—but nothing is ever nice, quiet, or simple when you’re Gin Blanco, the Spider, notorious assassin and current queen of the Ashland underworld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, someone seems to be targeting Stuart Mosley, the president of First Trust bank. Lots of people have grudges against Mosley, but the more I investigate, the more Mosley’s problems seem to be connected to some of my own, especially when it comes to the Circle, the evil, shadowy group that is secretly responsible for much of the crime and corruption in Ashland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when another blast from my dark and deadly past as the Spider comes to light, I wonder if I’ll be able to survive this dangerous new enemy, who has a burning thirst for revenge that will only be satisfied with one thing: my death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The title of this book has been changed from Cold Sting to Venom in the Veins.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Running in five-inch stilettos is an art form&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving your fiancé at the altar on live television is a disaster. Lexie Kowalsky thought she was ready to get married in front of millions of people, but at the last minute she fled the set of television’s hottest reality show, &lt;i&gt;Gettin’ Hitched&lt;/i&gt;. Wearing a poofy white dress and a pair of five-inch sparkly shoes, Lexie hopped a float plane for Sandspit, Canada. She figured no one would find her there. But she was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharing her flight was the Seattle Chinooks biggest star, Sean Knox. Lexie wasn’t just a reality-show runaway, she was his pain in the butt coach’s daughter. She was chaos and temptation and definitely off limits, but getting her luscious body out of that wedding gown, he couldn’t resist getting her in his bed for one amazing night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a photo of Sean and Lexi breaks the internet—and suddenly they’re both swept up in a crazy plan to spin the whole story. But you can’t run from love—&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Carl and Marianne were high school sweethearts, loving the way only teenagers can—with no thought to logic or pride, just a bone-headed, optimistic frenzy of unicorns and hormones. That was all they needed. Or so Carl thought.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scared of being stuck in Lake Sackett, Georgia, like so many of her friends—without a real shot at a future or achieving her own dreams—Marianne panicked and bolted to college after stomping Carl’s heart into the high grass. But when she returns to Lake Sackett for the summer with her family after years away, she and Carl are drawn together like moths to a flame. As they rekindle their old romance and remember what it was like to be in love, they have to wonder: is this, finally, their real chance at happiness?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Kristan Higgins and Amy E. Reichert, this warmhearted and witty love story introduces Molly Harper’s new Southern Eclectic series set in the small town of Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 3 hrs and 32 mins</description>

Lulled into the story plot, only for the rug to be pulled from under my feet. <br /><br />There are strong characters and storylines but this addition provided no conclusion, I’m hoping it’s a prelude and the next instalment will 1) expand on the buddi...]]>

  <description>From beloved romance author Molly Harper (&lt;i&gt;Half-Moon Hollow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Nice Girls&lt;/i&gt; series) comes the first title in her new rom-com women’s fiction series, Southern Eclectic, which features the lives, losses and loves of the McCready family as they manage their family’s generational funeral home and bait shop (you read that correctly) on the shore of picturesque Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type-A Margot Cary is the leading event planner for the crème de la crème of Chicago high society. No request is too extravagant for her to execute with trademark perfection. That is, until an unfortunate incident involving a shrimp tower, live flamingos, and a shellfish allergy puts her on the black list of the rich and social and out of a job. With the lights about to be shut off in the trendy condo she can no longer afford, and her savings account dwindling, Margot’s situation is near to desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In steps her birth father’s side of the family (who she’s never met), the McCreadys…the McCreadys of the McCready Family Funeral Home and Bait Shop in small town Georgia—and as luck would have it, they’re looking for an event planner and don’t care about her reputation among the A-list crowd. As Margot tackles small town life—where everyone knows everything about everyone—and builds a relationship with a father who she’d never known, she discovers the comforts that community, a rather large extended family, and a rugged, unpretentious country man can offer...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An Atlanta ex-cop comes to sleepy Lake Sackett, Georgia, seeking peace and quiet—but he hasn’t bargained on falling for Frankie, the cutest coroner he’s ever met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie McCready talks to dead people. Not like a ghost whisperer or anything—but it seems rude to embalm them and not at least say hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, at the McCready Family Funeral Home &amp;amp; Bait Shop, Frankie’s eccentricities fit right in. Lake Sackett’s embalmer and county coroner, Frankie’s goth styling and passion for nerd culture mean she’s not your typical Southern girl, but the McCreadys are hardly your typical Southern family. Led by Great-Aunt Tootie, the gambling, boozing, dog-collecting matriarch of the family, everyone looks out for one another—which usually means getting up in everyone else’s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that’s why Frankie is so fascinated by new sheriff Eric Linden...a recent transplant from Atlanta, he sees a homicide in every hunting accident or boat crash, which seems a little paranoid for this sleepy tourist town. What’s he so worried about? And what kind of cop can get a job with the Atlanta PD but can’t stand to look at a dead body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie has other questions that need answering first—namely, who’s behind the recent break-in attempts at the funeral home, and how can she stop them? This one really does seem like a job for the sheriff—and as Frankie and Eric do their best Scooby-Doo impressions to catch their man, they get closer to spilling some secrets they thought were buried forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A member of the famed Texas Rangers, Daxton Chambers has dealt with more than his share of depravity. But the Lone Star Reaper takes evil to a whole new level, kidnapping and burying women alive. It's Dax's job to help keep San Antonio safe, but even with help from friends in various law enforcement agencies, the killer remains two steps ahead. It's hardly the ideal time for a relationship, but Mackenzie Morgan is too luscious to resist. Dax wants her--which makes her an instant target for his newfound enemy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Reaper gets personal, it will take every ounce of Daxton's considerable skill and training to keep Mack alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;**&lt;i&gt;Justice for Mackenzie&lt;/i&gt; is the 1st book in the &lt;i&gt;Badge of Honor: Texas Heroes Series&lt;/i&gt;. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Gripping standalone thriller from the Sunday Times No. 1 bestselling author of the Logan McRae series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the Misfit Mob…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s where Police Scotland dumps the officers it can’t get rid of, but wants to: the outcasts, the troublemakers, the compromised. Officers like DC Callum MacGregor, lumbered with all the boring go-nowhere cases. So when an ancient mummy turns up at the Oldcastle tip, it’s his job to find out which museum it’s been stolen from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Callum uncovers links between his ancient corpse and three missing young men, and life starts to get a lot more interesting. O Division’s Major Investigation Teams already have more cases than they can cope with, so, against everyone’s better judgement, the Misfit Mob are just going to have to manage this one on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one expects them to succeed, but right now they’re the only thing standing between the killer’s victims and a slow, lingering death. The question is, can they prove everyone wrong before he strikes again?</description>

  <description>The Danover Royal family can’t weather another scandal following Phillip’s notorious wedding. Now, Eric “the spare” is tasked with going full on proper royal to rectify his party boy image. He can start by curing cancer -- or at least working on funding a new scientific breakthrough for breast cancer. But when he finds that the scientist behind the new treatment is sexier than all the sinning he’s done in recent years his ‘good boy’ image change hits a major roadblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Fernstone has happily avoided one royal wedding only to end up engaged financially with the second in line. What are the odds? Surely it wasn’t normal for a single scientist to have to ward off everyone in line for the throne. But when Eric proves to know a thing or two about the female breast, Anna is too taken to stop him. With their livelihoods on the line, do they risk a once in a lifetime romance even if it has the potential to ruin the reputations they’ve worked so hard to build? In the end they’ll have to choose what means more: what the world thinks or what they think of each other.</description>

  <description>Nell is twenty-six and has never been to Paris. She's never even been on a romantic weekend away--to anywhere--before. Traveling abroad isn't really her thing. But when Nell's boyfriend fails to show up for their mini-vacation, she has the opportunity to prove everyone--including herself--wrong. Alone in Paris, Nell finds a version of herself she never knew existed: independent and intrepid. Could this turn out to be the most adventurous weekend of her life? Funny, charming, and irresistible, &lt;i&gt;Paris for One&lt;/i&gt; is quintessential Jojo Moyes--as are the other stories that round out the collection.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;All is fair in love and hockey…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire O’Connor is back in Juniper Falls, but that doesn’t mean she wants to be. One semester off, that’s what she promised herself. Just long enough to take care of her father and keep the family business—a hockey bar beside the ice rink—afloat. After that, she’s getting the hell out. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Tate Tanley. What happened between them the night before she left town resurfaces the second they lay eyes on each other. But the guy she remembers has been replaced by a total hottie. When Tate is unexpectedly called in to take over for the hockey team’s star goalie, suddenly he’s in the spotlight and on his way to becoming just another egotistical varsity hockey player. And Claire’s sworn off Juniper Falls hockey players for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the absolute worst time to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Tate and Claire, hockey isn’t just a game. And they both might not survive a body check to the heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meet cute...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run for the hills—temporarily&lt;/em&gt;. That's Colbie Albright's plan when she flees New York for San Francisco. Wrangling her crazy family by day and writing a bestselling YA fantasy series by night has taken its toll. In short, Colbie's so over it that she's under it. She's also under the waters of a historic San Francisco fountain within an hour of arrival. Fortunately, the guy who fishes Colbie out has her looking forward to Christmas among strangers. But she's pretty sure Spencer Baldwin won't be a stranger for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make merry...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spence's commitment to hiding from the Ghosts of Relationships Past means he doesn't have to worry about the powerful—okay, crazy hot chemistry—he's got with Colbie. Just because she can laugh at anything, especially herself... just because she's gorgeous and a great listener just because she gets Spence immediately doesn't mean he won't be able to let Colbie go. Does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and hope for a miracle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the clock's ticking for Colbie and Spence: Two weeks to cut loose. Two weeks to fall hard. Two weeks to figure out how to make this Christmas last a lifetime.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;They say life can change in an instant…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her sister in a devastating car accident, chef Quinn Weller is finally getting her life back on track. She appears to have it all: a loving family, a dream job in one of L.A.'s hottest eateries, and a gorgeous boyfriend dying to slip an engagement ring on her finger. So why does she feel so empty, like she's looking for a missing piece she can't find? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer comes when a lawyer tracks down Quinn and reveals a bombshell secret and a mysterious inheritance that only she can claim. This shocking revelation washes over Quinn like a tidal wave. Her whole life has been a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On impulse, Quinn gives up her job, home, and boyfriend. She heads up the coast to the small hometown of Wildstone, California, which is just a few hours north, but feels worlds apart from Los Angeles. Though she doesn't quite fit in right away, she can't help but be drawn to the town’s simple pleasures…and the handsome, dark-haired stranger who offers friendship with no questions asked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Quinn settles into Wildstone, she discovers there's another surprise in store for her. The inheritance isn't a house or money, but rather something earthshattering, something that will make her question everything she thought she knew about herself, about her family. Now with a world of possibilities opening up to Quinn, she must decide if this new life is the one she was always meant to have—and the one that could finally give her the fulfillment she's searched so long for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When love drives you crazy . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sexy Joe Malone never calls after their explosive kiss, Kylie shoves him out of her mind. Until she needs a favor, and it’s a doozy. Something precious to her has been stolen and there’s only one person with unique finder-and-fixer skills that can help—Joe. It means swallowing her pride and somehow trying to avoid the temptation to throttle him—or seduce him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the best thing to do . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, Joe didn’t call after the kiss. He’s the fun time guy, not the forever guy. And Kylie, after all she’s been through, deserves a good man who will stay. But everything about Kylie makes it damned hard to focus, and though his brain knows what he has to do, his heart isn’t getting the memo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;… is enjoy the ride.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kylie and Joe go on the scavenger hunt of their lives, they discover surprising things about each other. Now, the best way for them to get over “that kiss” might just be to replace it with a hundred more.</description>

  <description>In a world where marriage doesn’t exist—only seven-year contracts—you don’t marry, you sign. You don’t divorce, you breach. And sometimes, you just expire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this hilarious conclusion to Erin Lyon's I Love You Subject to the Following Terms and Conditions, Kate has accepted a job practicing signing law, the one type of law she swore she'd never do - especially since what she thought was her very own happily ever after turned into just another expired contract. But between Kate's embarrassing penchant for running into exes in court, clients determined to use her as their very own therapist, and a couple having a knock-down, drag-out over the custody of the family guinea pig, at least the job's never boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Kate finally has a handle on her career, her love life is still, well, complicated. The former love of her life, Jonathan, wants her back. Her current main squeeze, Dave, wants to take things to the next level, but she still can't shake her wolf-in-sheep's-clothing vibe about him. And then there's Adam, her mad crush who really wants to be her friend. So, to sum up, one questionable ex, one player with a capital "P," and one guy who's kind of stolen her heart even though she's in the friend zone. This should be a piece of cake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unconditionally is both a sweet and sexy romantic comedy and a hilariously relatable look at finding happiness where you least expect it.</description>

  <description>Growing up in a small town isn’t easy, especially when you’re the daughter of a local cult leader. Ten years ago, Eden Collins left Clear Springs, Montana, and never once looked back. But when the bodies of murdered young women surface, their corpses violated and marked with tattoos worn by her mother’s followers, Eden, now an FBI agent, can’t turn a blind eye. To catch the killer, she’s going to have to return to the fold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheriff Zach Owens isn’t comfortable putting Eden in danger, even if she is an elite agent. And he certainly wasn’t expecting to be so attracted to her. As calm and cool as she appears, he knows this can’t be a happy homecoming. Zach wants to protect her—from her mother, the cult, and the evil that lurks behind its locked gates. But Eden is his only key to the tight-lipped group, and she may just be closer to the killer than either one of them suspects…</description>

  <description>Four years ago I lost my virginity on live, streaming television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I wasn’t awake for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video went viral. Of course it would. A Senator’s daughter on camera? Wouldn’t you click “share”? Besides, that’s what three of the four guys in the video did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They shared me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that fourth guy? The nondescript one in the background in the upper left corner of the screen, just sitting on the couch? The only one who did nothing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one single thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my boyfriend, Drew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that was the last time I saw him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until today, when my father—now on a path to the White House—hired him as head of security for my new team as I return home after four years of “recovering” in an undisclosed location that involved white lab coats, needles, pills and damage control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, the other three guys never went to jail. Never had charges pressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never faced consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game on.&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;A Harmless Little Game is the first in this political thriller/romantic suspense trilogy by USA Today bestselling author Meli Raine.</description>

  <description>A known serial killer is once again taking lives in Chicago. Bodies drained of blood are being strewn across the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For former Tampa homicide sergeant, Hank Rawlings, tracking down the man responsible for the killings becomes his first assignment at his new position, agent in the FBI's homicide division of the serial crimes unit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost before the ink dries on the new job’s acceptance papers, Hank finds himself in Chicago, knee-deep in an investigation with a mounting body count. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While every lead brings him and his partner closer to the killer, the one that puts them directly in front of him threatens them most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A wonderful story full of romance, forgiveness and the unavoidable ties that bind, &lt;i&gt;Secrets Of The Tulip Sisters&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Mallery at her very best.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly Murphy's life as a tulip farmer is pretty routine—up at dawn, off to work, lather, rinse, repeat. But everything changes one sun-washed summer with two dramatic homecomings: Griffith Burnett—Tulpen Crossing's prodigal son, who's set his sights on Kelly—and Olivia, her beautiful, wayward and, as far as Kelly is concerned, unwelcome sister. Tempted by Griffith, annoyed by Olivia, Kelly is overwhelmed by the secrets that were so easy to keep when she was alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Olivia's return isn't as triumphant as she pretends. Her job has no future, and ever since her dad sent her away from the bad boy she loved, she has felt cut off from her past. She's determined to reclaim her man and her place in the family…whether her sister likes it or not. For ten years, she and Kelly have been strangers. Olivia will get by without her approval now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Kelly and Olivia butt heads, their secrets tumble out in a big hot mess, revealing some truths that will change everything they thought they knew. Can they forgive each other—and themselves—and redefine what it means to be sisters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with Mallery's trademark heart and humor, the Tulip Sisters are in for the most colorful summer of their lives…</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A touching modern fairy tale that won't let go of your heart, from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Fool's Gold romances!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mathias Mitchell's easy smile hides a world of hurt. After the worst kind of family betrayal, he moves to Happily Inc., California—the wedding destination town supplies a steady stream of bridesmaids, perfect for his "no promises, no pain" lifestyle. Yet he can't stop watching for his beautiful, elusive neighbor on the animal preserve behind their homes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gamekeeper Carol Lund knows she's not special enough to attract an alpha male like Mathias, so his offer to help her adopt a herd for her lonely giraffe is surprising—and his determined seduction, even more so. But just as she finally welcomes him into her bed, his careless actions crush her heart. Will she give him a second chance to prove she'll always come first in his heart?</description>

  <description>The chic Manhattan nightspot Du Vin is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it’s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that’s exactly what happens one cold February evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described “social information reporter,” or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she’d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone’s done the same to her, literally—with a knife to the brachial artery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve didn’t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she’ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself. But along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn’t want to know…</description>

With the help of her friends, she quickly identifies a few possibilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a cuddle? Use a professional cuddler. Need affirmation? Get yourself a life coach. Need an orgasm? Try orgasm meditation! Why does she need the hassle of a romantic partner when she can meet all her needs with paid services?&lt;br /&gt;But then her irritating date resurfaces. And he’s not at all the person she thought he was. And he suggests a different—and crazier—solution to her dilemma . . .&lt;br /&gt;As everyone knows (or will soon come to realize), traditional relations between humans are a thing of the past. Robots are our future. And if robots are our future, then why do we need other people at all?</description>

  <description>The twisty, gripping number one bestseller from Richard and Judy Book Club winner Clare Mackintosh, author of I Let You Go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Richard and Judy Summer Book Club 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zoe Walker sees her photo in the classifieds section of a London newspaper, she is determined to find out why it's there. There's no explanation: just a grainy image, a website address and a phone number. She takes it home to her family, who are convinced it's just someone who looks like Zoe. But the next day the advert shows a photo of a different woman, and another the day after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a mistake? A coincidence? Or is someone keeping track of every move they make...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Shari Lapena, Paula Hawkins, Rachel Abbott, B A Paris, Fiona Barton, Ruth Ware and CL Taylor, you'll love this gripping psychological thriller.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;While you were sleeping...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her brother Thomas injured on the battlefront in the Colonies, orphaned Cecilia Harcourt has two unbearable choices: move in with a maiden aunt or marry a scheming cousin. Instead, she chooses option three and travels across the Atlantic, determined to nurse her brother back to health. But after a week of searching, she finds not her brother but his best friend, the handsome officer Edward Rokesby. He's unconscious and in desperate need of her care, and Cecilia vows that she will save this soldier's life, even if staying by his side means telling one little lie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I told everyone I was your wife&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Edward comes to, he's more than a little confused. The blow to his head knocked out six months of his memory, but surely he would recall getting &lt;i&gt;married&lt;/i&gt;. He knows who Cecilia Harcourt is—even if he does not recall her face—and with everyone calling her his wife, he decides it must be true, even though he'd always assumed he'd marry his neighbor back in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;If only it were true...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecilia risks her entire future by giving herself—completely—to the man she loves. But when the truth comes out, Edward may have a few surprises of his own for the new Mrs. Rokesby.</description>

  <description>There are three things you need to know about Ashley Winston: 1) She has six brothers and they all have beards, 2) She is a reader, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former beauty queen, Ashley Winston’s preferred coping strategy is escapism. She escaped her Tennessee small town, loathsome father, and six brothers eight years ago. Now she escapes life daily via her Amazon kindle one-click addiction. However, when a family tragedy forces her to return home, Ashley can’t escape the notice of Drew Runous— local Game Warden, reclusive mountain man, bear wrestler, philosopher, and everyone’s favorite guy. Drew’s irksome philosophizing in particular makes Ashley want to run for the skyscrapers, especially since he can’t seem to keep his exasperating opinions— or his soulful poetry, steadfast support, and delightful hands— to himself. Pretty soon the girl who wanted nothing more than the escape of the big city finds she’s lost her heart in small town Tennessee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a full-length novel, can be read as a standalone, and is the fourth book in the 'Knitting in the City' series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It was a stab in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a chilly February night, during a screening of &lt;i&gt;Psycho&lt;/i&gt; in midtown, someone sunk an ice pick into the back of Chanel Rylan’s neck, then disappeared quietly into the crowds of drunks and tourists in Times Square. To Chanel’s best friend, who had just slipped out of the theater for a moment to take a call, it felt as unreal as the ancient black-and-white movie up on the screen. But Chanel’s blood ran red, and her death was anything but fictional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, as Eve Dallas puzzles over a homicide that seems carefully planned and yet oddly personal, she receives a tip from an unexpected source: an author of police thrillers who recognizes the crime—from the pages of her own book. Dallas doesn’t think it’s coincidence, since a recent strangulation of a sex worker resembles a scene from her writing as well. Cops look for patterns of behavior: similar weapons, similar MOs. But this killer seems to find inspiration in someone else’s imagination, and if the theory holds, this may be only the second of a long-running series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that Eve and her billionaire husband Roarke have an excuse to curl up in front of the fireplace with their cat, Galahad, reading mystery stories for research. The bad news is that time is running out before the next victim plays an unwitting role in a murderer’s deranged private drama—and only Eve can put a stop to a creative impulse gone horribly, destructively wrong.</description>

  <description>The chic Manhattan nightspot Du Vin is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it’s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that’s exactly what happens one cold February evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described “social information reporter,” or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she’d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone’s done the same to her, literally—with a knife to the brachial artery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve didn’t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she’ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This chilling new suspense novel from #1 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;New York Times&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestselling author J.D. Robb is the perfect entry point into the compelling In Death police procedural series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As NY Lt. Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband Roarke are driving home, a young woman—dazed, naked, and bloody—suddenly stumbles out in front of their car. Roarke slams on the brakes and Eve springs into action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daphne Strazza is rushed to the ER, but it’s too late for her husband Dr. Anthony Strazza. A brilliant orthopedic surgeon, he now lies dead amid the wreckage of his obsessively organized town house, his three safes opened and emptied. Daphne would be a valuable witness, but in her terror and shock the only description of the perp she can offer is repeatedly calling him “the devil”...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it emerges that Dr. Strazza was cold, controlling, and widely disliked, this is one case where the evidence doesn’t point to the spouse. So Eve and her team must get started on the legwork, interviewing everyone from dinner-party guests to professional colleagues to caterers, in a desperate race to answer some crucial questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does the devil look like? And where will he show up next?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47171748-love-hacked" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00IS98B24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Sandra Fielding: 1) She makes all her first dates cry, 2) She hasn't been kissed in over two years, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sandra has difficulty removing her psychotherapist hat. Of her last 30 dates, 29 have ended the same way: the man sobbing uncontrollably. After one such disaster, Sandra--near desperation and maybe a little tipsy--gives in to a seemingly harmless encounter with her hot waiter, Alex. Argumentative, secretive, and hostile Alex may be the opposite of everything Sandra knows is right for her. But now, the girl who has spent all her life helping others change for the better, must find a way to cope with falling for someone who refuses to change at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length, 110k word novel and is the third book in the Knitting in the City series. All books in the series can be read as a standalone.</description>

But when Elizabeth’s plans for benefits without friendship are disarmed by the irritatingly charismatic and chauvinistic Nico Manganiello- her former nemesis- she finds herself struggling to maintain the electric fence around her heart while avoiding electrocution or, worse, falling in love.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Susan Mallery returns to Blackberry Island with the poignant tale of two sisters on the verge of claiming their dreams. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small-town nurse Nina Wentworth has made a career out of being a caretaker. More "Mom" than their mother ever was, she sacrificed medical school—and her first love—so her sister could break free. Which is why she isn't exactly thrilled to see Averil back on Blackberry Island, especially when Nina's life has suddenly become…complicated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina unexpectedly finds herself juggling two men—her high school sweetheart and a younger maverick pilot who also wants to claim her heart. But as fun as all this romance is, Nina has real life to deal with. Averil doesn't seem to want the great guy she's married to, and doesn't seem to be making headway writing her first book; their mom is living life just as recklessly as she always has; and Nina's starting to realize that the control she once had is slipping out of her fingers. Her hopes of getting off the island seem to be stretching further away…until her mother makes a discovery that could change everything forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before Nina and Averil can reach for the stars, they have to decide what they want. Will Averil stay? Will Nina leave? And what about the men who claim to love them? Does love heal, or will finding their happy ending mean giving up all they've ever wanted?</description>

  <description>Bryn McKenna has it all, including her smoking-hot knight turned live-in boyfriend, Valmont. Even though she’s a hybrid dragon, she’s finally fitting into the new shape-shifting dragon world that’s become her own. But her grandparents want to ruin everything by making Bryn’s nightmare of an arranged marriage to Jaxon Westgate a reality. It doesn’t help that Jaxon’s father is on a witch hunt for Rebel sympathizers and Bryn finds herself in his line of fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she doesn’t say, “ I do,” she’ll lose everything. Good-bye flying. Good-bye best friends. Good-bye magic. But if she bends to her grandparents’ will and agrees to marry Jaxon, she’ll lose the love of her life—her knight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Going Down in Flames series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book #1 - Going Down in Flames&lt;br /&gt;Book #2 - Bridges Burned&lt;br /&gt;Book #3 - Trial by Fire&lt;br /&gt;Book #4 - Fanning the Flames&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>When eighteen-year-old Chloe Emery returns to her West London home she finds her mother missing, the house covered in blood. Everything points to murder, except for one thing: there’s no sign of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London detective Maeve Kerrigan and the homicide team turn their attention to the neighbours. The ultra-religious Norrises are acting suspiciously; their teenage daughter and Chloe Emery definitely have something to hide. Then there’s William Turner, once accused of stabbing a schoolmate and the neighborhood’s favorite criminal. Is he merely a scapegoat, or is there more behind the charismatic façade?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body fails to materialize, Maeve must piece together a patchwork of testimonies and accusations. Who is lying, and who is not? And soon Maeve starts to realize that not only will the answer lead to Kate Emery, but more lives may hang in the balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Let the Dead Speak&lt;/i&gt;, Jane Casey returns with another taut, richly drawn novel that will grip readers from the opening pages to the stunning conclusion.</description>

  <description>The funny, enthralling and heartwarming story of a woman who gets a second chance in life - but will she have the courage to take it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly has moved from London to rural Herefordshire chasing the Good Life. Swapping the tube for the saddle, she is living the country dream. Apart from it isn't really her dream. It's her husband David's. And David is, well, rather dead now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a distant relative of her late husband kicks the bucket, leaving a London townhouse in her possession, and Molly dares to consider chucking it all in. Quitting the Good Life and going back to her good life. But there's a problem. A rather tall, handsome problem. In the shape of a man already living in Molly's new house. And when a face appears from her past, Molly is more confused than ever. Will Molly's London dream replace her muddy reality? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do any of the men in her life really have honourable intentions? And has she said goodbye to country life too soon?</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1999, Kit and Laura travel to a festival in Cornwall to see a total eclipse of the sun. Kit is an eclipse chaser; Laura has never seen one before. Young and in love, they are certain this will be the first of many they’ll share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the hushed moments after the shadow passes, Laura interrupts a man and a woman. She knows that she saw something terrible. The man denies it. It is her word against his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim seems grateful. Months later, she turns up on their doorstep like a lonely stray. But as her gratitude takes a twisted turn, Laura begins to wonder—did she trust the wrong person? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 years later, Kit and Laura are living under assumed names and completely off the digital grid: no Facebook, only rudimentary cell phones, not in any directories. But as the truth catches up to them, they realize they can no longer keep the past in the past.</description>

  <description>One cowboy. One cowgirl. One ranch.&lt;br /&gt;Who will win the Double Deuce by the Fourth of July?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adele O'Donnell knew that Double Deuce Ranch had to be hers the second she walked onto the property. Freshly divorced, she sees it as the perfect spot for her and the kids to start a new life. Remington Luckadeau was always a carefree playboy...until his suddenly orphaned nephews became his responsibility. The Double Deuce Ranch would be the perfect place to raise two boys. But some fiery woman is fighting him for it, and Remington is not sharing-no matter how the sparks fly when he and Adele are together.</description>

  <description>It took 32 seconds to end his career. But it only took 1 to change his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-two seconds. That’s how long it took for Delon Sanchez’s life to end. One minute he was the best bronc rider in the Panhandle and the next he was nothing. Knee shattered, future in question, all he can do is pull together the pieces…and wonder what cruel trick of Fate has thrown him into the path of his ex, the oh-so-perfect Tori Patterson.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tori’s come home after her husband’s death, intent on escaping the public eye. It’s just her luck that Delon limps into her physical therapy office, desperate for her help. All hard-packed muscle and dark-eyed temptation, he’s never been anything but a bad idea. And yet, seeing him again, Tori can’t remember what made her choose foolish pride over love…or why, with this second, final chance to right old wrongs, the smart thing would be to run from this gorgeous rodeo boy as fast as her boots can take her.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;War hurtles in, a typhoon over the sea.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Bree’s life was torn apart, Nereidium had represented a haven to her. A place that—if she could save it—was beyond the King’s reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, at last, she’s arrived upon its shores. But things in Nereidium are not what they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The land is plagued by a rash of mysterious earthquakes, the likes of which it’s never known. The governors are distracted by old traditions, while Bree and her friends grapple with changing identities and the sense that the longer they wait to take action… the greater the danger from Egria grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bree is tired of living under the shadow of King Langdon’s power. And she’s tired of waiting for him to be the first to act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this final chapter of the Threats of Sky and Sea series, it all comes down to Nereidium or Egria. To Bree or the King. It’s kill… or be killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not everyone will escape the battle unscathed.</description>

  <description>Wall Street meets the Sons of Anarchy in &lt;i&gt;Hard Rules, &lt;/i&gt;the smoldering, scorching first novel in the explosively sexy new Dirty Money series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lisa Renee Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How bad do you want it? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only man within the Brandon empire with a moral compass, Shane Brandon is ready to take his family’s business dealings legitimate. His reckless and ruthless brother, Derek wants to keep Brandon Enterprises cemented in lies, deceit, and corruption. But the harder Shane fights to pull the company back into the light, the darker he has to become. Then he meets Emily Stevens, a woman who not only stirs a voracious sexual need in him, but becomes the only thing anchoring him between good and evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily is consumed by Shane, pushed sexually in ways she never dreamed of, falling deeper into the all-encompassing passion that is this man. She trusts him. He trusts her, but therein lies the danger. Emily has a secret, the very thing that brought her to him in the first place, and that secret could destroy them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is book ONE of FOUR in Shane and Emily's story.</description>

  <description>Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back in the twelfth installment of Darynda Jones’ New York Times bestselling paranormal series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Reyes escaped from a hell dimension in which Charley accidently trapped him, the son of Satan has been brimstone-bent on destroying the world his heavenly Brother created. His volatile tendencies have put Charley in a bit of a pickle. But that’s not the only briny vegetable on her plate. While trying to domesticate the feral being that used to be her husband, she also has to deal with her everyday life of annoying all manner of beings—some corporeal, some not so much—as she struggles to right the wrongs of society. Only this time she’s not uncovering a murder. This time she’s covering one up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that her new occupation of keeping a startup PI venture—the indomitable mystery-solving team of Amber Kowalski and Quentin Rutherford—out of trouble and dealing with the Vatican’s inquiries into her beloved daughter, and Charley is on the brink of throwing in the towel and becoming a professional shopper. Or possibly a live mannequin. But when someone starts attacking humans who are sensitive to the supernatural world, Charley knows it’s time to let loose her razor sharp claws. Then again, her number one suspect is the dark entity she’s loved for centuries. So the question becomes, can she tame the unruly beast before it destroys everything she’s worked so hard to protect?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Book 1 of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series, perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Red Queen&lt;/i&gt;. An "enchanting and fast-paced debut" that "lights up the page with magic, romance, and action."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ruby is a Fireblood who has concealed her powers of heat and flame from the cruel Frostblood ruling class her entire life. But when her mother is killed trying to protect her, and rebel Frostbloods demand her help to overthrow their bloodthirsty king, she agrees to come out of hiding, desperate to have her revenge.&lt;br /&gt;Despite her unpredictable abilities, Ruby trains with the rebels and the infuriating--yet irresistible--Arcus, who seems to think of her as nothing more than a weapon. But before they can take action, Ruby is captured and forced to compete in the king's tournaments that pit Fireblood prisoners against Frostblood champions. Now she has only one chance to destroy the maniacal ruler who has taken everything from her--and from the icy young man she has come to love.&lt;br /&gt;Vivid and compelling, &lt;i&gt;Frostblood &lt;/i&gt;is the first in an exhilarating series, followed by &lt;i&gt;Fireblood&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nightblood&lt;/i&gt;, about a world where flame and ice are mortal enemies...but together create a power that could change everything.</description>

  <description>Lady Murine Carmichael has known her share of bad luck. But when her debt-ridden half-brother tries to sell her off in exchange for a few Scottish horses, it’s the final straw. If keeping her freedom means escaping through harsh countryside alone, so be it. She has barely begun her journey when she lands an unlikely escort—the brawny Highlander who just refused to buy her virtue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dougall Buchanan was disgusted by Lord Danvries’ shameful offer, but Murine herself tempts him beyond measure. Even bedraggled and dusty, the lass glows with beauty and bravery. Dougall wants to do more than just help her flee. He wants to protect her—with his life and his heart—if she’ll only let him. For Murine may be pursued by a powerful foe, but nothing compares to the fiery courage of a Highlander in love.</description>

  <description>Lady Laura Rosing knows two things: first, she will marry for love, and second, she detests rakes. When she meets Lord Gavin Farris, she understands immediately that he fails both her criteria, and worse yet, he is an absolute cad who refuses to leave her be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord Farris has always appreciated women and cannot understand why Lady Laura is so resistant to his charms. While pretty, she is not his usual type, but something about her intrigues him. Much to his chagrin, he finds himself desperately in love with her, but he may be too late. His adamant refusal to marry just might have planted her firmly in the arms of another.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Laura Griffin “delivers the goods” (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) again with the eleventh title in the gritty, heart-pounding Tracers series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a lakeside tryst ends in a double murder, police detective Daniele Harper arrives on the scene determined to get answers. Clues are everywhere, but nothing adds up. Dani turns to the Delphi Center crime lab for help, but soon regrets it when her secret attraction to their chief firearms examiner threatens to distract her from the most important case of her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a ballistics expert and former Navy SEAL, Scott Black knows firearms, and he knows he can help Dani unravel her case. Scott has managed to hide his interest in his best friend’s younger sister for years, but when her investigation brings them together, the sparks between them quickly get out of control. Scott resolves to keep his hands off Dani and his eyes on the goal—identifying a killer. But when that killer zeroes in on Dani, all bets are off. There isn’t a line Scott won’t cross to convince Dani to trust him so that he can help her take down a ruthless murderer who has her in his sights.</description>

  <description>The monster showed up after midnight. As they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it isn’t the monster Conor’s been expecting. He’s been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he’s had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments, the one with the darkness and the wind and the screaming...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This monster, though, is something different. Something ancient, something wild. And it wants the most dangerous thing of all from Conor. It wants the truth.</description>

  <description>A typical day in the life of Charley Davidson involves cheating husbands, missing people, errant wives, philandering business owners, and oh yeah...demons, hell hounds, evil gods, and dead people. Lots and lots of dead people. As a part time Private Investigator and full-time Grim Reaper, Charley has to balance the good, the bad, the undead, and those who want her dead. In this eleventh installment, Charley is learning to make peace with the fact that she is a goddess with all kinds of power and that her own daughter has been born to save the world from total destruction. But the forces of hell are determined to see Charley banished forever to the darkest corners of another dimension. With the son of Satan himself as her husband and world-rocking lover, maybe Charley can find a way to have her happily ever after after all.</description>

  <description>Take one sexy quarterback,&lt;br /&gt;Mix in one adventurous princess,&lt;br /&gt;Add some serious sexual tension,&lt;br /&gt;And you get the royal romance of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle Young—all-star quarterback and lady-killer—thought he knew what he wanted out of life: freedom, football and fun. Then he meets Bella. She seems like the perfect woman: gorgeous, funny, and a huge football fan. But what he doesn’t know? Bella also happens to be Princess Arabella of Salasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yearning for adventure and romance before she devotes herself to her country and marries a man she doesn’t love, Arabella can’t believe her luck when she meets Kyle. Sparks fly between the football player and the princess, and they begin an affair neither of them could’ve imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, however, duty and self-doubt cause Kyle and Arabella to separate. Can he become the prince she needs? And can Arabella overcome her family’s disapproval? Or will their love transform back into a pumpkin at midnight, leaving them both without a happily ever after?</description>

  <description>When Joya Bennett wakes up after her brother’s wedding, half-naked and lying next to her lifelong crush, she’s mortified. OMG, did she try to jump his bones? Worse, did she succeed? Intending to lay low and housesit for her brother until the embarrassment fades, she sneaks away before he wakes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she didn’t plan on is having company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Fisher doesn’t do relationships, but if he did, his friend’s little sister would be the one to tie him down. Good thing Joya had one too many drinks during the reception or he’d have crossed a line. Her brother would kill him if he found out all the places Linc wanted to kiss the sexy, auburn-haired beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now they’re stuck in the same house. For two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s off-limits. And he needs to keep it that way, even if the heat building between them is hot enough to blow off the roof…</description>

  <description>Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic.</description>

  <description>Thrilled that their playwright friend's Broadway debut was a rousing success, Nic and Nigel are trying to enjoy the A-list after-party with their pal Harper. Unfortunately, all the champagne and repartee in the world aren't enough to overlook the churlish behavior of Harper's theater-critic husband, Dan. Nic is shocked the next morning when she learns that Dan' been murdered. Nigel thinks the world may be a better place without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Harper is their friend and they're intent on helping her any way they can. Invigorated by the thrill of the hunt and fortified by a flood of cocktails, catching the killer becomes the Martinis' top priority...with their behemoth Bullmastiff Skippy along for the ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes cocktail recipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's impossible to resist Kiely's charming trio of husband, wife, and dog. The manner is effervescent and amusing, and the mystery surprisingly good."--&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In another amusing take-off on the Thin Man series, &lt;em&gt;A Perfect Manhattan Murder&lt;/em&gt; features Nic and her husband, Nigel Martini, as witty, drink-loving amateur sleuths in a Broadway murder mystery sure to leave you shaken (with laughter), if not stirred."--&lt;em&gt;Mystery Scene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A smart, sassy, sophisticated mystery with snappy dialogue and a fast-moving plot."--Suspense Magazine</description>

  <description>If you don’t know Gin “the Spider” Blanco, you don’t know dangerous female heroines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irony 101—The Spider herself snared in someone else’s web…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Another week, another few clues trickling in about the Circle, the mysterious group that supposedly runs the city’s underworld. Gathering intel on my hidden enemies is a painstaking process, but a more immediate mystery has popped up on my radar: a missing girl.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; My search for the girl begins on the mean streets of Ashland, but with all the killers and crooks in this city, I’m not holding out much hope that she’s still alive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A series of clues leads me down an increasingly dark, dangerous path, and I realize that the missing girl is really just the first thread in this web of evil. As an assassin, I’m used to facing down the worst of the worst, but nothing prepares me for this new, terrifying enemy—one who strikes from the shadows and is determined to make me the next victim.</description>

  <description>A typical day in the life of Charley Davidson involves cheating husbands, missing people, errant wives, philandering business owners, and oh yeah...demons, hell hounds, evil gods, and dead people. Lots and lots of dead people. As a part time Private Investigator and full-time Grim Reaper, Charley has to balance the good, the bad, the undead, and those who want her dead. In this eleventh installment, Charley is learning to make peace with the fact that she is a goddess with all kinds of power and that her own daughter has been born to save the world from total destruction. But the forces of hell are determined to see Charley banished forever to the darkest corners of another dimension. With the son of Satan himself as her husband and world-rocking lover, maybe Charley can find a way to have her happily ever after after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Ainsley O’Leary is so ready to get married—she’s even found the engagement ring her boyfriend has stashed away. What she doesn’t anticipate is being blindsided by a breakup he chronicles in a blog…which (of course) goes viral. Devastated and humiliated, Ainsley turns to her older half sister, Kate, who’s struggling with a sudden loss of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate’s always been the poised, self-assured sister, but becoming a newlywed—and a widow—in the space of four months overwhelms her. Though the sisters were never close, she starts to confide in Ainsley, especially when she learns her late husband was keeping a secret from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the murky blended-family dynamic that’s always separated them, Ainsley's and Kate’s heartaches bind their summer together when they come to terms with the inevitable imperfection of relationships and family—and the possibility of one day finding love again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There’s no such thing as a little in love…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle Wheaten’s priorities: friends, career, and kick-ass shoes. Then there’s the muscular wall of stubbornness that’s security expert Archer Hunt—who comes before everything else. No point in telling Mr. “Feels-Free Zone” that, though. Elle will just see other men until she gets over Archer . . . which should only take a lifetime . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There’s no such thing as a little in lust…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archer’s wanted the best for Elle ever since he sacrificed his law-enforcement career to save her. But now that she’s earned happiness and success, Archer just wants Elle 24/7. Their chemistry could start the next San Francisco Earthquake, and Archer doesn’t want to be responsible for the damage. The alternative? Watch her go out with guys who aren’t him . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is such a thing as…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Archer’s concerned, nobody is good enough for Elle. But when he sets out to prove it by sabotaging her dates, she gets mad—and things get hot as hell. Now Archer has a new mission: prove to Elle that her perfect man has been here all along…</description>

  <description>There's no doubt about it, the Cure Hotel situated on the outskirts of Manhattan is one of the most run down establishments in the whole of America. This is a hotel that not only boasts dampness, poor decoration and lighting, but also welcomes the most sinister type of overnight guest. Shady loners, men with prostitutes, bosses and their assistants - It all takes place under this roof, where although fornicating in this manner is frowned upon in the hotel industry, a blind eye is always turned at the Cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is receptionist Christina's story, just seven days before the grand re-opening of the newly refurbished building – In the single week it took an innocent act of voyeurism to turn the place into the murderous hell hole it was always destined to become. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping thriller, with a horrifying twist, where the dark sexual past of this tarnished building, can't be fixed by the new owner, who simply hasn't got the Cure in his blood.</description>

  <description>Perfectly pressed. Perfectly proper. Perfectly deadly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paranormal museum owner Maddie Kosloski thinks she has the perfect paranormal exhibit for the harvest festival—a haunted grape press. But before she can open the exhibit, she’s accused of stealing the antique press. And when her accuser is found murdered, all eyes turn to Maddie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solving the crime is the last thing on Maddie’s mind, but her mother insists she investigate. Does her mother have a secret agenda? And why has the local charity, Ladies Aid, seemingly gone gangster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this light, cozy mystery, haunted houses, runaway wine barrels, and murder combine in a perfect storm of chaos. Facing down danger and her own over-active imagination, Maddie must unearth the killer before she becomes the next ghost to haunt her museum. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cinderella goes to the con in this fandom-fueled twist on the classic fairy tale.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part romance, part love letter to nerd culture, and all totally adorbs, Geekerella is a fairy tale for anyone who believes in the magic of fandom. Geek girl Elle Wittimer lives and breathes &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt;, the classic sci-fi series she grew up watching with her late father. So when she sees a cosplay contest for a new &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; movie, she has to enter. The prize? An invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball, and a meet-and-greet with the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. With savings from her gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck (and her dad’s old costume), Elle’s determined to win…unless her stepsisters get there first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Teen actor Darien Freeman used to live for cons—before he was famous. Now they’re nothing but autographs and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Carmindor is all he’s ever wanted, but the &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; fandom has written him off as just another dumb heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws near, Darien feels more and more like a fake—until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise.</description>

  <description>Tobias Walcott, the Earl of Blade, has learned it is best to exercise rigid control over his passions and emotions in all that he does. Uncaring that it makes him seem cool and aloof to most in the ton, he is content with his desire to only woo agreeable and demur females. Then unforeseen circumstances see him trapped in a closet at a house party with the last woman he would ever make his countess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Olivia Sherwood is everything he should not desire in a female—unconventional, too decisive, and utterly without decorum. But passion ignites between them and they are discovered. Honor demands they wed, and while Tobias finds himself unwillingly drawn to the bewitching beauty, he must do everything not to tempt the passion that burns in him for her, lest it leads to disastrous consequences.</description>

  <description>Things I'd love to say to Ryder Covington...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate you more than a hole in my favorite pair of leggings.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your smirk makes me want to yell in all shouty caps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You're really gorgeous...until you open your mouth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Stop looking at me like that. You're not ripping my panties off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying those things to him would be the whipped cream on top of my rocky road ice cream, but I can't, because he's my client. And I'm up for a promotion. Oh, and the little fact that my boss told me to give Mr. Covington everything he wants. But the only thing he wants is me. And he can't have that.</description>

  <description>HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO TO TRUST WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN TRUST YOURSELF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at my hands. One of them says FLORA BE BRAVE.&lt;br /&gt;Flora has anterograde amnesia. She can't remember anything day-to-day: the joke her friend made, the instructions her parents gave her, how old she is.&lt;br /&gt;Then she kisses someone she shouldn't, and the next day she remembers it. It's the first time she's remembered anything since she was ten. &lt;br /&gt;But the boy is gone. She thinks he's moved to the Arctic. &lt;br /&gt;Will following him be the key to unlocking her memory? Who can she trust?</description>

  <description>Jane Dixon is a dating disaster. Flammable tablecloths and broken arms are just a typical evening for her unlucky companions. No wonder Jane never gets past a first date. But luckily her co-worker and new bff says he’s got loads of friends who’d date her more than once. If only she could stop thinking about how much fun he was to hang out with. And she’d never dropped a bucket of ice on his junk. Win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All attorney Eric Blackwell has to do to make junior partner is not screw anything up for six weeks, which seems like a slam dunk until he finds himself matchmaker to the office “One Date Wonder” aka the boss’s daughter. It’s hard to stay focused when setting up the hottest girl he’s ever met with everyone but himself. Maybe he could just set her up with all the wrong men, and keep his hands off his new friend… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. His promotion is toast.</description>

  <description>After a raging fire consumes her town and kills her parents, Maggie Davis is on her own to protect her younger sister and survive the best she can in the Colorado town of Burning Mesa. In Maggie’s world, the bones of long-extinct magical creatures such as dragons and sirens are mined and traded for their residual magical elements, and harnessing these relics’ powers allows the user to wield fire, turn invisible, or heal even the worst of injuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in a local saloon, Maggie befriends the spirited showgirl Adelaide and falls for the roguish cowboy Landon. But when she proves to have a particular skill at harnessing the relics’ powers, Maggie is whisked away to the glamorous hacienda of Álvar Castilla, the wealthy young relic baron who runs Burning Mesa. Though his intentions aren’t always clear, Álvar trains Maggie in the world of relic magic. But when the mysterious fires reappear in their neighboring towns, Maggie must discover who is channeling relic magic for evil before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relic is a thrilling adventure set in a wholly unique world, and a spell-binding story of love, trust, and the power of good.</description>

  <description>Trina Clemons needed the money. Why else would she—the most organized, prepared student in school—spend the summer as a nanny and partner with the biggest slacker ever? Now she's ready to tackle nannyhood with her big binder of research and schedules. Just don't ask her about the secret job of “fixing” the bad habits of a certain high school player…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slade Edmunds prefers easy hook-ups, and Trina is definitely not his type. She's all structure and rules, while Slade wants to just have fun. Fortunately, Trina has no idea about the bet Slade made with his best friend that he can totally get her to unwind by the end of summer…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the weirdest thing happens. There's chemistry. A lot of it. &lt;br /&gt;But nothing gets between a boy and a girl like a big, fat secret…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There are exactly one hundred halls of magic to choose from. Ever since our parents were killed I knew exactly which hall was for me.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aurelia "Aurie" Silverthorne is one of the best and brightest to ever apply to the Hundred Halls, the only magical university in the world. To be accepted, she must pass grueling trials that claim the lives of aspirants every year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But more than her desire to practice magic is at stake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aurie's little sister has been courting powerful forces in hopes of protecting herself from the beings that killed their parents, but alliances come with complications. As things spiral out of control, and dangerous foes arise at every turn, Aurie knows the only way to protect her sister is to pass the trials—even if it means making a terrible sacrifice.</description>

  <description>On the precipice of her sixteenth birthday, the last thing lone wolf Cat Crawford wants is an extravagant gala thrown by her bubbly stepmother and well-meaning father. So even though Cat knows the family's trip to Florence, Italy, is a peace offering, she embraces the magical city and all it offers. But when her curiosity leads her to an unusual gypsy tent, she exits . . . right into Renaissance Firenze.Thrust into the sixteenth century armed with only a backpack full of contraband future items, Cat joins up with her ancestors, the sweet Alessandra and protective Cipriano, and soon falls for the gorgeous aspiring artist Lorenzo. But when the much-older Niccolo starts sniffing around, Cat realizes that an unwanted birthday party is nothing compared to an unwanted suitor full of creeptastic amore. Can she find her way back to modern times before her Italian adventure turns into an Italian forever?</description>

  <description>Photojournalist Siobhan Walsh has been searching for two sisters who disappeared two years ago in Mexico, so when she receives a call from a priest in Texas about an abandoned baby holding a locket with her name, she calls her friends in the FBI for help. The infant obviously belongs to one of the sisters, but how did she end up in Texas? And why did she abandon her newborn?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Kincaid and her mentor, Supervisory Special Agent Noah Armstrong, track the missing girls and uncover a human-trafficking organization that leads to a seedy underworld in which nothing is as it seems. The bad guys seem to stay two steps ahead of them, leaving behind a trail of dead bodies and Lucy with more questions than answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile Lucy’s fiance Sean Rogan has a crisis of his own. An old girlfriend returns with shocking news: not only does Sean have a son, but Jesse and his step-father have disappeared. The last thing Sean wants to do is leave Lucy when she’s investigating a horrific case, but his son is in grave danger. Torn between an impossible choice, he makes a decision that has far-reaching consequences for Sean, Lucy, and everything they hold dear.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us into a dangerous and exhilarating world where a deadly, beautiful archangel and his once-mortal consort are caught in a fury of twisted darkness…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most vicious archangels in the world has disappeared. No one knows if Lijuan is dead or has chosen to Sleep the long sleep of an immortal. But with her lands falling into chaos under a rising tide of vampiric bloodlust, a mysterious and ancient order of angels known as the Luminata calls the entire Cadre together to discuss the fate of her territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanying her archangelic lover Raphael to the Luminata compound, guild hunter-turned-angel Elena senses that all is not as it seems. Secrets echo from within the stone walls of the compound, and the deeper Elena goes, the uglier the darkness. But neither Raphael nor Elena is ready for the brutal truths hidden within—truths that will change everything Elena thinks she knows about who she is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever be the same again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is the Advance Reader Copy edition. The final published edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34092240-the-french-impressionist" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary is fifteen and gloriously free, on her own for the very first time. Part of an exchange program for aspiring artists, she arrives in sunny southern France with a single goal: she doesn’t plan to leave, ever. She wants a new life, a new family, and a new identity. But her situation, crafted from lies big and small, is precarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to escape haunting images from her past and a stage one helicopter parent, Rosemary struggles to hide her lack of artistic talent and a communication disorder that has tormented her all her life. She believes her dream of a new start will come true, until she unwittingly finds herself enveloped in a decades-old mystery that threatens to ruin her only chance for success. Determined to stay, Rosemary must choose whether or not she’ll tell the biggest lie of all, even if it means destroying the life of someone she cares about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic, heartwarming, and full of teenage angst, The French Impressionist perfectly captures the struggle of those who feel they have no voice, and also shows the courage it takes to speak up and show the world who we really are.</description>

  <description>Owen Burnett planned on a quiet, easygoing Christmas, hanging out with his best friend and neighbor, Gabby Michaelson. So when his mom pressures him to come home for the holidays, he tells a little white lie…that he’s spending the holidays with his new girlfriend. But when his family shows up unexpectedly, Owen pulls the best friend card and asks Gabby to play his fake girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabby’s been hopelessly in love with her best friend Owen for what feels like forever, but playing his "fake" girlfriend when the entire boisterous Burnett clan visits is easier said than done. The more she tries to deny the attraction between them, the more obvious their chemistry becomes. But even though she's not the only one feeling it, putting their friendship on the line is a risk she can’t take.</description>

  <description>After fleeing her beloved small town five years ago, Julia Bailey is back to spend Christmas with her family. Returning is hard, but keeping the devastating secret about her late husband is even harder. Her place isn't in Big Sky Country any longer...but the more time she spends with the irresistible Sheriff who saved her once before, and his adorable little daughter, the more Julia starts wishing she could let go of the past and start a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single dad and county Sheriff Chase Donovan had been secretly in love with his best friend's wife for years. But after her traumatic loss he knew Julia needed to get away from Shadow Creek, even though helping her leave was the last thing he wanted to do. Now she's home and he doesn't intend to lose her a second time. Chase is going to prove to Julia just how good they can be together this Christmas...and forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Wedding Planner&lt;/i&gt; in The Wedding Belles, a contemporary and witty romance series about three high-powered New York City women who can plan any wedding—but their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexis Morgan has spent the past six years devoted to turning her tiny start-up into Manhattan’s premiere wedding planning company, The Wedding Belles. Now that her business is thriving, it’s time to turn towards her much neglected personal life, and Alexis approaches her relationships like she does everything else: with a plan. &lt;i&gt;Not&lt;/i&gt; a part of that plan is Logan Harris, the silent partner in the Belles, and the one person who’s been there for her since the very beginning. But Alexis needs someone fun, and Logan’s all business, all the time—except when a late night at the office ends with an unexpected kiss that leaves the usually cool and together Alexis reeling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Logan has lusted after Alexis since the day he walked into the tiny Harlem apartment that used to double as her office. But the ambitious wedding planner has always been untouchable...until now. Alexis has made it clear that she’s on the dating market—and equally clear that he’s not in the running. But when Alexis finds herself in need of a date for her sister’s last minute wedding in Florida, Logan knows it’s the perfect time to show Alexis that there’s more to him than numbers and spreadsheets—and beneath the pinstripes and glasses lies a hot-blooded heartthrob. As Florida’s sultry days turn into even hotter nights, Logan’s out to convince Alexis that the fling of a lifetime could just maybe turn into forever...</description>

  <description>Welcome To Bliss, the Bridal Capital of the Midwest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's an out-of-place single mother...&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Castellano didn't have the wedded bliss experience typical of her hometown, but that won't stop her from ensuring this year's bridal festival goes off without a hitch. Even if it means she has to play nice with the man who broke her fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a thrill-seeking widower...&lt;br /&gt;World adventurer and reluctant local hero CJ Blue doesn't want to be in Bliss anymore than Natalie wants him here. But family obligations have brought him back, and now, Natalie is using every trick she has to rope him into helping save a tradition he'd rather forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And their fun is just starting...&lt;br /&gt;Despite their rocky past, these two wounded souls have more in common than they expect. They've both loved and lost, they've both tried to move on, and now they've both locked up their hearts. But by joining forces for the sake of Bliss, they might find the courage to risk love one more time.</description>

  <description>No amount of training could’ve prepared him for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Army Ranger Stone Mitchum doesn’t have time for relationships, let alone a one-night stand. He’s too busy running a ranch that helps transition veterans back into society. But when his curvy new tenant falls into his arms, his libido snaps to attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jovy Larson has four weeks to prove she’s worthy of taking over the family business. She’s up for whatever ridiculous task they throw at her, but selling vegan food to a bunch of cowboys in cattle country, Texas? Not half as tough as fighting her attraction to her sexy, surly landlord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good thing she’s stubborn. Then again, so is he…</description>

  <description>Do you believe in Father Christmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Melissa, Christmas has always been overrated. From her cold, distant parents to her manipulative ex-husband, Lawrence, she’s never experienced the warmth and contentment of the festive season with a big, happy family sitting around the table.&lt;br /&gt;And Melissa has learned to live with it, but it breaks her heart that her seven-year-old son, William, has had to live with it too. Whilst most little boys wait with excitement for the big day, William finds it difficult to believe that Father Christmas even exists.&lt;br /&gt;But then Daniel McCormick comes into their lives. And with his help, Melissa and William might just be able to find their festive spirit, and finally have a Christmas where all of their wishes come true …</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The eight story, nineteen years later …&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/i&gt; is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on July 30, 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.</description>

  <description>Richard, Marquess of Devon is satisfied with his ton marriage. His wife of five months, Lady Eugenia Devon, thought she was, too, until she found the book. Their marriage is one of respect and affection, with no messy entanglements such as love. Devon’s upbringing impressed upon him that gentlemen slake their baser needs on a mistress, not their gently bred wives. However, once married, he was no longer comfortable bedding a woman other Eugenia. When &lt;br /&gt;she stumbles onto a naughty book, she begins a campaign to change the rules. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Eugenia wants her very proper husband to fall in love with her. But her much changed and undeniably wicked behavior might inadvertently drive her confused husband to ponder the unthinkable—his perfect Lady has taken a lover. But the only man Eugenia only wants is her husband. The book can bring sizzling desire to the marriage or it might cause an explosion.</description>

  <description>An approved textbook at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry since publication, Newt Scamander's masterpiece has entertained wizarding families through the generations. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an indispensable introduction to the magical beasts of the Wizarding World. Scamander's years of travel and research have created a tome of unparalleled importance. Some of the beasts will be familiar to readers of the Harry Potter books - the Hippogriff, the Basilisk, the Hungarian Horntail ... Others will surprise even the most ardent amateur Magizoologist. This is an essential companion to the Harry Potter stories, and includes a new foreword from J.K. Rowling (writing as Newt Scamander) and six new beasts!</description>

  <description>Sixteen year-old Breena Perdit has spent her life as a barmaid, innocent to her father’s past and happily free from the Elemental gifts that would condemn her to a life in the Egrian King’s army. Until the day that three Elemental soldiers recognize her father as a traitor to the throne and Bree’s father is thrown in jail—along with the secrets from his last mission as the King’s assassin. Secrets that could help the King win a war. Secrets he refuses to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to escape before the King’s capricious whims prove her and her father’s downfall, Bree bargains with him: information for their lives. It’s a good trade. And she has faith she’ll get them both out of the King’s grasp with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was before the discovery that she’s the weapon the King’s been waiting for in his war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, time is running out. To save her father’s life and understand her own, Bree must unravel the knot of her father’s past before the King takes his life– and uses her to bring a nation to its knees.</description>

  <description>A princess, a pea, and a tower of mattresses. This is the sliver that survives of a story more nightmare than fairytale... Maggie Rhodes, high school junior and semi-reformed stalker, learns the tale's true roots after a spying attempt goes awry and her best friend Kate ends up as the victim of an ancient curse. At the center of the curse lies an enchanted emerald that has been residing quietly in a museum for the past fifty years. Admirers of the gem have no idea that it feeds on life. Or that it's found its next victim in Kate. Enter Lindy, a school acquaintance who knows more than she's letting on, and Garon, a handsome stranger claiming he knows how to help, and Maggie is left wondering who to trust and how to save her best friend before it's too late. If only Maggie knew her connection to the fairy tale was rooted far deeper than an endangered best friend.</description>

      <![CDATA[Man oh man did I find this book exceedingly difficult to read! It's a paranormal twist to an old classic <i>"Princess &amp; The Pea"</i> which to me sounds like a bloody good read <i>{pardon the language}</i>. I couldn't wait to read this free ARC from Netgalley. The cover is quite beautiful<i> {I'm a sucker for covers!}</i><br /><br />Its downfall.....beautiful</i></i></i>]]>

  <description>Everyone loves hockey superstar Pierce Miller. Everyone except Lia Bailey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the two are forced to teach a skating class to save the rink, Lia’s not sure she’ll survive the pressure of Nationals and Pierce’s ego. Not only can’t he remember her name, he signed her bottle of water like she was one of his groupies. Ugh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if there’s one thing Lia knows better than figure skating, it’s hockey. Hoping to take his ego down a notch—or seven—she logs into his team website under an anonymous name to give him pointers on his less-than-stellar playing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, Pierce isn’t arrogant at all. And they have a lot in common. Too bad he’s falling for the anonymous girl online. No matter how much fun they’re starting to have in real life, she’s afraid he’s going to choose fake-Lia over the real one…</description>

  &lt;i&gt;'Frost-demons have no interest in mortal girls wed to mortal men. In the stories, they only come for the wild maiden.'&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a village at the edge of the wilderness of northern Russia, where the winds blow cold and the snow falls many months of the year, an elderly servant tells stories of sorcery, folklore and the Winter King to the children of the family, tales of old magic frowned upon by the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the young, wild Vasya these are far more than just stories. She alone can see the house spirits that guard her home, and sense the growing forces of dark magic in the woods...</description>

Chosen to change her world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mari is an Earth Walker, heir to the unique healing powers of her Clan, but she has been forced to turn from her duties, until she is chosen by a special animal ally, altering her destiny forever. When a deadly attack tears her world apart, Mari reveals the strength of her powers and the forbidden secret of her dual nature as she embarks on a mission to save herself and her people. It is not until Nik, the son of the leader from a rival, dominating Tribe, strays across her path that Mari experiences something she has never felt before…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now evil is coming, and with it, a force more terrible and destructive than the world has ever seen, leaving Mari to cast the shadows from the earth. By breaking Clan Law and forming an alliance with Nik, she must make herself ready. Ready to save her people. Ready to save herself and Nik. Ready to embrace her true destiny…and battle the forces that threaten to destroy them all.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A holiday miracle to remember . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A matchbox advent calendar first brought Frank Rayner and Addie Hutton together. But that was years ago. Since then Addie has written herself out of her father’s will, gotten herself blacklisted as a reporter, and had her husband leave her for a younger woman. The only good decision she seems to have made is to move back home, even if Frank now owns that home and is renting the apartment over the garage to her. Not that she thinks there’s anything there. There’s no reason to get wrapped up in the holiday cheer. Because Christmas miracles are for the movies. Real life is about unexpected families—and the magic of true love—and could there be a happy ending after all?</description>

Only, when he finds himself on the street, as the family car pulls away, Claude realises he is ALONE. And more importantly, he is without all the yummy treats he knows the festive season brings…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cue the start of Claude’s Christmas Adventure. It all begins with a belly-flop through next door’s catflap, where he finds newly single and craft-a-holic Holly, Jack the ex-army postman, his arch nemesis Perdita the cat … and serious amounts of gingerbread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Drive’s cutest resident is about to bring the street together for Christmas, in ways no-one could have imagined …</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Someone knows where she is…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old Victorian pier was a thing of beauty until it was allowed to decay. It was where the youth of Oldcliffe-on-Sea would go to hang out. It’s also where twenty-one-year-old Sophie Collier disappeared eighteen years ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Francesca Howe, known as Frankie, was Sophie’s best friend, and even now she is haunted by the mystery of what happened to her. When Frankie gets a call from Sophie’s brother, Daniel, informing her that human remains have been found washed up nearby, she immediately wonders if it could be Sophie, and returns to her old hometown to try and find closure. Now an editor at a local newspaper, Daniel believes that Sophie was terrified of someone and that her death was the result of foul play rather than “death by misadventure,” as the police claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel arranges a holiday rental for Frankie that overlooks the pier where Sophie disappeared. In the middle of winter and out of season, Frankie feels isolated and unnerved, especially when she is out on the pier late one night and catches a glimpse of a woman who looks like Sophie. Is the pier really haunted, as they joked all those years ago? Could she really be seeing her friend’s ghost? And what actually happened to her best friend all those years ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowing, electrifying, and thoroughly compelling, &lt;em&gt;Local Girl Missing&lt;/em&gt; showcases once again bestselling author Claire Douglas’ extraordinary storytelling talent.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third book in the sexy Sinful Suitors Regency romance series, this heart-pounding storyshows why &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries is one of the most beloved historical romance writers today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To root out the card cheat responsible for her brother’s death, Miss Delia Trevor spends her evenings dancing her way through high society balls, and her late nights disguised as a young man gambling her way through London’s gaming hells. Then one night, handsome Warren Corry, the Marquess of Knightford, a notorious member of St. George’s Club, recognizes her. When he threatens to reveal her secret, she’s determined to keep him from ruining her plans, even if it means playing a cat-and-mouse game with the enigmatic rakehell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warren knows the danger of her game, and he refuses to watch her lose everything while gaining justice for her late brother. But when she starts to delve beneath his carefully crafted façade, can he keep her at arm’s length while still protecting her? Or will their hot desires explode into a love that transcends the secrets of their pasts?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;If she has her way ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa Davis is wrangling puppies when Keane Winters stalks into her pet shop with frustration in his chocolate-brown eyes and a pink bedazzled cat carrier in his hand. He needs a kitty sitter, stat. But the last thing Willa needs is to rescue a guy who doesn’t even &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; her ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’ll get nothing but coal in his stocking.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddled with his great-aunt’s Feline from Hell, Keane is desperate to leave her in someone else’s capable hands. But in spite of the fact that he’s sure he’s never seen the drop-dead-gorgeous pet shop owner before, she seems to be mad at him ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unless he tempers “naughty” with a special kind of nice ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willa can’t deny that Keane’s changed since high school: he’s less arrogant, for one thing—but can she trust him not to break her heart again? It’s time to throw a coin in the fountain, make a Christmas wish—and let the mistletoe do its work ...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lieutenant Eve Dallas returns in a fast-paced new novel from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J. D. Robb.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nature versus nurture...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The shots came quickly, silently, and with deadly accuracy. Within seconds, three people were dead at Central Park’s ice skating rink. The victims: a talented young skater, a doctor, and a teacher. As random as random can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve Dallas has seen a lot of killers during her time with the NYPSD, but never one like this. After reviewing security videos, it becomes clear that the victims were killed by a sniper firing a tactical laser rifle, who could have been miles away when the trigger was pulled. And though the locations where the shooter could have set up seem endless, the list of people with that particular skill set is finite: police, military, professional killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eve’s husband, Roarke, has unlimited resources—and genius—at his disposal. And when his computer program leads Eve to the location of the sniper, she learns a shocking fact: There were two—one older, one younger. Someone is being trained by an expert in the science of killing, and they have an agenda. Central Park was just a warm-up. And as another sniper attack shakes the city to its core, Eve realizes that though we’re all shaped by the people around us, there are those who are just born evil...</description>

  <description>Mercenary Kate Daniels knows all too well that magic in post-Shift Atlanta is a dangerous business. But nothing she’s faced could have prepared her for this…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate and the former Beast Lord Curran Lennart are finally making their relationship official. But there are some steep obstacles standing in the way of their walk to the altar…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kate’s father, Roland, has kidnapped the demigod Saiman and is slowly bleeding him dry in his never-ending bid for power. A Witch Oracle has predicted that if Kate marries the man she loves, Atlanta will burn and she will lose him forever. And the only person Kate can ask for help is long dead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The odds are impossible. The future is grim. But Kate Daniels has never been one to play by the rules…</description>

  <description>Natasha: I’m a girl who believes in science and facts. Not fate. Not destiny. Or dreams that will never come true. I’m definitely not the kind of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when my family is twelve hours away from being deported to Jamaica. Falling in love with him won’t be my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel: I’ve always been the good son, the good student, living up to my parents’ high expectations. Never the poet. Or the dreamer. But when I see her, I forget about all that. Something about Natasha makes me think that fate has something much more extraordinary in store—for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Universe: Every moment in our lives has brought us to this single moment. A million futures lie before us. Which one will come true?</description>

  <description>Does a girl ever really learn from her mistakes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Sergeant Megan Taylor thinks so. She once lost her heart to a man who was too charming and she isn’t about to make the same mistake again – especially not with sexy defence lawyer, Scott Armstrong. Aside from being far too sure of himself for his own good, Scott’s major flaw is that he defends the very people that she works so hard to imprison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Scott wants something he goes for it. And he wants Megan. One day she’ll see him not as a lawyer, but as a man ... and that’s when she’ll fall for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet just as Scott seems to be making inroads, a case presents itself that’s far too close to home, throwing his life into chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Megan helps him pick up the pieces, can he persuade her that he isn’t the careless charmer she thinks he is? Isn’t a man innocent until proven guilty?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Scholar. Slave. Warrior. Wizard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria was once a shy but ambitious scholar. That life ends when slavers sell her to a vicious tyrant who strips away everything she knows and loves, forging her into something darker. Deadlier. Escaping captivity, she finds refuge with the tyrant's enemies and joins their war against him. Now as Vic the Blade, she hunts for vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Ashel leads a carefree life, more renowned for his musical prowess than his royal blood. A murder leads him to swap his harp for a dagger, but his path of revenge leads straight into the tyrant's trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to rescue Ashel, Vic must first reckon with a mysterious race who holds the key to defeating her enemy. A legendary power may be her only chance to destroy him, if it doesn’t kill her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dark, fast paced, and richly imagined blend of sci-fi and fantasy handles mature topics well and captures the combination of empowerment, justice, and revenge in a fresh way. It’s a must-read for fans of powerful protagonists such as Rey from Star Wars, Arya from Game of Thrones, Lisbeth Slander from Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, and Celaena Sardothien from Thone of Glass. It’s highly intelligent, ruthless, and hopeful—perfect for lovers of the classic science fiction–fantasy blends of Anne McCaffrey and Frank Herbert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A blade sharp enough for vengeance requires a wizard's forge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Finalist, 2017 Next Generation Indie Book Awards&lt;br /&gt;Honorable Mention, 2017 Reader's Favorite Book Awards&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Lady Rose Thornton never expected to find a half-naked man in her garden. The handsome Irishman claims to be the Earl of Ashton, but was Iain Donovan truly robbed by thieves? Or is he merely an impoverished stranger lying to her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing everything in the potato famine, Iain is searching for a wife whose dowry will save his estate. The beautiful and charming Lady Rose, unable to walk because of an illness that stole her strength, agrees to help him find a wife, but only if he will help her learn to take her first steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their friendship takes root and blossoms into something more, secrets about Iain’s birthright threaten the growing feelings between them. He has no right to love a woman like Rose, who deserves a better life than he can give her. Rose believes that there is more to Iain than a broken past, and she brings light to his shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the walls of a secret garden, sometimes miracles happen…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s repairing a home or taking care of clients’ &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; needs, Twin Cities handyman Sam Haney is in demand from his mostly female clientele. Despite Sam’s lothario reputation, love isn’t part of his portfolio. He’s built a lot of walls in his time, but the one that’s surrounded his heart ever since the death of his parents is his most solid yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haley Cooper has had enough heartache for a lifetime. Her high school sweetheart up and moved to Indonesia—&lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;—just two weeks before their wedding. Her mother thinks it’s time for Haley to move on and contracts Sam to work on Haley’s wreck of a house—and anything else, if he’s got the notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparks fly and passion ignites. But Haley isn’t into Sam’s love-’em-and-leave-’em act. She wants something more. Fixing a house is one thing, but for this handyman, building a relationship will need a whole different set of skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A hilarious new romantic comedy for fans of Lindsey Kelk and Jane Costello from Anna Bell, the bestselling author of Don't Tell the Groom.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abi's barely left her bed since Joseph, the love of her life, dumped her, saying they were incompatible. When Joseph leaves a box of her possessions on her doorstep, she finds a bucket list of ten things she never knew he wanted to do. What better way to win him back than by completing the list, and proving they're a perfect match? But there's just one problem - or rather, ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abi's not exactly the outdoorsy type, and she's absolutely terrified of heights - not ideal for a list that includes climbing a mountain, cycling around the Isle of Wight and, last but not least, abseiling down the tallest building in town...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completing the list is going to need all Abi's courage - and a lot of help from her friends. But as she heals her broken heart one task at a time, the newly confident Abi might just have a surprise in store...</description>

  <description>Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat Bunce, and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and his family surrounded. What they don’t know is that they’re not dealing with just any fox–Mr. Fox would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.</description>

  <description>In seventeen year old Dakota Kekoa’s line of work, a job can go bad in a split second. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when a job goes bad, people die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspended from working as a tax collector in her draconic family’s protection racket, Dakota is assigned a secret mission from her grandfather. A foreign queen has offered a grave insult to Dakota’s grandfather by running a vampire dinner cruise off the coast of the Mabiian Islands, and his retribution must be swift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, when Dakota infiltrates the ship ‘Crimson Sunset’, nothing is at it seems. In a split second, not only is Dakota in deathly peril, all of New Anglo is on the road to war.</description>
