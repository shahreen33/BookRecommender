  <description>&lt;b&gt;“With his trademark clarity, Covey emphasizes the importance of integrity and intrinsic rewards. &lt;i&gt;Primary Greatness&lt;/i&gt; is an ideal book for anyone looking for guidance in how to live a truly successful, worthwhile life of service.”—Daniel H. Pink, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For fans of&lt;i&gt; Principles&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Grit&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Primary Greatness&lt;/i&gt; outlines the twelve levers of success—a set of principles for achieving a happy and fulfilling life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of us are hurting. We have chronic problems, dissatisfactions, and disappointments. We feel overwhelmed by burdens we carry. The idea of living a “great life” can seem like a distant dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen R. Covey—the late, legendary author of &lt;i&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/i&gt;—believed there were only two ways to experience life: primary greatness or secondary greatness. Through his books and speaking, he taught that the intrinsic rewards of primary greatness—integrity, responsibility, and contribution—far outweighed the extrinsic rewards of secondary greatness: money, popularity, and the self-absorbed, pleasure-ridden life that some people consider “success.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this posthumous work, Covey lays out clearly the 12 levers of success that will lead to a life of primary greatness: Integrity, Contribution, Priority, Sacrifice, Service, Responsibility, Loyalty, Reciprocity, Diversity, Learning, Teaching, and Renewal. For the first time, Covey defines each of these 12 qualities and how they can be leveraged in your daily life to lead you to both professional success and personal happiness. Featuring his trademarked wisdom that has inspired countless readers and leaders, &lt;i&gt;Primary Greatness&lt;/i&gt; once again delivers classic Covey advice in a concise and reader-friendly way.</description>

  <description>The story of globalization, the most powerful force in history, as told through the life and times of ten people who changed the world by their singular, spectacular accomplishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first book to look at the history of globalization through the lens of individuals who did something transformative, as opposed to describing globalization through trends, policies, or particular industries. From &lt;em&gt;Silk to Silicon&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of who these men and women were, what they did, how they did it and how their achievements continue to shape our world today. They include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Genghis Khan, who united east and west by conquest and by opening new trade routes built on groundbreaking transportation, communications, and management innovations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who arose from an oppressive Jewish ghetto to establish the most powerful bank the world has seen, and ushered in an era of global finance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Cyrus Field, who became the father of global communications by leading the effort to build the transatlantic telegraph, the forerunner to global radio, TV, and the worldwide Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Margaret Thatcher, whose controversial policies opened the gusher of substantially free markets that linked economies across borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Andy Grove, a Hungarian refugee from the Nazis who built the company—Intel—that figured out how to manufacture complex computer chips on a mass, commercial scale and laid the foundation for Silicon Valley’s computer revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through these stories Jeffrey E. Garten finds the common links between these figure and probes critical questions including: How much influence can any one person have in fundamentally changing the world? And how have past trends in globalization affected the present and how will they shape the future? &lt;em&gt;From Silk to Silicon&lt;/em&gt; is an essential book to understanding the past—and the future—of the most powerful force of our times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You are not a Visionary... yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Lean Entrepreneur&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;shows you how to become one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Most of us believe entrepreneurial visionaries are born, not made. Our media glorify business outliers like Bezos, Branson, Gates, and Jobs as heroes with X-ray vision who can look to the future, see clearly what will be, imagine a fully formed product or experience and then, simply make the vision real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many in our entrepreneur community still believe that to be visionary, we must merely execute on a seemingly good idea and ignore all doubt. With this mindset, companies build doomed products in a vacuum; enterprises make ill-fated innovation investment decisions; and employees and shareholders come along for an uncomfortable ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Falling prey to the Myth of the Visionary confuses talented entrepreneurs, product managers, innovators and investors. It leads us to heartbreaking, costly and &lt;i&gt;preventable&lt;/i&gt; failures in new product and venture development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Lean Entrepreneur&lt;/i&gt; moves us beyond this myth. It combines powerful customer insight, rapid experimentation and easily actionable data from the Lean Startup methodology to empower individuals, companies, and entire teams to evolve their vision, solve problems, and create value at the speed of the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anyone can be visionary.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Lean Entrepreneur&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply actionable tips, tricks and hacks from successful lean entrepreneurs. Leverage the Innovation Spectrum to disrupt existing markets and create new ones. Drive strategies for efficient market testing with Minimal Viable Products. Engage customers with Viability Testing and radically reduce time and budget for product development. Rapidly create cross-functional innovation teams that devour roadblocks and set new benchmarks. Bring your organization critical focus on the power of loyal customers and valuable products you can build to serve them. Leverage instructive tools, skill-building exercises, and worksheets along with bonus online videos.</description>

  <description>In 480 BC, a huge Persian&lt;br /&gt;army, led by the inimitable King Xerxes, entered the mountain pass of Thermopylae&lt;br /&gt;as it marched on Greece, intending to conquer the land with little difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;But the Greeks—led by King Leonidas and a small army of Spartans—took the&lt;br /&gt;battle to the Persians at Thermopylae, and halted their advance—almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one&lt;br /&gt;of history’s most acclaimed battles, one of civilization’s greatest last&lt;br /&gt;stands. And in Thermopylae, renowned classical historian Paul Cartledge looks&lt;br /&gt;anew this history-altering moment and, most impressively, shows how its&lt;br /&gt;repercussions have bearing on us even today. The invasion of Europe by Xerxes&lt;br /&gt;and his army redefined culture, kingdom, and class. The valiant efforts of a&lt;br /&gt;few thousand Greek warriors, facing a huge onrushing Persian army at the narrow&lt;br /&gt;pass at Thermopylae, changed the way generations to come would think about&lt;br /&gt;combat, courage, and death.</description>

  <description>Are you a high potential charting your course within your current organization, a leader trying to jumpstart innovative thinking in your company? Or are you ready to do something new?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider this simple yet powerful idea: disruptive companies and ideas upend markets by doing something truly different – they see a need, an empty space waiting to be filled, and they dare to create something for which a market may not yet exist. An expert in driving innovation via personal disruption, Whitney Johnson, will help you understand how the frameworks of disruptive innovation can apply to you: if you want to be successful in unexpected ways, follow your own disruptive path. Dare to innovate. Dream big dreams. Do something astonishing. Disrupt yourself. In this book, you will learn how to apply these frameworks to building a business, career – and you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are living in an era of accelerating disruption – those who can manage the S-curve waves of learning and maxing out will have a competitive advantage. But this is a skill set that needs to be learned. &lt;i&gt;Disrupt Yourself&lt;/i&gt; will help people cope with the unpredictability of disruption, and use it to their competitive advantage.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The inside, lesser-known story of NASA's boldest and riskiest mission: Apollo 8, mankind's first journey to the Moon on Christmas in 1968. A riveting account of three heroic astronauts who took one of the most dangerous space flights ever, from the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Shadow Divers.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early 1968, the Apollo program was on shaky footing. President Kennedy's end-of-decade deadline to put a man on the Moon was in jeopardy, and the Soviets were threatening to pull ahead in the space race. By August 1968, with its back against the wall, NASA decided to scrap its usual methodical approach and shoot for the heavens. With just four months to prepare--a fraction of the normal time--the agency would send the first men in history to the Moon. In a year of historic violence and discord--the Tet offensive, the assassinations of MLK and RFK, the Chicago DNC riots--the Apollo 8 mission was the boldest test of what America could do. With a focus on astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and their wives and children, this is a vivid, gripping, you-are-there narrative that shows anew the epic danger involved, and the singular bravery it took, for man to leave Earth for the first time--and to arrive at a new world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Sapiens, &lt;/i&gt;he explored our past. In &lt;i&gt;Homo Deus, &lt;/i&gt;he looked to our future&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuval Noah Harari's &lt;i&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, &lt;i&gt;21 Lessons for the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The lowdown on the toughest, sexiest, and beardiest man to ever stalk the earth&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Since its emergence from the bowels of the internet, the Chuck Norris Fact has roundhouse kicked its way into the world’s consciousness with all the vim and verve of its namesake. Singing the praises of his unequaled toughness, his mighty kicking feet, his indestructible beard, his frightening virility, and his ability to stop time by thinking about pineapples, &lt;i&gt;The Truth About Chuck Norris&lt;/i&gt; is the one book brave enough to go behind the beard and reveal the real Chuck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ian Spector, webmaster of the site which started the meme and survivor of a real-life encounter with Chuck himself, has selected the 400 most kick-ass facts from his library of thousands, as well as illustrations as awesome as the man himself. This death-defying volume includes such awe-inspiring observations as:&lt;br /&gt; • A cobra once bit Chuck Norris’s leg. After five days of excruciating pain, the cobra died. &lt;br /&gt; • Chuck Norris can charge a cell phone by rubbing it against his beard.&lt;br /&gt; • When an episode of “Walker, Texas Ranger” aired in France, the French surrendered to Chuck Norris just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; • Chuck Norris was the first person to tame a dinosaur.&lt;br /&gt; • Chuck Norris once visited The Virgin Islands. Afterward, they were renamed The Islands.&lt;br /&gt; • Every piece of furniture in Chuck Norris’s house is a Total Gym. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A must-have paean to the archetypical American male and a bible of all things Chuck, &lt;i&gt;The Truth About Chuck Norris&lt;/i&gt; is easily the most important book of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;AN UNAUTHORIZED PARODY&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>While observing trainers of exotic animals, journalist Amy Sutherland had an epiphany: What if she used their techniques with the human animals in her own life–specifically her dear husband, Scott? As Sutherland put training principles into action, she noticed that not only did her twelve-year-old marriage improve, but she herself became more optimistic and less judgmental. What started as a goofy experiment had such good results that Sutherland began using the training techniques with all the people in her life, including her mother, her friends, her students, even the clerk at the post office. Full of fun facts, fascinating insights, hilarious anecdotes, and practical tips, &lt;b&gt;What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage &lt;/b&gt;reveals the biggest lesson Sutherland learned: The only animal you can truly change is yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Our Mathematical Universe&lt;/i&gt; is a journey to explore the mysteries uncovered by cosmology and to discover the nature of reality. Our Big Bang, our distant future, parallel worlds, the sub-atomic and intergalactic - none of them are what they seem. But there is a way to understand this immense strangeness - mathematics. Seeking an answer to the fundamental puzzle of why our universe seems so mathematical, Tegmark proposes a radical idea: that our physical world not only is described by mathematics, but that it is mathematics. This may offer answers to our deepest questions: How large is reality? What is everything made of? Why is our universe the way it is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Table of Contents&lt;br /&gt;Preface &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1 What Is Reality? &lt;br /&gt;Not What It Seems • What’s the Ultimate Question? • The Journey Begins&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Part One: Zooming Out&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2 Our Place in Space &lt;br /&gt;Cosmic Questions • How Big Is Space? • The Size of Earth • Distance to the Moon • Distance to the Sun and the Planets • Distance to the Stars • Distance to the Galaxies • What Is Space?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3 Our Place in Time&lt;br /&gt;Where Did Our Solar System Come From? • Where Did the&lt;br /&gt;Galaxies Come From? • Where Did the Mysterious Microwaves&lt;br /&gt;Come From? • Where Did the Atoms Come From?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4 Our Universe by Numbers&lt;br /&gt;Wanted: Precision Cosmology • Precision Microwave-Background Fluctuations • Precision Galaxy Clustering • The Ultimate Map of Our Universe • Where Did Our Big Bang Come From?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5 Our Cosmic Origins &lt;br /&gt;What’s Wrong with Our Big Bang? • How Inflation Works • The Gift That Keeps on Giving • Eternal Inflation&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6 Welcome to the Multiverse &lt;br /&gt;The Level I Multiverse • The Level II Multiverse • Multiverse Halftime Roundup&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Part Two: Zooming In&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;7 Cosmic Legos &lt;br /&gt;Atomic Legos • Nuclear Legos • Particle-Physics Legos • Mathematical Legos • Photon Legos • Above the Law? • Quanta and Rainbows • Making Waves • Quantum Weirdness • The Collapse of Consensus • The Weirdness Can’t Be Confined • Quantum Confusion&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;8 The Level III Multiverse &lt;br /&gt;The Level III Multiverse • The Illusion of Randomness • Quantum Censorship • The Joys of Getting Scooped • Why Your Brain Isn’t a Quantum Computer • Subject, Object and Environment • Quantum Suicide • Quantum Immortality? • Multiverses Unified • Shifting Views: Many Worlds or Many Words?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Part Three: Stepping Back&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;9 Internal Reality, External Reality and Consensus Reality &lt;br /&gt;External Reality and Internal Reality • The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth • Consensus Reality • Physics: Linking External to Consensus Reality&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;10 Physical Reality and Mathematical Reality &lt;br /&gt;Math, Math Everywhere! • The Mathematical Universe Hypothesis • What Is a Mathematical Structure?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;11 Is Time an Illusion? &lt;br /&gt;How Can Physical Reality Be Mathematical? • What Are You? • Where Are You?

  <description>Are leaders born or made? Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Does the leader make the times or do the times make the leader?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Leadership&lt;/i&gt;, Goodwin draws upon the four presidents she has studied most closely—Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson (in civil rights)—to show how they recognized leadership qualities within themselves and were recognized as leaders by others. By looking back to their first entries into public life, we encounter them at a time when their paths were filled with confusion, fear, and hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leadership &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of how they all collided with dramatic reversals that disrupted their lives and threatened to shatter forever their ambitions. Nonetheless, they all emerged fitted to confront the contours and dilemmas of their times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No common pattern describes the trajectory of leadership. Although set apart in background, abilities, and temperament, these men shared a fierce ambition and a deep-seated resilience that enabled them to surmount uncommon hardships. At their best, all four were guided by a sense of moral purpose. At moments of great challenge, they were able to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others.</description>

  <description>In her most affirming and life-changing book yet, Dr. Harriet Lerner teaches us how to restore love and connection with the people who matter the most. In &lt;em&gt;The Dance of Connection&lt;/em&gt; we learn what to say (and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say) when:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- We need an apology, and the person who has harmed us won't apologize or be accountable.&lt;br /&gt;- We don't know how to take a conversation to the next level when we feel desperate.&lt;br /&gt;- We feel worn down by the other person's criticism, negativity, or irresponsible behavior.&lt;br /&gt;- We have been rejected or cut off, and the other person won't show up for the conversation.&lt;br /&gt;- We are struggling with staying or leaving, and we don't know our "bottom line."&lt;br /&gt;- We are convinced that we've tried everything -- and nothing changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with compelling personal stories and case examples, Lerner outlines bold new "voice lessons" that show us how to speak with honor and personal integrity, even when the other person behaves badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether we're dealing with a partner, parent, sister, or best friend, &lt;i&gt;The Dance of Connection&lt;/i&gt; teaches us how to navigate our most important relationships with clarity, courage, and joyous conviction.</description>

  <description>Isaac Newton was born in a stone farmhouse in 1642, fatherless and unwanted by his mother. When he died in London in 1727 he was so renowned he was given a state funeral—an unheard-of honor for a subject whose achievements were in the realm of the intellect. During the years he was an irascible presence at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton imagined properties of nature and gave them names—&lt;i&gt;mass&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;velocity&lt;/i&gt;—things our science now takes for granted. Inspired by Aristotle, spurred on by Galileo’s discoveries and the philosophy of Descartes, Newton grasped the intangible and dared to take its measure, a leap of the mind unparalleled in his generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Gleick, the author of &lt;b&gt;Chaos&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Genius&lt;/b&gt;, and one of the most acclaimed science writers of &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; generation, brings the reader into Newton’s reclusive life and provides startlingly clear explanations of the concepts that changed forever our perception of bodies, rest, and motion. Ideas so basic to the twenty-first century we literally take them for granted.</description>

  <description>Most of the denizens of the Antarctic penguin colony sneer at Fred, the quiet but observant scout who detects worrying signs that their home, an iceberg, is melting. Fred must cleverly convince and enlist key players, such as Louis, the head penguin; Alice, the number two bird; the intractable NoNo the weather expert; and a passle of school-age penguins if he is to save the colony.&lt;br /&gt;Their delightfully told journey illuminates in an unforgettable way how to manage the necessary change that surrounds us all. Simple explanatory material following the fable enhances the lasting value of these lessons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Iceberg Is Melting&lt;/i&gt; is at once charming, accessible and profound; a treat for virtually any reader.</description>

  <description>Excerpt: "This book is written as an introductory text, meant for those with little or no experience with computers or information systems. While sometimes the descriptions can get a little bit technical, every effort has been made to convey the information essential to understanding a topic while not getting bogged down in detailed terminology or esoteric discussions. . . . At the end of each chapter, there is a set of study questions and exercises (except for chapter 1, which only offers study questions). The study questions can be assigned to help focus students' reading on the learning objectives. The exercises are meant to be a more in-depth, experiential way for students to learn chapter topics. It is recommended that you review any exercise before assigning it, adding any detail needed (such as length, due date) to complete the assignment."</description>

  <description>Introductory information systems textbooks often present the topic in somewhat of a vacuum. That is, they focus on information systems without really succeeding in showing how IS is integrated in organizations, how knowledge workers are supported, and how important IS is for an organization's success. Many undergraduate students do not understand why they are required to take an IS course since they are not IS majors. Many also expect the introductory course to focus on personal productivity software. This textbook will teach students how to exploit IS in a technology-rich environment. It will emphasize why, no matter what their major, information and communications technologies (ICT) are, and increasingly will be, a critical element in their personal success and the success of their organizations. In other words, they need to be introduced to concepts, principles, methods, and procedures that will be valuable to them for years to come in thinking about existing organization systems, proposing new systems, and working with IS professionals in implementing new systems.</description>

  <description>In 1909, because of their ties with the failed Boxer Rebellion and the rise of modern weaponry, Chinese martial arts were in serious danger of extinction. The Jingwu Association was formed to keep these ancient arts alive. &lt;i&gt;Jingwu: The School That Transformed Kung Fu &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of this seminal institution. Extensively researched, the book shows Jingwu as the first public martial arts training school and the first to teach kung fu as recreation, not simply as a form of combat. It was also the first to incorporate women's programs with men's, and the first to use popular media to promote Chinese martial arts as both sport and entertainment. Through these efforts, the Jingwu Association helped guarantee Chinese martial arts would survive the transition from traditional to modern China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lively history covers the school's tumultuous beginnings; the four historical phases of Chinese martial arts that inform it; profiles of important practitioners like Huo Yuanjia; those elements, such as the integration of women, that have made Jingwu distinctive and enduring; individual branches and practices within the larger system; and more. Rare historical documents and vintage photographs take the reader directly into one of the most fascinating and important stories in martial arts.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The 5 Languages of Appreciation in the Workplace&lt;/i&gt; applies the love language concept to the workplace. This book helps supervisors and managers effectively communicate appreciation and encouragement to their employees, resulting in higher levels of job satisfaction, healthier relationships between managers and employees, and decreased cases of burnout. Ideal for both the profit and non-profit sectors, the principles presented in this book have a proven history of success in businesses, schools, medical offices, churches, and industry. Each book contains an access code for the reader to take a comprehensive online MBA Inventory (Motivating By Appreciation) - a $20 value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inventory is designed to provide a clearer picture of an individual's primary language of appreciation and motivation as experienced in a work-related setting. It identifies individuals' preference in the languages of appreciation. Understanding an individual's primary and secondary languages of appreciation can assist managers and supervisors in communicating effectively to their team members.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Our most commonly held formula for success is broken.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; we’ll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness &lt;i&gt;fuels &lt;/i&gt;success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isn’t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. &lt;br /&gt;            &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Happiness Advantage&lt;/i&gt;, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research—including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMG—to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work. &lt;br /&gt;            &lt;br /&gt;Isolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    • The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunities wherever we look.&lt;br /&gt;    • The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.&lt;br /&gt;    • Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happiness—our social support network&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, &lt;i&gt;The Happiness Advantage &lt;/i&gt;isn’t only about how to become happier at work. It’s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our work and in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In The Millionaire Messenger, Brendon Burchard pulls back the curtains on the once-secretive "expert industry" and shows how to become an influential and highly paid advice expert through websites, books, speeches, seminars, coaching, consulting, and online programs.  Blessed to receive life’s golden ticket - a second chance - after surviving a dramatic car accident, Burchard has dedicated his life to helping others find their voice, live more fully, and follow their dreams.  By following his 10-step program, average, ordinary people can learn to package their struggles, successes, research, or life’s story into advice for others and become experts on any given topic.  In the industry of people who share their advice and knowledge with the world and get paid for it, Burchard is the “guru’s guru."&lt;br /&gt; If you’ve ever wondered how the gurus spread their message, serve others, and build a real business, then this is a must-read.</description>

  <description>James A. Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty, he rose to become a wunderkind scholar, a Civil War hero, and a renowned and admired reformist congressman. Nominated for president against his will, he engaged in a fierce battle with the corrupt political establishment. But four months after his inauguration, a deranged office seeker tracked Garfield down and shot him in the back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the shot didn’t kill Garfield. The drama of what hap­pened subsequently is a powerful story of a nation in tur­moil. The unhinged assassin’s half-delivered strike shattered the fragile national mood of a country so recently fractured by civil war, and left the wounded president as the object of a bitter behind-the-scenes struggle for power—over his administration, over the nation’s future, and, hauntingly, over his medical care. A team of physicians administered shockingly archaic treatments, to disastrous effect. As his con­dition worsened, Garfield received help: Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, worked around the clock to invent a new device capable of finding the bullet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meticulously researched, epic in scope, and pulsating with an intimate human focus and high-velocity narrative drive, &lt;i&gt;The Destiny of the Republic&lt;/i&gt; will stand alongside &lt;i&gt;The Devil in the White City&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Professor and the Madman&lt;/i&gt; as a classic of narrative history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The former director of communications at Harley-Davidson and one of the most sought-after speakers in the world reveals his exhilarating, innovative approach to creating customer loyalty and marketplace dominance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken Schmidt is a wanted man. His role in transforming Harley-Davidson Motor Company—one of the most celebrated corporate success stories in history—led business leaders all over the world to seek his guidance. After all, how many companies can get their customers to tattoo their logo on their arms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having worked with more than one thousand companies worldwide, Schmidt is ready to share the secrets that spurred Harley-Davidson’s remarkable turnaround. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, Schmidt harnessed his passion for riding to create his famed Noise Cubed Trilogy—the three questions he asks every one of his clients. They assess a company’s positioning, competitiveness, and reputation, and are the key ingredients for any successful corporation: What do the customers your business served yesterday say about your business when they’re talking about you to prospective customers? What do you want them to say? What are you doing to get them to say it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Make Some Noise&lt;/i&gt;, Schmidt shares his full-throttle approach for businesses and individuals alike. Anyone looking to become more competitive and grow customer loyalty can learn from the case studies and experiences he shares. From a nondescript heavy construction company, to the most high-end “luxury” gas station in America, to Apple, and to his own personal landscaper, Schmidt illustrates how the answers to his trio of questions will yield a course of action to stand out in today’s marketplace.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Saving Capitalism&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Work of Nations&lt;/i&gt;, a passionate, clear-eyed manifesto on why we must restore the idea of the common good to the center of our economics and politics.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the warmth and lucidity that have made him one of our most important public voices, Robert B. Reich makes the case for a generous, inclusive understanding of the American project, centering on the moral obligations of citizenship. Rooting his argument in everyday reality and common sense, Reich demonstrates the existence of a common good, and argues that it is this that defines a society or a nation. Societies and nations undergo virtuous cycles that reinforce and build the common good, as well as vicious cycles that undermine it. Over the course of the past five decades, Reich contends, America has been in a slowly accelerating vicious cycle--one that can and must be reversed. But first we need to weigh what really matters, and how we as a country should relate to honor, shame, patriotism, truth, and the meaning of leadership.&lt;p&gt;Powerful, urgent, and utterly vital, this is a heartfelt missive from one of our foremost political thinkers: a fundamental statement about the purpose of society and a cri de coeur to save America's soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Accelerate Leadership and Get Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great leaders of change positively impact business performance by fundamentally working differently than most leaders in three ways. First, they change how they think and talk about change. Second, they change their approach to change by engaging both individuals &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the organization. And third, they elevate what they do as a leader and the roles they play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Change the Way You Change!&lt;/i&gt;, authors R. Kendall Lyman and Tony C. Daloisio pull from ten years of research and working with individuals, teams, and organizations to convincingly illustrate how changing a team or a business requires changing both inside-out (thoughts and beliefs) and outside-in (structure and system) approaches. Each chapter provides an in-depth discussion of one of the five roles of great change leaders: focus, align, engage, lead, and sustain. And the main points of discussion in each chapter are bolstered by quotations, examples, exercises, and summaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only way to survive as a leader in the twenty-first century is to make change part of your leadership agenda. And that means making it a priority and getting good at it. Whether readers are beginners or experts, this book will help them change the way they change to accelerate their leadership and get results. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A bracing assessment of U.S. foreign policy and world disorder over the past two decades, anchored by a major new Pentagon-commissioned essay about changing power dynamics among China, Eurasia, and America--from the renowned geopolitical analyst and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Revenge of Geography&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Coming Anarchy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late thirteenth century, Marco Polo began a decades-long trek from Venice to China. The strength of that Silk Road--the trade route between Europe and Asia--was a foundation of Kublai Khan's sprawling empire. Now, in the early twenty-first century, the Chinese regime has proposed a land-and-maritime Silk Road that duplicates exactly the route Marco Polo traveled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the major lead essay, recently released by the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment, Robert D. Kaplan lays out a blueprint of the world's changing power politics that recalls the late thirteenth century. As Europe fractures from changes in culture and migration, Eurasia coheres into a single conflict system. China is constructing a land bridge to Europe. Iran and India are trying to link the oil fields of Central Asia to the Indian Ocean. America's ability to influence the power balance in Eurasia is declining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Kaplan's first collection of essays since his classic &lt;i&gt;The Coming Anarchy&lt;/i&gt; was published in 2000. Drawing on decades of firsthand experience as a foreign correspondent and military embed for &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic, &lt;/i&gt; as well as encounters with preeminent realist thinkers, Kaplan outlines the timeless principles that should shape America's role in a turbulent world: a respect for the limits of Western-style democracy; a delineation between American interests and American values; an awareness of the psychological toll of warfare; a projection of power via a strong navy; and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Kaplan's immediate thoughts on President Trump ("On Foreign Policy, Donald Trump Is No Realist," 2016) to a frank examination of what will happen in the event of war with North Korea ("When North Korea Falls," 2006), &lt;i&gt;The Return of Marco Polo's World&lt;/i&gt; is a vigorous and honest reckoning with the difficult choices the United States will face in the years ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"These essays constitute a truly pathbreaking, brilliant synthesis and analysis of geographic, political, technological, and economic trends with far-reaching consequences. &lt;i&gt;The Return of Marco Polo's World &lt;/i&gt;is another work by Robert D. Kaplan that will be regarded as a classic."--General David Petraeus (U.S. Army, Ret.)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A groundbreaking book about how technological advances in genomics and the extraction of ancient DNA have profoundly changed our understanding of human prehistory while resolving many long-standing controversies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massive technological innovations now allow scientists to extract and analyze ancient DNA as never before, and it has become clear--in part from David Reich's own contributions to the field--that genomics is as important a means of understanding the human past as archeology, linguistics, and the written word. Now&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;in&lt;i&gt; The New Science of the Human Past&lt;/i&gt;, Reich describes with unprecedented clarity just how the human genome provides not only all the information that a fertilized human egg needs to develop but also contains within it the history of our species. He delineates how the Genomic Revolution and ancient DNA are transforming our understanding of our own lineage as modern humans; how genomics deconstructs the idea that there are no biologically meaningful differences among human populations (though without adherence to pernicious racist hierarchies); and how DNA studies reveal the deep history of human inequality--among different populations, between the sexes, and among individuals within a population.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Happiness Advantage&lt;/i&gt; reveals why our potential is not limited by what we on our own can achieve; rather, our success is amplified by the successes of those around us. He offers five strategies for exponentially raising our achievement and performance by helping others--colleagues, teams, and employees--be better.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For decades, we have thought about potential as being a constellation of individual traits: &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;creativity, &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;abilities, &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; intelligence. But new research shows that this version of potential--what Achor calls Small Potential--is deeply flawed, and places a ceiling on the level of success we can achieve. Because we now know that all these traits are in fact interconnected, and that by pursuing success individually, we have been leaving much of our potential untapped.&lt;br /&gt; Big Potential works not in isolation, but rather as part of an ecosystem. So when we help those around us succeed, we not only raise the performance of the group, but we also create a virtuous cycle by which &lt;i&gt;we in turn become more successful ourselves&lt;/i&gt;. Drawing on cutting-edge original research as well as his work with executives, educators, and leaders around the globe, Achor shows how we can all lift the ceiling on our potential by helping others realize theirs.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"You'll not only break the ice, you'll melt it away with your new skills."&lt;/i&gt; -- Larry King&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The lost art of verbal communication may be revitalized by Leil Lowndes."&lt;/i&gt; -- Harvey McKay, author of &lt;i&gt;"How to Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is that magic quality makes some people instantly loved and respected? Everyone wants to be their friend (or, if single, their lover!) In business, they rise swiftly to the top of the corporate ladder. What is their "Midas touch?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it boils down to is a more skillful way of dealing with people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author has spent her career teaching people how to communicate for success. In her book &lt;i&gt;How to Talk to Anyone&lt;/i&gt; (Contemporary Books, October 2003) Lowndes offers 92 easy and effective sure-fire success techniques-- she takes the reader from first meeting all the way up to sophisticated techniques used by the big winners in life. In this information-packed book you'll find:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 ways to make a dynamite first impression 14 ways to master small talk, "big talk," and body language 14 ways to walk and talk like a VIP or celebrity 6 ways to sound like an insider in any crowd 7 ways to establish deep subliminal rapport with anyone 9 ways to feed someone's ego (and know when NOT to!) 11 ways to make your phone a powerful communications tool 15 ways to work a party like a politician works a room 7 ways to talk with tigers and not get eaten alive&lt;br /&gt;In her trademark entertaining and straight-shooting style, Leil gives the techniques catchy names so you'll remember them when you really need them, including: "Rubberneck the Room," "Be a Copyclass," "Come Hither Hands," "Bare Their Hot Button," "The Great Scorecard in the Sky," and "Play the Tombstone Game," for big success in your social life, romance, and business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Talk to Anyone&lt;/i&gt;, which is an update of her popular book, &lt;i&gt;Talking the Winner's Way&lt;/i&gt; (see the 5-star reviews of the latter) is based on solid research about techniques that work!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, don't confuse &lt;i&gt;How to Talk to Anyone&lt;/i&gt; with one of Leil's previous books, &lt;i&gt;How to Talk to Anybody About Anything&lt;/i&gt;. This one is completely different!</description>

  <description>The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia"—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>From one of America’s greatest minds, a journey through psychology, philosophy, and lots of meditation to show how Buddhism holds the key to moral clarity and enduring happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Wright famously explained in &lt;i&gt;The Moral Animal &lt;/i&gt;how evolution shaped the human brain. The mind is designed to often delude us, he argued, about ourselves and about the world. And it is designed to make happiness hard to sustain.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But if we know our minds are rigged for anxiety, depression, anger, and greed, what do we do? Wright locates the answer in Buddhism, which figured out thousands of years ago what scientists are only discovering now. Buddhism holds that human suffering is a result of not seeing the world clearly—and proposes that seeing the world more clearly, through meditation, will make us better, happier people.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Why Buddhism is True&lt;/i&gt;, Wright leads readers on a journey through psychology, philosophy, and a great many silent retreats to show how and why meditation can serve as the foundation for a spiritual life in a secular age. At once excitingly ambitious and wittily accessible, this is the first book to combine evolutionary psychology with cutting-edge neuroscience to defend the radical claims at the heart of Buddhist philosophy. With bracing honesty and fierce wisdom, it will persuade you not just that Buddhism is true—which is to say, a way out of our delusion—but that it can ultimately save us from ourselves, as individuals and as a species.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don't know much about timing itself. Our lives are a never-ending stream of "when" decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person. Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timing, it's often assumed, is an art. In &lt;i&gt;When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing&lt;/i&gt;, Pink shows that timing is really a science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on a rich trove of research from psychology, biology, and economics, Pink reveals how best to live, work, and succeed. How can we use the hidden patterns of the day to build the ideal schedule? Why do certain breaks dramatically improve student test scores? How can we turn a stumbling beginning into a fresh start? Why should we avoid going to the hospital in the afternoon? Why is singing in time with other people as good for you as exercise? And what is the ideal time to quit a job, switch careers, or get married?</description>

  <description>Written by gifted storyteller Winston Groom (author of &lt;i&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;The Aviators&lt;/i&gt; tells the saga of three extraordinary aviators--Charles Lindbergh, Eddie Rickenbacker, and Jimmy Doolittle--and how they redefine heroism through their genius, daring, and uncommon courage.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This is the fascinating story of three extraordinary heroes who defined aviation during the great age of flight. These cleverly interwoven tales of their heart-stopping adventures take us from the feats of World War I through the heroism of World War II and beyond, including daring military raids and survival-at-sea, and will appeal to fans of &lt;i&gt;Unbroken&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Generation&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Flyboys&lt;/i&gt;. With the world in peril in World War II, each man set aside great success and comfort to return to the skies for his most daring mission yet. Doolittle, a brilliant aviation innovator, would lead the daring Tokyo Raid to retaliate for Pearl Harbor; Lindbergh, hero of the first solo flight across the Atlantic, would fly combat missions in the South Pacific; and Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace, would bravely hold his crew together while facing near-starvation and circling sharks after his plane went down in a remote part of the Pacific. Groom's rich narrative tells their intertwined stories--from broken homes to Medals of Honor (all three would receive it); barnstorming to the greatest raid of World War II; front-page triumph to anguished tragedy; and near-death to ultimate survival--as all took to the sky, time and again, to become exemplars of the spirit of the "greatest generation."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first sleep book by a leading scientific expert—Professor Matthew Walker, Director of UC Berkeley’s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab—reveals his groundbreaking exploration of sleep, explaining how we can harness its transformative power to change our lives for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Walker answers important questions about sleep: how do caffeine and alcohol affect sleep? What really happens during REM sleep? Why do our sleep patterns change across a lifetime? How do common sleep aids affect us and can they do long-term damage? Charting cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and synthesizing decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood, and energy levels; regulate hormones; prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes; slow the effects of aging; increase longevity; enhance the education and lifespan of our children, and boost the efficiency, success, and productivity of our businesses. Clear-eyed, fascinating, and accessible, &lt;i&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/i&gt; is a crucial and illuminating book.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;AN INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “I find myself thinking deeply about what it means to love America, as I surely do.” —Dan Rather&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At a moment of crisis over our national identity, venerated journalist Dan Rather has emerged as a voice of reason and integrity, reflecting on—and writing passionately about—what it means to be an American. Now, with this collection of original essays, he reminds us of the principles upon which the United States was founded. Looking at the freedoms that define us, from the vote to the press; the values that have transformed us, from empathy to inclusion to service; the institutions that sustain us, such as public education; and the traits that helped form our young country, such as the audacity to take on daunting challenges in science and medicine, Rather brings to bear his decades of experience on the frontlines of the world’s biggest stories. As a living witness to historical change, he offers up an intimate view of history, tracing where we have been in order to help us chart a way forward and heal our bitter divisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With a fundamental sense of hope, &lt;i&gt;What Unites Us&lt;/i&gt; is the book to inspire conversation and listening, and to remind us all how we are, finally, one.</description>

  <description>Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative genius</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A masterpiece.”&lt;br /&gt; —Jon Kabat-Zinn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since &lt;i&gt;Mindfulness in Plain English&lt;/i&gt; was first published in 1994, it has become one of the bestselling — and most&lt;br /&gt; influential — books in the field of mindfulness. It’s easy to see why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Bhante Gunaratana, a renowned meditation master, takes us&lt;b&gt; step by step through the myths, realities, and&lt;br /&gt; benefits of meditation and the practice of mindfulness. &lt;/b&gt;The book showcases Bhante’s trademark clarity and wit, as he explores the tool of meditation, what it does, and how to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This expanded edition includes the complete text of its predecessor along with a new chapter on cultivating loving&lt;br /&gt; kindness, an especially important topic in today’s world. For anyone who is new to meditation, this is a great&lt;br /&gt; resource for learning how to live a more productive and peaceful life.</description>

  <description>A fifth-century Indian Buddhist monk, Bodhidharma is credited with bringing Zen to China. Although the tradition that traces its ancestry back to him did not flourish until nearly two hundred years after his death, today millions of Zen Buddhists and students of kung fu claim him as their spiritual father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While others viewed Zen practice as a purification of the mind or a stage on the way to perfect enlightenment, Bodhidharma equated Zen with buddhahood and believed that it had a place in everyday life. Instead of telling his disciples to purify their minds, he pointed them to rock walls, to the movements of tigers and cranes, to a hollow reed floating across the Yangtze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bilingual edition, the only volume of the great teacher's work currently available in English, presents four teachings in their entirety. "Outline of Practice" describes the four all-inclusive habits that lead to enlightenment, the "Bloodstream Sermon" exhorts students to seek the Buddha by seeing their own nature, the "Wake-up Sermon" defends his premise that the most essential method for reaching enlightenment is beholding the mind. The original Chinese text, presented on facing pages, is taken from a Ch'ing dynasty woodblock edition.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Democracy in America&lt;/i&gt; has had the singular honor of being even to this day the work that political commentators of every stripe refer to when they seek to draw large conclusions about the society of the USA. Alexis de Tocqueville, a young French aristocrat, came to the young nation to investigate the functioning of American democracy &amp;amp; the social, political &amp;amp; economic life of its citizens, publishing his observations in 1835 &amp;amp; 1840. Brilliantly written, vividly illustrated with vignettes &amp;amp; portraits, &lt;i&gt;Democracy in America&lt;/i&gt; is far more than a trenchant analysis of one society at a particular point in time. What will most intrigue modern readers is how many of the observations still hold true: on the mixed advantages of a free press, the strained relations among the races &amp;amp; the threats posed to democracies by consumerism &amp;amp; corruption. So uncanny is Tocqueville’s insight &amp;amp; so accurate are his predictions, that it seems as tho he were not merely describing the American identity but actually helping to create it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;How 401(k)s have gutted retirement security, from charging exorbitant hidden fees to failing to replace the income of traditional pensions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Named one of &lt;i&gt;PW&lt;/i&gt;'s Top 10 for Business &amp;amp; Economics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;A retirement crisis is looming. In 2008, as the 401(k) fallout rippled across the country, horrified holders watched 25 percent of their funds evaporate overnight. Average 401(k) balances for those approaching retirement are too small to generate more than $4,000 in annual retirement income, and experts predict that nearly half of middle-class workers will be poor or near poor in retirement. But long before the recession, signs were mounting that few people would ever be able to accumulate enough wealth on their own to ensure financial security later in life. This hasn’t always been the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each generation of workers since the nineteenth century has had more retirement security than the previous generation. That is, until 1981, when shaky 401(k) plans began replacing traditional pensions. For the last thirty years, we’ve been advised that the best way to build one’s nest egg is to heavily invest in 401(k)-type programs, even though such plans were originally designed to be a supplement to rather than the basis for retirement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This financial experiment, promoted by neoliberals and aggressively peddled by Wall Street, has now come full circle, with tens of millions of Americans discovering that they would have been better off under traditional pension plans long since replaced. As James W. Russell explains, this do-it-yourself retirement system—in which individuals with modest incomes are expected to invest large sums of capital in order to reap the same rewards as high-end money managers—isn’t working. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Social Insecurity&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a massive and international retirement robbery—a substantial transfer of wealth from everyday workers to Wall Street financiers via tremendously costly hidden fees. Russell traces what amounts to a perfect swindle, from its ideological origins at Milton Friedman’s infamous Chicago School to its implementation in Chile under Pinochet’s dictatorship and its adoption in America through Reaganomics. Enraging yet hopeful, Russell offers concrete ideas on how individuals and society can arrest this downward spiral.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;A. Lincoln&lt;/i&gt;, a major new biography of one of America’s greatest generals—and most misunderstood presidents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his time, Ulysses S. Grant was routinely grouped with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in the “Trinity of Great American Leaders.” But the battlefield commander-turned-commander-in-chief fell out of favor in the twentieth century. In &lt;i&gt;American Ulysses&lt;/i&gt;, Ronald C. White argues that we need to once more revise our estimates of him in the twenty-first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on seven years of research with primary documents—some of them never examined by previous Grant scholars—this is destined to become the Grant biography of our time. White, a biographer exceptionally skilled at writing momentous history from the inside out, shows Grant to be a generous, curious, introspective man and leader—a willing delegator with a natural gift for managing the rampaging egos of his fellow officers. His wife, Julia Dent Grant, long marginalized in the historic record, emerges in her own right as a spirited and influential partner.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grant was not only a brilliant general but also a passionate defender of equal rights in post-Civil War America. After winning election to the White House in 1868, he used the power of the federal government to battle the Ku Klux Klan. He was the first president to state that the government’s policy toward American Indians was immoral, and the first ex-president to embark on a world tour, and he cemented his reputation for personal courage by racing against death to complete his &lt;i&gt;Personal Memoirs&lt;/i&gt;. Published by Mark Twain, it is widely considered to be the greatest memoir by an American leader, but its place in Grant’s life story has never been fully explored—until now.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of those rare books that successfully recast our impression of an iconic historical figure, &lt;i&gt;American Ulysses&lt;/i&gt; gives us a finely honed, three-dimensional portrait of Grant the man—husband, father, writer, leader—that should set the standard by which all future biographies of him will be measured.</description>

  <description>A stunning new approach to how individuals can not only change their lives for the better in the workplace, but also their lives away from the office, including (but not limited to) finding ways to improve one's working relationship with others, one's overall health, outlook on life, and so on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, why is it that 95% of all diet attempts fail? Why do New Year's Resolutions last no more than a few days? Why can't people with good intentions seem to make consistent and positive strides in the way they want to improve their careers, financial fitness, physical fitness, and so on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based upon the latest research in a number of psychological and medical fields, the authors of &lt;strong&gt;CHANGE ANYTHING&lt;/strong&gt; will show that traditional will-power is not necessarily the answer to these strivings, that people are affected in their behaviors by far more subtle influences. &lt;strong&gt;CHANGE ANYTHING&lt;/strong&gt; shows how individuals can come to understand these powerful and influential forces, and how to put these forces to work in a positive manner that brings real and meaningful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors present an array of everyday examples that will change and truly empower you to reexamine the way you go about your business and life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller/&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book of 2017/NPR Best Books of 2017/&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Best Books of 2017 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This book will serve as the definitive guide to the past and future of health care in America."&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;Siddhartha Mukherjee, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Emperor of All Maladies&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Gene&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a moment of drastic political upheaval, &lt;i&gt;An American Sickness &lt;/i&gt;is a shocking investigation into our dysfunctional healthcare system - and offers practical solutions to its myriad problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these troubled times, perhaps no institution has unraveled more quickly and more completely than American medicine. In only a few decades, the medical system has been overrun by organizations seeking to exploit for profit the trust that vulnerable and sick Americans place in their healthcare. Our politicians have proven themselves either unwilling or incapable of reining in the increasingly outrageous costs faced by patients, and market-based solutions only seem to funnel larger and larger sums of our money into the hands of corporations. Impossibly high insurance premiums and inexplicably large bills have become facts of life; fatalism has set in. Very quickly Americans have been made to accept paying more for less. How did things get so bad so fast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breaking down this monolithic business into the individual industries--the hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers--that together constitute our healthcare system, Rosenthal exposes the recent evolution of American medicine as never before. How did healthcare, the caring endeavor, become healthcare, the highly profitable industry? Hospital systems, which are managed by business executives, behave like predatory lenders, hounding patients and seizing their homes. Research charities are in bed with big pharmaceutical companies, which surreptitiously profit from the donations made by working people. Patients receive bills in code, from entrepreneurial doctors they never even saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is in tatters, but we can fight back. Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal doesn't just explain the symptoms, she diagnoses and treats the disease itself. In clear and practical terms, she spells out exactly how to decode medical doublespeak, avoid the pitfalls of the pharmaceuticals racket, and get the care you and your family deserve. She takes you inside the doctor-patient relationship and to hospital C-suites, explaining step-by-step the workings of a system badly lacking transparency. This is about what we can do, as individual patients, both to navigate the maze that is American healthcare and also to demand far-reaching reform. &lt;i&gt;An American Sickness&lt;/i&gt; is the frontline defense against a healthcare system that no longer has our well-being at heart.</description>

  <description>Often used to explain Japanese business competition, "Musashi's Book of Five Rings" is more properly a definitive treatise on mortal combat from one of Japan's most formidable warriors - the martial arts luminary "Miyamoto Musashi." Famed martial artist Stephen Kaufman has translated this classic without the usual commercial bias, driving straight to the heart of Musashi's incisive martial arts stratagems. The result is an enthralling combination of powerful technical wisdom and the philosophical elucidation offered to martial artists by Buddhism, Shintoism, Confucianism, and Taoism. From the metaphor of the Four Elements and fundamentals of physical practice and strategy to an offering of Zen wisdom on the "way" of nature, "Musashi's Book of Five Rings" is as profound and important a book on martial arts as you will find.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"The best sales book of the year" — &lt;i&gt;strategy+business&lt;/i&gt; magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That gap between your company’s sales efforts and strategy? It’s real—and a huge vulnerability. Addressing that gap, actionably and with attention to relevant research, is the focus of this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Aligning Strategy and Sales&lt;/i&gt;, Harvard Business School professor Frank Cespedes equips you to link your go-to-market initiatives with strategic goals. Cespedes offers a road map to articulate strategy in ways that people in the field can understand and that will fuel the behaviors required for profitable growth. Without that alignment, leaders will press for better execution when they need a better strategy, or change strategic direction with great cost and turmoil when they should focus on the basics of sales execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With thoughtful, clear, and engaging examples, &lt;i&gt;Aligning Strategy and Sales&lt;/i&gt; provides a framework for diagnosing and managing the core levers available for effective selling in any organization. It will give you the know-how and tools to move from ideas to action and build a sales effort linked to your firm’s unique goals, not a generic selling formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cespedes shows how sales efforts affect all elements of value creation in a business, whether you’re a start-up seeking to scale or an established firm looking to jump-start new growth. The book provides key insights to optimize your firm’s customer management activities and so improve selling &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; strategy.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Since Alexis de Tocqueville, restlessness has been accepted as a signature American trait. Our willingness to move, take risks, and adapt to change have produced a dynamic economy and a tradition of innovation from Ben Franklin to Steve Jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, according to legendary blogger, economist and bestelling author Tyler Cowen, is that Americans today have broken from this tradition—we’re working harder than ever to &lt;i&gt;avoid&lt;/i&gt; change. We're moving residences less, marrying people more like ourselves and choosing our music and our mates based on algorithms that wall us off from anything that might be too new or too different. Match.com matches us in love. Spotify and Pandora match us in music. Facebook matches us to just about everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this “matching culture” brings tremendous positives: music we like, partners who make us happy, neighbors who want the same things. We’re more &lt;i&gt;comfortable&lt;/i&gt;. But, according to Cowen, there are significant collateral downsides attending this comfort, among them heightened inequality and segregation and decreased incentives to innovate and create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Social Stagnation&lt;/i&gt; argues that this cannot go on forever. We are postponing change, due to our near-sightedness and extreme desire for comfort, but ultimately this will make change, when it comes, harder. The forces unleashed by the Great Stagnation will eventually lead to a major fiscal and budgetary crisis: impossibly expensive rentals for our most attractive cities, worsening of residential segregation, and a decline in our work ethic. The only way to avoid this difficult future is for Americans to force themselves out of their comfortable slumber—to embrace their restless tradition again.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the New York Times–bestselling author of Where Good Ideas Come From and Everything Bad Is Good for You, a new look at the power and legacy of great ideas.&lt;/b&gt;In this illustrated history, Steven Johnson explores the history of innovation over centuries, tracing facets of modern life (refrigeration, clocks, and eyeglass lenses, to name a few) from their creation by hobbyists, amateurs, and entrepreneurs to their unintended historical consequences. Filled with surprising stories of accidental genius and brilliant mistakes—from the French publisher who invented the phonograph before Edison but forgot to include playback, to the Hollywood movie star who helped invent the technology behind Wi-Fi and Bluetooth—How We Got to Now investigates the secret history behind the everyday objects of contemporary life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In his trademark style, Johnson examines unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated fields: how the invention of air-conditioning enabled the largest migration of human beings in the history of the species—to cities such as Dubai or Phoenix, which would otherwise be virtually uninhabitable; how pendulum clocks helped trigger the industrial revolution; and how clean water made it possible to manufacture computer chips. Accompanied by a major six-part television series on PBS, How We Got to Now is the story of collaborative networks building the modern world, written in the provocative, informative, and engaging style that has earned Johnson fans around the globe.</description>

  <description>The legend of Bat Masterson as the heroic sheriff of Dodge City, Kansas, began in 1881 when an acquaintance duped a &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sun&lt;/i&gt; reporter into writing Masterson up as a man-killing gunfighter. That he later moved to New York City to write a widely followed sports column for eighteen years is one of history’s great ironies, as Robert K. DeArment relates in this engaging new book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Barclay “Bat” Masterson spent the first half of his adult life in the West, planting the seeds for his later legend as he moved from Texas to Kansas and then Colorado. In Denver his gambling habit and combative nature drew him to the still-developing sport of prizefighting. Masterson attended almost every important match in the United States from the 1880s to 1921, first as a professional gambler betting on the bouts, and later as a promoter and referee. Ultimately, Bat stumbled into writing about the sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Gunfighter in Gotham,&lt;/i&gt; DeArment tells how Bat Masterson built a second career from a column in the &lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Morning Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;. Bat’s articles not only covered sports but also reflected his outspoken opinions on war, crime, politics, and a changing society. As his renown as a boxing expert grew, his opinions were picked up by other newspaper editors and reprinted throughout the country and abroad. He counted President Theodore Roosevelt among his friends and readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This follow-up to DeArment’s definitive biography of the Old West legend narrates the final chapter of Masterson’s storied life. Far removed from the sweeping western plains and dusty cowtown streets of his younger days, Bat Masterson, in New York City, became “a ham reporter,” as he called himself, “a Broadway guy.”</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Why We Get Fat,&lt;/i&gt; a groundbreaking, eye-opening expose that makes the convincing case that sugar is the tobacco of the new millennium: backed by powerful lobbies, entrenched in our lives, and making us very sick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among Americans, diabetes is more prevalent today than ever; obesity is at epidemic proportions; nearly 10% of children are thought to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. And sugar is at the root of these, and other, critical society-wide, health-related problems. With his signature command of both science and straight talk, Gary Taubes delves into Americans' history with sugar: its uses as a preservative, as an additive in cigarettes, the contemporary overuse of high-fructose corn syrup. He explains what research has shown about our addiction to sweets. He clarifies the arguments against sugar, corrects misconceptions about the relationship between sugar and weight loss; and provides the perspective necessary to make informed decisions about sugar as individuals and as a society.</description>

  <description>During his lifetime, legendary martial artist Bruce Lee formulated a complex personal philosophy--a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideals--that extolled the virtues of knowledge and total mastery of one's self. However, most of his philosophical writings could be found only within the personal library of the Bruce Lee estate--until now. "The Warrior Within" is the most comprehensive volume of these teachings, meant to help you apply Lee's philosophies to your own life. This unique guide reveals such life-affirming secrets as:&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the totality of life and putting things into perspective&lt;br /&gt;Understanding the concept of Yin and Yang&lt;br /&gt;Defeating adversity by adapting to circumstances&lt;br /&gt;Tapping into inner spiritual forces to help shape the future&lt;br /&gt;With a foreword by Linda Lee Cadwell and photographs and other memorabilia from Bruce Lee's short but celebrated life, "The Warrior Within" is an engrossing and easy-to-understand guide to the little-explored world of Bruce Lee. John Little has been identified as "one of the foremost authorities on Bruce Lee in the world" by "Black Belt" magazine. He edited a three-volume series for the Bruce Lee estate and has written articles for several publications, including "Men's Fitness, Official Karate," and "Inside Kung Fu."</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it possible to be at your best even when you are underqualified or doing something for the first time? Is it still possible, even after decades of experience, to recapture the enthusiasm, curiosity, and fearlessness of youth to take on new challenges? With the right mindset—with Rookie Smarts—you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a rapidly changing world, experience can be a curse. Careers stall, innovation stops, and strategies grow stale. Being new, naïve, and even clueless can be an asset. For today’s knowledge workers, constant learning is more valuable than mastery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this essential guide, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explains how to reclaim and cultivate this curious, flexible, youthful mindset called Rookie Smarts. She argues that the most successful rookies are hunter-gatherers—alert and seeking, cautious but quick like firewalkers, and hungry and relentless like pioneers. Most importantly, she identifies a breed of leaders she refers to as “perpetual rookies.” Despite years of experience, they retain their rookie smarts, thinking and operating with the mindsets and practices of these high-performing rookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rookie Smarts&lt;/em&gt; addresses the questions every experienced professional faces: “Will my knowledge and skills become obsolete and irrelevant? Will a young, inexperienced newcomer upend my company or me? How can I keep up?” The answer is to stay fresh, keep learning, and know when to think like a rookie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rookie Smarts&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just for professionals seeking personal renewal; it is an indispensible resource for all leaders who must ensure their workforces remains vital and competitive.</description>

  <description>Wing Chun is the most popular form of Chinese Kung Fu in the world today, with over four million practitioners. The art as it is presently understood has been handed down from teacher to student for more than three hundred years.&lt;br /&gt;Until now, no one has ever stepped back and taken a critical look at why this art’s techniques are presented and performed the way they are. This book, by Wing Chun master Danny Xuan and martial-arts authority John Little, is the first to decipher these techniques that until now have been encrypted within this art.&lt;br /&gt;Xuan and Little reveal how Wing Chun was designed holistically, based on the laws of physics, human nature, and biomechanics. It was also designed with economy, efficiency, and productivity in mind. Unlike other martial arts, Wing Chun doesn’t focus on making a person larger, more rugged, acrobatic or animal-like; rather, it focuses on making optimal use of one’s own bodily structure and power potential by applying the sciences of biomechanics and physics. Thus, it is possible for males and females of all ages and sizes to excel in this art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tao of Wing Chun&lt;/i&gt; provides a readable, authoritative means of cultivating personal protection skills, enhanced flexibility, improved coordination, greater stamina, and physical and mental fitness while simultaneously cultivating humility, focus, determination, self-confidence, character, camaraderie, and deep inner strength. Foremost, this book offers the reader the means by which to apply Wing Chun principles in daily life.&lt;br /&gt;Enhanced by forty-eight full-color illustrations, &lt;i&gt;The Tao of Wing Chun&lt;/i&gt; will fascinate, educate, and entertain a wide range of readers—from beginner to master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Sports Publishing imprint, is proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in sports—books about baseball, pro football, college football, pro and college basketball, hockey, or soccer, we have a book about your sport or your team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to books on popular team sports, we also publish books for a wide variety of athletes and sports enthusiasts, including books on running, cycling, horseback riding, swimming, tennis, martial arts, golf, camping, hiking, aviation, boating, and so much more. While not every title we publish becomes a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to publishing books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked by other publishers and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;We Are All Weird&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; is Seth Godin's cult classic on celebrating (and marketing to) the individual, now repackaged and relaunched&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;World of Warcrafters, LARPers, Settlers of Catan? Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beliebers, Swifties, Directioners? Weirder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paleos, vegans, carb loaders, ovolactovegetarians? Definitely weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face it. We're all weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why are companies still trying to build products for the masses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are we still acting like the masses even exist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird is the new normal. And only companies that figure that out have any chance of survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Seth Godin shows you how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Read this book slowly and read it again, for the lessons are rich and wise' &lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Novogratz, founder, &lt;i&gt;Acumen&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketers at Procter &amp;amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They succeeded by transforming habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Power of Habit, &lt;/i&gt;award-winning &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its core, &lt;i&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/i&gt; contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Originals&lt;/i&gt; the author addresses the challenge of improving the world from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all?&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved &lt;i&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/i&gt;from the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the &lt;i&gt;ne plus ultra&lt;/i&gt; of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, &lt;i&gt;different.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.</description>

  <description>100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.</description>

  <description>First to translate two of the oldest accounts of Musashi's career, the Bushū denraiki and the Bukōden, the author here presents a full biography of this most famous yet most enigmatic of swordsmen, Miyamoto Musashi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on a wealth of additional and newly uncovered original sources, the author for the first time reveals aspects of Musashi's life that have hitherto been shrouded in mystery: the source of his deeply troubled relationship with his father, the exact place and side on which he fought during the battle of Sekigahara, his heroic role in the summer siege of Osaka castle, his actual whereabouts in the years that followed, and the remarkable gestation of the Gorin no sho, his great legacy to posterity of a unique martial philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quoting directly and extensively from original sources, A Life in Arms, traces Musashi's constant search for his own distinct style of swordsmanship--a path that began with the brutal slaying of Arima Kihei, led to the fall of the illustrious Yoshioka clan, and culminated in his dramatic encounter with Sasaki Kojirō on Ganryū island. It reveals how Musashi built on what he learned from his father and his uncles, how he perfected it on his musha shugyo, and how his Enmei-ryū evolved into the Niten Ichi-ryū, his unique art of fighting with two swords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Life in Arms shows how Musashi's path through life was shaped by strong personal traits: his reckless valor in the face of danger, his sensitive intelligence in the fields of art and architecture, his generosity toward peers and pupils, and his defiant stubbornness in old age. The complex yet human portrait that arises is a far cry from the accepted one-dimensional caricature of this great medieval swordsman.</description>

      <![CDATA[De Lange frames Musashi's life story around the heroes journey theme in a way that would have perhaps made Joseph Campbell smile. He also humanizes some of the eccentricities of the man and his behavior. It makes for an enjoyable story even for the non-martial artist. ]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WASHINGTON POST&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the getAbstract 17th International Book Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Seventh Sense&lt;/em&gt; is a concept every businessman, diplomat, or student should aspire to master--a powerful idea, backed by stories and figures that will be impossible to forget." -- Walter Isaacson, author of &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Endless terror. Refugee waves. An unfixable global economy. Surprising election results. New billion-dollar fortunes. Miracle medical advances. What if they were all connected? What if you could understand why? &lt;em&gt;The Seventh &lt;/em&gt;Sense is the story of what all of today's successful figures see and feel: the forces that are invisible to most of us but explain everything from explosive technological change to uneasy political ripples. The secret to power now is understanding our new age of networks. Not merely the Internet, but also webs of trade, finance, and even DNA. Based on his years of advising generals, CEOs, and politicians, Ramo takes us into the opaque heart of our world's rapidly connected systems and teaches us what the losers are not yet seeing--and what the victors of this age already know.</description>

  <description>Why do some people achieve great personal success, yet never succeed in building a business or making an impact in their organization? John C. Maxwell knows the answer. According to Maxwell, the greatest leadership principle that he has ever learned in over thirty-five years of leadership is that those closest to the leader will determine the success level of that leader. It’s not enough for a leader to have vision, energy, drive, and conviction. If you want to see your dream come to fruition, you must learn how to develop the leaders around you. Whether you’re the leader of a non-profit organization, small business, or Fortune 500 company, Developing the Leaders Around You can help you to take others to the limits of their potential and your organization to a whole new level.Learn how to•	Create an environment for potential leaders•	Identify and nurture future leaders•	Equip and develop leaders•	Form a dream team of leaders</description>

  <description>What would happen if a top expert with more than thirty years of leadership experience were willing to distill everything he had learned about leadership into a handful of life-changing principles just for you? It would change your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John C. Maxwell has done exactly that in &lt;i&gt;The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.&lt;/i&gt; He has combined insights learned from his thirty-plus years of leadership successes and mistakes with observations from the worlds of business, politics, sports, religion, and military conflict. The result is a revealing study of leadership delivered as only a communicator like Maxwell can.</description>

  <description>IN HIS BOOK The 100 Absolutely Unbreakable Laws of Business Success, Brian Tracy drew on his thirty years of experience and knowledge to present a set of principles or "universal laws" that lie behind the success of business people everywhere, in every kind of enterprise, large and small. This latest volume, The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires, is made up of entirely new material that shows how anyone, no matter where they are in life at this moment, can become a millionaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advice in this book is based on Brian Tracy's twenty-five years of research, teaching, and personal experience on the subject of self-made millionaires. Tracy himself used these ideas to rise from humble beginnings to become a millionaire. And Tracy has discovered that all successful people practice these 21 success secrets, whether they're consciously aware of it or not. In The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires Tracy not only identifies and defines each success secret, but also reveals its source and foundation, illustrates how it functions in the world, and shows how to apply it in life and work through specific steps and practical exercises that everyone can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to apply, The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires shows how anyone can cultivate the habits and behaviors that will enable them to achieve not just financial independence, but success in any area of life. Because, as Tracy writes, "The most important part of achieving great success is not the money. It is the kind of person you have to become to earn that money and hold onto it."</description>

  <description>We all recognize wisdom, but defining it is more elusive. In this fascinating journey from philosophy to science, Stephen S. Hall gives us a penetrating history of wisdom, from its sudden emergence in the fifth century B.C. to its modern manifestations in education, politics, and the workplace. Hall’s bracing exploration of the science of wisdom allows us to see this ancient virtue with fresh eyes, yet also makes clear that despite modern science’s most powerful efforts, wisdom continues to elude easy understanding.</description>

  <description>Why can't we solve our problems anymore? Why do threats such as the Gulf oil spill, worldwide recession, terrorism, and global warming suddenly seem unstoppable? Are there limits to the kinds of problems humans can solve?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Costa confronts--and offers a solution to--these questions in her highly anticipated and game-changing book, &lt;i&gt;The Watchman's Rattle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costa pulls headlines from today's news to demonstrate how accelerating complexity quickly outpaces that rate at which the human brain can develop new capabilities. With compelling evidenced based on research in the rise and fall of Mayan, Khmer, and Roman empires, Costa shows how the tendency to find a quick solution leads to frightening long-term consequence: Society's ability to solve its most challenging, intractable problems becomes gridlocked, progress slows, and collapse ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A provocative new voice in the tradition of thought leaders Thomas Friedman, Jared Diamond and Malcolm Gladwell, Costa reveals how we can reverse the downward spiral. Part history, part social science, part biology, &lt;i&gt;The Watchman's Rattle&lt;/i&gt; is sure to provoke, engage, and incite change.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A major new book by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and geopolitical forecaster George Friedman (&lt;i&gt;The Next 100 Years&lt;/i&gt;), with a bold thesis about coming events in Europe. This provocative work examines "flashpoints," unique geopolitical hot spots where tensions have erupted throughout history, and where conflict is due to emerge again.&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"There is a temptation, when you are around George Friedman, to treat him like a Magic 8 Ball." --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With remarkable accuracy, George Friedman has forecasted coming trends in global politics, technology, population, and culture. In &lt;i&gt;Flashpoints, &lt;/i&gt; Friedman focuses on Europe--the world's cultural and power nexus for the past five hundred years . . . until now. Analyzing the most unstable, unexpected, and fascinating borderlands of Europe and Russia--and the fault lines that have existed for centuries and have been ground zero for multiple catastrophic wars--Friedman highlights, in an unprecedentedly personal way, the flashpoints that are smoldering once again.&lt;br /&gt; The modern-day European Union was crafted in large part to minimize built-in geopolitical tensions that historically have torn it apart. As Friedman demonstrates, with a mix of rich history and cultural analysis, that design is failing. &lt;i&gt;Flashpoints&lt;/i&gt; narrates a living history of Europe and explains, with great clarity, its most volatile regions: the turbulent and ever-shifting land dividing the West from Russia (a vast area that currently includes Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania); the ancient borderland between France and Germany; and the Mediterranean, which gave rise to Judaism and Christianity and became a center of Islamic life.&lt;br /&gt; Through Friedman's seamless narrative of townspeople and rivers and villages, a clear picture of regions and countries and history begins to emerge. &lt;i&gt;Flashpoints&lt;/i&gt; is an engrossing analysis of modern-day Europe, its remarkable past, and the simmering fault lines that have awakened and will be pivotal in the near future. This is George Friedman's most timely and, ultimately, riveting book.</description>

  <description>No other book in the entire history of the world has exerted a greater influence on a larger number of people over a longer period of time than this slim volume. The spiritual cornerstone of the most populous and oldest living civilization on Earth, the "Analects" has inspired the Chinese and all the peoples of East Asia with its affirmation of a humanist ethics. As the Gospels are to Jesus, the "Analects" is the only place where we can encounter the real, living Confucius. In this gem-like translation by Simon Leys, Confucius speaks with clarity and brilliance. He emerges as a man of great passion and many enthusiasms, a man of bold action whose true vocation is politics. Confucius (551-479 B.C.) lived in an age of acute cultural and political crisis. Many of his observations mark a world sinking into violence and barbarity. Unable to obtain the leading political role he sought, he endeavored to reform society and salvage civilization through ethical debate, defining for ages to come the public mission of the intellectual.</description>

  <description>In this sixth volume of Alan Axelrod's popular CEO series, he dispenses the wisdom of a female monarch for the first time since his &lt;i&gt;Businessweek&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Elizabeth I, CEO&lt;/i&gt;. Catherine the Great traveled from Germany to Russia at only 14 years of age, and rose to become one of the most remarkable, powerful, and captivating rulers in history. Axelrod profiles this strong and beloved leader, examining her qualities of intellect, heart, and character, and distilling her words and actions into more than 100 practical and modern leadership lessons. Women, in particular, will appreciate this study of a role model—one of only two Russian tsars ever to earn the title “Great.” </description>

  <description>Thanks to Caesar, “crossing the Rubicon” has become a synonym for bold, decisive decision-making where the risks are great--but the rewards can be greater. In his popular &lt;i&gt;CEO&lt;/i&gt; series, bestselling writer Alan Axelrod analyzes Caesar as a business leader, using an engaging, conversational style to explore six inspirational principles that constitute Julius Caesar's guiding tenets. From this, Axelrod draws 92 lessons that modern business leaders should learn from this first, great, and iconic CEO.</description>

      <![CDATA[So many authors focus on "the Caesar", the larger than life character, the conquerer. Axelrod tries to focus on the man, in a balanced way, within the context of ancient Rome. What did he get right and how can it be applied to 21st Century leadership. ]]>

  <description>Following his &lt;i&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers &lt;i&gt;Elizabeth I, CE&lt;/i&gt;O and &lt;i&gt;Patton on Leadership&lt;/i&gt; comes a new and perfect subject for Alan Axelrod’s innovative format: Winston Churchill, the quintessential leader of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Churchill skillfully converted crisis into victory, making the boldest of visions seem attainable; even though he sometimes failed audaciously, he embraced his errors and used them to become stronger. Axelrod looks at this much-studied figure in a way nobody has before: he explores 25 key facets of Churchill’s leadership style and decision-making from his early years as a junior cavalry officer and journalist to his role throughout WWII and demonstrates how he was able to overcome near-impossible obstacles. Fluidly and engagingly written, each lesson is enlivened with a vivid vignette from Churchill’s life. As always, Axelrod’s penetrating analysis will instruct, inspire, and encourage those who lead business enterprises, large and small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;WALL STREET JOURNAL&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of America’s most accomplished entrepreneurs—a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business—shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Case’s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOL’s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Third Wave&lt;/i&gt;, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the “Third Wave” of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we’re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major “real world” sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and food—and in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Third Wave&lt;/i&gt; is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies—and how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age.</description>

  <description>Merlin, the wizard of Arthurian legend, has been a source of enduring fascination for centuries. In this authoritative, entertaining, and generously illustrated book, Stephen Knight traces the myth of Merlin back to its earliest roots in the early Welsh figure of Myrddin. He then follows Merlin as he is imagined and reimagined through centuries of literature and art, beginning with Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose immensely popular &lt;i&gt;History of the Kings of Britain&lt;/i&gt; (1138) transmitted the story of Merlin to Europe at large. He covers French and German as well as Anglophone elements of the myth and brings the story up to the present with discussions of a globalized Merlin who finds his way into popular literature, film, television, and New Age philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knight argues that Merlin in all his guises represents a conflict basic to Western societies-the clash between knowledge and power. While the Merlin story varies over time, the underlying structural tension remains the same whether it takes the form of bard versus lord, magician versus monarch, scientist versus capitalist, or academic versus politician. As Knight sees it, Merlin embodies the contentious duality inherent to organized societies. In tracing the applied meanings of knowledge in a range of social contexts, Knight reveals the four main stages of the Merlin myth: Wisdom (early Celtic British), Advice (medieval European), Cleverness (early modern English), and Education (worldwide since the nineteenth century). If a wizard can be captured within the pages of a book, Knight has accomplished the feat.</description>

  <description>It may be hard to believe in an era of Walmart, Citizens United, and the Koch brothers, but corporations are on the decline. The number of American companies listed on the stock market dropped by half between 1996 and 2012. In recent years we've seen some of the most storied corporations go bankrupt (General Motors, Chrysler, Eastman Kodak) or disappear entirely (Bethlehem Steel, Lehman Brothers, Borders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gerald Davis argues this is a root cause of the income inequality and social instability we face today. Corporations were once an integral part of building the middle class. He points out that in their heyday they offered millions of people lifetime employment, a stable career path, health insurance, and retirement pensions. They were like small private welfare states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The businesses that are replacing them will not fill the same role. For one thing, they employ far fewer people the combined global workforces of Facebook, Yelp, Zynga, LinkedIn, Zillow, Tableau, Zulily, and Box are smaller than the number of people who lost their jobs when Circuit City was liquidated in 2009. And in the sharing economy, companies have no obligation to most of the people who work for them at the end of 2014 Uber had over 160,000 driver-partners in the United States but recognized only about 2,000 people as actual employees. &lt;br /&gt;Davis tracks the rise of the large American corporation and the economic, social, and technological developments that have led to its decline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future could see either increasing economic polarization, as careers turn into jobs and jobs turn into tasks, or a more democratic economy built from the grass roots. It's up to us.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I come from a country that was created at midnight. When I almost died it was just after midday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Am Malala&lt;/i&gt; is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.</description>

  <description>Pulitzer Prize winner Massie offers the tale of a princess who went to Russia at 14 and became one of the most powerful women in history. Born into minor German nobility, she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant, curious mind, she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers, and reaching the throne, tried using their principles to rule the vast, backward empire. She knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time: Voltaire, Diderot, Frederick the Great, Maria Theresa of Austria, Marie Antoinette &amp;amp; John Paul Jones. Wanting to be the “benevolent despot” Montesquieu idealized, she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life, including serfdom. She persevered, and for 34 years the government, foreign policy, cultural development and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, wars &amp;amp; the tides of political change and violence inspired by the French Revolution. Her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as like the classical philosophers. She was condemned by enemies, mostly foreign, as “the Messalina of the north.” Her family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers and enemies are vividly described. These included her ambitious, scheming mother; her weak, bullying husband, Peter (who left her sexually untouched for nine years after their marriage); her unhappy son &amp;amp; heir, Paul; her beloved grandchildren; and her favorites—the young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex. Here, too, is Gregory Potemkin, her most significant lover &amp;amp; possible husband, with whom she shared a correspondence of love &amp;amp; separation, followed by 17 years of unparalleled mutual achievement. All the qualities that Massie brought to Nicholas &amp;amp; Alexandra and Peter the Great are present: historical accuracy, deep understanding, felicity of style, mastery of detail, ability to shatter myth &amp;amp; a genius for finding and expressing a human drama.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed author Anthony Everitt, whose &lt;b&gt;Augustus&lt;/b&gt; was praised by the Philadelphia Inquirer as “a narrative of sustained drama and skillful analysis,” is the rare writer whose work both informs and enthralls. In&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Hadrian and the Triumph of Rome–the first major account of the emperor in nearly a century–Everitt presents a compelling, richly researched biography of the man whom he calls arguably “the most successful of Rome’s rulers.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born in A.D. 76, Hadrian lived through and ruled during a tempestuous era, a time when the Colosseum was opened to the public and Pompeii was buried under a mountain of lava and ash. Everitt vividly recounts Hadrian’s thrilling life, in which the emperor brings a century of disorder and costly warfare to a peaceful conclusion while demonstrating how a monarchy can be compatible with good governance. Hadrian was brave and astute–despite his sometimes prickly demeanor–as well as an accomplished huntsman, poet, and student of philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What distinguished Hadrian’s rule, according to Everitt, were two insights that inevitably ensured the empire’s long and prosperous future: He ended Rome’s territorial expansion, which had become strategically and economically untenable, by fortifying her boundaries (the many famed Walls of Hadrian), and he effectively “Hellenized” Rome by anointing Athens the empire’s cultural center, thereby making Greek learning and art vastly more prominent in Roman life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With unprecedented detail, Everitt illuminates Hadrian’s private life, including his marriage to Sabina–a loveless, frequently unhappy bond that bore no heirs–and his enduring yet doomed relationship with the true love of his life, Antinous, a beautiful young Bithynian man. Everitt also covers Hadrian’s war against the Jews, which planted the seeds of present-day discord in the Middle East. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite his tremendous legacy–including a virtual “marble biography” of still-standing structures–Hadrian is considered one of Rome’s more enigmatic emperors. But making splendid use of recently discovered archaeological materials and his own exhaustive research, Everitt sheds new light on one of the most important figures of the ancient world.</description>

  <description>One of the world's most celebrated scholars, Stephen Greenblatt has crafted both an innovative work of history and a thrilling story of discovery, in which one manuscript, plucked from a thousand years of neglect, changed the course of human thought and made possible the world as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, &lt;em&gt;On the Nature of Things&lt;/em&gt;, by Lucretius—a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The copying and translation of this ancient book—the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age—fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson.</description>

  <description>The liberal arts are under attack. The governors of Florida, Texas, and North Carolina have all pledged that they will not spend taxpayer money subsidizing the liberal arts, and they seem to have an unlikely ally in President Obama. While at a General Electric plant in early 2014, Obama remarked, "I promise you, folks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree." These messages are hitting home: majors like English and history, once very popular and highly respected, are in steep decline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I get it," writes Fareed Zakaria, recalling the atmosphere in India where he grew up, which was even more obsessed with getting a skills-based education. However, the CNN host and best-selling author explains why this widely held view is mistaken and shortsighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zakaria eloquently expounds on the virtues of a liberal arts education—how to write clearly, how to express yourself convincingly, and how to think analytically. He turns our leaders' vocational argument on its head. American routine manufacturing jobs continue to get automated or outsourced, and specific vocational knowledge is often outdated within a few years. Engineering is a great profession, but key value-added skills you will also need are creativity, lateral thinking, design, communication, storytelling, and, more than anything, the ability to continually learn and enjoy learning—precisely the gifts of a liberal education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zakaria argues that technology is transforming education, opening up access to the best courses and classes in a vast variety of subjects for millions around the world. We are at the dawn of the greatest expansion of the idea of a liberal education in human history.</description>

  <description>***Updated content to coincide with the public television documentary, &lt;em&gt;In Money We Trust&lt;/em&gt;***Why a return to sound money is our only hope for a true recovery and a healthy global economyFew topics are as misunderstood today as the subject of money. Since the U.S. abandoned a gold-linked dollar more than four decades ago, the world's governments have slid into a dangerous ignorance of the fundamental monetary principles that guided the world's most successful economies for centuries. Today's wrong-headed monetary policies are now setting the stage for a new global economic and social catastrophe that could rival the recent financial crisis and even the horrors of the 1930s. Coauthored by Steve Forbes, one of the world's leading experts on finance, &lt;i&gt;Money&lt;/i&gt; shows you why that doesn't need to happen--and how to prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading this entertaining and hugely well-informed book, you will know more about money than most people in the highest government positions today. &lt;i&gt;Money&lt;/i&gt; explains why a return to sound money is absolutely essential if the U.S. and other nations are ever to overcome today's problems. Stable money, Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Ames argue, is the only way to a true recovery and a stable and prosperous economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today's system of fluctuating "fiat" money, in which governments manipulate the value of the dollar and other currencies, has been responsible for the biggest economic failures of recent decades, including the 2008 financial crisis, from whose effects we continue to suffer. The Obama/Bernanke/Yellen Federal Reserve and its unstable dollar policies are accelerating our course toward disaster, the authors show, in numerous convincing examples. In &lt;i&gt;Money&lt;/i&gt;, Forbes and Ames answer these crucial questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;What is the difference between money and value?What is real wealth?&lt;br /&gt;How does sound money contribute to a well-functioning society?&lt;br /&gt;How have our money policy errors led to the current problems in global financial markets?&lt;br /&gt;What can we do now to reestablish the strength of the dollar and other currencies?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors argue that the most effective way to return to a sound money policy and a healthy economy is to put the dollar back on a gold standard, and they outline the several different forms a gold standard could take. They also share invaluable suggestions for how to preserve our wealth and where to invest our money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Money&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading for anyone interested in this crucially important subject.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From acclaimed historian Lawrence Goldstone comes a thrilling narrative of courage, determination, and competition: the story of the intense rivalry that fueled the rise of American aviation. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The feud between this nation’s great air pioneers, the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss, was a collision of unyielding and profoundly American personalities. On one side, a pair of tenacious siblings who together had solved the centuries-old riddle of powered, heavier-than-air flight. On the other, an audacious motorcycle racer whose innovative aircraft became synonymous in the public mind with death-defying stunts. For more than a decade, they battled each other in court, at air shows, and in the newspapers. The outcome of this contest of wills would shape the course of aviation history—and take a fearsome toll on the men involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Birdmen&lt;/i&gt; sets the engrossing story of the Wrights’ war with Curtiss against the thrilling backdrop of the early years of manned flight, and is rich with period detail and larger-than-life personalities: Thomas Scott Baldwin, or “Cap’t Tom” as he styled himself, who invented the parachute and almost convinced the world that balloons were the future of aviation; John Moisant, the dapper daredevil who took to the skies after three failed attempts to overthrow the government of El Salvador, then quickly emerged as a celebrity flyer; and Harriet Quimby, the statuesque silent-film beauty who became the first woman to fly across the English Channel. And then there is Lincoln Beachey, perhaps the greatest aviator who ever lived, who dazzled crowds with an array of trademark twists and dives—and best embodied the romance with death that fueled so many of aviation’s earliest heroes.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; A dramatic story of unimaginable bravery in the air and brutal competition on the ground, &lt;i&gt;Birdmen&lt;/i&gt; is at once a thrill ride through flight’s wild early years and a surprising look at the personal clash that fueled America’s race to the skies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Birdmen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “A meticulously researched account of the first few hectic, tangled years of aviation and the curious characters who pursued it . . . a worthy companion to Richard Holmes’s marvelous history of ballooning, &lt;i&gt;Falling Upwards&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “The daredevil scientists and engineers who forged the field of aeronautics spring vividly to life in Lawrence Goldstone’s history.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “The history of the development of an integral part of the modern world and a fascinating portrayal of how a group of men and women achieved a dream that had captivated humanity for centuries.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Christian Science Monitor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Captivating and wonderfully presented . . . a fine book about these rival pioneers.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “[A] vivid story of invention, vendettas, derring-do, media hype and patent fights [with] modern resonance.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “A powerful story that contrasts soaring hopes with the anchors of ego and courtroom.”&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;—Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “A riveting narrative about the pioneering era of aeronautics in America and beyond . . . Goldstone raises questions of enduring importance regarding innovation and the indefinite exertion of control over ideas that go public.”&lt;b&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;(starred review)&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Outdoorsman, politician, patriot, soldier, bestselling author, naturalist, winner of the Medal of Honor and the Nobel Peace Prize, Theodore Roosevelt was both a consummate man of action and a prolific author. &lt;i&gt;A Passion to Lead&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of excerpts from his writings--his autobiography, memoirs such as &lt;i&gt;Rough Riders&lt;/i&gt;, speeches, articles, and letters--that bring the man to life in his own eloquent words. Along with the text are images (some never before published) that give added dimension to the man and his era.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“I wrote this book not sure I could follow the road to character, but I wanted at least to know what the road looks like and how other people have trodden it.”—David Brooks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; With the wisdom, humor, curiosity, and sharp insights that have brought millions of readers to his &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; column and his previous bestsellers, David Brooks has consistently illuminated our daily lives in surprising and original ways. In &lt;i&gt;The Social Animal,&lt;/i&gt; he explored the neuroscience of human connection and how we can flourish together. Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Road to Character, &lt;/i&gt;he focuses on the deeper values that should inform our lives. Responding to what he calls the culture of the Big Me, which emphasizes external success, Brooks challenges us, and himself, to rebalance the scales between our “résumé virtues”—achieving wealth, fame, and status—and our “eulogy virtues,” those that exist at the core of our being: kindness, bravery, honesty, or faithfulness, focusing on what kind of relationships we have formed.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Looking to some of the world’s greatest thinkers and inspiring leaders, Brooks explores how, through internal struggle and a sense of their own limitations, they have built a strong inner character. Labor activist Frances Perkins understood the need to suppress parts of herself so that she could be an instrument in a larger cause. Dwight Eisenhower organized his life not around impulsive self-expression but considered self-restraint. Dorothy Day, a devout Catholic convert and champion of the poor, learned as a young woman the vocabulary of simplicity and surrender. Civil rights pioneers A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin learned reticence and the logic of self-discipline, the need to distrust oneself even while waging a noble crusade.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Blending psychology, politics, spirituality, and confessional, &lt;i&gt;The Road to Character&lt;/i&gt; provides an opportunity for us to rethink our priorities, and strive to build rich inner lives marked by humility and moral depth.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; “Joy,” David Brooks writes, “is a byproduct experienced by people who are aiming for something else. But it comes.”</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Finalist for the 2015 &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; and McKinsey Business Book of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best business book of the week from Inc.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author of &lt;em&gt;Power,&lt;/em&gt; Stanford business school professor, and a leading management thinker offers a hard-hitting dissection of the leadership industry and ways to make workplaces and careers work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leadership enterprise is enormous, with billions of dollars, thousands of books, and hundreds of thousands of blogs and talks focused on improving leaders. But what we see worldwide is employee disengagement, high levels of leader turnover and career derailment, and failed leadership development efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Leadership BS&lt;/em&gt;, Jeffrey Pfeffer shines a bright light on the leadership industry, showing why it’s failing and how it might be remade. He sets the record straight on the oft-made prescriptions for leaders to be honest, authentic, and modest, tell the truth, build trust, and take care of others. By calling BS on so many of the stories and myths of leadership, he gives people a more scientific look at the evidence and better information to guide their careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rooted in social science, and will practical examples and advice for improving management, &lt;em&gt;Leadership BS&lt;/em&gt; encourages readers to accept the truth and then use facts to change themselves and the world for the better.</description>

  <description>As David Maraniss captures it with power and affection, Detroit summed up America’s path to music and prosperity that was already past history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s 1963 and Detroit is on top of the world. The city’s leaders are among the most visionary in America: Grandson of the first Ford; Henry Ford II; influential labor leader Walter Reuther; Motown’s founder Berry Gordy; the Reverend C.L. Franklin and his daughter, the amazing Aretha; Governor George Romney, Mormon and Civil Rights advocate; super car salesman Lee Iacocca; Mayor Jerome Cavanagh, a Kennedy acolyte; Police Commissioner George Edwards; Martin Luther King. It was the American auto makers’ best year; the revolution in music and politics was underway. Reuther’s UAW had helped lift the middle class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time was full of promise. The auto industry was selling more cars than ever before and inventing the Mustang. Motown was capturing the world with its amazing artists. The progressive labor movement was rooted in Detroit with the UAW. Martin Luther King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech there two months before he made it famous in the Washington march.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a Great City shows that the shadows of collapse were evident even then. Before the devastating riot. Before the decades of civic corruption and neglect, and white flight. Before people trotted out the grab bag of rust belt infirmities—from harsh weather to high labor costs—and competition from abroad to explain Detroit’s collapse.</description>

  <description>Renowned media scholar Sherry Turkle investigates how a flight from conversation undermines our relationships, creativity, and productivity—and why reclaiming face-to-face conversation can help us regain lost ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in a technological universe in which we are always communicating. And yet we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Preeminent author and researcher Sherry Turkle has been studying digital culture for over thirty years. Long an enthusiast for its possibilities, here she investigates a troubling consequence: at work, at home, in politics, and in love, we find ways around conversation, tempted by the possibilities of a text or an email in which we don’t have to look, listen, or reveal ourselves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We develop a taste for what mere connection offers. The dinner table falls silent as children compete with phones for their parents’ attention. Friends learn strategies to keep conversations going when only a few people are looking up from their phones. At work, we retreat to our screens although it is conversation at the water cooler that increases not only productivity but commitment to work. Online, we only want to share opinions that our followers will agree with – a politics that shies away from the real conflicts and solutions of the public square. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The case for conversation begins with the necessary conversations of solitude and self-reflection. They are endangered: these days, always connected, we see loneliness as a problem that technology should solve. Afraid of being alone, we rely on other people to give us a sense of ourselves, and our capacity for empathy and relationship suffers. We see the costs of the flight from conversation everywhere: conversation is the cornerstone for democracy and in business it is good for the bottom line. In the private sphere, it builds empathy, friendship, love, learning, and productivity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there is good news: we are resilient. Conversation cures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on five years of research and interviews in homes, schools, and the workplace, Turkle argues that we have come to a better understanding of where our technology can and cannot take us and that the time is right to reclaim conversation. The most human—and humanizing—thing that we do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The virtues of person-to-person conversation are timeless, and our most basic technology, talk, responds to our modern challenges. We have everything we need to start, we have each other.</description>

  <description>In the last few decades what it means to be rich has changed dramatically. Forget the 1%; it's the wealthiest .01% who are fast outpacing the rest of us. Today's colossal fortunes are amassed by the diligent toiling of smart, perceptive businessmen who see themselves as deserving victors in a cutthroat international competition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cracking open this tight-knit world is Chrystia Freeland, an acclaimed business journalist. At ease in Davos or Dubai, Freeland has reported on the lives and minds of these new super-elites for nearly a decade. Grounding her interviews in the economics and history of modern capitalism, she provides examples of the new wealth and its consequences. She showcases the $3 million birthday party of a New York financier months before the financial meltdown; details the closed-door 2005 SEC meeting where the US government allowed investment banks to write their own regulatory laws; and tells how the Bank of Canada's Mark Carney became a key figure in the central battle between the plutocracy and the rest of us. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brightly written and powerfully researched, Freeland's &lt;i&gt;Plutocrats &lt;/i&gt;will be a lightning rod event in the midst of the US election season.</description>

  <description>Written in Greek, without any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, the &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt; of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. &lt;br /&gt;Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus' own emotions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while the &lt;i&gt;Meditations&lt;/i&gt; were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries.</description>

  <description>Essayist, poet, and philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) propounded a transcendental idealism emphasizing self-reliance, self-culture, and individual expression. The six essays and one address included in this volume, selected from &lt;i&gt;Essays, First Series&lt;/i&gt; (1841) and &lt;i&gt;Essays, Second Series&lt;/i&gt; (1844), offer a representative sampling of his views outlining that moral idealism as well as a hint of the later skepticism that colored his thought. In addition to the celebrated title essay, the others included here are "History," "Friendship," "The Over-Soul," "The Poet," and "Experience," plus the well-known and frequently read Harvard Divinity School Address.</description>

  <description>American manufacturing is on life support—at least, that’s what most people think. The exodus of jobs to China and other foreign markets is irreversible, and anything that is built here requires specialized skills the average worker couldn’t hope to gain. Not so, says Dan Dimicco, chairman and former CEO of Nucor, America’s largest steel company. He not only revived a major US manufacturing firm during a recession, but helped galvanize the flagging domestic steel industry when many of his competitors were in bankruptcy or headed overseas. In &lt;i&gt;American Made&lt;/i&gt;, he takes to task the politicians, academics, and political pundits who, he contends, are exacerbating fears and avoiding simple solutions for the sake of nothing more than their own careers, and contrasts them with the postwar leaders who rebuilt Europe and Japan, put a man on the moon, and kept communism at bay. We need leaders of such resolve today, he argues, who can tackle a broken job-creation engine by restoring manufacturing to its central role in the U.S. economy—and cease creating fictitious “service businesses” where jobs evaporate after a year or two, as in a Ponzi scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his trademark bluntness, Dimicco tackles the false promise of green jobs and the hidden costs of outsourcing. Along the way, he shares the lessons he’s learned about good leadership, crisis management, and the true meaning of innovation, and maps the road back to robust economic growth, middle-class prosperity, and American competitiveness.</description>

  <description>An order of warrior monks founded after the First Crusade to protect pilgrims to Jerusalem, the Templars developed into one of the wealthiest and most powerful bodies in the medieval world. Yet two centuries later, the Knights were suddenly arrested and accused of blasphemy, heresy and orgies, their order was abolished, and their leaders burnt at the stake. Their dramatic end shocked their contemporaries and has gripped peoples' imaginations ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new book explains the whole context of Templar history, including, for the first time, the new evidence discovered by the Vatican that the Templars were not guilty of heresy. It covers the whole swathe of Templar history, from its origins in the mysteries of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem through to the nineteenth century development of the Freemasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book also features a guide to Templar castles and sites, and coverage of the Templars in books, movies and popular culture, from Indiana Jones to the Xbox360 game Assassin's Creed.</description>

  <description>In this eye-opening account, Cal Newport debunks the long-held belief that "follow your passion" is good advice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the cliché flawed-preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work-but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to "be so good they can't ignore you," Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So Good They Can't Ignore You&lt;/i&gt; will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.</description>

  <description>Mark Twain's autobiography is a classic of American letters, to be ranked with the autobiographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Adams.... It has the marks of greatness in it--style, scope, imagination, laughter, tragedy."--From the Introduction by Charles Neider&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Twain was a figure larger than life: massive in talent, eruptive in temperament, unpredictable in his actions. He crafted stories of heroism, adventure, tragedy, and comedy that reflected the changing America of the time, and he tells his own story--which includes sixteen pages of photos--with the same flair he brought to his fiction. Writing this autobiography on his deathbed, Twain vowed to he "free and frank and unembarrassed" in the recounting of his life and his experiences. Twain was more than a match for the expanding America of riverboats, gold rushes, and the vast westward movement, which provided the material for his novels and which served to inspire this beloved and uniquely American autobiography.</description>

  <description>Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focusing on "disruptive technology" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel's 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss "the next great wave." Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, "The Innovator's Dilemma" presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.</description>

  <description>The computer and the internet are among the most important innovations of our era, but few people know who created them. They were not conjured up in a garret or garage by solo inventors suitable to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell, and Morse. Instead, most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively. There were a lot of fascinating people involved, some ingenious and a few even geniuses. This is the story of these pioneers, hackers, inventors, and entrepreneurs—who they were, how their minds worked, and what made them so creative. It’s also a narrative of how they collaborated and why their ability to work as teams made them even more creative.”</description>

  <description>An engrossing biography of the longest-reigning female pharaoh in Ancient Egypt and the story of her audacious rise to power in a man’s world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hatshepsut, the daughter of a general who took Egypt's throne without status as a king’s son and a mother with ties to the previous dynasty, was born into a privileged position of the royal household. Married to her brother, she was expected to bear the sons who would legitimize the reign of her father’s family. Her failure to produce a male heir was ultimately the twist of fate that paved the way for her inconceivable rule as a cross-dressing king. At just twenty, Hatshepsut ascended to the rank of king in an elaborate coronation ceremony that set the tone for her spectacular twenty-two year reign as co-regent with Thutmose III, the infant king whose mother Hatshepsut out-maneuvered for a seat on the throne. Hatshepsut was a master strategist, cloaking her political power plays with the veil of piety and sexual expression. Just as women today face obstacles from a society that equates authority with masculinity, Hatshepsut had to shrewdly operate the levers of a patriarchal system to emerge as Egypt's second female pharaoh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hatshepsut had successfully negotiated a path from the royal nursery to the very pinnacle of authority, and her reign saw one of Ancient Egypt’s most prolific building periods. Scholars have long speculated as to why her images were destroyed within a few decades of her death, all but erasing evidence of her rule. Constructing a rich narrative history using the artifacts that remain, noted Egyptologist Kara Cooney offers a remarkable interpretation of how Hatshepsut rapidly but methodically consolidated power—and why she fell from public favor just as quickly. The Woman Who Would Be King traces the unconventional life of an almost-forgotten pharaoh and explores our complicated reactions to women in power.</description>

  <description>Since the latter part of the century just past, Stanley Bing has been exploring the relationship between authority and madness. In one bestselling book after another, reporting from his hot-seat as an insider in a world-renowned multinational corporation, he has tried to understand the inner workings of those who lead us and to inquire why they seem to be powered, much of the time, by demons that make them obnoxious and dangerous, even to themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;What Would Machiavelli Do?&lt;/em&gt;, Bing looked at the issue of why mean people do better than nice people, and found that in their particular form of insanity lay incredible power. In &lt;em&gt;Throwing the Elephant: Zen and the Art of Managing Up&lt;/em&gt;, he offered a spiritual path toward managing the unruly executive beast. And in &lt;em&gt;Sun Tzu Was a Sissy&lt;/em&gt;, he taught us how to become one of them, and wage war on the playing field that ends in a dream home in Cabo. Now he returns to his roots to offer the last word on the entity that shapes our lives and stomps through—and on—our dreams: The Crazy Boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students of Bing—and there are many, secreted inside tortured organizations, yearning for blunt instruments with which to fight—will note that he has walked this ground before, looking for answers. In 1992, he published the first edition of &lt;em&gt;Crazy Bosses&lt;/em&gt;, which was fine, as far as it went. Now, some 15 years and several dozen insane bosses later, he has updated and rethought much of the work. Back in the last century, Bing was a small, trembling creature, looking up at those who made his life miserable and analyzing the mental illness that gave them their power. Today, while still trembling much of the time, he is in fact one of those people his prior work has warned us against. His own hard-won wisdom and now institutionalized dementia make this new edition completely fresh and indispensable to anyone who works for somebody else or lives with somebody else, or would like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Bing is back on his home turf in this funny, true, and essential book, peering with his keen and frosty eye at the crazy boss in all his guises: the Bully, the Paranoid, the Narcissist, the Wimp, and the self-destructive Disaster Hunter. If you loved the original, classic &lt;em&gt;Crazy Bosses&lt;/em&gt;, you'll be thrilled to plunge back into the new, refurbished pool. If you are new to the book, strap yourself in: it's going to be a crazy ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Master the many styles of Wing Chun Kung Fu with this expert martial arts guide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the fame of Bruce Lee, the conditions in Hong Kong, and the hard work and effort of many of his classmates, the Wing Chun of the late master Yip Man became one of the most well-known and popular Chinese martial arts in the world. Although this gave Wing Chun international recognition, it also led to a lot of misconceptions. Due to a lack of authentic information, many mistakenly came to assume that the renowned Yip Man was the sole inheritor of the style and that his Wing Chun was the lone version of the art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, there are several different and distinct systems of Wing Chun. Unfortunately, over the years most of these systems have remained unseen or unreported to all but a few—until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Profusely illustrated with over 300 historical photographs, &lt;i&gt;Complete Wing Chun: The Definitive Guide to Wing Chun's History and Traditions&lt;/i&gt; presents seldom seen information on a dozen branches of the Wing Chun art. It offers the reader side-by-side comparison of these arts by outlining each system in terms of Wing Chun history, principles, basics, and training methods:&lt;br /&gt;Yip Man Wing Chun&lt;br /&gt;Yuen Kay-San Wing Chun Kuen&lt;br /&gt;Gu Lao Wing Chun Kuen&lt;br /&gt;Nanyang Wing Chun Kuen&lt;br /&gt;Pan Nam Wing Chun Kuen&lt;br /&gt;Pao Fa Lien Wing Chun Kuen&lt;br /&gt;Hung Suen Wing Chun Kuen&lt;br /&gt;and more!</description>

  <description>Over the last half-billion years, there have been five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In prose that is at once frank, entertaining, and deeply informed, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; writer Elizabeth Kolbert tells us why and how human beings have altered life on the planet in a way no species has before. Interweaving research in half a dozen disciplines, descriptions of the fascinating species that have already been lost, and the history of extinction as a concept, Kolbert provides a moving and comprehensive account of the disappearances occurring before our very eyes. She shows that the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy, compelling us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.</description>

  <description>Our brains are marvels, hard-wired by millions of years of evolution to boast a number of mental shortcuts, biases, and tricks that allow us to negotiate our complicated lives without overthinking every choice and decision we have to make. Unfortunately, those ancient shortcuts don't always work to our advantage in our modern lives-when we don't also think slowly and rationally, those hard-wired habits can trip us up. This intriguing book helps us to understand how our minds are predisposed to think about the world-and how to avoid many of life's common mistakes.Among the surprising examples of these mental habits at work in our lives:-Experienced skiers make fatal mistakes on familiar terrain more often than less experienced ones.-Ninety-nine point nine percent of the citizens of France are registered organ donors, but only 28 percent of Americans are.-Early birds on jury duty are more likely to succumb to racial stereotypes in delivering verdicts when the day gets late.-People who are hungry for lunch will donate less money to charity.Wray Herbert introduces us to twenty of these shortcuts and biases, explaining how they affect us in the real world and how they're being studied in labs around the world.</description>

  <description>A prescient financial analyst predicts the next economic iceberg and explains how all of us can steer clear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Great Recession was just the beginning, according to sought-after analyst Eric Janszen; if we remain on the current course, an even bigger catastrophe is imminent. Inclined to disbelieve him? He predicted the last two busts well before they happened. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our problems, according to Janszen, are rooted in the flaws of the debt-driven FIRE economy (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate), which dwarfs, and is coming close to extinguishing, America's "Productive Economy"-the making and selling of real things. The government's tried-and-true methods of currency depreciation, tax and interest rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus won't cut it this time around. The only way out is to change our fundamental approach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The solution? Use private and public monies to develop major, for-profit infrastructure projects in transportation, energy, and communications. These projects will spark employment and growth, reduce America's dependence on foreign energy and our foreign debt, and improve the efficiency of the economy for decades to come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With a startling grasp of the complex factors at play, Janszen cuts through the rhetoric to get at the heart of our recent financial woes. This thought- provoking book shows how political failures have impeded our country's economic progress and offers solutions for a more sustainable and stable economic future.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the celebrated corporate satirist, a tongue-in-cheek curriculum-with real world case studies-for the young entreprenuer looking to stay out of debt and save thousands of dollars spent on traditional business school&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past decade, students across America have become slaves to debt, paying thousands upon thousands of dollars for the privilege of a college degree. For those considering grad school, Stanley Bing says save your money. With The Curriculum, the preeminent business anthropologist of the age offers the most comprehensive, useful, and inexpensive Master of Business Administration curriculum in the history of the discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bing's core curriculum and extensive elective courses provide any aspiring entrepreneur with the knowledge and know-how he needs to get ahead without spending $100K and wasting two years in boring classrooms with academics out of touch with the real world. The Curriculum is based on actual workplace experience and interviews with seasoned business leaders who offer pungent, relevant information, insight, and wisdom students can really use. In addition, students can log onto a companion website where they can file exams, answer essay questions, and meet a community of like-minded thinkers eager to acquire the practical knowledge and essential skills they actually need to succeed.</description>

  <description>In this age of an open Internet, it is easy to forget that every American information industry, beginning with the telephone, has eventually been taken captive by some ruthless monopoly or cartel. With all our media now traveling a single network, an unprecedented potential is building for centralized control over what Americans see and hear. Could history repeat itself with the next industrial consolidation? Could the Internet—the entire flow of American information—come to be ruled by one corporate leviathan in possession of “the master switch”? That is the big question of Tim Wu’s pathbreaking book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Wu’s sweeping history shows, each of the new media of the twentieth century—radio, telephone, television, and film—was born free and open. Each invited unrestricted use and enterprising experiment until some would-be mogul battled his way to total domination. Here are stories of an uncommon will to power, the power over information: Adolph Zukor, who took a technology once used as commonly as YouTube is today and made it the exclusive prerogative of a kingdom called Hollywood . . . NBC’s founder, David Sarnoff, who, to save his broadcast empire from disruptive visionaries, bullied one inventor (of electronic television) into alcoholic despair and another (this one of FM radio, and his boyhood friend) into suicide . . . And foremost, Theodore Vail, founder of the Bell System, the greatest information empire of all time, and a capitalist whose faith in Soviet-style central planning set the course of every information industry thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explaining how invention begets industry and industry begets empire—a progress often blessed by government, typically with stifling consequences for free expression and technical innovation alike—Wu identifies a time-honored pattern in the maneuvers of today’s great information powers: Apple, Google, and an eerily resurgent AT&amp;amp;T. A battle royal looms for the Internet’s future, and with almost every aspect of our lives now dependent on that network, this is one war we dare not tune out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part industrial exposé, part meditation on what freedom requires in the information age, &lt;i&gt;The Master Switch&lt;/i&gt; is a stirring illumination of a drama that has played out over decades in the shadows of our national life and now culminates with terrifying implications for our future.</description>

  <description>In this beautifully illustrated offering of ancient wisdom, Deng Ming-Dao shares the secrets of the spiritual path handed down to him by Kwan Saihung, his Taoist master, as well as by herbalists, martial artists, and other practitioners of the ancient arts. Deng shows how Taoist philosophy and practice may be integrated into contemporary Western lifestyles for complete physical, mental, and spiritual health. He provides an abundance of philosophical and practical information about hygiene, diet, sexuality, physical exercise, meditation, medicine, finding one's purpose in life, finding the right teacher, death, and transcendence.</description>

  <description>For the first time in English, &lt;em&gt;The Essence of Aikido&lt;/em&gt; presents the profound philosophy of Aikido in Morihei's own words, disclosing many of the arcane secrets of Aikido's aims and methods. Considered by many to be the greatest martial artist and spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, Morihei provides a wealth of clues to the often puzzling nature of the inseparable link between the physical and spiritual aspects of Aikido, revealing the heart of the peaceful warrior's art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elegantly translated and compiled by John Stevens, translator of Morihei's &lt;em&gt;Budo&lt;/em&gt;, the first half of &lt;em&gt;The Essence of Aikido&lt;/em&gt; presents the most comprehensive collection of the writings of Morihei Ueshiba ever published. Key concepts in Aikido philosophy, such as kototama (language of the spirit) and misogi (purification of body and mind) are discussed at length, profusely illustrated with Morihei's mystical diagrams, spiritual poems, and fascinating calligraphy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Morihei, techniques were the means to express the spiritual principles of Aikido, and in the second half of &lt;em&gt;The Essence of Aikido&lt;/em&gt;, John Stevens focuses on Morihei's techniques. Over two hundred hitherto unpublished photos of Morihei in action from his earliest days as a teacher of the martial arts to his last years as a master of Aikido complete this detailed survey of the true nature of Aikido.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major contribution to a field that until recently has remained elusive to Western readers, &lt;em&gt;The Essence of Aikido&lt;/em&gt; is an inspiring study of the spiritual and physical elements in Aikido, providing an important resource for martial arts practitioners and philosophy students alike.</description>

  <description>For centuries, Western science and many Western cultures have taught us to think of ourselves as individuals. But today, a revolutionary new understanding is emerging from the laboratories of the most cutting-edge physicists, biologists, and psychologists: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What matters is not the isolated entity, but the space between things, the relationship of things. The Bond.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By international bestselling author Lynne McTaggart&lt;i&gt;, The Bond &lt;/i&gt;is the culmination of her groundbreaking work. It offers a completely new, scientific story of life and the human experience, one that challenges the very way we conceive of ourselves and our world. &lt;i&gt;The Bond &lt;/i&gt;shows that the essential impulse of all life is a &lt;i&gt;will to connect &lt;/i&gt;rather than a drive to compete. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, we are inescapably connected, hardwired to each other at our most elemental level—from cells to whole societies. The desire to help others is so necessary that we experience it as one of our chief pleasures, as essential as eating and having sex, and we succeed and prosper only when we see ourselves as part of a greater whole. Every conflict that occurs—whether between husband and wife, social or racial groups, or nations—is resolved only when we can fully see and embrace the space—the bond—between us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McTaggart offers detailed recommendations to help foster more holistic thinking, more cooperative relationships, and more unified social groups. Blending interviews and human stories into an absorbing narrative, she shows how: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• A simple daily practice conditions the brain to enable you to become more empathetic toward others &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• A new way of speaking and listening can overcome polarization, helping the staunchest of enemies to become close friends &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• People who fire together wire together: Whenever a group works together for a common goal, the brains of all parties begin to get on the same wavelength, strengthening the bond within the group &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Fairness is more powerful than unfairness: A small group of individuals committed to strong reciprocity can “invade” a population of self-interested individuals and create a fairer society &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bond &lt;/i&gt;offers a breathtaking, visionary plan for a new way to live, in harmony with our true nature and with each other, and a new way to heal our relationships, our neighborhoods, and our world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the multimillion-copy bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/i&gt;, hailed as the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century, &lt;i&gt;The 3rd Alternative&lt;/i&gt; introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many methods of “conflict resolution,” but most involve compromise, a low-level accommodation that stops the fight without breaking through to new and innovative results. &lt;i&gt;The 3rd Alternative&lt;/i&gt; introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving, transcending traditional solutions to conflict by forging a path toward a third option. A third alternative moves beyond your way or my way to a higher and better way—one that allows both parties to emerge from debate or even heated conflict in a far better place than either had envisioned. With the third alternative, &lt;i&gt;nobody &lt;/i&gt;has to give up anything, and &lt;i&gt;everyone &lt;/i&gt;wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through key examples and stories from his work as a consultant, Covey demonstrates the power of 3rd Alternative thinking. His wide-ranging examples include a Canadian metropolitan police force that transformed a crime-plagued community; a judge who brought a quick, peaceful end to one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in American history without setting foot in a courtroom; the principal of a high school for children of migrant workers who raised their graduation rate from 30 percent to 90 percent; a handful of little-known people who are quietly finding new ways to bring peace to the Middle East; and many others. These various groups and individuals offer living examples of how to create new and better results instead of escalating conflict, as well as how to build strong relationships based on an attitude of winning together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond conflict and compromise, &lt;i&gt;The 3rd Alternative&lt;/i&gt; unveils a radical, creative new way of thinking.</description>

  <description>If you've ever thought, "There must be more to life than this," "The Art of Non-Conformity" is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on Chris Guillebeau's popular online manifesto "A Brief Guide to World Domination," "The Art of Non-Conformity" defies common assumptions about life and work while arming you with the tools to live differently. You'll discover how to live on your own terms by exploring creative self-employment, radical goal-setting, contrarian travel, and embracing life as a constant adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired and guided by Chris's own story and those of others who have pursued unconventional lives, you can devise your own plan for world domination-and make the world a better place at the same time.</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors and renowned leadership consultants Adrian Gostick and Chester Elton comes a groundbreaking guide to building high-performance teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the true driver of a thriving organization’s exceptional success? Is it a genius leader? An iron-clad business plan? Gostick and Elton shatter these preconceptions of corporate achievement. Their research shows that breakthrough success is guided by a particular breed of high-performing team that generates its own momentum—an engaged group of colleagues in the trenches, working passionately together to pursue a shared vision. Their research also shows that only 20 percent of teams are working anywhere near this optimal capacity. How can your team become one of them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Based on a groundbreaking 350,000-person study by the Best Companies Group, as well as extraordinary research into exceptional teams at leading companies, including Zappos.com, Pepsi Beverages Company, and Madison Square Garden, the authors have determined a key set of characteristics displayed by members of breakthrough teams, and have identified a set of rules great teams live by, which generate a culture of positive teamwork and lead to extraordinary results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Using a wealth of specific stories from the breakthrough teams they studied, they reveal in detail how these teams operate and how managers can transform their own teams into such high performers by fostering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Stronger clarity of goals&lt;br /&gt; -Greater trust among team members&lt;br /&gt; -More open and honest dialogue&lt;br /&gt; -Stronger accountability for all team members&lt;br /&gt; -Purpose-based recognition of team members’ contributions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The remarkable stories they tell about these teams in action provide a simple and powerful step-by-step guide to taking your team to the breakthrough level, igniting the passion and vision to bring about an Orange Revolution.</description>

  <description>In I'M HERE TO WIN, Chris "Macca" McCormack opens his playbook and reveals everything it takes-mind, body, and spirit-to become a champion. Now he shares the story of his triumphs and the never-say-die dedication that has made him the world's most successful triathlete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2010, at the age of 37, Macca beat the odds and won the Ford Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii for a second time in what many called the most dramatic finish in the race's history. Macca's journey to athletic greatness is more than just one of physical perseverance. After coming in fourth in Hawaii in 2009, Macca returned to the island on a mission: He was there to win. A game plan containing a new strategic approach to winning brought him first across the finish line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris McCormack has dedicated his life to training for-and winning-the Ironman Hawaii, one of the most grueling tests of mental and physical endurance in the world. The race challenges athletes to swim 2.4 miles, bike 112 miles, and run a full marathon, 26.2 miles, using all their strength and willpower to overcome the incredibly harsh conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In I'M HERE TO WIN Macca provides concrete training advice for everyone-from weekend warriors who casually compete to seasoned veterans who race every week to armchair athletes looking for an extra push-and provides insight into the mind of a great champion with excitement and inspiration on every page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'M HERE TO WIN is also available as an enhanced e-book with embedded video and audio.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Harness the Power of TR's Charisma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theodore Roosevelt was a leader of uncommon strength who, through the sheer force of his extraordinary will, turned America into a modern world power. Thrown headfirst into the presidency by the assassination of his predecessor, he led with courage, character, and vision in the face of overwhelming challenges, whether busting corporate trusts or building the Panama Canal. Roosevelt has been a hero to millions of Americans for over a century and is a splendid model to help you master today's turbulent marketplace and be a hero and a leader in your own organization.</description>

  <description>Harvey Mackay, Doris Christopher, Pete Dawkins, Clay Jones and John Pappajohn know that the answer to how you recover from career toppling adversity, and then go on to achieve pinnacles of success lies in firsthand knowledge of “the adversity paradox”. They all attest to having found that the knowledge they gained from overcoming adversity played such a crucial role in their success trajectories, they now consider adversity a friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While many motivational business books promise easy access to prosperity and power by way of secret insight, quick and easy steps, or “insider tips” that are dubious at best, &lt;i&gt;The Adversity Paradox &lt;/i&gt;tells it straight and offers no secret formula or silver bullet; instead it offers candid accounts from those whose skills, resourcefulness, and confidence have been tested by adversity and who have put their misfortunes to good use by gaining invaluable business lessons from them. The paths to success are diverse, but &lt;i&gt;The Adversity Paradox &lt;/i&gt;identifies patterns that anyone can study and learn from. Business people working to overcome humble beginnings, lack of knowledge, unexpected setbacks, or any manner of misfortune may find the greatest tool for creating business success lies in this new book.</description>

  <description>"The vertical farm is a world-changing innovation whose time has come. Dickson Despommier's visionary book provides a blueprint for securing the world's food supply and at the same time solving one of the gravest environmental crises facing us today."--Sting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a world where every town has their own local food source, grown in the safest way possible, where no drop of water or particle of light is wasted, and where a simple elevator ride can transport you to nature's grocery store - imagine the world of the vertical farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Columbia professor Dickson Despommier set out to solve America's food, water, and energy crises, he didn't just think big - he thought &lt;i&gt;up. &lt;/i&gt;Despommier's stroke of genius, the vertical farm, has excited scientists, architects, and politicians around the globe. Now, in this groundbreaking book, Despommier explains how the vertical farm will have an incredible impact on changing the face of this planet for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despommier takes readers on an incredible journey inside the vertical farm, buildings filled with fruits and vegetables that will provide local food sources for entire cities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vertical farms will allow us to:&lt;br /&gt;- Grow food 24 hours a day, 365 days a year&lt;br /&gt;- Protect crops from unpredictable and harmful weather&lt;br /&gt;- Re-use water collected from the indoor environment&lt;br /&gt;- Provide jobs for residents&lt;br /&gt;- Eliminate use of pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides&lt;br /&gt;- Drastically reduce dependence on fossil fuels&lt;br /&gt;- Prevent crop loss due to shipping or storage&lt;br /&gt;- Stop agricultural runoff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vertical farms can be built in abandoned buildings and on deserted lots, transforming our cities into urban landscapes which will provide fresh food grown and harvested just around the corner. Possibly the most important aspect of vertical farms is that they can built by nations with little or no arable land, transforming nations which are currently unable to farm into top food producers. In the tradition of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;The World Without Us&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Vertical Farm &lt;/i&gt;is a completely original landmark work destined to become an instant classic</description>

  <description>The former Senior Vice President of Apple Computer and close colleague of Steve Jobs’s throughout his tenure, Jay Elliot takes listeners on a remarkable tour through Jobs’s astonishing career. From the inception of game-changing products like the Apple II and the Macintosh, to his stunning fall from grace, and on to his rebirth at the helm of Apple, his involvement with Pixar, and the development of the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and much more, The Steve Jobs Way presents real-life examples of Jobs’s leadership challenges and triumphs, showing readers how to apply these principles to their own lives and careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with exclusive interviews from key figures in Apple Computer’s history, this revealing account provides a rarely seen, intimate glimpse into the Steve Jobs you won’t see on stage, thoroughly exploring his management and leadership principles. From product development meetings to design labs, through executive boardroom showdowns to the world outside of Silicon Valley, you will see the real Steve Jobs, the “Boy Genius” who forever transformed technology and the way we work, play, consume, and communicate — all through the eyes of someone who worked side by side with Jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Fascinating work that both validates the Jobs/Apple mystique while demystifying it at the same time! Great [book] for all of us working to keep our visions married to the details.”&lt;br /&gt;—David Allen, author of the international bestseller Getting Things Done</description>

  <description>What makes us happy? It's not wealth, youth, beauty, or intelligence, says Dan Buettner. In fact, most of us have the keys within our grasp. Circling the globe to study the world's happiest populations, Buettner has spotted several common principles that can unlock the doors to true contentment with our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with leading researchers, Buettner identifies the happiest region on each of four continents. He explores why these populations say they are happier than anyone else, and what they can teach the rest of us about finding contentment. His conclusions debunk some commonly believed myths: Are people who have children happier than those who don't? Not necessarily--in Western societies, parenthood actually makes the happiness level drop. Is gender equality a factor? Are the world's happiest places to be found on tropical islands with beautiful beaches? You may be surprised at what Buettner's research indicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unraveling the story of each "hotspot" like a good mystery, Buettner reveals how he discovered each location and then travels to meet folks who embody each particular brand of happiness. He introduces content, thriving people in Denmark, in Singapore, in northeastern Mexico, and in a composite "happiest place in America." In addition, he interviews economists, psychologists, sociologists, politicians, writers, and other experts to get at what contributes to each region's happiness, from the Danish concept of hygge, which translates to creating a feeling of coziness, to the Mexican love of a good joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buettner's findings result in a credible, cross-cultural formula and a practical plan to help us stack the deck for happiness and get more satisfaction out of life. According to Buettner's advisory team, the average person can control about forty percent of his or her individual happiness by optimizing life choices. These aren't unreasonable demands on a person's lifestyle, and they often require only slight changes. They fall into three categories that make up the way we live our lives: the food we eat, the way we exercise, and the social networks we foster. It's all about nourishing the body and the spirit. Heeding the secrets of the world's happiness all-stars can help us make the right choices to find more contentment in our own lives and learn how to thrive.</description>

  <description>“Conventional analysis suffers from a profound failure of imagination. It imagines passing clouds to be permanent and is blind to powerful, long-term shifts taking place in full view of the world.” —George Friedman&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited and provocative new book, George Friedman turns his eye on the future—offering a lucid, highly readable forecast of the changes we can expect around the world during the twenty-first century. He explains where and why future wars will erupt (and how they will be fought), which nations will gain and lose economic and political power, and how new technologies and cultural trends will alter the way we live in the new century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Next 100 Years &lt;/i&gt;draws on a fascinating exploration of history and geopolitical patterns dating back hundreds of years. Friedman shows that we are now, for the first time in half a millennium, at the dawn of a new era—with changes in store, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The U.S.-Jihadist war will conclude—replaced by a second full-blown cold war with Russia.&lt;br /&gt;• China will undergo a major extended internal crisis, and Mexico will emerge as an important world power.&lt;br /&gt;• A new global war will unfold toward the middle of the century between the United States and an unexpected coalition from Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Far East; but armies will be much smaller and wars will be less deadly.&lt;br /&gt;• Technology will focus on space—both for major military uses and for a dramatic new energy resource that will have radical environmental implications.&lt;br /&gt;• The United States will experience a Golden Age in the second half of the century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with the keen insight and thoughtful analysis that has made George Friedman a renowned expert in geopolitics and forecasting, &lt;i&gt;The Next 100 Years&lt;/i&gt; presents a fascinating picture of what lies ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For continual, updated analysis and supplemental material, go to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.Stratfor.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.Stratfor.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Master the ancient samurai art of iaijutsu with this expert martial arts guide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Japanese, the sword is a spiritual weapon, possessed of a kind of divinity, a self reflective of the soul of its maker, owner, and user. Around its mystical powers has grown a centuries-old ritual and a fascinating, intricate discipline. This unique guide unlocks the mysteries of this ancient ritual practice, explaining the history and significance of swords in the samurai culture, and documenting the techniques of swordsmanship, as no other book in English does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;IAI: The Art of Drawing the Sword&lt;/i&gt; is a thorough examination of the traditional Japanese martial art of iaijutsu. Included in this volume are introductions to sword care and selection; general etiquette and the training uniform and gear; proper basic sword procedure; sword techniques and drills for practice and demonstrations; kata; and sword testing; as well as the story of the Chushingura (the 47 Ronin). Generously illustrated with black and white photographs and line drawings, &lt;i&gt;IAI: The Art of Drawing the Sword&lt;/i&gt; is a storehouse of information for both the aspiring student and the experienced swordsman.</description>

  <description>Chinese peasants chafed against the foreign technologies and ideas that the imperialists introduced. Then a new movement-mystical, materialistic, and virulently anti-Christian-began to spread among them like wildfire. The foreigners laughed at the peasants' martial-arts routines and nicknamed them "the Boxers"-never imagining that the group, with the backing of China's empress dowager, would soon terrorize the world...This acclaimed account of the Boxer Rebellion, by an Oxford-trained historian, is an important new addition to every shelf of high-quality, highly accessible history.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;Bukoden&lt;/i&gt; is one of the earliest records on Miyamoto Musashi still in existence. It was completed in 1755 by Toyoda Masanaga, senior retainer to the Nagaoka, a clan closely involved in the events of Musashi's later life. Masanaga's work ranks with the Bushû denraiki as one of the most reliable records of Musashi's life and exploits outside those from the hand of the master swordsman himself. Now, for the first time in two-and-a-half centuries, Masanaga's insight into this enigmatic and solitary swordsman is available to the English reader. It throws a new and refreshing light on many aspects of especially Musashi's later life—his adoption of Iori, his return to Kyushu in 1634, and of course the gestation of his great work on the philosophy and art of Japanese swordsmanship, the &lt;i&gt;Book of Five Rings&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>The Bushu denraiki is the earliest record on Miyamoto Musashi still in existence. Completed in 1727 by Tachibana Minehide, the fifth generation master of Musashi's Niten Ichi school of fencing, it is the most reliable record of Musashi's life and exploits outside those from the hand of the master swordsman himself. Now, after three centuries, Minehide's insight into this enigmatic and solitary swordsman are available to the English reader. His text throws a new and refreshing light on many aspects of especially Musashi's early life—his troubled relations with his father, his first battle experience during Japan's period of unification, the sad death of his illegitimate child, and of course his legendary duel on Ganryû island. For those interested in the sword culture of Japan, this true story of its most iconic figure is essential reading.</description>

  <description>Chuang Tzu (&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/149093.Zhuangzi" title="Zhuangzi" rel="nofollow"&gt;Zhuangzi&lt;/a&gt;, 369?–286? B.C.) was a leading thinker representing the Taoist strain in Chinese thought. Using parable and anecdote, allegory and paradox, he set forth the early ides of what was to become the Taoist school. Central in these is the belief that only by understanding Tao (the Way of Nature) and dwelling in its unity can man achieve true happiness and be truly free, in both life and death. Witty and imaginative, enriched by brilliant imagery, making sportive use of both mythlogical and historical personages (including even Confucius), the book which bears Chuang Tzu's name has for centuries been savored by Chinese readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This translation, by Burton Watson, of Chuang Tzu's basic writings includes the seven "inner chapters," which form the heart of the book, three of the "outer chapters," and one of the "miscellaneous chapters." An introduction places the philosopher in relation to Chinese history and thought.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;–bestselling sequel to &lt;i&gt;The 48 Laws of Power&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastery&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes the years of research Robert Greene conducted while writing the international bestsellers &lt;i&gt;The 48 Laws of Power&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The 33 Strategies of War&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Art of Seduction&lt;/i&gt; and demonstrates that the ultimate form of power is mastery itself. By analyzing the lives of such past masters as Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Leonard da Vinci, as well as by interviewing nine contemporary masters, including tech guru Paul Graham and animal rights advocate Temple Grandin, Greene debunks our culture’s many myths about genius and distills the wisdom of the ages to reveal the secret to greatness. With this seminal text as a guide, readers will learn how to unlock the passion within and become masters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The themes, ideas, and images generated by the martial arts have found their way in myriad forms into the minds of millions of westerners over the past few decades--from the films of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan to the traditions of Asian meditation and exercise. At the same time that a wide spectrum of people have a passing familiarity with the martial arts, the topic is also one that is subject to wide misunderstanding and misinterpretation. The Overlook Martial Arts Reader is an in-depth anthology and analysis of the fundamental writings--both ancient and modern--that demonstrates exactly why the martial arts exert such a powerful hold on the western imagination. John Donohue, a world-renowned scholar in the Asian martial arts, and a black belt in both karate and karatedo, provides penetrating and insightful commentary on the selections he has gathered for this volume--the core writings that martial arts masters regard as the backbone and underpinning of their training and technique. With highlights ranging from Lao Tzu on the Taoist principles of striving for the "natural" to Musashi's classic writings on swordsmanship and discipline in the heat of attack; from Issai Chozen on the pinnacle of martial skill development to modern masters and apprentices such as Dave Lowry, Robert W. Smith, and Nicklaus Suino, The Overlook Martial Arts Reader is the one book absolutely every serious student of the martial arts and Asian culture must have.</description>

  <description>Thunderbolts of the Hell Hawks - 365th Fighter-Bomber Group in Words, Pictures and Illustrations - Ninth Air Force P-47 units have been long overlooked, despite their significant contribution to victory in WWII. Their war was close to the ground, dive-bombing and strafing in support of the US Army at the Normandy landings, and in the race across France, Belgium and Germany. "Thunderbolts of the Hell Hawks" is a new book offering a personal view of one of the most decorated and effective P-47 units in the Ninth Air Force. This rich visual account of the 365th Fighter-Bomber Group, the "Hell Hawks", is presented in 320 pages with over 500 photos, most published for the first time. The book also features 98 thoroughly researched and detailed color profiles of their Thunderbolts, illustrated by Don Barnes. All but three of the aircraft profiled have languished in obscurity for the past 65 years, brought to light for the first time here.</description>

  <description>Agincourt is one of the epic battles of history. It was fought by two badly matched armies that met in atrocious conditions on St Crispin's Day 1415, and resulted in an extraordinary victory that was celebrated in England long before Shakespeare immortalised it in &lt;i&gt;Henry V&lt;/i&gt;. It has always been held to be the triumph of the longbow against the armoured knight, and of the common man against the feudal aristocrat, but those are history's myths. Bernard Cornwell, who has long wanted to write this story, depicts the reality behind the myths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas Hook is an English archer. He seems born to trouble and, when his lord orders him to London as part of a force sent to quell an expected Lollard uprising, Nick's headstrong behaviour leads to him being proscribed an outlaw. He finds refuge across the Channel, part of an English mercenary force protecting the town of Soissons against the French. What happened at the Siege of Soissons shocked all Europe, and propels Nick back to England where he is enrolled in the archer companyof the doughty Sir John Cornwaille, a leader of Henry V's army. The army was superb, but sickness and the unexpected French defiance at Harfleur, reduce it to near-shambolic condition. Henry stubbornly refuses to accept defeat and, in appalling weather, leads his shrunken force to what appears to be inevitable disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Azincourt&lt;/i&gt; culminates in the battle. Seen from several points of view on the English side, but also from the French ranks, the scene is vivid, convincing and compelling. Bernard Cornwell has a great understanding of men at war and battlefields and this is his masterpiece. This is what it must have been like to fight at Agincourt.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;The samurai warrior is famed throughout history for his strict martial code, intricately constructed armor, and distinctive &lt;i&gt;katana &lt;/i&gt;sword.

Written by an acknowledged expert, &lt;i&gt;Weapons and Fighting Techniques of the Samurai Warrior &lt;/i&gt;is a highly-illustrated, accessible introduction to samurai warfare for both the military enthusiast and general reader.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
   Divided into six chapters covering mounted samurai, skirmishers, pikemen, commanders, firearms, and artillery and siege techniques  
   Includes more than 300 color line artworks, photographs, and maps illustrating the weapons, armor, equipment, fighting techniques, and tactics of medieval and early-modern Japan 
   Step-by-step illustrations demonstrate skills and postures, including how to fire a bow, fight with a &lt;i&gt;katana&lt;/i&gt;, pike combat and tactics, firing an harquebus, and many, many other fighting techniques

  <description>Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The author of the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Next 100 Years&lt;/i&gt; now focuses his geopolitical forecasting acumen on the next decade and the imminent events and challenges that will test America and the world, specifically addressing the skills that will be required by the decade’s leaders. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The next ten years will be a time of massive transition. The wars in the Islamic world will be subsiding, and terrorism will become something we learn to live with. China will be encountering its crisis. We will be moving from a time when financial crises dominate the world to a time when labor shortages will begin to dominate. The new century will be taking shape in the next decade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Next Decade&lt;/i&gt;, George Friedman offers readers a pro­vocative and endlessly fascinating prognosis for the immedi­ate future. Using Machiavelli’s &lt;i&gt;The Prince &lt;/i&gt;as a model, Friedman focuses on the world’s leaders—particularly the American president—and with his trusted geopolitical insight analyzes the complex chess game they will all have to play. The book also asks how to be a good president in a decade of extraordinary challenge, and puts the world’s leaders under a microscope to explain how they will arrive at the decisions they will make—and the consequences these actions will have for us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;1421&lt;/em&gt; offers another stunning reappraisal of history, presenting compelling new evidence that traces the roots of the European Renaissance to Chinese exploration in the fifteenth century&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The brilliance of the Renaissance laid the foundation of the modern world. Textbooks tell us that it came about as a result of a rediscovery of the ideas and ideals of classical Greece and Rome. But now bestselling historian Gavin Menzies makes the startling argument that in the year 1434, China—then the world's most technologically advanced civilization—provided the spark that set the European Renaissance ablaze. From that date onward, Europeans embraced Chinese intellectual ideas, discoveries, and inventions, all of which form the basis of western civilization today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Florence and Venice of the early fifteenth century were hubs of world trade, attracting traders from across the globe. Based on years of research, this marvelous history argues that a Chinese fleet—official ambassadors of the emperor—arrived in Tuscany in 1434, where they were received by Pope Eugenius IV in Florence. The delegation presented the influential pope with a wealth of Chinese learning from a diverse range of fields: art, geography (including world maps that were passed on to Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan), astronomy, mathematics, printing, architecture, steel manufacturing, military weaponry, and more. This vast treasure trove of knowledge spread across Europe, igniting the legendary inventiveness of the Renaissance, including the work of such geniuses as da Vinci, Copernicus, Galileo, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;1434&lt;/em&gt;, Gavin Menzies combines this long-overdue historical reexamination with the excitement of an investigative adventure. He brings the reader aboard the remarkable Chinese fleet as it sails from China to Cairo and Florence, and then back across the world. Erudite and brilliantly reasoned, &lt;em&gt;1434&lt;/em&gt; will change the way we see ourselves, our history, and our world.</description>

  <description>Machiavelli needs to be looked at as he really was. Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term? 1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people. 2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose. 4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure. 9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice 10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force. The first is rightly man’s way; the second, the way of beasts.</description>

  <description>The late antique world possessed no voice like that of Roman emperor &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17212.Marcus_Aurelius" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; (AD 121-180). His meditations on what constitutes a good life have withstood the centuries and reach us today with a force that has not diminished.&lt;br /&gt; In this remarkable new translation, philosopher &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17940.Jacob_Needleman" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jacob Needleman&lt;/a&gt; and classics scholar &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4071742.John_Piazza" rel="nofollow"&gt;John P. Piazza&lt;/a&gt; reveal Marcus Aurelius not only in light of his philosophical ideas, but as a great practitioner who struggled to live according to those ideas.&lt;br /&gt; The voice that emerges from their translation is a universal one that stands within the stream of the wisdom traditions of every historic faith. While rooted in the Stoic philosophy of Greece and Rome, it is recognizable to students of early Christianity and Buddhism, of the Vedas and the Talmud, and to all who seriously search for meaning in contemporary life.&lt;br /&gt; The translators' selection process has also been guided by the intention of making Marcus's thought vividly accessible to the general reader. They frame the translation with concise, relevant introductions that tell who Marcus was and provide a fresh, while historically grounded, way of entering this deeply powerful work. Also included are a glossary of terms; spare yet helpful notes that do not cloud the text; and recommendations for further reading.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Complete Book of Five Rings&lt;/i&gt; is an authoritative version of Musashi’s classic &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings,&lt;/i&gt; translated and annotated by a modern martial arts master, Kenji Tokitsu. Tokitsu has spent most of his life researching the legendary samurai swordsman and his works, and in this book he illuminates this seminal text, along with several other works by Musashi. These include “The Mirror of the Way of Strategy,” which Musashi wrote when he was in his twenties; “Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy,” and “Forty-two Instructions on Strategy,” which were precursors to &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings;&lt;/i&gt; and “The Way to Be Followed Alone,” which Musashi wrote just days before his death. Read together, these five texts give readers an unusually detailed, nuanced view of Musashi’s ideas on swordsmanship, strategy, and self-cultivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokitsu puts all these writings into historical and philosophical context and makes them accessible and relevant to today’s readers and martial arts students. Tokitsu understands Musashi’s writings—and Musashi as a martial artist—unusually well and is able to provide a rare insight into the man and his historical contribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Why do underdogs succeed so much more than we expect? How do the weak outsmart the strong? In David and Goliath Malcolm Gladwell takes us on a scintillating and surprising journey through the hidden dynamics that shape the balance of power between the small and the mighty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the conflicts in Northern Ireland, through the tactics of civil rights leaders and the problem of privilege, Gladwell demonstrates how we misunderstand the true meaning of advantage and disadvantage. When does a traumatic childhood work in someone's favour? How can a disability leave someone better off? And do you really want your child to go to the best school he or she can get into? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David and Goliath draws on the stories of remarkable underdogs, history, science, psychology and on Malcolm Gladwell's unparalleled ability to make the connections other miss. It's a brilliant, illuminating book that overturns conventional thinking about power and advantage.</description>

      <![CDATA[Another great read by Malcolm Gladwell. It serves as yet more evidence and example of the need for reform of the schooling system in the United States. It also reminds me that there are rarely poor students, usually it's poor teaching. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The now classic work on Buddhism and business from the foremost American teacher of Tibetan Buddhism— reissued in a tenth anniversary edition with compelling case studies that showcase its principles in action around the globe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a unique combination of ancient and contemporary wisdom from Tibetan Buddhism, THE DIAMOND CUTTER presents readers with empowering strategies for success in their personal and professional lives. The book is presented in three layers. The first is a translation of The Diamond Sutra, an ancient text of conversations between the Buddha and his close disciple, Subhuti. The second contains quotes from some of the best commentaries in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. And the third layer, the main text, is the practical application of Buddhist philosophies to the world of business, based upon Geshe Michael Roach's seventeen-years of experience as an employee of the Andin International Diamond Corporation, a company that grew during his tenure from four employees to a world leader in the jewelry industry. &lt;br /&gt;Roach’s easy style and spiritual understanding make THE DIAMOND CUTTER an invaluable source of timeless wisdom for those familiar or unfamiliar with Tibetan Buddhism. His focus on practical personal and business applications has resonated with and changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals the world over since its original publication.</description>

  <description>After fifteen years of rising to the pinnacle of the hospitality industry, Chip Conley's company was suddenly undercapitalized and overexposed in the post-dot.com, post-9/11 economy. For relief and inspiration, Conley, the CEO and founder of Joie de Vivre Hospitality, turned to psychologist Abraham Maslow's iconic Hierarchy of Needs. This book explores how Conley's company "the second largest boutique hotelier in the world" overcame the storm that hit the travel industry by applying Maslow's theory to what Conley identifies as the key &lt;i&gt;Relationship Truths&lt;/i&gt; in business with Employees, Customers and Investors. Part memoir, part theory, and part application, the book tells of Joie de Vivre's remarkable transformation while providing real world examples from other companies and showing how readers can bring about similar changes in their work and personal lives. Conley explains how to understand the motivations of employees, customers, bosses, and investors, and use that understanding to foster better relationships and build an enduring and profitable corporate culture.</description>

  <description>The book you hold in your hands is revolutionary, a groundbreaking exploration of the science of intention. It is also the first book to invite you, the reader, to take an active part in its original research. Drawing on the findings of leading scientists on human consciousness from around the world, "The Intention Experiment" demonstrates that "thought is a thing that affects other things." Thought generates its own palpable energy that you can use to improve your life, to help others around you, and to change the world.In "The Intention Experiment, " internationally bestselling author Lynne McTaggart, an award-winning science journalist and leading figure in the human consciousness studies community, presents a gripping scientific detective story and takes you on a mind-blowing journey to the farthest reaches of consciousness. She profiles the colorful pioneers in intention science and works with a team of renowned scientists from around the world, including physicist Fritz-Albert Popp of the International Institute of Biophysics and Dr. Gary Schwartz, professor of psychology, medicine, and neurology at the University of Arizona, to determine the effects of focused group intention on scientifically quantifiable targets -- animal, plant, and human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Intention Experiment" builds on the discoveries of McTaggart's first book, international bestseller "The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe, " which documented discoveries that point to the existence of a quantum energy field. "The Field" created a picture of an interconnected universe and a scientific explanation for many of the most profound human mysteries, from alternative medicine and spiritual healing to extrasensory perception and the collective unconscious. "The Intention Experiment" shows you myriad ways that all this information can be incorporated into your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After narrating the exciting developments in the science of intention, McTaggart offers a practical program to get in touch with your own thoughts, to increase the activity and strength of your intentions, and to begin achieving real change in your life. After you've begun to realize the amazing potential of focused intention, and the times when it is most powerful, McTaggart invites you to participate in an unprecedented experiment: Using "The Intention Experiment" website to coordinate your involvement and track results, you and other participants around the world will focus your power of intention on specific targets, giving you the opportunity to become a part of scientific history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Intention Experiment" redefines what a book does. It is the first "living" book in three dimensions. The book's text and website are inextricably linked, forming the hub of an entirely self-funded research program, the ultimate aim of which is philanthropic. An original piece of scientific investigation that involves the reader in its quest, "The Intention Experiment" explores human thought and intention as a tangible energy -- an inexhaustible but simple resource with an awesome potential to focus our lives, heal our illnesses, clean up our communities, and improve the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Intention Experiment" also forces you to rethink what it is to be human. As it proves, we're connected to everyone and everything, and that discovery demands that we pay better attention to our thoughts, intentions, and actions. Here's how you can.</description>

  <description>We Are All Weird is a celebration of choice, of treating different people differently and of embracing the notion that everyone deserves the dignity and respect that comes from being heard. The book calls for end of mass and for the beginning of offering people more choices, more interests and giving them more authority to operate in ways that reflect their own unique values.&lt;br /&gt;For generations, marketers, industrialists and politicians have tried to force us into little boxes, complying with their idea of what we should buy, use or want. And in an industrial, mass-market driven world, this was efficient and it worked. But what we learned in this new era is that mass limits our choice because it succeeds on conformity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Godin has identified, a new era of weirdness is upon us. People with more choices, more interests and the power to do something about it are stepping forward and insisting that the world work in a different way. By enabling choice we allow people to survive and thrive.</description>

  <description>Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948) is widely acknowledged as one of the great souls of the twentieth century. As the leader of the Indian independence movement he defined the modem practice of nonviolence, wedding an ethic of love to a practical method of social struggle. In the end, however, his philosophy was rooted in a deep spirituality. For Gandhi the struggle for peace and social justice was ultimately related to the search for God. These writings reveal the heart and soul of a man whose life and message bear special relevance to all spiritual seekers.</description>

  <description>Sheryl Sandberg’s &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt; is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</description>

  <description>In an unparalleled collaboration, two leading global thinkers in technology and foreign affairs give us their widely anticipated, transformational vision of the future: a world where everyone is connected - a world full of challenges and benefits that are ours to meet and to harness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Schmidt is one of Silicon Valley's great leaders, having taken Google from a small startup to one of the world's most influential companies. Jared Cohen is the director of Google Ideas and a former adviser to secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. With their combined knowledge and experiences, the authors are uniquely positioned to take on some of the toughest questions about our future: Who will be more powerful in the future, the citizen or the state? Will technology make terrorism easier or harder to carry out? What is the relationship between privacy and security, and how much will we have to give up to be part of the new digital age?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this groundbreaking book, Schmidt and Cohen combine observation and insight to outline the promise and peril awaiting us in the coming decades. At once pragmatic and inspirational, this is a forward-thinking account of where our world is headed and what this means for people, states and businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the confidence and clarity of visionaries, Schmidt and Cohen illustrate just how much we have to look forward to - and beware of - as the greatest information and technology revolution in human history continues to evolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspiring, provocative and absorbing, The New Digital Age is a brilliant analysis of how our hyper-connected world will soon look, from two of our most prescient and informed public thinkers.</description>

  <description>On 3/8/1421, the largest fleet the world had ever seen set sail from China. Its mission was "to proceed all the way to the ends of the earth to collect tribute from the barbarians beyond the seas" &amp;amp; unite the whole world in Confucian harmony. When it returned in 10/1423, the emperor had fallen, leaving China in political &amp;amp; economic chaos. The great ships were left to rot at their moorings. Most records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost in China's long, self-imposed isolation that followed was the knowledge that Chinese ships had reached America 70 years before Columbus &amp;amp; had circumnavigated the globe a century before Magellan. Also concealed was how the Chinese colonized America before the Europeans &amp;amp; transplanted in America &amp;amp; other countries the principal economic crops that have fed &amp;amp; clothed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unveiling incontrovertible evidence of these astonishing voyages, "1421" rewrites our understanding of history. Our knowledge of world exploration as it's been commonly accepted for centuries must now be reconceived due to this landmark work of historical investigation.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this dazzling work of history, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author follows Benjamin Franklin to France for the crowning achievement of his career&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In December of 1776, a small boat delivered an old man to France." So begins an enthralling narrative account of how Benjamin Franklin--seventy years old, without any diplomatic training, and possessed of the most rudimentary French--convinced France, an absolute monarchy, to underwrite America's experiment in democracy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Franklin stepped onto French soil, he well understood he was embarking on the greatest gamble of his career. By virtue of fame, charisma, and ingenuity, Franklin outmaneuvered British spies, French informers, and hostile colleagues; engineered the Franco-American alliance of 1778; and helped to negotiate the peace of 1783. The eight-year French mission stands not only as Franklin's most vital service to his country but as the most revealing of the man.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Great Improvisation&lt;/i&gt;, Stacy Schiff draws from new and little-known sources to illuminate the least-explored part of Franklin's life. Here is an unfamiliar, unforgettable chapter of the Revolution, a rousing tale of American infighting, and the treacherous backroom dealings at Versailles that would propel George Washington from near decimation at Valley Forge to victory at Yorktown. From these pages emerges a particularly human and yet fiercely determined Founding Father, as well as a profound sense of how fragile, improvisational, and international was our country's bid for independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A compelling look inside the mind and powerful leadership methods of America's coaching legend, John Wooden &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Team spirit, loyalty, enthusiasm, determination. . . . Acquire and keep these traits and success should follow."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Coach John Wooden&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Wooden's goal in 41 years of coaching never changed; namely, to get maximum effort and peak performance from each of his players in the manner that best served the team. &lt;i&gt;Wooden on Leadership&lt;/i&gt; explains step-by-step how he pursued and accomplished this goal. Focusing on Wooden's 12 Lessons in Leadership and his acclaimed Pyramid of Success, it outlines the mental, emotional, and physical qualities essential to building a winning organization, and shows you how to develop the skill, confidence, and competitive fire to "be at your best when your best is needed"--and teach your organization to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Wooden on Leadership&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What an all-encompassing Pyramid of Success for leadership! Coach Wooden's moral authority and brilliant definition of success encompass all of life. How I admire his life's work and concept of what it really means to win!"&lt;br /&gt;--Stephen R. Covey, author, &lt;i&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Wooden On Leadership&lt;/i&gt; offers valuable lessons no matter what your endeavor. 'Competitive Greatness' is our goal and that of any successful organization. Coach Wooden's Pyramid of Success is where it all starts."&lt;br /&gt; --Jim Sinegal, president &amp;amp; CEO, Costco</description>

  <description>AN ORIGINAL AUDIO PROGRAM FROM THE #1 BESTSELLING AUTHOR! In his instant self-help classic, the international bestseller How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci, Michael J. Gelb identified seven aspects of Da Vinci's genius that contemporary readers can emulate and apply in their own lives. Now, in WORK LIKE DA VINCI, Gelb adapts these principles to the specific demands of the workplace, sharing the innovative solutions to contemporary corporate and career challenges that have kept him in constant demand as a top-tier speaker and consultant to Fortune 500 clients. In Gelb's expert perspective, Da Vinci's genius can be distilled into seven principles for the business listener: Ask the right questions (Curiosit�) Put your answers to work (Dimostrazione) Develop your business senses (Sensazione) Turn uncertainty into opportunity (Sfumato) Strike a profitable balance (Arte/Scienza) Integrate for success (Corporalit�) Make the break-through connection (Connessione) These principles will help you tackle such timeless business challenges as: leadership; innovation; teamwork; strategic planning; decision-making; managing change and uncertainty; giving powerful presentations; giving and receiving feedback; and more.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A compact, profoundly inspiring book that captures the spirit of Nelson Mandela, distilling the South African leader’s wisdom into 15 vital life lessons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We long for heroes and have too few. Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013 at the age of ninety-five, is the closest thing the world has to a secular saint. He liber­ated a country from a system of violent prejudice and helped unite oppressor and oppressed in a way that had never been done before. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Richard Stengel, the editor of &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;maga­zine, has distilled countless hours of intimate conver­sation with Mandela into fifteen essential life lessons. For nearly three years, including the critical period when Mandela moved South Africa toward the first democratic elections in its history, Stengel collaborated with Mandela on his autobiography, &lt;i&gt;Long Walk to Freedom&lt;/i&gt;, and traveled with him everywhere. Eating with him, watching him campaign, hearing him think out loud, Stengel came to know all the different sides of this complex man and became a cherished friend and colleague. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mandela’s Way, &lt;/i&gt;Stengel recounts the moments in which “the grandfather of South Africa” was tested and shares the wisdom he learned: why courage is more than the absence of fear, why we should keep our rivals close, why the answer is not always either/or but often “both,” how important it is for each of us to find something away from the world that gives us pleasure and satisfaction—our own garden. Woven into these life lessons are remarkable stories—of Mandela’s child­hood as the protégé of a tribal king, of his early days as a freedom fighter, of the twenty-seven-year imprison­ment that could not break him, and of his fulfilling remarriage at the age of eighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This uplifting book captures the spirit of this extraordinary man—warrior, martyr, husband, statesman, and moral leader—and spurs us to look within ourselves, reconsider the things we take for granted, and contemplate the legacy we’ll leave behind.</description>

  <description>Robert Oppenheimer was among the most brilliant and divisive of men. As head of the Los Alamos Laboratory, he oversaw the successful effort to beat the Nazis in the race to develop the first atomic bomb—a breakthrough that was to have eternal ramifications for mankind and that made Oppenheimer the “Father of the Atomic Bomb.” But with his actions leading up to that great achievement, he also set himself on a dangerous collision course with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his witch-hunters. In &lt;i&gt;Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center&lt;/i&gt;, Ray Monk, author of peerless biographies of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, goes deeper than any previous biographer in the quest to solve the enigma of Oppenheimer’s motivations and his complex personality. &lt;br /&gt;     The son of German-Jewish immigrants, Oppenheimer was a man of phenomenal intellectual attributes, driven by an ambition to overcome his status as an outsider and penetrate the heart of political and social life. As a young scientist, his talent and drive allowed him to enter a community peopled by the great names of twentieth-century physics—men such as Niels Bohr, Max Born, Paul Dirac, and Albert Einstein—and to play a role in the laboratories and classrooms where the world was being changed forever, where the secrets of the universe, whether within atomic nuclei or collapsing stars, revealed themselves.&lt;br /&gt;     But Oppenheimer’s path went beyond one of assimilation, scientific success, and world fame. The implications of the discoveries at Los Alamos weighed heavily upon this fragile and complicated man. In the 1930s, in a climate already thick with paranoia and espionage, he made suspicious connections, and in the wake of the Allied victory, his attempts to resist the escalation of the Cold War arms race led many to question his loyalties.&lt;br /&gt;     Through compassionate investigation and with towering scholarship, Ray Monk’s &lt;i&gt;Robert Oppenheimer&lt;/i&gt; tells an unforgettable story of discovery, secrecy, impossible choices, and unimaginable destruction.</description>

  <description>From the Introduction: "In 1970, Bruce sustained a rather sever injury to his back. His doctors ordered him to discontinue the practice of martial arts and to remain in bed to allow his back heal. This was probably the most trying and dispiriting time in Bruce's life. He stayed in bed, virtually flat on his back for six months, but he couldn't keep his mind from working - the result of which is this book." Linda Lee "Jeet Kune Do, you see, has no definite lines or boundaries - only those you make yourself." Gilbert L Johnson</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;i&gt;Quiet&lt;/i&gt; has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.</description>

  <description>A manual for relating to the brain in a revolutionary new way, &lt;i&gt;Super Brain &lt;/i&gt;shows you how to use your brain as a gateway for achieving health, happiness, and spiritual growth. The authors are two pioneers: bestselling author and physician Deepak Chopra and Harvard Medical School professor Rudolph E. Tanzi, one of the world's foremost experts on the causes of Alzheimer’s. They have merged their wisdom and expertise for a bold new understanding of the “three-pound universe” and its untapped potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to the “baseline brain” that fulfills the tasks of everyday life, Chopra and Tanzi propose that, through a person’s increased self-awareness and conscious intention, the brain can be taught to reach far beyond its present limitations. “We are living in a golden age for brain research, but is this a golden age for &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; brain?” they ask.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Super Brain&lt;/i&gt; explains how it can be, by combining cutting-edge research and spiritual insights, demolishing the five most widespread myths about the brain that limit your potential, and then showing you methods to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use your brain instead of letting it use you&lt;br /&gt;-Create the ideal lifestyle for a healthy brain&lt;br /&gt;-Reduce the risks of aging&lt;br /&gt;-Promote happiness and well-being through the mind-body connection&lt;br /&gt;-Access the enlightened brain, the gateway to freedom and bliss&lt;br /&gt;-Overcome the most common challenges, such as memory loss, depression, anxiety, and obesity&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your brain is capable of incredible healing and constant reshaping. Through a new relationship with your brain you can transform your life. In &lt;i&gt;Super Brain&lt;/i&gt;, Chopra and Tanzi guide you on a fascinating journey that envisions a leap in human evolution. The brain is not just the greatest gift that Nature has given us. It’s the gateway to an unlimited future that you can begin to live today.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The first popular work to combine the spiritual and psychological insights of modern psychoanalysis with the archetypes of world mythology, the book creates a roadmap for navigating the frustrating path of contemporary life. Examining heroic myths in the light of modern psychology, it considers not only the patterns and stages of mythology but also its relevance to our lives today--and to the life of any person seeking a fully realized existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Myth, according to Campbell, is the projection of a culture's dreams onto a large screen; Campbell's book, like &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;, the film it helped inspire, is an exploration of the big-picture moments from the stage that is our world. It is a must-have resource for both experienced students of mythology and the explorer just beginning to approach myth as a source of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Miyamoto Musashi, who lived in Japan in the fifteenth century, was a renowned samurai warrior. He has become a martial arts icon, known not just as an undefeated dueler, but also as a master of battlefield strategy. Kenji Tokitsu turns a critical eye on Musashi's life and writings, separating fact from fiction, and giving a clear picture of the man behind the myth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musashi's best-known work, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings &lt;/i&gt;, provides timeless insight into the nature of conflict. Tokitsu translates and provides extensive commentary on that popular work, as well as three other short texts on strategy that were written before it, and a longer, later work entitled "The Way to Be Followed Alone." Tokitsu is a thoughtful and informed guide, putting the historical and philosophical aspects of the text into context, and illuminating the etymological nuances of particular Japanese words and phrases. As a modern martial artist and a scholar, Tokitsu provides a view of Musashi's life and ideas that is accessible and relevant to today's readers and martial arts students.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Mastering Kung Fu&lt;/i&gt; provides you with a path for taking your kung fu training and combat skills to the next level. Based on Wing Chun kung fu, this book will give you insight into the most advanced combat theories, skills, and tactics--as well as the history and evolution of traditional kung fu--that will give you the edge with your opponent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastering Kung Fu&lt;/i&gt; introduces these advanced theories that show you how science plays as much a role in kung fu as art:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Centerline theory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Two lines of offense and defense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Three reference points&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Five line (dimensional) theory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Five phases of combat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Six gates concept&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kiu sau (bridge arm) employment concepts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chi sau (sticking hand) concepts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By understanding these principles, you will see how space and time factor into successful, tactical maneuvers. Then, by combining these principles with detailed instruction on the subtleties of advanced techniques, you will be able to add the concepts to your own arsenal to improve your combat skills--even if you are an established black belt. You will also find clear, concise flow charts that detail various combat situations, showing you different tactical options as well as the potential outcomes of executing those options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, you will discover the ancient combat secrets of the monks by tracing the evolution of Shaolin kung fu from the Northern Temples to the Southern Temples. Learn how the Chan Buddhist philosophy of universal harmony has influenced the advancement of Wing Chun kung fu, and how it contributes to the way in which kung fu is performed today.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Of all our great presidents, Theodore Roosevelt is the only one whose greatness increased out of office. When he toured Europe in 1910 as plain “Colonel Roosevelt,” he was hailed as the most famous man in the world. Crowned heads vied to put him up in their palaces. “If I see another king,” he joked, “I think I shall bite him.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had TR won his historic “Bull Moose” campaign in 1912 (when he outpolled the sitting president, William Howard Taft), he might have averted World War I, so great was his international influence. Had he not died in 1919, at the early age of sixty, he would unquestionably have been reelected to a third term in the White House and completed the work he began in 1901 of establishing the United States as a model democracy, militarily strong and socially just.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This biography by Edmund Morris, the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award–winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Theodore Rex&lt;/i&gt;, is itself the completion of a trilogy sure to stand as definitive. Packed with more adventure, variety, drama, humor, and tragedy than a big novel, yet documented down to the smallest fact, it recounts the last decade of perhaps the most amazing life in American history. What other president has written forty books, hunted lions, founded a third political party, survived an assassin’s bullet, and explored an unknown river longer than the Rhine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Colonel Roosevelt &lt;/i&gt;begins with a prologue recounting what TR called his “journey into the Pleistocene”—a yearlong safari through East Africa, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian. Some readers will be repulsed by TR’s bloodlust, which this book does not prettify, yet there can be no denying that the Colonel passionately loved and understood every living thing that came his way: The text is rich in quotations from his marvelous nature writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although TR intended to remain out of politics when he returned home in 1910, a fateful decision that spring drew him back into public life. By the end of the summer, in his famous “New Nationalism” speech, he was the guiding spirit of the Progressive movement, which inspired much of the social agenda of the future New Deal. (TR’s fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt acknowledged that debt, adding that the Colonel “was the greatest man I ever knew.”)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then follows a detailed account of TR’s reluctant yet almost successful campaign for the White House in 1912. But unlike other biographers, Edmund Morris does not treat TR mainly as a politician. This volume gives as much consideration to TR’s literary achievements and epic expedition to Brazil in 1913–1914 as to his fatherhood of six astonishingly different children, his spiritual and aesthetic beliefs, and his eager embrace of other cultures—from Arab and Magyar to German and American Indian. It is impossible to read &lt;i&gt;Colonel Roosevelt &lt;/i&gt;and not be awed by the man’s universality. The Colonel himself remarked, “I have enjoyed life as much as any nine men I know.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morris does not hesitate, however, to show how pathologically TR turned upon those who inherited the power he craved—the hapless Taft, the adroit Woodrow Wilson. When Wilson declined to bring the United States into World War I in 1915 and 1916, the Colonel blasted him with some of the worst abuse ever uttered by a former chief executive. Yet even Wilson had to admit that behind the Rooseveltian will to rule lay a winning idealism and decency. “He is just like a big boy—there is a sweetness about him that you can’t resist.” That makes the story of TR’s last year, when the “boy” in him died, all the sadder in the telling: the conclusion of a life of Aristotelian grandeur.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Wired &lt;/i&gt;magazine editor and bestselling author Chris Anderson takes you to the front lines of a new industrial revolution as today’s entrepreneurs, using open source design and 3-D printing, bring manufacturing to the desktop.  In an age of custom-fabricated, do-it-yourself product design and creation, the collective potential of a million garage tinkerers and enthusiasts is about to be unleashed, driving a resurgence of American manufacturing.  A generation of “Makers” using the Web’s innovation model will help drive the next big wave in the global economy, as the new technologies of digital design and rapid prototyping gives everyone the power to invent -- creating “the long tail of things”.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Hagakure&lt;/em&gt; ("In the Shadow of Leaves") is a manual for the samurai classes consisting of a series of short anecdotes and reflections that give both insight and instruction-in the philosophy and code of behavior that foster the true spirit of Bushido-the Way of the Warrior. It is not a book of philosophy as most would understand the word: it is a collection of thoughts and sayings recorded over a period of seven years, and as such covers a wide variety of subjects, often in no particular sequence. &lt;br /&gt;The work represents an attitude far removed from our modern pragmatism and materialism, and possesses an intuitive rather than rational appeal in its assertion that Bushido is a Way of Dying, and that only a samurai retainer prepared and willing to die at any moment can be totally true to his lord. While &lt;em&gt;Hagakure&lt;/em&gt; was for many years a secret text known only to the warrior vassals of the Hizen fief to which the author belonged, it later came to be recognized as a classic exposition of samurai thought and came to influence many subsequent generations, including Yukio Mishima. &lt;br /&gt;This translation offers 300 selections that constitute the core texts of the 1,300 present in the original. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hagakure&lt;/em&gt; was featured prominently in the film &lt;em&gt;Ghost Dog&lt;/em&gt;, by Jim Jarmusch.</description>

  <description>The Spartans were a society of warrior-heroes who were the living exemplars of such core values as duty, discipline, self-sacrifice, and extreme toughness. This book, written by one of the world’s leading experts on Sparta, traces the rise and fall of Spartan society and explores the tremendous influence the Spartans had on their world and even on ours. Paul Cartledge brings to life figures like legendary founding father Lycurgus and King Leonidas, who embodied the heroism so closely identified with this unique culture, and he shows how Spartan women enjoyed an unusually dominant and powerful role in this hyper-masculine society. Based firmly on original sources, &lt;b&gt;The Spartans&lt;/b&gt; is the definitive book about one of the most fascinating cultures of ancient Greece.</description>
