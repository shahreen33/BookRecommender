  <description>Braxton’s life hits a roadblock when in the middle of his junior year of college, his parents decide to divorce. Braxton ends up moving away from his home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Braxton’s grades start to drop his father forces him to see a local tutor named Cody. When Braxton goes over to Cody’s house for his first tutoring session, he meets Cody’s gorgeous, youthful mom, Anna. Anna and Braxton feel an instant connection, but there is a huge age gap since Anna is old enough to be his mother. This does not stop them from teasing and experimenting with each other whenever Cody is out of the house. While it’s fun to mess around, Braxton wants a commitment from Anna. Will Anna say yes and continue the hot romance with a younger man or will Braxton leave her and end up broken-hearted so that Anna can keep up appearances?</description>

Notorious serial killer &lt;i&gt;The Hacker&lt;/i&gt; has escaped prison and kidnapped one of his best detectives from her own home.

  <description> The temptation to sin and lure of the forbidden can be impossible to ignore.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sex Education, A Woman's Awakening: The Series&lt;/i&gt;: Rebecca Beiler's recent &lt;b&gt;sexual&lt;/b&gt; urges are at odds with her strict religious upbringing. Married at 17 to a sexually repressed man who left her a widow, at age 26 she now finds herself yearning to be &lt;b&gt;taken hard by hot men with chiseled bodies&lt;/b&gt;. When an indiscretion with a neighbor leads to a six-month expulsion from her community, Rebecca attempts to purge herself of her &lt;b&gt;sinful desires&lt;/b&gt; by giving into them, in full. Unfortunately, each new intoxicating encounter only intensifies her cravings — &lt;b&gt;intense lustful cravings for physical ecstasy&lt;/b&gt; that lead Rebecca to dark recesses of the sexual underground and compel her to do things the likes of which she &lt;b&gt;never imagined herself capable&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Book 1&lt;/i&gt; Rebecca inadvertently sees a pornographic image that spurs in her a &lt;b&gt;dormant desire for sex&lt;/b&gt;. One thing leads to another until she's forced to embark on the adventure of a lifetime, one that will lead her to question her former life and &lt;b&gt;spark a fierce hunger for physical pleasure&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This series was formerly published under the name &lt;i&gt;Shunned&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>At an economics conference Gail Garvey ends up sharing a room with a teacher she had a crush on twenty years ago. They’re both professors now, and Gail’s crush has long faded, but finding herself in the same room as Professor Joanne Ferguson two nights in a row proves to be more challenging than Gail would like to believe.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to life. He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you medicine. He's a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willy Loman has been a salesman for 34 years. At 60, he is cast aside, his usefulness now exhausted. With no future to dream about he must face the crushing disappointments of his past. He takes one final brave action, but is he heroic at last?, or a self-deluding fool?</description>

  <description>When it first appeared, one volume per month, Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE was an unprecedented publishing triumph: all six volumes ended up on the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller lists—simultaneously—and delighted millions of fans the world over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Cold Mountain Penitentiary, home to the Depression-worn men of E Block. Convicted killers all, each awaits his turn to walk the Green Mile, keeping a date with "Old Sparky," Cold Mountain's electric chair. Prison guard Paul Edgecombe has seen his share of oddities in his years working the Mile. But he's never seen anyone like John Coffey, a man with the body of a giant and the mind of a child, condemned for a crime terrifying in its violence and shocking in its depravity. In this place of ultimate retribution, Edgecombe is about to discover the terrible, wondrous truth about Coffey, a truth that will challenge his most cherished beliefes... and yours.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;'I felt something alive moving on my left leg ... when bending my Eyes downwards as much as I could. I perceived it to be a human Creature not six inches high'&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipwrecked and cast adrift, Lemuel Gulliver wakes to find himself on Lilliput, an island inhabited by little people, whose height makes their quarrels over fashion and fame seem ridiculous. His subsequent encounters - with the crude giants of Brobdingnag, the philosophical Houyhnhnms and the brutish Yahoos - give Gulliver new, bitter insights into human behaviour. Swift's savage satire view mankind in a distorted hall of mirrors as a diminished, magnified and finally bestial species, presenting us with an uncompromising reflection of ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all its original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways &lt;i&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/i&gt; has been interpreted since its first publication.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of &lt;i&gt;The Canterbury Tales.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!&lt;br /&gt;Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His "wonderful, awful" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.</description>

  <description>Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This machine was the Professor’s ultimate achievement. No woman who had lain on this table had yet been able to withstand it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord Elliston is at his wit's end with his daughter Emily. Nothing he tries seems to make the slightest impact on her deplorable behavior, and when she is caught stealing a handkerchief he knows that it is time for desperate measures. One name comes up again and again - Professor George E. Feversham. The founder of &lt;i&gt;Feversham's Academy of Young Women's Correctional Education&lt;/i&gt; has a reputation for reforming troubled young women of the lower classes, and his treatments for &lt;i&gt;praefocatio matricis&lt;/i&gt; - female hysteria - are renowned in scientific circles. It seems that the Professor is his last, best hope for regaining control of his daughter. But what will the treatments mean for Emily?</description>

  <description>When a man is found dead at the remote church of Heavenfield, DCI Ryan is the only other person for miles around. The police have no weapon, no motive and no other suspects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Already suspended from Northumbria CID, Ryan must fight to clear his name. But soon, more than his career is at stake when prominent members of the mysterious ‘Circle’ begin to die. Somebody wants Ryan’s name to be next on the coroner’s list and to survive he must unmask the devil who walks among them – before it is too late. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Ryan, the devil looks just like everybody else… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Murder and mystery are peppered with romance and humour in this fast-paced crime whodunnit from LJ Ross, set amidst the spectacular Northumbrian landscape. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After a turbulent time, DCI Ryan’s life is finally beginning to return to normal and he’s looking forward to spending an uneventful Easter bank holiday weekend with his fiancée. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then, on Good Friday morning he is called out to a crime scene at one of the largest cemeteries in Newcastle. The body of a redheaded woman has been found buried in a shallow grave and the killer has given her wings, like an angel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon, another woman is found at a different cemetery, followed quickly by another. Panic spreads like wildfire as a new serial killer is born, and Ryan’s band of detectives must work around the clock to unmask him before he can strike again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Murder and mystery are peppered with romance and humour in this fast paced crime whodunnit set amidst the spectacular Northumbrian landscape. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes an uncomfortably hilarious Mystery with a heaping help of sexual frustration, &lt;i&gt;THE LIBRARIAN’S VAMPIRE ASSISTANT, Book Three.&lt;/i&gt; (Yep! It’s a STAND-ALONE. But why not read them all because…fun!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOUR BOSS JUST CAN’T GET MORE AWKWARD...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Vanderhorst is not your usual vampire. For starters, he works in a library, is in love with Miriam, his hot nerdy human boss who has no clue what he is, and he looks like a college student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, Michael is an ancient deadly vampire, an ex-assassin, and is currently the de facto king of his kind ever since their ruling party disappeared. To where? He doesn’t know, but if he wants his life back, he’ll have to find out. (Mystery!) Especially because a civil war is brewing, and being king makes his librarian a mark for his enemies. (She is, after all, his biggest weakness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a global uprising about to explode, Michael must give her the protection of his army. Only one problem: She must become his queen first. But every attempt he makes to tell her the truth is met with extreme hostility. “Vampires aren’t real. That’s crazy talk, Michael!” Clearly, the topic frightens her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With time running out and her life on the line, Michael is left with one option: Marry her. Without her knowing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he pull it off? And what will happen when the fight comes to their door?</description>

  <description>In this ingenious, suspenseful historical thriller, Sigmund Freud is drawn into the mind of a sadistic killer who is savagely attacking Manhattan’s wealthiest heiresses &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by Sigmund Freud’s only visit to America, The Interpretation of Murder is an intricate tale of murder and the mind’s most dangerous mysteries. It unfurls on a sweltering August evening in 1909 as Freud disembarks from the steamship George Washington, accompanied by Carl Jung, his rival and protégé. Across town, in an opulent apartment high above the city, a stunning young woman is found dangling from a chandelier—whipped, mutilated, and strangled. The next day, a second beauty—a rebellious heiress who scorns both high society and her less adventurous parents—barely escapes the killer. Yet Nora Acton, suffering from hysteria, can recall nothing of her attack. Asked to help her, Dr. Stratham Younger, America’s most committed Freudian analyst, calls in his idol, the Master himself, to guide him through the challenges of analyzing this high-spirited young woman whose family past has been as complicated as his own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interpretation of Murder leads readers from the salons of Gramercy Park, through secret passages, to Chinatown—even far below the currents of the East River where laborers are building the Manhattan Bridge. As Freud fends off a mysterious conspiracy to destroy him, Younger is drawn into an equally thrilling adventure that takes him deep into the subterfuges of the human mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richly satisfying, elegantly crafted, The Interpretation of Murder marks the debut of a brilliant, spectacularly entertaining new storyteller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2007 The Interpretation of Murder won the prestigious Best Read of the Year award from Richard and Judy's Bookclub in the UK (comparable to Oprah Winfrey in the USA).</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times Bestseller&lt;/i&gt; Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes a humorous, standalone mystery, &lt;i&gt;The Librarian’s Vampire Assistant, Book 2.&lt;/i&gt; (Yep! It’s a standalone. The boring title is just to mess with you!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW MUCH LONGER CAN HE KEEP HIS SECRET AND HIS FAVORITE HUMAN SAFE?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Michael Vanderhorst has always been a lone wolf. Or lone vampire? Whatever. Point is, this ancient gentleman vampire is obsessed. She’s quirky, a horrible dresser, and the cutest librarian he’s ever seen. The question is, why her? In four hundred years, no one has ever captured his attention like this. He must find out, which is why he just signed on as her new assistant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is, she has no idea vampires exist or that she’s just broken one of their laws. As the leader of his territory, Michael has been ordered by his council to turn her or kill her. “Over my dead body!” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To overturn the ruling, Michael needs the council on his side, and right now they’re asking him to hunt down and execute five hundred vampires no one can seem to locate. Unfortunately, his assassin days are long over, and he’s not so sure he can go back to killing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with Miriam’s life on the line and their unusual bond growing stronger each day, will he dust off the old sword or give her the bite that will make her his forever? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff comes a Horribly Sunny Mystery, &lt;i&gt;The Librarian’s Vampire Assistant.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOBODY MESSES WITH HIS LIBRARIAN. . . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who killed Michael Vanderhorst’s maker? It’s a darn good question. But when the trail brings Michael to hellishly sunny Phoenix, Arizona, his biggest problem soon becomes a cute little librarian he can’t seem to stay away from. He’s never met a bigger danger magnet! Even her book cart has it out for her. And is that the drug cartel following her around, too? “Dear God, woman! What have you gotten yourself into?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things go from bad to worse when local vampires won’t play nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can this four-hundred-year-old vampire keep his librarian safe and himself out of hot water? Can he bring his maker’s killer to justice? Yesterday, he would’ve said yes. But yesterday, he didn’t have a strange connection with a librarian. Yesterday, people weren’t trying to kill her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Detective Chief Inspector Ryan believes he has put his turbulent history behind him. Then, in the early hours of the summer solstice, the skeleton of a young woman is found inside the Roman Wall at Sycamore Gap. She has lain undiscovered for ten years and it is Ryan's job to piece together her past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enquiry lines cross and merge as Ryan is forced to face his own demons and enter into a deadly game of cat and mouse with a killer who seems unstoppable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Murder and mystery are peppered with a sprinkling of romance and humour in this fast-paced crime whodunnit set amidst the spectacular scenery of Hadrian's Wall country in Northumberland.</description>

  <description>Detective Chief Inspector Ryan retreats to Holy Island seeking sanctuary when he is forced to take sabbatical leave from his duties as a homicide detective. A few days before Christmas, his peace is shattered and he is thrust back into the murky world of murder when a young woman is found dead amongst the ancient ruins of the nearby Priory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When former local girl Dr Anna Taylor arrives back on the island as a police consultant, old memories swim to the surface making her confront her difficult past. She and Ryan struggle to work together to hunt a killer who hides in plain sight, while pagan ritual and small-town politics muddy the waters of their investigation.</description>

  <description>'Max, your father is here. He's come to take Matthew away'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever wondered what would happen if Max's husband met Max's father? What would Leon do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're normally a fairly amiable bunch, but this is the story of what to expect if St Mary's doesn't like someone. As in, really doesn't like someone. Warning: contains a unit-wide criminal enterprise, a great deal of illegal activity and a sad misuse of public resources. All the things a father will do to protect his family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a story of revenge. Because this is payback - St Mary's style.</description>

  <description>Sally Lockhart's father was an unconventional man who preferred to teach his daughter how to run a business and shoot straight from a pistol, rather than school her in the social graces expected of a young lady. When he dies suddenly and unexpectedly, on a voyage to the Far East, Sally receives a mysterious letter containing a strange warning - one that is to lead to yet another unexpected death. Soon Sally finds herself at the heart of a deep and dangerous mystery, and one which she is determined to solve at all costs.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Cuckoo's Calling&lt;/i&gt; is a 2013 crime fiction novel by J. K. Rowling, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant mystery in a classic vein: Detective Cormoran Strike investigates a supermodel's suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.</description>

  <description>Gavin Faulkner was the only doctor in the small South Carolina inner coastal town of Shadows Landing. He was used to patching up everything from fishing lures stuck in skin to gator bites. Nothing could surprise him anymore--except when he found an unconscious woman partially submerged near his dock after a fierce thunderstorm. Ellery St. John's last memory was of a bat swinging toward her head. The next thing she knew, she was cold, wet, and a sexy man was pressing his lips to hers. Too bad it turned out to be CPR instead of a passionate kiss. Gavin thought Ellery would be safe in the small town where BBQ wars were the biggest danger, but he was wrong. Now it was up to him to help Ellery put the pieces together in order to discover who had tried to kill her and why before they both ended up at the bottom of the ocean.</description>

  <description>It was an open and shut case. All the evidence said Caroline Crale poisoned her philandering husband, a brilliant painter. She was quickly and easily convicted and sentenced to life in prison. &lt;br /&gt; Now, sixteen years later, in a posthumous letter, Mrs. Crale has assured her grown daughter that she was innocent. But instead of setting the young woman's mind at ease, the letter only raises disquieting questions. Did Caroline indeed write the truth? And if she didn't kill her husband, who did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find out, the Crale’s daughter asks Hercule Poirot to reopen the case. His investigation takes him deep into the conflicting memories and motivations of the five other people who were with the Crales on the fatal day. With his keen understanding of human psychology, he manages to discover the surprising truth behind the artist's death.</description>

  <description>The most difficult case of Detective Jackman’s life. Who are the guilty ones and is anyone really innocent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackman’s sister-in-law Sarah disappears to London and throws herself into the river. What drove her to this? She was a woman with a seemingly happy home life and two beloved sons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DI Jackman and DI Evans dig into Sarah’s life. And Jackman realises he knew almost nothing about his sister-in-law’s past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, they discover a woman in a neighbouring village died in similar circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What is the connection to a convicted murderer whose family are convinced he is innocent? Who is really pulling the strings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DI Jackman and DS Evans of the Fenland police face a battle against their most dangerous and deadly adversary. And in a case so close to home can Jackman keep his feelings under control?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Full of twists and turns, this is a crime mystery that will keep you turning the pages until the thrilling ending. Set in the atmospheric Lincolnshire Fens, whose isolated villages hide many dark secrets.</description>

  <description>Adam Kay was a junior doctor from 2004 until 2010, before a devastating experience on a ward caused him to reconsider his future. He kept a diary throughout his training, and This Is Going to Hurt intersperses tales from the front line of the NHS with reflections on the current crisis. The result is a first-hand account of life as a junior doctor in all its joy, pain, sacrifice and maddening bureaucracy, and a love letter to those who might at any moment be holding our lives in their hands.</description>

  <description>Lost in a new world, Lyra finds Will—a boy on the run, a murderer—a worthy and welcome ally. For this is a world where soul-eating Specters stalk the streets and witches share the skies with troops of angels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each is searching—Lyra for the meaning of Dark Matter, Will for his missing father—but what they find instead is a deadly secret, a knife of untold power. And neither Lyra nor Will suspects how tightly their lives, their loves, and their destinies are bound together... until they are split apart.</description>

  <description>Shakespeare’s King Lear challenges us with the magnitude, intensity, and sheer duration of the pain that it represents. Its figures harden their hearts, engage in violence, or try to alleviate the suffering of others. Lear himself rages until his sanity cracks. What, then, keeps bringing us back to King Lear? For all the force of its language, King Lear is almost equally powerful when translated, suggesting that it is the story, in large part, that draws us to the play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play tells us about families struggling between greed and cruelty, on the one hand, and support and consolation, on the other. Emotions are extreme, magnified to gigantic proportions. We also see old age portrayed in all its vulnerability, pride, and, perhaps, wisdom—one reason this most devastating of Shakespeare’s tragedies is also perhaps his most moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authoritative edition of King Lear from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Scene-by-scene plot summaries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-An annotated guide to further reading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essay by Susan Snyder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

  <description>The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men simply waiting for someone—or something—named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree, inhabiting a drama spun of their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and nonsense, which has been interpreted as mankind’s inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett’s language pioneered an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existential post-World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.</description>

  <description>In Othello, Shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination (between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona), with elopement, and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths. He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.</description>

  <description>In this original edition, Peter and his sisters are told to go gather blackberries and not to go into MacGregor's garden because Peter's father was made into a pie by MacGregor after being found in the garden. Peter, who is wearing a new coat, promptly disobeys his mother, stuffs himself with vegetables, gets spotted by MacGregor, loses his coat and barely makes it out of the garden alive. When Peter gets home, he is given chamomile tea for dinner. Peter's sisters, who listened to their mother and stayed out of the forbidden garden have a regular dinner.</description>

  <description>This four-volume, boxed set contains J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterworks The Hobbit and the three volumes of The Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is whisked away from his comfortable, unambitious life in Hobbiton by the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves. He finds himself caught up in a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the dwarf; Legolas the elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. J.R.R. Tolkien's three volume masterpiece is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale—a story of high and heroic adventure set in the unforgettable landscape of Middle-earth</description>

  <description>This is a story for people who follow their hearts and make their own rules...people who get special pleasure out of doing something well, even if only for themselves...people who know there's more to this living than meets the eye: they’ll be right there with Jonathan, flying higher and faster than ever they dreamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Livingston Seagull is no ordinary bird. He believes it is every gull's right to fly, to reach the ultimate freedom of challenge and discovery, finding his greatest reward in teaching younger gulls the joy of flight and the power of dreams. The special 20th anniversary release of this spiritual classic!</description>

  <description>Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the start--Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for Lysander. Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.</description>

As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</description>

  <description>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone -- or something -- starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects . . . Harry Potter himself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--jacket description</description>

  <description>One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland. At first sceptical, he’s urged on by the ruthless, single-minded ambitions of Lady Macbeth, who suffers none of her husband’s doubt. But seeing the prophecy through to the bloody end leads them both spiralling into paranoia, tyranny, madness, and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shocking tragedy - a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake - is, to this day, one of Shakespeare’s most popular and influential masterpieces.</description>

  <description>When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://harrypotter.scholastic.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://harrypotter.scholastic.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly. --back cover</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.&lt;br /&gt;--scholastic.com</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.</description>

  <description>PARTS 1 - 3 of the Called by the Bear Serial. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m Carly Cutler and my dreams predict the future. So why am I dreaming about a sexy beast of a guy, a bear, and a paw print design? I don’t know. A force I can’t fight wants me to find out, and I’m leaving the only life I’ve ever known. With a fresh tattoo of a bear paw and my best friend by my side, I’m on a quest to find a man I’ve never met. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sierra Steele here, and ready for adventure – We’ve been chosen. The moment I saw Carly’s first tattoo, I felt the undeniable attraction of the guy I’ve been dreaming about. My cautious friend can’t resist the pull either, and we’re off to the mountains to get answers. Something’s calling us, and I’m certain the hunky men are our exciting destiny. They’ll keep us safe from the bear, right?</description>

She has been drugged and it’s uncertain whether she’ll survive. She says she saw her friend Emily being dragged away from the party. But no one knows who Emily is or even if she’s still alive . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile &lt;b&gt;the drowned body of another girl&lt;/b&gt; has been found on an isolated beach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And how does this all relate to the &lt;b&gt;shocking disappearance of a little girl&lt;/b&gt; nearly a decade ago, a crime which was never solved?

  <description>Zoey Mathers was a witch. Not on purpose. It had happened accidently. But as Zoey was finding out, maybe this had been her fate all along. Luckily the potential witch hunter, Slade, had turned out to be on her side and had found a place in her heart. With the War of the Witches heating up, it's not just Zoey's life on the line, but all the witches fighting for good.But fate wasn't done with Zoey yet. There was a reason she'd become a witch when others wouldn't have. And that answer was going to change her life even more. Now Zoey was falling in love, fighting for good, and defending the sweet small town of Moonshine Hollow. All while the humans were completely unaware of a war around them. But that was nothing compared to the fight to end the war-the one the prophecy said was up to her. Only one witch was going to survive and she just hoped fate knew what she was doing because Zoey's life was in the balance.</description>

  <description>Zoey Mathers had everything going for her until one night she lost her biggest client, her job, and her reputation. Leaving her life up to fate, Zoey closed her eyes and pointed. She would serve out her career exile in the small mountain town of Moonshine Hollow where moonshine flowed as freely as a mountain stream.Giving up the law to become a baker in Moonshine Hollow turned out to be the best thing Zoey had ever done. She was happy and enjoying life in her new small town. But Zoey should have learned the first time . . . one night can change your whole life. After unknowingly crashing a battle between witches, Zoey accidentally becomes a witch herself. That's all before Zoey stumbles over a murder victim and the town's sheriff becomes involved. Now she's trying to find a murderer, stop two old witches from playing matchmaker, and learning she's way more than a mere accidental witch.And that's all before fate turns up one more sexy hunk of a twist . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He lost his mentor.&lt;br /&gt;He lost his K9 partner.&lt;br /&gt;He almost lost his will to live.&lt;br /&gt;But when a ruthless killer targets a woman on the run, Theo and his new K9 companion will do whatever it takes to survive—and save the woman neither can live without.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grieving the death of his partner, Theo Bosco has no room in his life for distractions. Though his instincts scream that he should avoid Juliet 'Jules' Jackson, he can't seem to stay away. It doesn't help that Theo's new K9 companion has fallen head over paws with Jules's rambunctious family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or that when he's with her, Theo finally knows peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jules rescued her siblings, whisking them away to the safety of the beautifully rugged Colorado Rockies, she never expected to catch the eye—or the heart—of a cop. Yet as Jules struggles to fight her growing attraction to the brooding K9 officer, another threat lurks much closer to home...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this time, there's no escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rocky Mountain K-9 Unit: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run to Ground (Book 1)&lt;br /&gt;On the Chase (Book 2)&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Abigail Mueez knows all about being something you’re not. Everyone knows she works security in Washington D.C., but that wasn’t exactly the truth. There are many layers of deception in Abby’s life from her job to the man she’s with—a man she doesn’t have time to fall in love with when her life and so much more was on the line. Too bad she didn’t tell her heart that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knew there was more to Abby than everyone else saw, but he never asked. He had his own secrets to keep. But then the President called and all deceptions fell to the side as more than just their truths are laid bare. With bullets flying and lives at stake, could he and Abby do the scariest thing possible—become the couple that would set the town of Keeneston on fire?</description>

  <description>The tenth book in the bestselling Chronicles of St Mary's series which follows a group of tea-soaked disaster magnets as they hurtle their way around History. If you love Jasper Fforde or Ben Aaronovitch, you won't be able to resist Jodi Taylor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't change History. History doesn't like it. There are always consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max is no stranger to taking matters into her own hands. Especially when she's had A Brilliant Idea. Yes, it will mean breaking a few rules, but - as Max always says - they're not her rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconded to the Time Police to join in the hunt for the renegade Clive Ronan, Max is a long way from St Mary's. But life in the future does have its plus points - although not for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A problem with the Time Map reveals chaos in the 16th century and the wrong Tudor queen on the throne. History has gone rogue, there's a St Mary's team right in the firing line and Max must step up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know what they say. Hope for the best. But plan for the worst.</description>

  <description>When the past meets the present… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King George County, Virginia has it’s share of crime, but it’s generally a good place to live and raise a family. So when a string of violent murders sweeps through the county, J.J. Graves and her husband, Sheriff Jack Lawson, are left scratching their heads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s soon discovered all the victims have a connection—Malachi Graves—J.J.’s father. The world thinks he’s dead, but J.J. knows that’s just another one of his lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The problem is the killer might not be her father, but someone staging the crimes to set up Malachi for murder. Which means she and Jack aren’t the only people who know he’s alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Guilty or Innocent…it’s time to bring Malachi Graves down once and for all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description> How far would you go to save your family?  &lt;br /&gt;In the dead of night, new parents &lt;b&gt;Alice and Harry French&lt;/b&gt; are plunged into their worst nightmare when they wake to find masked men in their bedroom. Men ruthless enough to threaten their &lt;b&gt;baby daughter, Evie&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is no burglary gone wrong. &lt;br /&gt;The intruders know &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; they’re looking for – a man called Edward Renshaw. &lt;br /&gt;And they are prepared to &lt;b&gt;kill&lt;/b&gt; to get to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the men leave empty handed, little do Alice and Harry realise that their nightmare is just beginning. Is it a case of mistaken identity? Who is Renshaw? And what is he hiding? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One thing is clear – they already know too much.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Alice and Harry are separated in the run for their lives, there is no time to breathe in their fight to be reunited. And with their attackers closing in, there is only one choice: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAY ALIVE. OR DON’T.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrifying, unputdownable and full of twists and turns, this stunning thriller will have you on the edge of your seat right to the very last page.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE VAMPIRE AFFAIR BOOKS 1 - 4&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the first time, all four books in one collection. Four volumes of a sexy vampire named Jonathan Devane and Makayla Bradley, the woman who wants to tame him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 - Makayla Bradley risks everything including her first job as a journalist to get the goods on billionaire playboy businessman Jonathan Devane. A man who enthralled her from a single passionate kiss months prior in a Toronto nightclub. A man who makes her blood race and her insides throb. A man with dark secrets… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 - Makayla is dangerously close to falling under Jonathan Devane's spell. She has to find the story her editor is pressuring her for and get out of town before Jonathan can completely consume her. But her body and her heart tell her, it may already be too late for that... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 - Makayla Bradley loves her new life. She has a great career as a novelist, she’s living in a vibrant big city that has fabulous shopping and a spectacular night life. And she’s shacked up now and then with her rich gorgeous vampire boyfriend. She couldn’t ask for anything more…that is until he suggests they fly to Ireland so she can meet his family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now she’s neck deep in a country she doesn’t know, surrounded by vampires and she’s not sure whether they want her to be part of the family or part of the main course… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 - Whisked away on a private jet, 5 star hotel, shopping, spa treatments, Makayla’s trip to Ireland to meet Jonathan’s family is everything she’d hoped for, except for one pesky little problem…the mysterious vampire who seems to want to drink her for a midnight snack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Families can really suck. This one in particular. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other books in the Billionaires After Dark series: &lt;br /&gt;The Werewolf Liaison 1 &lt;br /&gt;The Werewolf Liaison 2 &lt;br /&gt;The Werewolf Liaison 3 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Vampire Design 1 &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Killing Floor&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the phenomenal bestselling Jack Reacher series by Lee Child. It introduces Reacher for the first time, as the tough ex-military cop of no fixed abode. Trained to think fast and act faster, he is the perfect action hero for men and women alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Margrave is a no-account little town in Georgia. Jack Reacher jumps off a bus and walks fourteen miles in the rain to reach it, an arbitrary detour in search of a dead guitar player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Margrave has just had its first homicide in thirty years. And Reacher is the only stranger in town. So he is thrown into jail. As the body count mounts, only one thing is for sure: they picked the wrong guy to take the fall.</description>

  <description>Here's a question for you. What's the most exciting thing ever found in a fire bucket? And don't say 'fire' because you'll be wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suppose - just suppose - it was the technology to take a pod to Mars? Yeah, now we're talking! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every Christmas, for reasons which seem good at the time - especially after an eggnog or two - Max and the others leap into the nearest pod and indulge in their illegal Christmas jump. It's a tradition. This year, however, just to be different, they find themselves part of someone else's illegal Christmas jump. It's time to don a spacesuit and bring your own urine!</description>

  <description>A corrupt countess&lt;br /&gt;A spy in danger&lt;br /&gt;And an assassin at large&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fifth title in Genevieve Cogman's witty and wonderful Invisible Library series, The Mortal Word is a rollicking literary adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace talks are always tricky, especially when a key diplomat gets stabbed. This rudely interrupts a top-secret summit between the warring dragons and Fae. As a neutral party, Librarian-spy Irene is summoned to investigate. She must head to a version of 1890s Paris, with her assistant Kai and her detective friend Vale, where these talks are fracturing. Here, she must get to the bottom of the attack – before either the peace negotiations or the city go up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspicions fly thick and fast and Irene soon finds herself in the seedy depths of the Parisian underworld. She’s on the trail of a notoriously warlike Fae, the Blood Countess. However, the evidence against the Countess is circumstantial. Could the killer be a member of the Library itself?</description>

  <description>The second novel in the new, gripping supernatural thriller series from international bestselling author Jodi Taylor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the frying pan into the fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betrayed, terrified and alone, Elizabeth Cage has fled her home. With no plan and no friends, she arrives at the picturesque village of Greyston and finds herself involved in an ages-old ceremony that will end in death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that might be the least of her problems – the Sorensen Institute would very much like to know her whereabouts. And Michael Jones is still out there, somewhere, she hopes. No matter how far and how fast she can run, trouble will always find Elizabeth Cage.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The ghost of Sherlock Holmes is dead, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;but who will solve &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; murder?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Great Detective's ghost has walked London's streets for an age, given shape by people's memories. Now someone's put a ceremonial dagger through his chest. But what's the motive? And who - or what - could kill a ghost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When policing London's supernatural underworld, eliminating the impossible is not an option. DI James Quill and his detectives have learnt this the hard way. Gifted with the Sight, they'll pursue a criminal genius - who'll lure them into a Sherlockian maze of clues and evidence. The team also have their own demons to fight. They've been to Hell and back (literally) but now the unit is falling apart . . .</description>

  <description>Summer in London: a city in turmoil. The vicious murder of a well-known MP is like a match to tinder but Detective Inspector James Quill and his team know that it's not a run-of-the-mill homicide. Still coming to terms with their new-found second sight, they soon discover that what is invisible to others - the killer - is visible to them. Even if they have no idea who it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are more deaths. The bodies of rich, white men are found in circumstances similar to those that set the streets of London awash with fear during the late 1800s: the Whitechapel murders. Even with their abilities to see the supernatural, accepting that Jack the Ripper is back from the dead is a tough ask for Quill's team. As they try to get to grips with their abilities and a case that's spiralling out of control, Quill realizes that they have to understand more about this shadowy London, a world of underground meetings, bizarre and fantastical auctions, and objects that are 'get out of hell free' cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the team's unlikely guide, a bestselling author, can't offer them much insight - and their other option, the Rat King, speaks only in riddles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relying on old-fashioned police work and improvising with their new skills only lands them in deeper water, and they soon realize that the investigation is going to hell - literally. And if they're not careful, they may be going with it . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Severed Streets&lt;/i&gt; is the second urban fantasy by bestselling Doctor Who writer, Paul Cornell.</description>

  <description>A guarded heart is a lonely heart . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Piper Davies is a leading researcher in the fields of viruses and nanotechnology. All she ever wanted was to help save lives. But her newest creation has the potential to be manipulated to kill a single person, as well as launch a global pandemic if it ever landed in the wrong hands. And unfortunately, someone knows what she’s created and will stop at nothing to get it. Piper's family hires someone to protect her when the threats become dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Security specialist Aiden Creed knew all too well what someone would do to get their hands on Piper’s viral nanotech creation. His time in the British Army’s Special Air Service exposed him to the true evil that hid throughout the world. What he didn’t count on when he accepted this assignment was the danger Piper posed to his heart.</description>

  <description>Not one to let being banged up in Sick Bay stop her, Max has had a brilliant idea. But she needs Markham to execute it on her behalf. The subject of this cunning plan is Peterson, struggling with another bereavement and not doing very well. What’s needed to get him through it is sympathy, sensitivity, tact and understanding. &lt;br /&gt;Step forward Mr Markham, for whom sympathy, sensitivity, etc., are things that happen to other people. &lt;br /&gt;Combine a fanatic from R&amp;amp;D, a head of Security with his own problems, a steam-pump, two historians who can’t even be in the same room as each other, some fractious Protestants and a large body of very dirty water. &lt;br /&gt;Told in Markham’s own words, this is the story of an intervention – St Mary’s style.</description>

  <description>Book 5 - Deceased and Desist &lt;br /&gt;A Harley and Davidson Mystery &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Texas summers are hot. Really hot. Agatha Harley and Hank Davidson have been through one heck of a year. She’s hot off the heels of a successful book tour, and Hank’s been offered a high-profile crime consulting position back East. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Things have changed, but despite all their success, something isn't quite right. When Hank and Agatha decide to head to Montana in search of cooler weather, less adventure, and a little R&amp;amp;R, things really start to heat up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A killer Hank once put away has escaped and is hiding in Glacier National Park. It turns out a killer on the loose is a real wet blanket for their romantic camping trip. Agatha and Hank aren’t sure what they’ve gotten themselves into, but they’ve been through enough to know they’re better together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other Books In The Series: &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;The Farmer’s Slaughter &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;A Tisket A Casket &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;I Saw Mommy Killing Santa Claus &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 &lt;br /&gt;Get Your Murder Running &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 &lt;br /&gt;Deceased and Desist &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS: &lt;br /&gt;The dynamic husband and wife writing duo of Liliana Hart and Scott Silverii combine their love of adventure and storytelling into the Harley and Davidson Mystery Series. While they've discussed a team writing effort for years, when it came time to actually develop their characters, both admit to being stumped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why not write us they laughed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liliana, a 24-time NY Times and USA Today bestseller and author of over 52 titles,enjoys this labor of love with her husband. Scott, a former Chief of Police and law enforcement professional has over 25 years of banging down doors and busting bad guys. An author of 10 titles, he says this by far is his favorite mission. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together, they have created a lovable tandem of adventure seeking, mystery-solving heroes that you'll get to know and love. You might even catch a glimpse of Liliana and Scott in each story. Well, probably much more than a glimpse.</description>

      <![CDATA[What a rush! After the first chapter I was too afraid to keep on reading... <br />So much suspense building up along with tension between our main characters AND then the deaths! That second one, was just awful. <br />I can wait for the next book, pity 30 April 2019 is so far away...]]>

  <description>It's the Wild West. Or it might as well be. Cowboys, longhorns, and outlaw bikers still roam the land of the free. But not all are brave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank Davidson is retirement-challenged. Apparently, he's not good at anything but being a cop. But there's still one retirement dream he hasn't realized, and he hopes hitting the open road on his monster V-twin HOG will help alleviate his boredom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agatha Harley needs another hot case for her next novel. And when rival outlaw motorcycle gangs show up in their small Texas town, she thinks it's a story made in heaven. What better way to research than to go undercover, posing as Hank's old lady? But she soon discovers she's in a plot she might not be able to escape.</description>

  <description>Book 3 - I Saw Mommy Killing Santa Claus &lt;br /&gt;A Harley and Davidson Mystery &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the latest Harley &amp;amp; Davidson mystery, there's a new meaning to the twelve days of Christmas. Hank and Agatha stumble upon a serial killer who's rewriting Santa Claus’s naughty and nice list by knocking off big guys in red suits with beards. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hank isn't sure he believes this is a serial killer. Despite Agatha's insistence, he knows serial killers aren't as common as she'd like them to be for her research. Maybe deadline enthusiasm is making Agatha see this as more than it is.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Agatha knows her way around bodies, and the dead Santa's have too much in common not to be connected. Her real-world training as a forensic anthropologist pays off as she matches wits with law enforcement’s best, and a deviant killer’s worst. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other Books In The Series: &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;The Farmer’s Slaughter &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;A Tisket A Casket &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;I Saw Mommy Killing Santa Claus &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 &lt;br /&gt;Get Your Murder Running &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 &lt;br /&gt;Deceased and Desist &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS: &lt;br /&gt;The dynamic husband and wife writing duo of Liliana Hart and Scott Silverii combine their love of adventure and storytelling into the Harley and Davidson Mystery Series.

  <description>Book 2 - A Tisket A Casket &lt;br /&gt;A Harley and Davidson Mystery &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Friday night lights in the Lone Star State gives the term "sudden death" a whole new meaning.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Retired homicide detective Hank Davidson still struggles with civilian life. But he's trying. His latest attempt at a hobby leads him to discover the world of the outdoorsman, but it doesn't take long before he realizes he's much better at hunting man than animal. He was thinking about becoming a vegetarian anyway. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh off a new, high-pressure publishing contract and another solved cold case under her belt, Agatha Harley tempts Hank with an arson case that might have landed an innocent man in prison for murder. All the clues lead to those at the top, but money and power make it easy to get away with murder. Cracking this case won't be easy, but Hank and Agatha are on the job. After all, solving a crime is much easier than meeting a deadline or being retired. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other Books In The Series: &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;The Farmer’s Slaughter &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;A Tisket A Casket &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;I Saw Mommy Killing Santa Claus &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 &lt;br /&gt;Get Your Murder Running &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 &lt;br /&gt;Deceased and Desist &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS: &lt;br /&gt;The dynamic husband and wife writing duo of Liliana Hart and Scott Silverii combine their love of adventure and storytelling into the Harley and Davidson Mystery Series.

  <description>The dark is rising ...Detective Inspector James Quill is about to complete the drugs bust of his career. Then his prize suspect Rob Toshack is murdered in custody. Furious, Quill pursues the investigation, co-opting intelligence analyst Lisa Ross and undercover cops Costain and Sefton. But nothing about Toshack's murder is normal. Toshack had struck a bargain with a vindictive entity, whose occult powers kept Toshack one step ahead of the law -- until his luck ran out. Now, the team must find a 'suspect' who can bend space and time and alter memory itself. And they will kill again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the group starts to see London's sinister magic for themselves, they have two choices: panic or use their new abilities. Then they must hunt a terrifying supernatural force the only way they know how: using police methods, equipment and tactics. But they must all learn the rules of this new game - and quickly. More than their lives will depend on it.</description>

  <description>President Bill Clinton and bestselling novelist James Patterson have written a spellbinding thriller, &lt;i&gt;The President is Missing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the novel opens, a threat looms. Enemies are planning an attack of unprecedented scale on America. Uncertainty and fear grip Washington. There are whispers of cyberterror and espionage and a traitor in the cabinet. The President himself becomes a suspect, and then goes missing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in real time, over the course of three days, &lt;i&gt;The President Is Missing&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most dramatic thrillers in decades. And it could all really happen. The President Is Missing is Bill Clinton and James Patterson's totally authentic and spellbinding thriller.</description>

  <description>Book 1 - The Farmer’s Slaughter &lt;br /&gt;A Harley and Davidson Mystery &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Texas Hill Country promises to be anything but ordinary when bestselling mystery writer, Agatha Harley, begins researching her next novel. What she doesn't expect is for her research to lead her to her newly retired neighbor, Hank Davidson. She recognizes a cop when she sees one, and Hank doesn't look like her idea of retired, despite the black socks, sandals, and manicured lawn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hank needs a place to forget his past, but Agatha needs his past to secure her future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As an FBI trained profiler, Hank Davidson sees right through most people. But Agatha isn’t most people. She's as seasoned as any cop he knows and just as mouthy. It doesn't take long for him to get caught up in the cold case Agatha's using for research, but small town roots run deep, and loose lips will tell you anything you want to know--except who the killer is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other Books In The Series: &lt;br /&gt;Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;The Farmer’s Slaughter &lt;br /&gt;Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;A Tisket A Casket &lt;br /&gt;Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;I Saw Mommy Killing Santa Claus &lt;br /&gt;Book 4 &lt;br /&gt;Get Your Murder Running &lt;br /&gt;Book 5 &lt;br /&gt;Deceased and Desist &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS: &lt;br /&gt;The dynamic husband and wife writing duo of Liliana Hart and Scott Silverii combine their love of adventure and storytelling into the Harley and Davidson Mystery Series. While they've discussed a team writing effort for years, when it came time to actually develop their characters, both admit to being stumped. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why not write us they laughed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liliana, a 24-time NY Times and USA Today bestseller and author of over 52 titles,enjoys this labor of love with her husband. Scott, a former Chief of Police and law enforcement professional has over 25 years of banging down doors and busting bad guys. An author of 10 titles, he says this by far is his favorite mission. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Together, they have created a lovable tandem of adventure seeking, mystery-solving heroes that you'll get to know and love. You might even catch a glimpse of Liliana and Scott in each story. Well, probably much more than a glimpse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;The Meryl Streep Movie Club&lt;/i&gt;, “a heartwarming, spirit-lifting read just in time for beach season” (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;), comes a new novel about three women, connected in secret and surprising ways, who are in for a life-changing summer when rumor has it that actor Colin Firth is coming to their Maine town to film a movie. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her job and leaving her beloved husband, journalist Gemma Hendricks is sure that scoring an interview with Colin Firth will save her career and marriage. Yet a heart-tugging local story about women, family ties, love, and loss captures her heart— and changes everything. The story concerns Bea Crane, a floundering twenty-two-year-old who learns in a deathbed confession letter that she was adopted at birth. Bea is in Boothbay Harbor to surreptitiously observe her biological mother, Veronica Russo—something of a legend in town—who Bea might not be ready to meet after all. Veronica, a thirty-eight-year-old diner waitress famous for her “healing” pies, has come home to Maine to face her past. But when she’s hired as an extra on the bustling movie set, she wonders if she is hiding from the truth . . . and perhaps the opportunity of a real-life Mr. Darcy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These three women will discover more than they ever imagined in this coastal Maine town, buzzing with hopes of Colin Firth. Even the conjecture of his arrival inspires daydreams, amplifies complicated lives, and gives incentive to find their own romantic endings.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;SHE PLANNED HER OWN FUNERAL. BUT DID SHE ARRANGE HER OWN MURDER?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman is strangled six hours after organising her own funeral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did she know she was going to die? Did she recognise her killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Hawthorne, a recalcitrant detective with secrets of his own, is on the case, together with his reluctant side-kick – a man completely unaccustomed to the world of crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even Hawthorne isn't prepared for the twists and turns in store – as unexpected as they are bloody...&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buried secrets, murder and a trail of bloody clues lie at the heart of Anthony Horowitz’s page-turning new detective series. If you enjoyed BBC’s Sherlock, you’ll LOVE The Word is Murder. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chosen as one of &lt;i&gt;Crime Time&lt;/i&gt;'s books of the year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;'Raises the game-playing to Olympic level' – &lt;i&gt;Guardian &lt;/i&gt;Books of the Year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'A real page-turner. I loved it!' – ALED JONES (ITV, &lt;i&gt;Weekend&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'The beguiling whodunit plot is dispatched with characteristic elan as Horowitz blurs the line between fact and fiction' – &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Splendidly entertaining, absorbing and difficult to put down. Hawthorne is an intriguing character' – &lt;i&gt;Daily Express&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Sharp-witted readers who think they've solved the puzzle early on can rest assured that they've opened only one of many dazzling Christmas packages Horowitz has left beautifully wrapped under the tree' – &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Deduction and wit are well-balanced, and fans of Peter Lovesey and other modern channelers of the spirit of the golden age of detection will clamor for more' – &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[What a thrill! Although this is the fourth book in the series, it is the first Eddie Flynn book I've read. In hindsight, there were so many clues, but also so many distractions.

  <description>It's 1946 and author Juliet Ashton can't think what to write next. Out of the blue, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey - by chance, he's acquired a book that once belonged to her - and, spurred on by their mutual love of reading, they begin a correspondence. When Dawsey reveals that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, her curiosity is piqued and it's not long before she begins to hear from other members. As letters fly back and forth with stories of life in Guernsey under the German Occupation, Juliet soon realizes that the society is every bit as extraordinary as its name.</description>

  <description>Layne Davies needed a break—a break from the busy bodies in her small town of Keeneston, Kentucky and a break from dating men who turned into scared little boys upon meeting her father. That’s why she was so excited to have been invited to speak at a medical conference in Charleston, South Carolina. Never did she think her whole life would change the second she stepped on that stage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Walker Greene can’t talk about his job. He can’t talk about what happened that one night off the coast of Nigeria when his team was ambushed. No one would believe him even if he could talk about it. But his training kept him alive until he was able to sneak back into his small hometown of Shadows Landing, South Carolina. But when people show up looking for Walker, he has no choice but to listen to his best friend, Dr. Gavin Faulkner, and turn to a total stranger for help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Layne may be Gavin Faulkner’s estranged cousin, but that doesn’t mean she’ll drop everything to work with someone who Gavin refuses to tell her anything about . . . until she sees Walker Greene. All her protective instincts come alive upon seeing the wounded soldier and Layne knows there’s only one place to keep him safe—Keeneston. Walker becomes a hunted man, and Layne is determined to keep him safe as she finds herself drawn to him more and more each day.</description>

  <description>Based on interviews that were conducted with Holocaust survivor and Auschwitz-Birkenau tattooist Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov—a love story in the midst of atrocity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a &lt;i&gt;Tätowierer&lt;/i&gt; (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.</description>

  <description>It's not easy being a rebel. So many new skills to assimilate. Never mind strategic planning, weapons expertise and the like - there's bicycle-stealing, oil-stain removal and boat steering to be mastered first.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And quickly.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's the time of the Civil Uprisings and two young women set out to make a difference. Their only problem? They don't know where they are.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or where they're going.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Or what to do when they get there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that. . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fans of St Mary's will enjoy this glimpse into the past of some of their favourite characters.</description>

  <description>Behind the seemingly innocuous facade of St. Mary’s Institute of Historical Research, a different kind of academic work is taking place. Just don’t call it “time travel”―these historians “investigate major historical events in contemporary time.” And they aren’t your harmless eccentrics either; a more accurate description, as they ricochet around history, might be unintentional disaster-magnets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Tudor England to the burning city of Persepolis, from a medieval St. Mary’s under siege to Victorian Rushford and a very nasty case of gaol fever, Max is struggling to keep her private life intact. There’s an ambitious programme hindered by giant teapots, plus Mrs. Midgely’s objection to dead hamsters in her airing cupboard, and Mr. Markham’s stubborn refusal to reveal his exact marital status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as if that’s not enough―the unfortunately not leprosy-laden Malcolm Halcombe is back. Admittedly, none of this is the most secure platform from which to launch an initiative to bring down the renegade Clive Ronan, but hey―what’s the worst that could happen?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A small town hides big secrets in this atmospheric, page-turning debut mystery by award-winning author Jane Harper.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the grip of the worst drought in a century, the farming community of Kiewarra is facing life and death choices daily when three members of a local family are found brutally slain.&lt;br /&gt;Federal Police investigator Aaron Falk reluctantly returns to his hometown for the funeral of his childhood friend, loath to face the townsfolk who turned their backs on him twenty years earlier. &lt;br /&gt;But as questions mount, Falk is forced to probe deeper into the deaths of the Hadler family. Because Falk and Luke Hadler shared a secret. A secret Falk thought was long buried. A secret Luke's death now threatens to bring to the surface in this small Australian town, as old wounds in bleed into new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Close To Me&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping debut psychological drama that will appeal to fans of Liane Moriarty's bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Husband's Secret&lt;/i&gt;, Clare Mackintosh's &lt;i&gt;I Let You Go&lt;/i&gt;, and Linda Green's &lt;i&gt;While My Eyes Were Closed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can't remember the last year. Her husband wants to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jo Harding falls down the stairs at home, she wakes up in hospital with partial amnesia-she's lost a whole year of memories. A lot can happen in a year. Was Jo having an affair? Lying to her family? Starting a new life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can't remember what she did-or what happened the night she fell. But she's beginning to realise she might not be as good a wife and mother as she thought.</description>

  <description>After years of following her navy officer husband on assignment around the world with their three children, Grace Bennett realizes that she's left something behind—herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Bennett can't understand the unraveling of his wife's heart. He wants to set things right, but when a secret from his past is revealed just as he's sent out to sea, their already-strained relationship is pushed to the edge. Now, with plenty of space to ponder the true distance between them, Grace begins to reinvent herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as her new self is coming to terms with her family life, the unthinkable happens. A disaster aboard Steve's ship shatters Grace's world and all she can do is gather her children around and wait for news to come, good or bad. A navy wife's worst nightmare collides with the cold truth that life's biggest chances can slip away while you're busy looking for guarantees.</description>

  <description>No two victims are alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DI Marnie Rome knows this better than most. Five years ago, her family home was the scene of a shocking and bloody crime that left her parents dead and her foster brother in prison. Marnie doesn’t talk much about her personal life, preferring to focus on work. Not even her partner, DS Noah Jake, knows much about Marnie’s past. Though as one of the few gay officers on the force and half Jamaican to boot, Noah’s not one to overshare about his private life either. Now Marnie and Noah are tackling a case of domestic violence, and a different brand of victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Proctor stabbed her husband in desperate self-defense. A crowd of witnesses in the domestic violence shelter where she’s staying saw it happen, but none of them are telling quite the same story, and the simple question remains: how did Leo Proctor get in to the secure shelter? Marnie and Noah shouldn’t even have been there when it happened but they were interviewing another resident, Ayana Mirza. They’re trying to get Ayana to testify against her brothers for pouring bleach on her face for bringing dishonor to the family, and blinding her in one eye. But Ayana knows that her brothers are looking for her, and she has no doubt that they’ll kill her this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the violence spirals, engulfing the residents of the women's shelter, Marnie finds herself drawn into familiar territory: A place where the past casts long shadows and she must tread carefully to survive.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;The Ultra-Secret Unit That Posed As Nazi Stormtroopers&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;The Most Daring Mission Ever Undertaken&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SAS Ghost Patrol&lt;/i&gt; is the explosive true story of the day in 1942 when the SAS donned Nazi uniforms to perpetrate the most audacious and daring mission of the war. Beyond top secret, deniable in the extreme (and of course enjoying Churchill's enthusiastic blessing), this is one of the most remarkable stories of wartime lawlessness, eccentricity and raw courage in the face of impossible odds - a thoroughly British undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What unfolded - the longest mission ever undertaken by Allied special forces - was an epic of daring, courage, tragedy and survival that remains unrivalled to this day, and which rightly became a foundation stone of Special Forces legend. Written with Lewis's signature authenticity and dramatic verve, &lt;i&gt;SAS Ghost Patrol&lt;/i&gt; is peopled by a cast of the utterly maverick and the extraordinary. In its quirky eccentricities and outrageous rule-breaking, this is a story that only the British could have authored, and with such panache and aplomb. It may read like the stuff of impossible myth or folklore, but every single word is true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Liliana Hart comes a new story in her MacKenzie Family series… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MacKenzie vs. MacKenzie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole MacKenzie is content to be the sheriff of Surrender, Montana, but he’s needed for a greater purpose. The United States needs a U.S. Marshal with a certain kind of experience to track the leader of the notorious Silver Creek Bandits, as they leave a trail of bodies in their wake with every bank they rob. The leader is smart, cunning, and ruthless. And he's also his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth MacKenzie never dreamed she’d marry Cole MacKenzie, but thanks to her father’s meddling, Cole was hers to have and to hold. Forever. She needed an equal, not a man to rule her life, and Cole fit the bill every in every way. If only he loved her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One heart is broken and the other is bent on revenge, but love is a choice, and it's one Cole and Elizabeth are determined to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**</description>

  <description>It is 1891, and London is still reeling from the horror of the unsolved Jack the Ripper murders when Inspector Sholto Lestrade is sent to the Isle of Wight to investigate a strange corpse found walled up in Shanklin Cline. Lestrade whirls from ballroom and barroom, from vicarage to spiritualist gather, from the studio of the celebrated Alma-Tadema to 221B Baker Street with spell-binding panache.</description>

  <description>At a gala party thrown by her parents, Evelyn Hardcastle will be killed--again. She's been murdered hundreds of times, and each day, Aiden Bishop is too late to save her. Doomed to repeat the same day over and over, Aiden's only escape is to solve Evelyn Hardcastle's murder and conquer the shadows of an enemy he struggles to even comprehend--but nothing and no one are quite what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply atmospheric and ingeniously plotted, &lt;i&gt;The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle&lt;/i&gt; is a highly original debut that will appeal to fans of Kate Atkinson and Agatha Christie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also titled as The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Fahrenheit 451 ofrece la historia de un sombrío y horroroso futuro. Montag, el protagonista, pertenece a una extraña brigada de bomberos cuya misión, paradójicamente, no es la de sofocar incendios sino la de provocarlos, para quemar libros. Porque en el país de Montag está terminantemente prohibido leer. Porque leer obliga a pensar, y en el país de Montag esta prohibido pensar. Porque leer impide ser ingenuamente feliz, y en el país de Montag hay que ser feliz a la fuerza...</description>

  <description>"It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas – this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart. Based on the life of the author, it is by any measure the debut of an extraordinary voice in literature.</description>

As a study of human nature and the choices we make, based on the people we surround ourselves with, this is a must read. <br /><br />I did not look at this as an autobiographical piece of writing and there...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The First Farrell Family Christmas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Max, Leon and Matthew - together at last for Christmas at St Mary's - a time of conspicuous consumption, riotous misbehaviour and the traditional illegal Christmas jump. And this time, it's inter-generational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Donning her unfamiliar mother hat, Max takes Matthew back to 19th century London, where they plan to deliver a parcel of Christmas cheer to his former friends, but find themselves confronting the terrifying Old Ma Scrope in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 'Tis the season to be jolly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It's also the season of goodwill towards all mankind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pity no one told Max.</description>

  <description>A covert mission&lt;br /&gt;A royal demand&lt;br /&gt;And a race against time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth title in Genevieve Cogman's witty and wonderful The Invisible Library series, The Lost Plot is an action-packed literary adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a 1930s-esque New York, Prohibition is in force, fedoras, flapper dresses and tommy guns are in fashion, and intrigue is afoot. Intrepid Librarians Irene and Kai find themselves caught in the middle of a dragon vs dragon contest. It seems a young librarian has become tangled in this conflict, and if they can't extricate him there could be serious political repercussions for the mysterious Library. And, as the balance of power across mighty factions hangs in the balance, this could even trigger war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene and Kai find themselves trapped in a race against time (and dragons) to procure a rare book. They'll face gangsters, blackmail and fiendish security systems. And if this doesn't end well, it could have dire consequences for Irene's job. And, incidentally, for her life . . .</description>

  <description>The time has come to step out of the shadows . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Valeria McGregor was a better shot, a better fighter, and smarter than everyone she’d ever gone up against as an agent for the DEA. Then she’d uncovered illegal activity within her own organization and was fired as part of a cover-up. That was how she’d joined the secret group who reports only to the president. Valeria fully plans to find the men and women hell bent on ruling the world from the shadows, but she also has revenge on the mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Valeria left the secret team thinking she could go undercover and get to the bottom of how this shadow group was funded. Valeria discovered too late that when it comes to true evil, it’s best to face it with your team at your back. Alone and on the run, Valeria is being hunted by some of the most dangerous people on the planet. She has learned how the shadow group has been funded and what they have planned next, but she still has to find out where. If the shadow group pulls it off, then there may be no stopping them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Desperate to escape, Valeria calls her team only to find they aren’t close enough to help her. Grant Macay, a trusted Air Force Pararescueman, is brought into the fold and sent to rescue Valeria. With her past at the DEA alive and threatening her survival, and the world’s most vicious drug lord hunting her, Valeria and Grant must make their way back to the team to prepare for the battle of their lives.</description>

  <description>The web has begun to untangle. Elizabeth James has been working in the shadows to take down the group that has quietly snatched power in nearly every part of society. But now, Elizabeth is no longer alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tate Carlisle was a respected television journalist until an investigation of the wrong person cut her career short. She may be off the air, but she’s not off the job. President Birch Stratton has tapped her as the newest member of Elizabeth’s growing shadow team. And now it’s Tate’s turn to pull some strings. Her latest lead has Tate back in the media game where the truth is rarely what’s reported. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tate finds herself deep in the secret world of journalism with payoffs, affairs, and buried stories. Split-second decisions are now a matter of life and death . . . but will the next lead story be about her death or those she cares about?</description>

There is action, romance and strong men and women working side by side for truth, justice and the American Way.<br />I cannot wait to see what happens next, in fact, it’s already been pre-ordered.]]>

  <description>Can love find a way when truth is concealed? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gabe Ali Rahman is the standby heir to the crown and he’s okay with that. So what that he’s gotten the reputation of being a playboy prince? He’s had a lot of fun along the way. But now he wants more in life than casual flings. When his king asks him to negotiate a peace treaty, Gabe sees his chance to prove himself as something more than tabloid fodder. But when he rescues a woman from unwanted attention at a bar late one night, Gabe conceals his identity. He could never imagine the connection he would form, and the trouble that came with that little white lie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sloane Holiday just wanted to keep her nose down as she finished her Master’s degree. Without the help from the family she left behind, Sloane depended on waitressing at night to pay for school. Everything was going according to plan until one night someone noticed her. Sloane was rescued by a dark and handsome man whose touch left her realizing just how alone she really was. The unwanted attention eventually led to gunshots . . . and this mysterious man now insisting on protecting her. Can Gabe and Sloane survive when truths are concealed or can love conquer all?</description>

  <description>This book is an update of the ongoing Bluegrass, Bluegrass Brothers, and Forever Bluegrass series. If you haven’t read the books in those series, then it is recommended that you start with Bluegrass State of Mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You’re invited to the Rose sisters’ Surprise Hundredth Birthday Party! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What do the people of Keeneston do when they find out the Rose sisters’ one hundredth birthday is only days away? Try to throw one heck of a surprise party that even John Wolfe couldn’t see coming! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come back to Keeneston for a visit with each of your favorite couples and their children as they all try to pull off the seemingly impossible—surprise the Rose sisters. Will the Rose sisters be too distracted with all of the other gossip to notice the biggest happening in Keeneston’s history or will they blow the surprise? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I won’t describe what I look like. Whatever you’re thinking, it’s probably worse. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1 New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0375869026 (ISBN13: 9780375869020)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; From the bestselling author of The Chronicles of St Mary's. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Nothing Girl has grown up… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s life as usual at Frogmorton Farm – which is to say that events have passed the merely eccentric and are now galloping headlong towards the completely bizarre. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once again Jenny struggles to stay afloat in the stormy seas of matrimony with her husband, Russell Checkland, together with an unlikely mix of Patagonian Attack Chickens, Jack the Sad Donkey, and Mrs Crisp’s mysterious boyfriend. The old favourites are still around, of course. There’s Marilyn the Omnivorous Donkey, Russell’s ex-girlfriend Don’t Call Me Franny, and the neurotic Boxer, currently failing to deal with butterfly trauma. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So nothing much is new … except for the mysterious figure dogging Jenny’s steps and who, if she didn’t know better, she would swear was her sinister cousin Christopher, last seen being hurled from the house by her wayward husband. He couldn’t possibly be stupid enough to come back and try again … Could he?</description>

  <description>Sophie Davies has a secret . . . in fact, she has quite a few secrets. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sophie Davies is the head of weapon development for a private firm contracted with the Department of Defense. Because of her knowledge and high security clearances, she has kept her job a secret for fear of kidnapping and sabotage. She always knew some groups would kill to learn what she knows, and now someone is trying to do just that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nash Dagher trained to become an elite weapon for the Rahmi Royal Family while he served at their horse farm in Keeneston. But for the past two years, Nash has been running an operation for the King—an operation once completed would result in his promotion to the head of security for the entire royal family in Rahmi. But when Nash discovers a threat against Sophie, he must decide what is more important: the job of a dreams or the life of the woman he loves. But will Sophie allow him back in her life?</description>

  <description>Aurora Sky narrowly escapes death only to end up as a vampire hunter with unusual cravings and heightened desires. To protect the people she loves, she will have to make sacrifices, and evade the biggest threat of all . . . a forbidden love. Fast-paced and full of twists, the Aurora Sky series takes an entirely new, sci-fi approach to what it means to be a vampire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AURORA SKY (Volume 1) &lt;br /&gt;If there is one thing eighteen-year-old Aurora Sky wants, it's to get off the iceberg she calls home. Then a near-fatal car wreck changes everything. Government agents step in and save Aurora's life in exchange for her services as a vampire hunter. In Alaska. Basically she's a glorified chew toy. All thanks to her rare blood type, which sends a vampire into temporary paralysis right before she has to finish the job . . . by hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Aurora's stuck with an overzealous partner, a group of misfit friends, and a maddening attraction to a rebellious man keeping secrets of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NORTHERN BITES (Volume 2) &lt;br /&gt;Love bites. &lt;br /&gt;Probation sucks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Dante’s recklessness, Aurora is now partners with Valerie: the redheaded, backstabbing vixen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dante is in full flirt mode. Fane’s tactics are more ruthless. Something carnal has awakened in Aurora and neither boy is helping tame her cravings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a member of the unit’s team is found dead, Aurora and Valerie are sent after a vampire in Sitka, but Aurora suspects the killer’s much closer to home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;STAKEOUT (Volume 2.5) &lt;br /&gt;Noel Harper got a second chance at life when the government recruited her as an undercover vampire informant. Since the day they brought her back from the good-as-dead, she has wanted to prove herself worthy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a member of her investigative unit is murdered, Noel is paired up with a vampire hunter named Dante to spy on a suspect in Fairbanks. The problem? They're not the only ones on stakeout. Taking down murderous vampires is one thing. Dealing with the past is another. But this time, Noel isn't letting fear win. She's calling in help from the other side and discovers a shocking secret along the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BAD BLOOD (Volume 3) &lt;br /&gt;Aurora returns from boot camp to a new assignment, an unwelcome roommate, and the increasingly amorous attentions of a certain vampire hunter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;College is starting, and so is Aurora’s undercover work at a network of swanky parties known as “Tastings” for high rolling vampires who like their blood laced with fine wine. But Aurora’s not the only one on the prowl. An underground investigation is under way to find out who killed one of Anchorage’s most prominent vampires… and Aurora is a prime suspect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AURORA SKY SERIES READING ORDER &lt;br /&gt;Aurora Sky (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 1) &lt;br /&gt;Northern Bites (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 2) &lt;br /&gt;Stakeout (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 2.5) &lt;br /&gt;Evil Red (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 2.6) &lt;br /&gt;Bad Blood (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 3) &lt;br /&gt;Hunting Season (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 4) &lt;br /&gt;Night of the Living Dante (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 4.5) &lt;br /&gt;Whiteout (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 5) &lt;br /&gt;True North (Aurora Sky: Vampire Hunter, Vol. 6) - Final Volume &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love bites . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big time. And probation sucks, especially when it means I'm forced to partner up with a redheaded, backstabbing vixen. I can thank Dante for that fun little treat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of my reckless "mentor", he's in full flirt mode. Fane's tactics are far more ruthless, but what can you expect from a boy who bites?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something carnal has awakened in me and neither boy is helping tame my cravings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A member of our unit's team has been murdered and now Valerie and I are being sent after a suspicious vampire in Sitka, along with our psycho chaperone, Jared. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the killer's much closer to home…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I could be the next target, which leads me back to how my discovery all started: LOVE BITES!</description>

  <description>"It's like Buffy on steroids." - Benjaminoftomes, YouTube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My blood is toxic to vampires . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there's one thing I want, it's go get off this iceberg. I'm thinking college on the east coast. ANYWHERE besides Alaska. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a near-fatal car wreck changes everything. Government agents jump in and save my life in exchange for my services as a vampire hunter. Did they just say vampires? Yep. And they're not the kind that sparkle. They're rabid, disgusting, rude . . . and way too suave. Those are the ones I really have to watch out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A knife isn't my only weapon. My rare blood type sends vampires into temporary paralysis right before I have to finish the job by hand. Basically I'm a glorified chew toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I'm stuck with an overzealous partner, a group of suck junkies, and a maddening attraction to Mr. Joe Cool, dresses all in black, Fane Donado. I don't know if I want to punch him or kiss him, but clearly he's keeping secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The old Aurora is gone forever. Destroyed in the wreckage. I don’t know who I am anymore, only that I suddenly have intense cravings and a V.I.P. pass into Alaska’s underworld. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If vampires found out who I worked for it would be lights out forever. In the meantime, I have some undead ass to kick so long as it doesn't kick mine first.</description>

  <description>Alternate Cover edition for ISBN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25879546-miss-peregrine-s-home-for-peculiar-children" rel="nofollow"&gt;9781594744761&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of very curious photographs. It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow-impossible though it seems-they may still be alive. A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: This is the original cover edition of ASIN: B00N9JVRUQ. The alternate cover edition is &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41146514._here" title=" here" rel="nofollow"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Protecting Caroline is a stand-alone love story. It’s Book 1 in the SEAL of Protection Series.** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew “Wolf” Steel hated flying commercial. Luckily his job as a Navy SEAL meant he didn’t have to do it very often. He’d been unlucky enough to be assigned a middle seat on the cramped jet, but fortunately for him, the woman next to him was willing to switch seats with him. Hoping for a relaxing flight, Wolf was pleasantly surprised at the good conversation and sense of humor the woman had as they flew 36,000 feet over the countryside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Caroline boarded the plane to Virginia to move across the country for her new job she never expected to be seated next to the hottest guy she’d ever seen. She also never expected he’d be so easy to talk to. She knew he’d never be interested in talking to her if he hadn’t been trapped in the seat next to her, but it was a nice way to spend a long plane ride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither Wolf nor Caroline were prepared for a terrorist hijacking of their plane, but if Caroline thought that would be the last time she’d see, or need, Wolf, she’d be sorely mistaken. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start the SEAL of Protection Series with Caroline and Wolf's story</description>

  <description>The Gravediggers aren’t exactly what they seem. They’re the most elite of the world’s fighting forces—and all they have in common is that they’ve been betrayed by the countries they’ve died for. Because they are dead. To their country, their military, and their families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the dead do rise....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller Darling is one of the most popular romance novelists of her time. Not bad for a woman who doesn’t believe in romance. She’s as logical as they come, and she doesn’t believe in happily-ever-afters. What she does believe in is family, so when her brother disappears, she doesn’t think twice about packing her bag and her laptop and heading out to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elias Cole lived and breathed the life of a Navy SEAL. Now he’s “dead” and his hero’s honor tarnished. The only thing keeping him sane are the men who are like him—The Gravediggers—and the woman who makes his head spin. He’s never met anyone like Miller Darling. Her smart mouth and quick wit keep him on his toes, and damned if he doesn’t find that appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Miller receives a package from the brother who abandoned her asking for help, it’s clear she’s in over her head with the mess he’s gotten himself into. She needs a professional, and Elias is just the man for the job. Only her brother is a former SEAL—the man who left his team to die—and Elias is more interested in vengeance than saving his life.</description>

  <description>Northern Exposure &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even in Grundy, Alaska, it's unusual to find a naked guy with a bear trap clamped to his ankle on your porch. But when said guy turns into a wolf, recent southern transplant Mo Wenstein has no difficulty identifying the problem. Her surly neighbor Cooper Graham—who has been openly critical of Mo's ability to adapt to life in Alaska—has trouble of his own. Werewolf trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cooper, an Alpha in self-imposed exile from his dysfunctional pack, it's love at first sniff when it comes to Mo. But Cooper has an even more pressing concern on his mind. Several people around Grundy have been the victims of wolf attacks, and since Cooper has no memory of what he gets up to while in werewolf form, he's worried that he might be the violent canine in question. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a wolf cries wolf, it makes sense to listen, yet Mo is convinced that Cooper is not the culprit. Except if he's not responsible, then who is? And when a werewolf falls head over haunches in love with you, what are you supposed to do anyway? The rules of dating just got a whole lot more complicated. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Liliana Hart’s first book in her suspenseful Gravediggers series, featuring an elite group of mysterious men who might be dead to the world, but are also tasked with saving it—and no one can ever know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Gravediggers aren’t exactly what they seem. They’re the most elite of the world’s fighting forces—and all they have in common is that they’ve been betrayed by the countries they’ve died for. Because they are dead. To their country, their military, and their families.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes the dead do rise...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deacon Tucker is a dead man walking. A former black ops agent, he was disavowed and stripped of all honor before being recruited as a Gravedigger. But his honor and good name no longer matter, because no one knows he’s alive, and he’ll never get the recognition he deserves. His mission is simple: save the world or die trying. And for God’s sake, don’t ever fall in love. That’s a rule punishable by death. The kind of death a man can’t be brought back from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess Sherman is the only mortician in Last Stop, Texas. She has no idea how Deacon Tucker ended up in her funeral home, but she’ll eat her hat if he’s only a funeral home assistant. Deacon is dangerous, deadly, and gorgeous. And she knows her attraction to him can only end in heartache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deacon is on a mission to stop the most fatal terror attack the world has ever known—what’s known as The Day of Destiny—a terrorist’s dream. But when he discovers Tess has skills he can use to stop them, he has to decide if he can trust her with secrets worth dying for. And, most important, he has to decide if he can trust her with his heart.</description>

  <description>The Shadowhunters of Los Angeles star in the first novel in Cassandra Clare’s newest series, The Dark Artifices, a sequel to the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series. &lt;i&gt;Lady Midnight&lt;/i&gt; is a Shadowhunters novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been five years since the events of &lt;i&gt;City of Heavenly Fire&lt;/i&gt; that brought the Shadowhunters to the brink of oblivion. Emma Carstairs is no longer a child in mourning, but a young woman bent on discovering what killed her parents and avenging her losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with her parabatai Julian Blackthorn, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches across Los Angeles, from the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica. If only her heart didn’t lead her in treacherous directions…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making things even more complicated, Julian’s brother Mark—who was captured by the faeries five years ago—has been returned as a bargaining chip. The faeries are desperate to find out who is murdering their kind—and they need the Shadowhunters’ help to do it. But time works differently in faerie, so Mark has barely aged and doesn’t recognize his family. Can he ever truly return to them? Will the faeries really allow it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Glitz, glamours, and Shadowhunters abound in this heartrending opening to Cassandra Clare’s Dark Artifices series.</description>

  <description>Troy and Dmitri have worked everything out - well, almost everything. Except for the part where Troy's family doesn't know Dmitri exists. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Troy's been out of the Army for almost a year, and except for a few short weeks, hasn't been back to West Virginia at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Christmas is coming, and his mother can't be put off any longer, not unless Troy wants to break her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Troy's biggest fear is that going home, new boyfriend and service dog in tow, is going to break his Momma's heart just as much.</description>

It definitely has what you're looking for! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE PROFESSOR, I NEED AN A&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Upon discovering that her failing term paper grade could jeopardize her academic scholarship at the end of her freshman year, 18-year-old Kylie goes to talk to her beautiful English Professor to see what she can do to change her grade and save her college career. Professor Martine, 45 years old, sultry and fit, proposes that Kylie meet her at home that evening so that they can trade... an A grade for a night with Kylie. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After discussing this indecent proposal with her roommate, Kylie decides that she's actually quite interested and excited by her Professor's advances. She practices kissing with her roommate to get a feeling of how it is to be with a woman and she agrees to meet her Professor that evening and bend to her will. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How will Kylie handle this first time experience with a woman? Will her fear and trepidation get the better of her? Or will she earn her A grade and get to stay in college? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 4000 word short story contains a lesbian bi-curious first time experience, some kissing practice between roommates, an indecent proposal, fingers flying, and a sloppy and slurping mouthful of pleasure from an older woman to her budding young student. You're sure to enjoy this sensual, coming-of-age romp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE PROFESSOR, LET ME STAY&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After being pleasured by her sultry 45 year old Professor in the previous episode, 18 year old Kylie wakes up on Jen's couch and considers her first time lesbian experience. Jen soon rejoins her and they talk about Jen's first time thoughts and calm Kylie's nerves. Eventually, Jen convinces Kylie that it's all right to stay the night and the two head to her bedroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With Jen's coaching, Kylie has her first experience giving oral pleasure to another woman and finds that she enjoys it, wanting so bad to make her Professor happy. But Kylie's in for a squirting surprise after Jen gets over-aroused and taken to completion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 3600 word short story contains a lesbian bi-curious first time experience, tender make out scenes, fingers flying, a slurping mouthful of pleasure as a young college student learns from her older professor, and a lusty squirting scene.

After 45-year-old Professor Jen leaves for her office, Kylie slips into some of Jen's panties and pleasures herself with Jen's vibrating toy. Then Kylie leaves Jen a little present in her panty drawer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once Jen returns, the two discuss the possibility of Kylie staying up at college over summer and living in Jen's house. This discussion leads to making out on the couch and Jen, unable to help herself, proceeds to pleasure Kylie with her fingers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This 3400 word short story contains a lesbian bi-curious first time experience, tender make out scenes, some self-pleasure, and an older woman professor pleasuring her younger college student. You're sure to enjoy this sensual, coming-of-age romp.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Wreckless... Where obsession and rebellion collide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridget Larson's never met a rule she didn’t like. Drawing inside the lines isn’t just a way of life – it’s the only way she can make it through the day. And through it all her BFF Leah has stood inside the lines with her through the unspeakable. Then Bridget catches her boyfriend with Leah--and the last thing on her mind is staying safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salvation... A bad boy and his jacked up pickup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Moore was everything she needed and nothing he claimed to be. With one night of freedom and a spontaneously scribbled Rebellion List, Jake leads Bridget down every path she thought was forbidden... And into the one place she'd thought was lost to her forever.</description>

  <description>On a sullen, cloudy July day ten years since 7/7, the happy, confident and optimistic British Prime Minister is visiting a charity in East London. It's just two months after the general election which saw John Campbell's government returned to power with a clear majority, the economy is on the mend and the coalition is fast becoming a bad memory. Suddenly, a man appears out of the crowd and shoots him three times in the chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step forward Alex Cartwright (Andrew Scott), MI5 Chief Counter Terrorism Officer who must find out the truth. But it's easier said than done, as he discovers that whoever ordered the assassination has covered their tracks very well indeed. Along with Ellen Townsend, his trusted second-in-command, Cartwright finds himself embroiled in a race against time which leads him into the murky heart of Westminster...and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the pen of renowned screenwriter and novelist M J Arlidge, featuring an established British cast and with an exclusively-composed musical score, Six Degrees of Assassination is truly a thriller not to be missed.</description>

  <description>An approved textbook at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry since publication, Newt Scamander's masterpiece has entertained wizarding families through the generations. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is an indispensable introduction to the magical beasts of the Wizarding World. Scamander's years of travel and research have created a tome of unparalleled importance. Some of the beasts will be familiar to readers of the Harry Potter books - the Hippogriff, the Basilisk, the Hungarian Horntail ... Others will surprise even the most ardent amateur Magizoologist. This is an essential companion to the Harry Potter stories, and includes a new foreword from J.K. Rowling (writing as Newt Scamander) and six new beasts!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Kane and Abel&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Prisoner of Birth&lt;/i&gt; comes &lt;i&gt;Only Time Will Tell&lt;/i&gt;, the first in an ambitious new series that tells the story of one family across generations, across oceans, from heartbreak to triumph.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;The epic tale of Harry Clifton’s life begins in 1920, with the words “I was told that my father was killed in the war.” A dock worker in Bristol, Harry never knew his father, but he learns about life on the docks from his uncle, who expects Harry to join him at the shipyard once he’s left school. But then an unexpected gift wins him a scholarship to an exclusive boys’ school, and his life will never be the same again.&lt;p&gt;As he enters into adulthood, Harry finally learns how his father really died, but the awful truth only leads him to question, was he even his father? Is he the son of Arthur Clifton, a stevedore who spent his whole life on the docks, or the firstborn son of a scion of West Country society, whose family owns a shipping line?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This introductory novel in Archer’s ambitious series The Clifton Chronicles includes a cast of colorful characters and takes us from the ravages of the Great War to the outbreak of the Second World War, when Harry must decide whether to take up a place at Oxford or join the navy and go to war with Hitler’s Germany. From the docks of working-class England to the bustling streets of 1940 New York City, &lt;i&gt;Only Time Will Tell&lt;/i&gt; takes readers on a journey through to future volumes, which will bring to life one hundred years of recent history to reveal a family story that neither the reader nor Harry Clifton himself could ever have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>FAST:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;br /&gt;Former United States Army Green Beret, Joe Boxer, is part of a little known specialized tactical unit inside the DEA. He not only lost his leg in Middle Eastern combat, but also his partner at the hands of a corrupt puppet regime placed in power by soiled American interests. Boxer is now forced to lead the battle against domestic terrorism in a war he never imagined fighting on U.S. soil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blue-collar veteran struggles with an amputee’s challenge, but doesn’t succumb to it as he battles his way onto DEA’s elite FAST Team 5. Boxer’s challenges with PTSD and addiction are only half the struggle as his country is under attack, and he comes to realize he’s still very much the man he was prior to the roadside bomb that claimed his leg. But the fight isn’t easy. He’s up against the worst type of enemies—his own self-doubt, American politics, and a global radicalized ideology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RAPID FIRE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“While seeking revenge, dig two graves - one for yourself.” Douglas Horton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe revenge is not a dish best served cold. Despite his prosthesis, former United States Army Green Beret, Sergeant Joe Boxer has proven he belongs on DEA’s elite FAST unit. Now he’s headed into the fiery lands of the Middle East to hunt the terrorist responsible for his best friend’s murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politics in the sandbox have changed drastically since Joe served as a military special forces sergeant in Afghanistan, but his mission remains the same. He’s rejoining his FAST Team 5 to stop the terrorist threat against America’s heartland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boxer’s sights are also set on revenge for Tommy Price. Boxer won’t sacrifice the team’s mission, but he won’t miss a chance to kill The Butcher either. It’s an all out race to destroy the threat to America, but the head of World Apocalyptic Revolution won’t be so easily defeated. The Butcher’s WAR also isn’t above relying on it’s allies back in the States to stop Boxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;END OF WATCH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Loyalty to the Nation all the time, loyalty to the Government when it deserves it.” Mark Twain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Boxer only knows loyalty to his country. His sacrifices while serving as a sergeant in the United States Army Green Berets, and now his assignment as a federal counter narco-terrorism agent with the DEA, have left him in a struggle to remain loyal to his government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s being played on all sides, but his loyalty to some is threatening his ability to see the big picture. He’s back in the United States, but risk is greater now than when he was deployed. Boxer will have to rely on a small circle of patriots and his own skills to defeat the global terror group, WAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In times of greatest crisis, it’s not the uniform of the warrior, but the soul of the citizen who answers the call. Boxer’s desperate task force of federal agents, Navy SEALs, and Savage Souls renegade bikers may not meet the bureaucratic ideal, but it sure as heck won’t surrender to the terrorists or politicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keywords: Thriller, Police Procedural, Investigation, Mystery, Terrorism, Mystery, Espionage, Political</description>

  <description>CALL OF DUTY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Black Hawk helicopter gets punched out of the Afghan sky. The covert operative's hand and briefcase it held are missing. The terror fighters responsible are ordered terminated by Central Command. United States Army Green Beret, Sergeant Joe Boxer is tasked with hunting them and killing them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no mention of the briefcase. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Army green and patriotic as they come, Boxer follows JSOC orders. Along with his team of battle-hardened warriors, they engage in high-risk, deadly operations where the costs are extreme. He'll stop at nothing to protect his brothers and his best friend, Tommy Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both boys grew up together and enlisted with a desire to serve America. It wasn't until after Boxer began to question the briefcase's contents, that he's treated as an enemy of the state, and Tommy's life is at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson&lt;br /&gt;Former United States Army Green Beret, Joe Boxer, is part of a little known specialized tactical unit inside the DEA.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sometimes falling in love means going through hell...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She's a sweet girl.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nicola Hart grew up under the heels of her older brother and his sexy best friend, Cash Garrison. Years of ignoring her spark with Cash has transformed their friendship into a slow burning sizzle. One night with him could ruin everything. Or it could be more than she ever dreamed. They play. They flirt. But they haven't crossed the line because too much is at stake. Family. Friendship. And the deepest kind of love that she'd have to be crazy to walk away from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He can't stay away from.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She's his best friend's little sister. The definition of hands off. Cash has tried to ignore her for years. Those innocent eyes and her smile that screams kiss-me-if-you-dare... Instead, he's looked at every pretty little thing who's crossed his path, all to ignore the girl he seems destined to want. But when his hard partying ways get old and everyone at school is interested in Nicola, it's time to stake a claim. To make Nicola his girl, no matter the risks, and hold the hand of the one he really loves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet Girl&lt;/b&gt; is the full length prequel to bestselling &lt;b&gt;Garrison's Creed&lt;/b&gt;. Before Cash and Nicola can fall in love forever, they have to suffer through their first love.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The leaves were cold and slightly clammy. There was no mistaking them. She had seen their likeness painstakingly sketched in her father's journal. This was his greatest secret, his treasure and his undoing. The Tree of Lies. Now it was hers, and the journey he had never finished stretched out before her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Faith's father is found dead under mysterious circumstances, she is determined to untangle the truth from the lies. Searching through his belongings for clues, she discovers a strange tree. A tree that feeds off whispered lies and bears fruit that reveals hidden secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Faith's untruths spiral out of control, she discovers that where lies seduce, truths shatter...</description>

  <description>Her eyes are wide open. Her lips parted as if to speak. Her dead body frozen in the ice…She is not the only one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young boy discovers the body of a woman beneath a thick sheet of ice in a South London park, Detective Erika Foster is called in to lead the murder investigation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim, a beautiful young socialite, appeared to have the perfect life. Yet when Erika begins to dig deeper, she starts to connect the dots between the murder and the killings of three prostitutes, all found strangled, hands bound and dumped in water around London. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What dark secrets is the girl in the ice hiding? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Erika inches closer to uncovering the truth, the killer is closing in on Erika. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last investigation Erika led went badly wrong… resulting in the death of her husband. With her career hanging by a thread, Erika must now battle her own personal demons as well as a killer more deadly than any she’s faced before. But will she get to him before he strikes again?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length: 2 hours and 18 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone - 999 times out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back. How? We don't know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life.&lt;br /&gt;Tony Valdez is a Dispatcher - a licensed, bonded professional whose job is to humanely dispatch those whose circumstances put them in death's crosshairs, so they can have a second chance to avoid the reaper. But when a fellow Dispatcher and former friend is apparently kidnapped, Tony learns that there are some things that are worse than death and that some people are ready to do almost anything to avenge a supposed wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It's a race against time for Valdez to find his friend before it's too late...before not even a Dispatcher can save him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___&lt;br /&gt;Zachary Quinto - best known for his role as the Nimoy-approved Spock in the recent Star Trek reboot and the menacing, power-stealing serial killer, Sylar, in Heroes - brings his well-earned sci-fi credentials and simmering intensity to this audio-exclusive novella from master storyteller John Scalzi.</description>

  <description>A Darkness at Sethanon is the stunning climax to Raymond E. Feist's brilliant epic fantasy trilogy, the Riftwar Saga. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here be dragons and sorcery, swordplay, quests, pursuits, intrigues, stratagems, journeys to the darkest realms of the dead and titanic battles between the forces of good and darkest evil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the final dramatic confrontation between Arutha and Murmandamus - and the perilous quest of Pug the magician and Tomas the warrior for Macros the Black. A Darkness at Sethanon is heroic fantasy of the highest excitement and on the grandest scale, a magnificent conclusion to one of the great fantasy sagas of our time.</description>

  <description>The third title in Genevieve Cogman's clever and exciting The Invisible Library series, The Burning Page is an action-packed literary adventure! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Librarian spy Irene has professional standards to maintain. Standards that absolutely do not include making hasty, unplanned escapes through a burning besieged building. But when the gateway back to your headquarters dramatically malfunctions, one must improvise. And after fleeing a version of Revolutionary France astride a dragon (also known as her assistant, Kai), Irene soon discovers she's not the only one affected. Gates back to the Library are malfunctioning across a multitude of worlds, creating general havoc. She and Kai are tasked with a mission to St Petersburg's Winter Palace, to retrieve a book which will help restore order.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, such plans rarely survive first contact with the enemy - particularly when the enemy is the traitor Alberich. A nightmare figure bent on the Library's destruction, Alberich gives Irene a tainted 'join me or die' job offer. Meanwhile, Irene's old friend Vale has been damaged by exposure to Chaotic forces and she has no idea how to save him. When another figure from her past appears, begging for help, Irene has to take a good hard look at her priorities. And of course try to save the Library from absolute annihilation. Saving herself would be a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene's adventures feature stolen books, secret agents and forbidden societies - think Doctor Who but with librarian spies!</description>

  <description>Living again of the Isle of Lewis, the ex-Detective Inspector Fin McLeod is working as a security officer for a local landowner. While investigating illegal activity on the estate Fin encounters the elusive poacher and former childhood friend Whistler Macaskill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Fin catches up with Whistler, the two witness a freak natural phenomenon--a 'Bog Burst'--which spontaneously drains a loch of its water, revealing a mud-encased light aircraft with a sickeningly familiar moniker on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both men immediately know hat they will find inside: the body of Roddy Mackenzie, a friend whose flight disappeared more than seventeen years before. But when Whistler's face appears to register something other than shock, an icy chill of apprehension overtakes Fin. What secret has Whistler been hiding from him, and everyone else on the island? Fin is unprepared for how the truth about the past will alter the course of the future.</description>

  <description>A body is recovered from a peat bog on the Isle of Lewis. The male Caucasian corpse is initially believed by its finders to be over 2000 years old, until they spot the Elvis tattoo on his right arm. The body, it transpires, is not evidence of an ancient ritual killing, but of a murder committed during the latter half of the 20th century.</description>

  <description>Berlin, Summer 2011. Adolf Hitler wakes up from a 66-year sleep in his subterranean Berlin bunker to find the Germany he knew entirely changed: Internet-driven media spreads ideas in minutes and fumes celebrity obsession; immigration has produced multicultural neighborhoods bringing together people of varying race, ethnicity, and religion; and the most powerful person in government is a woman. Hitler is immediately recognized . . . as an impersonator of uncommon skill. The public assumes the fulminating leader of the Nazi party is a performer who is always in character, and soon his inevitable viral appeal begets YouTube stardom, begets television celebrity on a Turkish-born comedian's show. His bigoted rants are mistaken for a theatrical satire--exposing prejudice and misrepresentation--and his media success emboldens Hitler to start his own political party and set the country he finds a shambles back to rights. With daring and dark humor, &lt;i&gt;Look Who's Back&lt;/i&gt; skewers the absurdity and depravity of the cult of personality in modern media culture.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Cuckoo's Calling&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days—as he has done before—and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives—meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before...</description>

  <description>Like a smaller and much scruffier Greta Garbo – finally – Markham speaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Christmas and time for the first (and almost certainly last) St Mary’s Annual Children’s Christmas Party – attendance compulsory, by order of Dr Bairstow. Discovered practising his illegal reindeer dance and poo-dropping routine, our hero, along with fellow disaster-magnets Peterson and Maxwell, is despatched to Anglo-Saxon England to discover the truth about Alfred and the cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his own words, our hero reveals Major Guthrie’s six-point guide to a successful assignment and the Security Section’s true opinion of the History Department. And of historians in general. And of one historian in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, just to be clear, it is time travel, for God’s sake. Forget all that pretentious ‘investigating major historical events in contemporary time’ rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is history without the capital ‘H’. Because this is the way the Security Section rolls!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; The Navy made me the man I am, but I wouldn't have survived without her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Violet Shaw. &lt;i&gt;My Vi.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made her a promise a long time ago, and she thinks I broke it. But I never stopped loving her. I never will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fool four years ago. I threw what we had away, thinking it was for her own good. No girl should have to wait around for a soldier that might never come home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday I thought about her; I fought to come back to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I'm back in our hometown, I see her everywhere, as curvaceous and tempting as ever. But all she's doing is pushing me away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was her first and I want to be her last. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need one chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw what we had away once -- I won't make that mistake again. &lt;i&gt;Vi is going to be mine. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Promise Me is a full-length standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description> They tempted me with her. And I couldn’t resist.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m not a good man. I’m a hired killer, and damn good at what I do. Raised to be ruthless and forced into this life, I never had a choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Until she was thrown into my lap.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t want to take the hit. It’s too dangerous, and I can’t afford these kinds of risks. I turned my employers down, but they sweetened the deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gifting her to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s scared, beautiful, &lt;i&gt;and all mine.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She gazes at me with her gorgeous baby blues, and I can hardly resist taking her. She makes me want to break my rules… all because of the desire hidden in those stolen glances. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m addicted to her seductive curves and the soft moans that spill from her lips. She’s tempting in ways she doesn’t even realize. I’m practically obsessed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They’re going to want her back, but I’ll kill them all to keep her.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*Forsaken is a full-length standalone DARK romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger. Includes expanded content and a deleted scene!</description>

  <description> I’m used to getting what I want.  But I’ve never wanted anyone like her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’m the CEO. I dominate the boardroom with my presence. What I want, I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the world at my beck and call.  But that no longer excites me. Nothing does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until she comes along.  My Rose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her deep blue eyes. Her tempting curves. They call to me, holding my attention like nothing has in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should walk away, but the soft sighs spilling from her plump lips are addictive. Even more, I want to force them from her lips myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve never felt such desire.  I’ve never wanted like this.  Even though I know I shouldn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a reason I keep everyone away, and I need to remember that. But now that I have her in my grasp, I won’t let her go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Mr. CEO is a full-length standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>An alien soldier without emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finn is three quarters Asazi and one quarter human. He's a lieutenant in the Asazi army and his desire is to be the best soldier he can. He's spent a lifetime denying his human side, only to find out that now it makes him key to a mission on Earth. A mission that includes Marissa Sanchez, Target 41, a determined, smart-mouthed spitfire that brings out emotions his Asazi nature rejects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A human woman with a target on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marissa's dream is to keep her restaurant from being seized by ruthless developers. She's broke, out of options, has a deadline, and a cheating ex who offers to marry her and solve her financial problems. Everything changes when a guy named Finn saves her life and provides a completely different kind of option.</description>

      <![CDATA[I liked that it started differently to what alien romances normally start. The idea was to send Finn, who is quarter human and almost ashamed of it, to Earth to abduct women who could facilitate the birth of new Asazi children. The behaviour of baser species like humans is unthinkable and below t...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;One curvy waitress, Two HOT billionaire bosses, an unforgettable Christmas Eve….now that’s what we call paradise.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Grab your toys, some Kleenex and get ready for the smuttiest Christmas holidays ever!&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books included in this collection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;My Christmas gift&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Just a few hours ago I was cursing this particular Kennedy brother, but now all I want to do is find out how the rest of his skin would feel beneath my touch. His clear blue eyes meet mine, and I realize he is going to be a lot more complicated than I initially expected.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Two Huge 4 me&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;She felt a sense of embarrassment as he looked at her, just taking in her appearance. She moved to cover up but he grabbed her hands holding them down by her side. She couldn’t move as he held her. He moved behind her trading places with Blake, who now had free access to her breasts as Derek held her hands down, gently but firmly..&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Loving both&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“You guys aren’t…gay?” Sadie asked and heard Brent laugh.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“Not so much. We both loved pleasuring you, but we don’t feel the need to pleasure each other. I guess if a hand slips or something next time, then we’ll see what happens.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Vacationing with my billionaire bosses&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“You’re a virgin?” I nodded with some shame crossing my features, and he shook his head. “No, that’s beautiful. Nobody has felt you wrapped around them, tasted you,” his eyes questioned me, and I shook my head as he slid his arms down over my ass and moved his body close to mine. “That makes it even more interesting. Which one of us will you give yourself to?”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a steamy, menage collection with loads of juiciness and explicit content, suitable for mature audience only. For a limited time, this novella comes with &lt;strong&gt;the complete girl fantasy series (Don’t forget to indulge in your filthiest fantasies through Christmas Foursomes and Moresomes – scroll down to TOC to take a look!).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The rule: Get married and have a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Grandpa Stinson dies, he expects nothing more than to keep his grandsons together, running the family's multibillion-dollar business. But he's got just one unfaltering rule: they have to get married and have a baby first. The brothers disagree...wholeheartedly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it's set in stone. Follow the rule or you're the one grandson out of luck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stubborn, rugged, but oh-so-sexy, Roark Stinson, the oldest brother, refuses to give in to his grandfather's manipulations. After all, women are the root of all evil, and he's never witnessed a relationship that actually works. Then it hits him; it doesn't have to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roark just needs a warm body to agree to the terms...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe Morgan never wanted to be anyone's "means to an end," especially not Roark Stinson's. But his proposal is one she's in no position to refuse--can't refuse. When the stakes are this high, a warm body might just be exactly what she needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe--just maybe--Grandpa Stinson knew exactly what he was doing...</description>

  <description> Write. Publish. Repeat.   
  &lt;i&gt;The No-Luck-Required Guide to Publishing&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In 2013, Johnny B. Truant and Sean Platt published 1.5 million words and made their full-time livings as indie authors. In Write. Publish. Repeat., they tell you exactly how they did it: how they created over 15 independent franchises across 50+ published works, how they turned their art into a logical, sustainable business, and how any independent author can do the same to build a sustainable, profitable career with their writing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write. Publish. Repeat. explains the current self-publishing landscape and covers the truths and myths about what it means to be an indie author now and in the foreseeable future. It explains how to create books your readers will love and will want to return to again and again. Write. Publish. Repeat. details expert methods for building story worlds, characters, and plots, understanding your market (right down to your ideal reader), using the best tools possible to capture your draft, and explains proven best practices for editing. The book also discusses covers, titles, formatting, pricing, and publishing to multiple platforms, plus a bit on getting your books into print (and why that might not be a good idea!). But most importantly, Write. Publish. Repeat. details the psychology-driven marketing plan that Sean and Johnny built to shape their stories into "products" that readers couldn't help but be drawn into -- thus almost automatically generating sales -- and explores ways that smart, business-minded writers can do the same to future-proof their careers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is not a formula with an easy path to follow. It is a guidebook that will help you build a successful indie publishing career, no matter what type of writer you are ... so long as you're the type who's willing to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His roomie Matt has gone home with the girl that Trey had his eye on the whole night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despondent, well-hung Trey goes home to jerk off alone, but when he gets there, he remembers that Matt's 19 year old little sister Chelsea is crashing on their couch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to stop himself, Trey starts to play with the passed out young teen, but he has a problem. She's so petite, and his cock is so huge, he just can't fit inside her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will he be able to have his way with her without waking her up?</description>

  <description>Michelle doesn’t believe in fairy tales. She’s a hard-headed businesswoman, making a fresh start in a new town. And when she decides to take over a neglected book shop, she knows the perfect manager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For book-loving Anna, it’s a dream come true—and not just because it gives her an escape from her three demanding step-children and their adorable but hyperactive Dalmatian. Although she’s been thinking that her own fairytale ending hasn’t really turned out the way she hoped, Anna’s passion for the classics is transforming the shop. The customers, and even Michelle, are falling under the spell of the magical stories of romance, adventure, and lost dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when secrets from her past threaten Michelle’s new beginnings, and trouble strikes at the heart of Anna’s household, can the wisdom and courage of the stories in the bookshop help the two friends—and those they love—find their happy ever after?</description>

  <description>WARLORDS OF LLANTATIS's graphics, gameplay, and immersive three-dimensional virtual reality experience took the online role playing gaming world by storm when it was first released - but it was first released over fifteen years ago. Now it's a haunt for the nostalgic and unfashionable. Cyrus Baggett and Raj Rengarajulu have been pretending to be Smelrond of Quimnimbriel and Mordaxxe, Pwner of Noobs since college. Now they're old, married, and wanted by most of the crowned heads, secret police organisations and demonic familiars of the game universe. They are considering growing out of this thing - at least, until they meet the Character With No Name. The Character's player is living in one room, which he has never left and appears to be being held in against his will. He doesn't know where in the world the room is; he doesn't even know his own name. The only way of finding out more about him is through playing Warlords of Llantatis, and that can only happen if Mordaxxe and Smelrond can keep him alive for long enough to talk - and if they can stay alive themselves, with Beëlzebelle and the Munchkins, Wizard Sparklebeard and Titanowang Lord of Fertility at large in the same universe.</description>

  <description>Elijah Black, a hardcore Navy SEAL, eats, sleeps, and lives for his missions—and little else … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self-proclaimed playboy has no time for relationships, unless it's between the sheets. So he’s more than happy to leave for his newest mission, a quick extraction of a terrorist believed to be responsible for a series of bombings in Europe. But the mission doesn’t go as planned, and the terrorists take Elijah prisoner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nasima was only supposed to care for his body, not his heart… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the nurse charged with keeping the prisoner alive, Nasima is alone with Elijah every day. Sparks fly between them, but Elijah makes it clear he cares little for Nasima’s traditions and only wants her for her body. Still, she grows to care for the broken soldier, and it isn’t long before she begins to dream of abandoning her strict upbringing for Elijah’s tempting embrace. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A passionate encounter leads to more than just feelings… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After Elijah’s failed escape and another beating, Nasima is found comforting him and suffers the consequences. Just as Elijah realizes he will do whatever is necessary to save her, but before they can get to safety, Nasima reveals a secret that may be Elijah’s undoing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Nasima's secret keep her from breaking through Elijah’s tough exterior in time for another escape, or will he decide to make the journey alone?</description>

  <description> Mr. Right has never been so freakin’ wrong.  &lt;br /&gt;I'm a single mom and a cop. When some arrogant superstar thinks he can speed through my town and smirk and charm his way out of a ticket, he’s wrong. I wrote the ticket and impounded his car. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then he &lt;i&gt;moved in next door.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This muscled up god with his glorious physique, panty-dropping smile and smart mouth is my new neighbor. He hates the ‘burbs, but that doesn’t seem to stop him from flirting with me every chance he gets. As if strutting around in boxers with his abs and chest on display is enough to make me forget his snide comments and wisecracks. Oh sure, he knows how to turn on the charm... like I'll fall for that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bet that would make a great story, bagging the cop that gave him the ticket- but I’m not some ditzy arm candy lining up to be the next notch in his bedpost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don’t have time to fool around. It doesn’t matter if he’s hot, and younger than I am, and just &lt;i&gt;looking&lt;/i&gt; at him makes my legs shake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The closer we get, the more I think I misjudged him. Somewhere beneath that arrogant smirk is a good man, maybe even the right man, but my past threatens to shatter us both... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;BENCHED&lt;/b&gt; is a standalone, full-length romance with an HEA.&lt;/i&gt; This special edition includes a second full length novel, &lt;i&gt;Player's Princess&lt;/i&gt;, with an all new, exclusive epilogue!</description>

  <description>Years ago he ended things between them to protect her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As leader of one of the fiercest werewolf packs in the south, Finn Stavros is in full battle mode 24/7. He has no choice—he’s one of the few beings strong enough to fight the Akkadian demons, whose mysterious escape from hell threatens the entire world. With the battle turning bloodier by the second, Finn is ready for anything…until his vampire long lost love shows up on his doorstep in desperate need of his help, sending his heart into a tailspin. He agrees to help her, unaware that she carries a shocking secret that will turn his life upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, he’s not letting her go…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampire Lyra Marius curses the day she met Finn. The ruthless werewolf promised to love her forever, but he rejected her instead—before she could share her life altering news. Pregnant, kicked out of her coven, and cast aside by the love of her life, Lyra struggled to raise their rare shifter-vampire daughter Vega alone among humans. When the 16-year-old is kidnapped and used to fulfill a frightening prophecy, Lyra swallows her pride and turns to Finn for help. But how long can she fight her feelings for him and keep him from guessing the truth about who Vega really is? As they race against the clock to save their daughter, they must defeat the lethal threat imposed by demons infiltrating the human world and a hell gate that could not only reveal their existence to mankind, but destroy the world in the process.</description>

  <description>Tess Laurelton, PhD, likes things wild and unexpected. She's curvy, smart and not the kind of woman to let life stand in the way of adventure. Her career as a well-respected grizzly bear expert should have given her plenty of adventure, but instead, she's camped up inside a research lab. When she is given the opportunity to find out why the grizzly population at Cabinet Mountains in Montana is suddenly booming, she jumps at the chance. What she doesn't know is that the innocent trip will be a lot more primal and untamed than she could have ever imagined. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jackson Arder might be known as a reserved forest ranger, but he is first and foremost the powerful Alpha of a prominent werebear clan. His clan has come under attack by a man he thought of as his brother, Ryder Hunt, throwing his life in turmoil. When Tess shows up on Jackson's doorstep, looking like a sassy, curvy treat made just for him, Jackson knows life is about to get a lot more heated than he was prepared for. How can a bear wage war when all he wants to do is claim the sexy, whip-smart woman who strolled into his world as if she belonged there? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As danger surrounds them, Jackson finds himself falling fast and hard for Tess. But with war at his door, can he give his heart to someone who doesn't know about his true nature? &lt;b&gt;Can Tess love both the man and the bear or will she run for the hills when she finds out the truth?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A Tortured Hero with a Heart of Gold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up on the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Javier Almeida has only his older sister to protect him. When she’s sold to a human-trafficker, he vows to hunt down those responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Titan Group’s Delta team finds him, tattooed and brawling, a vigilante protector with information they want. They take him in and train him, working him harder than a man should be driven, until he’s a soldier harboring an obsession. Ready for revenge, Javier ghosts his way across the globe, tracking the men who took his sister and working elite private security jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meets Sweet and Sassy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jilted at the altar, Sophia Cole turns the reception into a one-woman party. She’s intent on devouring all the cake and champagne, so she can bask in the calories she’s been avoiding. In the midst of the revelry, he walks in, the one man she can never ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Javier is her older brother’s black ops teammate—an automatic Do Not Go There. But if there’s one thing better than fondant and a buzz to ease the wounds of a cheating fiancé, it might be a one-night stand with a South American military man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game Changer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Javier didn’t expect to see Sophia again. He never thought he would even want to see her again. He shouldn’t have touched her, but his mind won’t stay away from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Sophia Cole is thousands of miles away from the safety of her parents’ lavish estate and working alongside him in hell. She’s a staffer at an Embassy, and he’s there to keep them alive. There are bombs and bullets and blood-hungry enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then she’s taken. Gone. Just like his sister. But so much worse.</description>

The whole thing with Her mother was a little forced for me, but may that was just because I had not seen it coming.<br />I'll read the rest, it's an easy read with likeable chara...]]>

  <description>After putting her life on the line to protect classified intelligence, military psychologist Mia Kensington is on a cross-country road trip from hell with an intrusive save-the-day hero. Uninterested in his white knight act, she’d rather take her chances without the ruggedly handsome, cold-blooded operative who boasts an alpha complex and too many guns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colby Winters, an elite member of The Titan Group, has a single objective on his black ops mission: recover a document important to national security. It was supposed to be an easy in-and-out operation. But now, by any means necessary becomes a survival mantra when he faces off with a stunning woman he can’t leave behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Titan’s safe houses are compromised, Colby stashes Mia at his home, exposing his secret—he’s the adoptive father of an orphaned baby girl. Too soon, danger arrives and Mia lands in the hands of a sadistic cartel king with a taste for torture. As hours bleed into fear-drenched days, Colby races across the globe and through a firestorm of bullets to save the woman he can’t live without.</description>

  <description>Blood Lust: The Preternaturals, Book 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an anthology of: Kept, Claimed, and Mated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… The enemy of my enemy is my lover. Is that how it goes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one should have to be on the run from their family. Family is who you can trust, right? Dark magic users are the ones on the don’t trust list. Yet, when Greta learns the werecat tribe plans to sacrifice her on the full moon to steal her potent magical blood, she ditches common sense in favor of running to the one man who can protect her. Will Dayne kill her as he has so many others of her kind, or is his grudge against her family strong enough to save her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLAIMED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;… Vampires claiming amnesiacs is the new black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anthony is cold, ruthless, undead, and hard to like. Yet, all it takes is one human with amnesia, to soften his heart. Ever since being bitten, Charlotte hasn’t been the same. More than anything, he wants to return to a time when she saw him for the man he is, instead of the monster she’s discovered. A time before she feared him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of a power struggle for vampire king, it soon becomes clear that the only way to protect a fragile human in his care is to claim her as his mate. Meanwhile, his deepest wish is to have his lover awakened from the memory loss that took everything... not just the memories he meant to erase. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A classic, sweet werewolf love story. Or maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be small. Be invisible. It’s an odd life mantra for a human woman in a world of monsters. But Jane’s blood contains a touch of vampire magic, making her their victim over and over. With her faster-than-normal healing time, she’s an ideal punching bag for the abusive vampire she’s been living with, the one she thought might protect her this time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul owes a debt to the werewolf alpha, and Cole doesn’t care how he gets paid: flesh or coin. $10,000 or Jane? The human is a small price for the vampire to pay to be debt-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole is attractive and warm---so different from the coldness and death Jane has grown used to. If the werewolves didn’t have a worse reputation than the vampires, being taken by the alpha might feel like rescue, but Cole’s growing possessive nature, makes Jane fear he’ll only abuse her like the others. If he doesn’t, could becoming an alpha’s mate free her from the vampires for good?</description>

  <description>Everyone deserves to get away for a bit. Even the miscreants at St Mary's. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astonishingly, Dr Bairstow has declared a holiday. Even more astonishingly - he's paying for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, there are strings attached. They have to record the 1601 performance of Hamlet, with Shakespeare himself in the role of the Ghost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't go well, of course.</description>

      <![CDATA[And Ms Taylor does it again! This time it is mayhem in Elizabethan London. As always, I loved it. These characters are well developed and, by now, well loved. The underlying humour with which the telling of this tale is threaded makes it another rounding success for St Mary's. ]]>

  <description>Abby Tanner is content to live on her mountain creating her beautiful works of art and enjoying the peace and quiet. All of that changes when a strange golden space ship crash lands on it. Now, Abby has to deal with a golden ship, a tortured alien, and an insane local sheriff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoran Reykill knew he had to find a safe place to heal after he escapes from a Curizan military post. When his symbiosis mothership takes him to an unknown planet he finds more than he expects – he finds his true mate. The only problems are Abby doesn’t understand a thing he says and the local sheriff wants her too. There is only one thing the King of Valdier can do, abduct his true mate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zoran has his hands full trying to keep his true mate safe in his own world while trying to help her accept her new life. He will need all the help he can get to help his stubborn human accept she can make a life in a place other than her mountain back on Earth. He just needs to keep her alive long enough to enjoy it and away from the other males on his planet who wouldn’t mind helping her accept her new sensual body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing he knows he will never regret – abducting Abby</description>
