  <description>Elias and Laia are running for their lives. After the events of the Fourth Trial, Martial soldiers hunt the two fugitives as they flee the city of Serra and undertake a perilous journey through the heart of the Empire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laia is determined to break into Kauf—the Empire’s most secure and dangerous prison—to save her brother, who is the key to the Scholars’ survival. And Elias is determined to help Laia succeed, even if it means giving up his last chance at freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dark forces, human and otherworldly, work against Laia and Elias. The pair must fight every step of the way to outsmart their enemies: the bloodthirsty Emperor Marcus, the merciless Commandant, the sadistic Warden of Kauf, and, most heartbreaking of all, Helene—Elias’s former friend and the Empire’s newest Blood Shrike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bound to Marcus’s will, Helene faces a torturous mission of her own—one that might destroy her: find the traitor Elias Veturius and the Scholar slave who helped him escape…and kill them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Twin sisters separated by the past are reunited by unspeakable crimes in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mary Burton’s throat-clutching novel of suspense…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trauma victims are not new to medical examiner Faith McIntyre, but this one is different. The unconscious woman clinging to life after a hit and run is FBI agent Macy Crow. What the woman from Quantico was doing in a dark alley after midnight is just one mystery. The other is more unsettling: Macy is Faith’s mirror image—the twin sister she never knew she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faith knew that she was adopted, but now she’s finding that her childhood concealed other secrets. Following the trail of clues Macy left behind, Faith and Texas Ranger Mitchell Hayden make a shocking discovery on an isolated country ranch—a burial ground for three women who disappeared thirty years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They weren’t the only victims in a killer’s twisted plot. And they won’t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the missing pieces of Faith’s and Macy’s dark lives snap into place, Faith is becoming more terrified by what she sees—and by what she must do to save her sister and herself from the past.</description>

  <description>He wants her soul. Too bad she already sold it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family is everything to gambling den darling, Teresa Valentini. Blood comes first, especially before men. So when her brother lands himself in hot water, she’s willing to do whatever it takes to save him. And showing up topless in her unwitting savior’s motel room is turning out to be the furthest thing from a hardship…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Caruso is the bad boy of New York’s financial scene…and he just found out the very thing that drives his success is a damn lie. Now, he’s exchanged his high-stress life for the open road, no one but his Great Dane…and half a million Instagram followers to keep him company. When a mysterious beauty arrives, her secrecy prods his suspicions, even while she tempts his lust to the breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teresa met Will under false pretenses, but the bond consuming them is real. They’re strong enough to overcome a little betrayal…aren’t they?</description>

  <description>A thrilling and original coming-of-age novel for adults about a young man practicing magic in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A senior in high school, he’s still secretly preoccupied with a series of fantasy novels he read as a child, set in a magical land called Fillory. Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. Something is missing, though. Magic doesn’t bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he dreamed it would. After graduation he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real. But the land of Quentin’s fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he could have imagined. His childhood dream becomes a nightmare with a shocking truth at its heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once psychologically piercing and magnificently absorbing, The Magicians boldly moves into uncharted literary territory, imagining magic as practiced by real people, with their capricious desires and volatile emotions. Lev Grossman creates an utterly original world in which good and evil aren’t black and white, love and sex aren’t simple or innocent, and power comes at a terrible price.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are three things you need to know about Sandra Fielding:&lt;/b&gt; 1) She makes all her first dates cry, 2) She hasn't been kissed in over two years, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sandra has difficulty removing her psychotherapist hat. Of her last 30 dates, 29 have ended the same way: the man sobbing uncontrollably. After one such disaster, Sandra gives in to a seemingly harmless encounter with her hot waiter, Alex. Argumentative, secretive, and hostile Alex may be the opposite of everything Sandra knows is right for her. But now, the girl who has spent all her life helping others change for the better, must find a way to cope with falling for someone who refuses to change at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Hacked is book #3 in the Knitting in the City series. Each book is a standalone, full length (110k words), contemporary romantic comedy novel, and follows the misadventures and exploits of seven friends in Chicago, all members of the same knitting group.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NETFLIX NEWS! The 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN series is being adapted into a steamy Netflix dramedy series called SEX/LIFE, coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"SKIN is a sophisticated, edgy, authentic, five-star read, and I HIGHLY recommend it." - L.J. Shen, &lt;/i&gt;USA Today &lt;i&gt;Bestselling Author&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because BB Easton had so much fun writing her best-selling, award-winning memoir, 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN, she decided to give each of her four men his own steamy stand-alone. SKIN is Knight's book--a gritty, taboo,forbidden love story overflowing with '90s nostalgia, dark humor, and heart-wrenching teenage angst. It is based on a true story.&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1997, Ronald “Knight” McKnight was the meanest, most misunderstood boy at Peach State High School ... perhaps on the entire planet. Knight hated everyone, except for me, BB—the perky, quirky punk chick with the locker next to his. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand, liked everybody … except for Knight. I was scared sh*tless of him, actually. All I wanted was to marry Prince Eric-lookalike and king of the Peach State High punk scene, Lance Hightower, and have a million of his babies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, Knight was even better at getting his way than I was, and once he got under my skin, my life would never be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;*SKIN is Book 1 in the 44 CHAPTERS ABOUT 4 MEN spin-off series but can be read as a complete standalone. Go in with an open mind, and prepare to have it blown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Not all love stories are written the same way.

She doesn’t need his protection anymore.&lt;br /&gt;When life throws a curveball at All Saints’ golden boy, he’s forced to realize not all knights are heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, the greatest love stories flourish in tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE SOMEDAY GIRL is the 95,000 word follow up to THE MONDAY GIRL. It concludes the angsty, addictive storyline of THE GIRL duet. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; I fell in love with a man who could not love me back. &lt;br /&gt;A man I will never deserve fell in love with me. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Katherine Firestone has finally &lt;i&gt;made it &lt;/i&gt; in Hollywood. &lt;br /&gt;New house. New car. New closet full of designer clothes. &lt;br /&gt;She's got it all. &lt;br /&gt;And yet... without &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.... she has absolutely nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; THE SOMEDAY GIRL arrives February 1, 2017. It is recommended for readers ages 17+ due to mature content.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Great writing, loved the romance and the heroine’s sass and strength and growth...but the end 10-15% almost made me rate this a 3 star...unnecessary drama. Really.<br />Still, it’s a great duet and I’ll definitely read more by Julie.]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Katharine Firestone is a bit of a mess. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between an acting career that’s never quite made lift-off to stardom, a pathetic love life of online-dating-app losers, and a maxed-out balance on every one of her credit cards, things can’t get much worse. So, when she’s plucked from relative obscurity to land a lead role in Hollywood’s next big blockbuster, Kat is sure she’s finally on the right track. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Until she meets her co-star, Grayson Dunn… and all her plans are completely derailed. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grayson is everything you’d expect the hottest actor alive to be — charming, disarming, and cocky as hell. As their characters slowly spiral into love on screen, Kat struggles to keep herself from falling for real. She knows handing Grayson her heart and expecting him not to break it would be the biggest mistake of her life. Yet the deeper she’s immersed in his glamorous world, the more blurred the boundaries between scripted affection and sincere passion become… and the harder it is to deny that their on-camera chemistry has crescendoed into a behind-the-scenes love affair… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when you fall for someone who’s guaranteed to shatter you into pieces? Do you walk away? Or do you let him break you because, even broken, there’s simply no way you can’t stay? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;THE MONDAY GIRL is a messy contemporary romance about a mixed up girl who falls for the wrong boy. It is the first part of a duet. The second installment, THE SOMEDAY GIRL, will be released a few weeks later, in early 2017. Each installment is approximately 95,000 words. Recommended for readers ages 17+ due to strong language, sexual situations, drug use, and other mature elements. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>There were two brothers—identical twins—and though I loved them both, my soul belonged to only one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annalia Del Valle has loved Preston Sawyer all her life. The daughter of an impoverished migrant farmworker, she grew up as an outcast in what was no more than a tiny, cooped up shack in California’s Central Valley. But her heart found freedom in the land, in the wide-open spaces of Sawyer Farm, and in the boys who were her only friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preston has yearned for Annalia since he was a boy. But a sense of honor kept him from pursuing her until he’s unable to hold back any longer and their worlds—and bodies—collide one hot summer night. A night that sets off a chain of events that will alter their lives forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Annalia is back in town after disappearing without a trace for six long months. Determined to reclaim her heart, her life, and the baby she left behind—the son who was created in a moment of lust and love and pent-up yearning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preston has survived grief, a ravaging drought, and the despair of heartache, but he’s not sure he can survive Annalia again. And he might be unwilling to try. Will pride and bitterness keep him from the one thing he’s always longed for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you heal what is irreparably broken? How do you forgive that which is unforgivable? How do you discover that real honor comes not from circumstance, but from the place deep in our hearts where truth resides? And how do you move beyond the wounds of the past to discover that some loves are as solid as the ground beneath your feet, and as enduring as the earth itself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A STAND-ALONE SIGN OF LOVE NOVEL, INSPIRED BY GEMINI. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are three things you need to know about Elizabeth Finney:&lt;/b&gt; 1) She suffers from severe sarcastic syndrome, especially when she's unnerved, 2) No one unnerves her like Nico Manganiello, and 3) She knows how to knit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Finney is almost always right about everything: the musical merits of boy bands are undervalued by society, “benefits” with human Ken dolls are better without friendship, and the sun has set on her once-in-a-lifetime chance for true love. But when Elizabeth’s plans for benefits without friendship are disarmed by the irritatingly charismatic and chauvinistic Nico Manganiello—her former nemesis—she finds herself struggling to maintain the electric fence around her heart while avoiding a Nico charisma-electrocution or, worse, falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Friends Without Benefits' is book #2 in the Knitting in the City series. Each book is a standalone, full length (110k words), contemporary romantic comedy novel, and follows the misadventures and exploits of seven friends in Chicago, all members of the same knitting group.&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Emilia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances, and it’s true.The man who comes to me in my dreams also haunts me in my nightmares. He is a brilliant lawyer. A skilled criminal. A beautiful liar. A bully and a savior, a monster and a lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years ago, he made me run away from the small town where we lived. Now, he came for me in New York, and he isn’t leaving until he takes me with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vicious&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a starving artist. Pretty and evasive like cherry blossom. Ten years ago, she barged into my life unannounced and turned everything upside down. She paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emilia LeBlanc is completely off-limits, my best friend’s ex-girlfriend. The woman who knows my darkest secret, and the daughter of the cheap Help we hired to take care of our estate. That should deter me from chasing her, but it doesn’t. So she hates me. Big fucking deal. She better get used to me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;‘Beard With Me’ is the origin story of Billy Winston and Scarlet St. Claire (aka Claire McClure) and is just the beginning of their epic love story. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at surviving than Scarlet St. Claire and making the best out of circumstances beyond her control is Scarlet’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, she’d be the last person on earth, hermitting like a pro, singing along to her CD Walkman, and dancing like no one is watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet is clever, Scarlet is careful, and Scarlet is smart . . . except when it comes to Billy Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is better at fighting than Billy Winston and raging against his circumstances—because nothing is beyond his control—is Billy’s specialty. In an apocalyptic situation, he’d be the first person on earth to lead others to safety, overcome catastrophe, or die trying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy is fearless, Billy is disciplined, and Billy is honorable . . . except when it comes to Scarlet St. Claire.</description>

  <description>In the Vampire Stratocracy of Cain, human blood is scarce. For centuries, councils have sought to assuage the blood shortage by enslaving and breeding humans, turning them into profitable supply units for the rich and the abled. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, eighteen-year-old Wavorly Sterling is officially a supply unit, bound to serve her blood willingly to her master for the rest of her life. One of only few humans that was not bred in Cain, Wavorly knows freedom better than anyone, and she is determined to escape the clutches of her oppressors, even if by the hands of death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But surprises lay beyond every certainty, and within every doubt. Where Wavorly's hatred for both vampires and her enslavement once flowed free as blood, it merely trickles as she grows to admire her reserved, yet receptive master and savior, Anton Zein. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although warmed by comforts never felt before, danger still lurks in the castle, and a prophecy calls from beyond the walls of a lavender gate—concealing the horrific secrets lodged between handsome smirks and cinereous eyes. It will take everything within Wavorly to face her fears and her doubts; to harness the truth of her past despite what that means for her future. The only question is, will she? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a richly detailed world of fantasy, A Violet Fire is a gripping journey filled with passion, betrayal, lies, and the encouragement we all need to take a stand for our freedom—no matter the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1519735373i/25130848.png" class="gr-hostedUserImg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>GRIPPING AND UNPUTDOWNABLE. Like walking into a John Hughes film... --Christina Lauren, international bestselling author of Dating You/Hating You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coming of age story about friendship with an enemies to lovers high school romance and a dark twist. The Outsiders meets The Breakfast Club with a side of Veronica Mars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 1985 in the Chicago suburbs. You know the scene. The teen princess. The bad boy. The punk rock lesbian. The high school. The mall. The blood-stained Mercedes. Misogyny. Homophobia. Class warfare. Cocaine. It's a party, crank the Bowie, let's dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha Ward can be a little mean, but mostly she's a nice girl. She's not doing coke in the bathroom or having sex by the bleachers. So when the worst boy in school starts a war with her, she's shocked. But she's not one to back down from a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbie girls like Samantha rub Jason Devlin the wrong way, even though most girls will rub him any way he wants. Jason keeps a low profile at his bowling alley job—the dealers there hit harder than he does—but at school, he prefers a little trouble. People call him the Devil, but school is hell, home is worse, and girls and fights make good distractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pris is Jason's best distraction yet, and they're not even fooling around. Full of London stories and secrets, Pris promises a wider world—plus she chews and spits and swears like a guy. “Prissy” was once “Sammie’s” best friend, but punk rocker Pris hates what Samantha’s become, and Samantha doesn’t even notice her friend is back. Jason wants to teach Samantha she can’t look through people like that—no matter how pretty her eyes are. But Jason has some major blind spots of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Samantha starts looking, she sees too much. Sleepy suburbs don’t give up their secrets gently. As mean girls, angry boys, and corrupt grownups converge, Highland’s shadows erupt in violence. Can high school enemies stand together to save their friends and fight a bigger battle?</description>

  <description>Elle and her friends Mads, Jenny, and Summer rule their glittering LA circle. Untouchable, they have the kind of power other girls only dream of. Every party is theirs and the world is at their feet. Until the night of Elle’s sweet sixteen, when they crash a St. Andrew’s Prep party. The night the golden boys choose Elle as their next target. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They picked the wrong girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sworn to vengeance, Elle transfers to St. Andrew’s. She plots to destroy each boy, one by one. She’ll take their power, their lives, and their control of the prep school’s hierarchy. And she and her coven have the perfect way in: a boy named Mack, whose ambition could turn deadly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Foul is Fair&lt;/i&gt; is a bloody, thrilling revenge fantasy for the girls who have had enough. Golden boys beware: something wicked this way comes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are three things you should know about Quinn Sullivan:&lt;/b&gt; 1) He is madly in love with Janie Morris, 2) He’s not above playing dirty to get what (or who) he wants, and 3) He doesn’t know how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After just five months of dating Janie, Quinn—former Wendell and unapologetic autocrat—is ready to propose marriage. In fact, he’s more than ready. If it were up to Quinn, he would efficiently propose, marry, and beget Janie with child all in the same day—thereby avoiding the drama and angst that accompanies the four stages of pre-matrimony: engagement, meeting the parents, bachelor/bachelorette party, and overblown, superfluous wedding day traditions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Janie, much to Quinn’s dismay, tosses a wrench in his efficacious endeavors and challenges him to prove his devotion by going through the matrimonial motions, no matter how minute and mundane. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Quinn last until the wedding day? Or will he yield to his tyrant impulses? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is not a standalone. It is the sequel to ‘Neanderthal Seeks Human,’ and is book #1.5 in the Knitting in the City series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From USA Today and Washington Post bestselling author L.J. Shen comes an intense, high school enemies-to-lovers romance with a twist.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Penn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say revenge is a dish best served cold. &lt;br /&gt;I’d had four years to stew on what Daria Followhill did to me, and now my heart was completely iced. &lt;br /&gt;I took her first kiss. &lt;br /&gt;She took the only thing I loved. &lt;br /&gt;I was poor. &lt;br /&gt;She was rich. &lt;br /&gt;The good thing about circumstances? They can change. Fast. &lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m her parents’ latest shiny project. &lt;br /&gt;Her housemate. Her tormentor. The captain of the rival football team she hates so much. &lt;br /&gt;Yeah, baby girl, say it—I’m your foster brother. &lt;br /&gt;There’s a price to pay for ruining the only good thing in my life, and she’s about to shell out some serious tears. &lt;br /&gt;Daria Followhill thinks she is THE queen. I’m about to prove to her that she’s nothing but a spoiled princess. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daria&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves a good old unapologetic punk. &lt;br /&gt;But being a bitch? Oh, you get slammed for every snarky comment, cynical eye roll, and foot you put in your adversaries’ way. &lt;br /&gt;The thing about stiletto heels is that they make a hell of a dent when you walk all over the people who try to hurt you. &lt;br /&gt;In Penn Scully’s case, I pierced his heart until he bled out, then left it in a trash can on a bright summer day. &lt;br /&gt;Four years ago, he asked me to save all my firsts for him. &lt;br /&gt;Now he lives across the hall, and I want nothing more than to be his last everything. &lt;br /&gt;His parting words when he gave me his heart were that nothing in this world is free. &lt;br /&gt;Now? Now he is making me pay. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Pour le meilleur et pour le pire, Ted Bundy a fait partie de ma vie pendant dix-huit ans. Ted le monstre. Le monstre-tueur-violeur. Celui-là même avec qui je passais des nuits à secourir des correspondants en détresse, des candidats au suicide. J'entends encore la patience et la sympathie qui perçaient dans sa voix. Je me rappelle la sollicitude avec laquelle il m'escortait jusqu'à ma voiture au petit matin, au cas où... Quand une vague de meurtres de jeunes filles ensanglanta le pays, j'eus droit, en tant qu'ancien membre de la police, à la primeur des informations. Et un beau jour, on m'annonça que les soupçons se portaient sur mon ami. Seule une preuve absolument irréfutable m'amena à accepter l'idée que cet homme était le plus épouvan-table des tueurs en série qu'aient connu les Etats-Unis... Aussi terrorisant qu'une fenêtre qui claque en pleine nuit. New York Times.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From ​the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author comes a breathtaking fantasy of a cursed kingdom, warring clans, and unexpected salvation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayr of Saylok, bastard son of a powerful and jealous chieftain, is haunted by the curse once leveled by his dying mother. Bartered, abandoned, and rarely loved, she plagued the land with her words: &lt;i&gt;From this day forward, there will be no daughters in Saylok.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised among the Keepers at Temple Hill, Bayr is gifted with inhuman strength. But he’s also blessed with an all-too-human heart that beats with one purpose: to protect Alba, the first girl child born in nearly two decades and the salvation for a country at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the fate of Saylok lies with Alba and Bayr, whose bond grows deeper with every whisper of coming chaos. Charged with battling the enemies of their people, both within and without, Bayr is fueled further by the love of a girl who has defied the scourge of Saylok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Bayr and Alba don’t know is that they each threaten the king, a greedy man who built his throne on lies, murder, and betrayal. There is only one way to defend their land from the corruption that has overtaken it. By breaking the curse, they could defeat the king…but they could also destroy themselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;He broke her heart, and now he’s back . . .&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Penny Reid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week. &lt;br /&gt;Manhattan apartment. &lt;br /&gt;Super-hot ex-boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;…What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been nine months since Kaitlyn Parker has seen or heard from Martin Sandeke—nine months and five stages of matter. She’s lived through the worst of first-love heartbreak, and is most certainly stronger (and less likely to hide in science cabinets) than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now Martin is back. And he wants to be friends. But he’s sending mixed signals to the Bunsen burner in Kaitlyn’s pants. Will Martin re-capture Kaitlyn’s heart? Can Kaitlyn and Martin ever be just friends? Or, despite an abundance of chemistry, are some bonds just too unstable to endure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elements of Chemistry: CAPTURE is the final part in a three part series; it is 65k words.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 (ATTRACTION) Available Now! (ends on a cliffhanger)&lt;br /&gt;Part 2 (HEAT) Available Now! (ends on a cliffhanger)&lt;br /&gt;Part 3 (CAPTURE) Available Now!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There are three things you need to know about Janie Morris:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) She is incapable of engaging in a conversation without volunteering TMTI (Too Much Trivial Information), especially when she is unnerved, &lt;br /&gt;2) No one unnerves her more than Quinn Sullivan, and &lt;br /&gt;3) She doesn't know how to knit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her boyfriend, apartment, and job in the same day, Janie Morris can't help wondering what new torment fate has in store. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her utter mortification, Quinn Sullivan—aka Sir McHotpants—witnesses it all then keeps turning up like a pair of shoes you lust after but can't afford. The last thing she expects is for Quinn to make her an offer she can't refuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neanderthal Seeks Human&lt;/i&gt; is book #1 in the &lt;i&gt;Knitting in the City&lt;/i&gt; series. Each book is a standalone, full length, contemporary romantic comedy novel, and follows the misadventures and exploits of seven friends in Chicago, all members of the same knitting group.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There will be a battle, and you will need to protect your heart.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kjell of Jeru had always known who he was. He'd never envied his brother or wanted to be king. He was the bastard son of the late King Zoltev and a servant girl, and the ignominy of his birth had never bothered him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But there is more to a man than his parentage. More to a man than his blade, his size, or his skills, and all that Kjell once knew has shifted and changed. He is no longer simply Kjell of Jeru, a warrior defending the crown. Now he is a healer, one of the Gifted, and a man completely at odds with his power. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Called upon to rid the country of the last vestiges of the Volgar, Kjell stumbles upon a woman who has troubling glimpses of the future and no memory of the past. Armed with his unwanted gift and haunted by regret, Kjell becomes a reluctant savior, beset by old enemies and new expectations. With the woman by his side, Kjell embarks upon a journey where the greatest test may be finding the man she believes him to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My Life in Shambles is an emotional and sexy new standalone contemporary romance from the New York Times bestselling author of A Nordic King and The Pact.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Valerie Stephens made the resolution to say yes to new adventures, she never thought she’d end up in the tiny town of Shambles, fake engaged to one of Ireland’s top rugby players. But there’s a first time for everything.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say bad things happen in threes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After my boyfriend broke off our engagement, I lost my apartment, and was laid off from my job, I can definitely attest to that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They also say life is what happens when you say yes to new adventures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when my two sisters invited me to ring in the new year in Ireland, I decided to throw all caution to the wind and go for it. I was going to let “saying yes” be my new resolution. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little did I know I’d spend New Year’s Eve having a hot and dirty one-night stand with Padraig McCarthy, one hell of a sexy Irishman. I also didn’t know that the brooding and intense sex god was one of Ireland’s top rugby players. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rugby player with a proposition for me: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come with him to his tiny hometown of Shambles and pretend to be his fiancé for a few days, just so that his ailing father can have some peace of mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It sounded simple enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was anything but. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when a town gets up in your business, not when the media hunts you down, not when your past comes back in the picture, not when there are real hearts and feelings at stake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not when there are secrets that could break you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They say life is what happens when you say yes to new adventures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my life in Shambles.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;-Reading Order-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - KILLING SARAI&lt;br /&gt;#2 - REVIVING IZABEL&lt;br /&gt;#3 - THE SWAN &amp;amp; THE JACKAL&lt;br /&gt;#4 - SEEDS OF INIQUITY&lt;br /&gt;#5 - THE BLACK WOLF&lt;br /&gt;#6 - BEHIND THE HANDS THAT KILL&lt;br /&gt;#7 - SPIDERS IN THE GROVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fredrik Gustavsson never considered the possibility of love, or that anyone could ever understand or accept his dark and bloody lifestyle—until he met Seraphina, a woman as vicious and blood-thirsty as Fredrik himself. They spent two short but unforgettable years together, full of lust and killing and the darkest kind of love that two people can share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Seraphina was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been six years since Fredrik’s lover and sadistic partner in crime turned his world upside-down. Seraphina went into hiding and has eluded him ever since. Now, he’s getting closer to finding her, and an innocent woman named Cassia is the key to drawing Seraphina from the shadows. But Cassia—after sustaining injuries from a fire that Seraphina ignited—suffers from amnesia and can’t give Fredrik the information he desperately seeks. Having no other choice, Fredrik has been keeping Cassia locked in his basement as he not only tries to get her to recall her past—because she and Seraphina share it—but also to protect her from Seraphina, who clearly wants her dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Cassia is a light in the darkness that Fredrik never believed existed. After a year subjected to her kindness and compassion, he finds himself struggling with his love for Seraphina, and his growing feelings for Cassia—because he knows that to love one, the other must die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will light win out over darkness, or will something more powerful than either further destroy an already tortured soul?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: THE SWAN &amp;amp; THE JACKAL is NOT a New Adult title. It, and all other books in the series are categorized as Suspense/Crime/Thriller.)</description>

  &lt;b&gt;It’s too late to turn back now . . .&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Penny Reid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four days left.&lt;br /&gt;Private beach (…and boat).&lt;br /&gt;Not so invisible girl.&lt;br /&gt;And maybe less of a jerk-faced bully than originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the worst (or the best) that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaitlyn is finding life outside of the science cabinet of obscurity to be quite illuminating …and so are her pants. When things heat up between Kaitlyn Parker and Martin—previously known as the jerk-faced bully—Sandeke, she places her trust in the one person she never thought capable of earning it, let alone keeping it safe. Fortunately or unfortunately for Kaitlyn, where she gives her trust she can’t help but also give her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how will the world beyond the sanctuary of their newfound connection react to their relationship? Soon senators, chinless billionaires, and elements beyond Martin and Kaitlyn’s control want to weigh in on the young couple’s future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navigating the chaotic inferno of new love might be more than Kaitlyn bargained for, and much, much more than her trust—or her heart—can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elements of Chemistry: HEAT is the second part in a three part series; it is 55k words; and it ends with a cliffhanger. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 1 (ATTRACTION) Available Now! (ends on a cliffhanger)&lt;br /&gt;Part 2 (HEAT) Available Now! (ends on a cliffhanger)&lt;br /&gt;Part 3 (CAPTURE) Available Now!</description>

  &lt;i&gt;He is everything she doesn’t want, so why does she want him so badly?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author Penny Reid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week.&lt;br /&gt;Private beach.&lt;br /&gt;Invisible girl.&lt;br /&gt;Jerk-faced bully.&lt;br /&gt;What’s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaitlyn Parker has no problem being the invisible girl, which is why she finds herself hiding in various cabinets and closets all over her college campus. Despite her best efforts, she can’t escape the notice of Martin Sandeke—bad boy, jerkface bully, and the universe’s hottest, wealthiest, and most unobtainable bachelor—who also happens to be Kaitlyn’s chemistry lab partner.&lt;br /&gt;Kaitlyn might be the only girl who isn’t interested in exploiting his stunning rower’s build, chiseled features, and family's billionaire fortune. Kaitlyn wants Martin for his brain, specifically to tabulate findings of trace elements in surface water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Kaitlyn saves Martin from a nefarious plot, Martin uses the opportunity to push Kaitlyn out of her comfort zone: spring break, one week, house parties, bathing suits, and suntan lotion. Can she overcome her aversion to being noticed? Will he be able grow beyond his self-centered nature? Or, despite their obvious chemistry, will Martin be the one to drive Kaitlyn into the science cabinet of obscurity for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to read more of the Hypothesis Series&lt;br /&gt;Book 1 ATTRACTION (ends in a cliffhanger!)&lt;br /&gt;Book 2 HEAT (ends in a cliffhanger!)&lt;br /&gt;Book 3 CAPTURE (no cliffhanger)&lt;br /&gt;Book 4 MOTION (ends in a cliffhanger!)&lt;br /&gt;Book 5 SPACE (ends in a cliffhanger!)&lt;br /&gt;Book 6 TIME (no cliffhanger)</description>

  <description>Dear Isaiah,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight months ago, you were just a soldier about to be deployed and I was just a waitress, sneaking you free pancakes and hoping you wouldn’t notice that my gaze was lingering a little too long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you did notice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent a “week of Saturdays” together before you left, and we said goodbye on day eight, exchanging addresses at the last minute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved every letter you ever sent, your words quickly becoming my religion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you went radio silent on me months ago, and then you had the audacity to walk into my diner yesterday and act like you’d never seen me in your life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To think … I almost loved you and your beautifully complicated soul. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever your reason is—I hope it’s a good one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maritza the Waitress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS – I hate you, and this time … I mean it.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Elin Hilderbrand, a summertime story about identical twins who couldn't be any less alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Nantucket is only two and a half hours away from Martha's Vineyard by ferry. But the two islands might as well be worlds apart for a set of identical twin sisters who have been at odds for years. When a family crisis forces them to band together — or at least appear to — the twins slowly come to realize that the special bond that they share is more important than the sibling rivalry that's driven them apart for the better part of their lives. A touching depiction of all the pleasures and annoyances of the sibling relationship, Elin Hilderbrand's next New York Times bestseller, THE IDENTICALS proves once and for all that just because twins look exactly the same doesn't mean they're anything alike. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;

  <description>A coming-of-age romance inspired by Great Expectations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life was irrevocably changed the moment I stepped foot inside Elena Alderman’s grand front doors. A lifeless tomb on the edge of Chicago’s Southside, the Alderman home sat in one of the city’s oldest and wealthiest neighborhoods, and Elena Alderman was the queen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was also mad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the kind of madness that’s readily apparent. No, her psychopathy was far more surgical—more…insidious. She was surrounded by beautiful things—most notably her grand piano and her adopted son, Henry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gift blossomed when my fingers touched her black and white keys. But my life began when I became haunted by the boy. Henry Alderman was a handsome blend of arrogance and seduction, and as we grew up together, I found it more and more impossible to separate him from my thoughts. I envied his life. I imagined how my name—Lily—would look with his. I became his closest friend…and more. I gave him my kiss, locked away his secrets, and loved him even when it was hard to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we were just a game. Elena Alderman made the rules. And when she decided to change them, she broke everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost.</description>

  <description>When Sarah meets Eddie, they connect instantly and fall in love. To Sarah, it seems as though her life has finally begun. And it's mutual: It's as though Eddie has been waiting for her, too. Sarah has never been so certain of anything. So when Eddie leaves for a long-booked vacation and promises to call from the airport, she has no cause to doubt him. But he doesn't call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah's friends tell her to forget about him, but she can't. She knows something's happened--there must be an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minutes, days, weeks go by as Sarah becomes increasingly worried. But then she discovers she's right. There is a reason for Eddie's disappearance, and it's the one thing they didn't share with each other: the truth.</description>

  <description>They killed my mother.&lt;br /&gt;They took our magic.&lt;br /&gt;They tried to bury us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zélie Adebola remembers when the soil of Orïsha hummed with magic. Burners ignited flames, Tiders beckoned waves, and Zélie’s Reaper mother summoned forth souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, maji were killed, leaving Zélie without a mother and her people without hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zélie has one chance to bring back magic and strike against the monarchy. With the help of a rogue princess, Zélie must outwit and outrun the crown prince, who is hell-bent on eradicating magic for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger lurks in Orïsha, where snow leoponaires prowl and vengeful spirits wait in the waters. Yet the greatest danger may be Zélie herself as she struggles to control her powers and her growing feelings for an enemy.</description>

  <description>Erik Larson's gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his "World's Fair Hotel" just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before.</description>

  <description>For the first time in history, too much food is making us sick. It’s all too apparent that the Modern American Diet (MAD) is expanding our waistlines; what’s less obvious is that it’s starving and shrinking our brains. Rates of obesity and depression have recently doubled, and while these epidemics are closely linked, few experts are connecting the dots for the average American.Using the latest data from the rapidly changing fields of neuroscience and nutrition,&lt;i&gt; The Happiness Diet&lt;/i&gt; shows that over the past several generations small, seemingly insignificant changes to our diet have stripped it of nutrients—like magnesium, vitamin B12, iron, and vitamin D, as well as some very special fats—that are essential for happy, well-balanced brains. These shifts also explain the overabundance of mood-destroying foods in the average American’s diet and why they predispose most of us to excessive weight gain. After a clear explanation of how we’ve all been led so far astray, &lt;i&gt;The Happiness Diet&lt;/i&gt; empowers the reader with simple, straightforward solutions. Graham and Ramsey show you how to steer clear of this MAD way of life with foods to swear off, shopping tips, brain-building recipes, and other practical advice, and then remake your diet by doubling down on feel-good foods—even the all-American burger.</description>

  <description>I'm a wolf in wolf’s clothing, and I’ll consume her if she lets me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ambition. Passion. Betrayal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rita Award-winning author Kennedy Ryan delivers the epic first installment of the All the King's Men Duet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raised to rule, bred to lead and weaned on a diet of ruthless ambition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a world of haves and have nots, my family has it all, and I want nothing to do with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My path takes me far from home and paints me as the black sheep. At odds with my father, I'm determined to build my own empire. I have rules, but Lennix Hunter is the exception to every one of them. From the moment we meet, something sparks between us. But my family stole from hers and my father is the man she hates most. I lied to have her, and will do anything to keep her. Though she tries to hate me, too, the inexorable pull between us will not be denied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And neither will I.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This journey is what I do now. I bump along, in fits and starts, on a perpetual path to finding better ways for me and my mate, Anxiety, to get around. It's everything I do.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Wilson—bestselling author and entrepreneur, intrepid solver of problems and investigator of how to live a better life—has helped over 1.2 million people across the world to quit sugar. She has also been an anxiety sufferer her whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her new book, she directs her intense focus and fierce investigatory skills onto this lifetime companion of hers, looking at the triggers and treatments, the fashions and fads. She reads widely and interviews fellow sufferers, mental health experts, philosophers, and even the Dalai Lama, processing all she learns through the prism her own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah pulls at the thread of accepted definitions of anxiety, and unravels the notion that it is a difficult, dangerous disease that must be medicated into submission. Ultimately, she re-frames anxiety as a spiritual quest rather than a burdensome affliction, a state of yearning that will lead us closer to what really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practical and poetic, wise and funny, this is a small book with a big heart. It will encourage the myriad sufferers of the world's most common mental illness to feel not just better about their condition, but delighted by the possibilities it offers for a richer, fuller life.</description>

  <description>A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;"You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When playboy businessman Jonas Faraday receives a private note from the anonymous intake agent assigned to process his online application to an exclusive club, he becomes obsessed with finding her and giving her the satisfaction she claims has always eluded her, in order to fulfill his own desperate need for redemption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah:&lt;/i&gt; “When I read Jonas Faraday’s brutally honest personal message on his application to The Club—I practically climaxed at my desk. I’m an idiot to risk losing my job but I couldn’t resist contacting him. I knew my confession would be like dangling an irresistible carrot in front of his nose—but never in a million years did I think he’d actually hunt me down.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jonas:&lt;/i&gt; “I was shocked to get my intake agent’s email—I’d attached that note to my application on a whim, never expecting a reply from an actual person, let alone a reply as mind blowing as that. Her message was so alluring, so irresistible, I’ve been spiraling into a full-blown obsession ever since I got it. What’s her name? What does she look like? Finding her is my top priority.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Club, what starts out as an innocent exploration of attraction quickly spirals into a steamy story of unbridled passion, obsession, heartbreak, and, ultimately, redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Readers 18+ only due to graphic sexual content and explicit language.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Celebrity favorite health and wellness consultant Kelly LeVeque shares her secrets for losing weight, attuning ourselves to our bodies’ needs, and freeing ourselves from food drama in this essential wellness guide, which includes 88 delectable recipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this inspirational yet practical book, the nutritional consultant and holistic healthcare expert who has helped celebrities such as Jessica Alba, Molly Sims, Chelsea Handler, and Emmy Rossum improve their health and achieve their goals shows you how to get beyond the food drama of cyclical fad diets and feel and look great by eating well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly’s Food Freedom program helps you set yourself up for success, eliminating cravings, mood swings, and other symptoms caused by food drama. Start your day with her Fab Four Smoothies, including a Strawberry Shortcake Smoothie and a Mango Kale Madness Smoothie, which pack protein, fat, fiber, and carbs to balance your blood sugar and keep you full and happy. After breakfast, you’ll thrive with her Fab Four recipes, including Turkey-Stuffed Delicata Squash, Spicy Salmon Nori Burritos, and Anti-Inflammatory Detox Salad, which include the Fab Four food groups—protein, fat, fiber, and greens—that play a role in day-long satiety. Kelly also teaches you how to elongate your blood sugar curve to stay full and happy, and make yourself insulin aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly has studied the science behind familiar diets to understand how they trigger the body to lose pounds—and why they aren’t sustainable. Instead, she offers a better choice: her four-step Food Freedom program that helps you find your wellness balance between eating enough and deciding how you feel. Once you find your balance, you will lose weight, lose fat, increase lean muscle mass, and drop at least one size. You’ll also enjoy thicker, shinier hair; clear, glowing skin; a remarkable improvement in your overall appearance; reduced joint pain and other inflammations; increased energy; and better sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with tips and resources on supplements and cleansing, dozens of delicious, healthy recipes and advice on how to adjust your eating when traveling and on vacation, &lt;em&gt;Body Love&lt;/em&gt; is your one-stop resource to living clean and happy!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Beloved food blogger and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Danielle Walker is back with over 100 new Paleo recipes in her sophomore cookbook, &lt;i&gt;Meals Made Simple&lt;/i&gt;—a collection of gluten-free, dairy-free, and Paleo-friendly recipes for easy weeknight meals.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at twenty-two, Danielle Walker spent many years in and out of the hospital and on high dosages of debilitating medications before taking her health into her own hands and drastically changing her diet. In a true lemons-to-lemonade story, Danielle transformed her adversities into opportunities and created her wildly successful blog, &lt;i&gt;Against All Grain&lt;/i&gt;, in an effort to help those in need eat well and feel great, without feeling deprived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With recipes that make cooking for the grain-free family both easy and enjoyable, &lt;i&gt;Meals Made Simple&lt;/i&gt; answers the age-old question: “What’s for dinner?” Danielle Walker takes the guesswork out of meal planning with eight weeks’ worth of dinner ideas, complete with full shopping lists and recipes for using up leftovers. Whether we’re moms, students, or business owners, at the end of the day we all want fresh, home-cooked meals that are easy to prepare. And we want lots of variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Preparing real foods can be time-consuming and monotonous, but Danielle brings both simplicity and creativity to the everyday meal with an enthusiasm for flavors and textures that are often lacking in easy weeknight dishes. &lt;i&gt;Meals Made Simple&lt;/i&gt; includes a variety of slow cooker, one-pot, and thirty-minute meals, as well as ways to create entirely new dishes from leftovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As in her critically acclaimed first cookbook, &lt;i&gt;Against All Grain&lt;/i&gt;, Danielle offers special “tidbits” to help ensure that your meals turn out picture-perfect. The vibrant flavors and colors in these grain-free dishes, like slow-cooked Pork Ragu, Beef Stroganoff, Peruvian-Style Chicken, Chicken and Rice Casserole, and Barbecue Salmon with Peach Salsa, add delight to any meal and put an end to all those nights of mundane grilled chicken and steamed vegetables. Even the desserts are quick to make, should a craving or a last-minute celebration arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Features include&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ·         make-ahead options&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ·         8 weeks’ worth of dinner ideas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ·         nutritional facts for every recipe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ·         shopping lists for fast grocery runs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ·         suggestions for how best to use leftovers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ·         slow cooker, one-pot, and 30-minute recipes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>** Hoops Holiday consists of FULL-COURT PRESS, a HOOPS novella originally published in the TEAM PLAYER Anthology. It has been expanded with all-new, never-before-published content &amp;amp; epilogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also includes Christmas-themed bonus material for LONG SHOT (Iris &amp;amp; August) and BLOCK SHOT (Banner &amp;amp; Jared).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗙𝗨𝗟𝗟-𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗥𝗧 𝗣𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗦*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MacKenzie Decker was a question Avery never got to ask, much less answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They met when she was a young reporter fueled by ambition, and the ink on Deck's first NBA contract was barely dry. Years later, they've climbed so high and lost so much, but one thing hasn't changed. The attraction that simmered between them in a locker room before is still there. With success like theirs, everything has been possible . . . except them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was then . . . but what about now?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A COMPLETE standalone and a Sinners of Saint spin-off.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naked surfer. Habitual pothead. A con, a liar, a thief and a fraud.&lt;br /&gt;Last I heard, he was extorting the rich and screwing their wives for a living.&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I’m more than a little surprised to find him at my threshold, looking for my friendship, my services, and most puzzling of all—looking humbled.&lt;br /&gt;Thing is, I’m on a boycott. Literally—I cut boys from my life. Permanently.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, Bane is not a boy, he is all man, and I’m falling, crashing, drowning in his sweet, perfect lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesse Carter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot as hell, cold as ice.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t aware of her existence until a fat, juicy deal landed in my lap.&lt;br /&gt;She’s a part of it, a little plaything to kill some time.&lt;br /&gt;She is collateral, a means to an end, and a side-bonus for striking a deal with her oil tycoon stepdad.&lt;br /&gt;More than anything, Jesse Carter is a tough nut to crack.&lt;br /&gt;Little does she know, I have the teeth for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This book contains material that might be offensive for some or elicit a strong emotional response.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Sasha.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s dark and mysterious.&lt;/b&gt; Quiet and lethal. &lt;br /&gt;An Irish mobster. &lt;br /&gt;Pure sin wrapped up in a beautiful package. &lt;br /&gt;But there’s also something off about him. &lt;br /&gt;He doesn’t feel anything. He shows no emotions. &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I question his humanity. &lt;br /&gt;He hasn’t spoken to me in two years. Not a single word. &lt;br /&gt;But we share a secret, he and I. &lt;br /&gt;And if it ever comes out, I have no doubt in my mind… &lt;br /&gt;He won’t have a problem killing me too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ronan.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve slain for her. I’ll do it again. &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Sasha, there isn’t a line I won’t cross. &lt;br /&gt;I watch her. She doesn’t know it. &lt;br /&gt;She thinks I hate her. Sometimes, I think I might too. &lt;br /&gt;But I’m always there, lurking in the shadows. &lt;br /&gt;Craving her. Trying to keep the beast within at bay. &lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep her safe. I’ll slaughter anyone who tries to hurt her. &lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can’t do… is protect her from myself. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Raw, captivating, and undeniably real, Nic Stone joins industry giants Jason Reynolds and Walter Dean Myers as she boldly tackles American race relations in this stunning debut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justyce McAllister is top of his class and set for the Ivy League—but none of that matters to the police officer who just put him in handcuffs. And despite leaving his rough neighborhood behind, he can't escape the scorn of his former peers or the ridicule of his new classmates. Justyce looks to the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for answers. But do they hold up anymore? He starts a journal to Dr. King to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the day Justyce goes driving with his best friend, Manny, windows rolled down, music turned up—way up, sparking the fury of a white off-duty cop beside them. Words fly. Shots are fired. Justyce and Manny are caught in the crosshairs. In the media fallout, it's Justyce who is under attack.</description>

  <description>The only purebred vampire left on the planet and the leader of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who killed his parents centuries ago. But when his most trusted fighter is killed—orphaning a half-breed daughter unaware of her heritage or her fate—Wrath must put down his dagger and usher the beautiful female into another world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racked by a restlessness in her body that wasn’t there before, Beth Randall is helpless against the dangerously sexy man who comes to her at night with shadows in his eyes.

  <description>Newlyweds Celestial and Roy are the embodiment of both the American Dream and the New South. He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. In this deft exploration of love, loyalty, race, justice, and both Black masculinity and Black womanhood in 21st century America, Jones achieves that most-elusive of all literary goals: the Great American Novel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named an Oprah’s Book Club Selection.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her younger brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller &lt;i&gt;You Are A Badass&lt;/i&gt; is the self-help book for people who desperately want to improve their lives but don't want to get busted doing it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this refreshingly entertaining how-to guide, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author and world-traveling success coach, Jen Sincero, serves up 27 bite-sized chapters full of hilariously inspiring stories, sage advice, easy exercises, and the occasional swear word. If you're ready to make some serious changes around here, &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt; will help you: Identify and change the self-sabotaging beliefs and behaviors that stop you from getting what you want, blast past your fears so you can take big exciting risks, figure out how to make some damn money already, learn to love yourself and others, set big goals and reach them - it will basically show you how to create a life you totally love, and how to create it &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of &lt;i&gt;You Are a Badass&lt;/i&gt;, you'll understand why you are how you are, how to love what you can't change, how to change what you don't love, and how to use The Force to kick some serious ass.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semi Finalist: Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Romance 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All is fair in love and auto maintenance.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beau Winston is the nicest, most accommodating guy in the world. Usually. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Handsome as the devil and twice as charismatic, Beau lives a charmed life as everyone’s favorite Winston Brother. But since his twin decided to leave town, and his other brother hired a stunning human-porcupine hybrid as a replacement mechanic for their auto shop, Beau Winston’s charmed life has gone to hell in a handbasket. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shelly Sullivan is not nice and is never accommodating. Ever. &lt;br /&gt;She mumbles to herself, but won’t respond when asked a question. She glares at everyone, especially babies. She won’t shake hands with or touch another person, but has no problems cuddling with a dog. And her damn parrot speaks only in curse words. Beau wants her gone. He wants her out of his auto shop, out of Tennessee, and out of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, learning why this porcupine wears her coat of spikes opens a Pandora’s box of complexity—exquisite, tempting, heartbreaking complexity—and Beau Winston soon discovers being nice and accommodating might mean losing what matters most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist: Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Romance 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make a deal with the devil and you might get what you want, but will it be what you need?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Sylvester wants one thing, and that one thing is NOT to be Tennessee’s reigning Banana Cake Queen. Ever the perpetual good girl and obedient daughter, Jennifer is buckling under the weight of her social media celebrity, her mother’s ambitions, and her father’s puritanical mandates. Jennifer is officially desperate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And desperate times call for Cletus Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cletus Winston is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery covered in conundrum sauce, and now he’s in a pickle. Despite being convinced of his own omniscience, extortion by the exalted Banana Cake Queen of Green Valley has taken him completely by surprise. So... what’s a maniacal mastermind to do? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely, the last thing you expect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wall Street Journal Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;USA Today Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hunches, horse races, and heartbreak&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after Simone Payton broke his heart, all Roscoe Winston wants is a doughnut. He’d also like to forget her entirely, but that’s never going to happen. Roscoe remembers everything—every look, every word, every single unrequited second—and the last thing he needs is another memory of Simone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after one chance encounter, Simone keeps popping up everywhere he happens to be . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after Roscoe Winston dropped out of her life, all Simone Payton wants is to exploit him. She’d also like some answers from her former best friend about why he ghosted her, but if she never gets those answers, that’s a-okay. Simone let go of the past a long time ago. Seriously, she has. She totally, totally has. She is definitely not still thinking about Roscoe. Nope. She’s more than happy to forget he exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, she needs just one teeny-tiny favor . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Strange Beard is a full-length romantic comedy novel, can be read as a stand-alone, and is the fifth book in the USA TODAY bestselling Winston Brothers series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna Diaz is everyone’s favorite “fat” funny lady. The movie studio executives can’t explain it, but her films are out-grossing all the fit and trim headliners and Hollywood’s most beautiful elite. The simple truth is, everyone loves plus-sized Sienna. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she has a problem, she can’t read maps and her sense of direction is almost as bad as her comedic timing is stellar. Therefore, when Sienna’s latest starring role takes her to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park she finds herself continually lost while trying to navigate the backroads of Green Valley, Tennessee. Much to her consternation, Sienna’s most frequent savior is a ridiculously handsome, charming, and cheeky Park Ranger by the name of Jethro Winston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna is accustomed to high levels of man-handsome, so it’s not Jethro’s chiseled features or his perfect physique that make Sienna stutter. It’s his southern charm. And gentlemanly manners. And habit of looking at her too long and too often. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna has successfully navigated the labyrinth of Hollywood heart-throbs. But can she traverse the tenuous trails of Tennessee without losing her head? Or worse, her heart?</description>

  <description>There are three things you need to know about Ashley Winston: 1) She has six brothers and they all have beards, 2) She is a reader, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former beauty queen, Ashley Winston’s preferred coping strategy is escapism. She escaped her Tennessee small town, loathsome father, and six brothers eight years ago. Now she escapes life daily via her Amazon kindle one-click addiction. However, when a family tragedy forces her to return home, Ashley can’t escape the notice of Drew Runous— local Game Warden, reclusive mountain man, bear wrestler, philosopher, and everyone’s favorite guy. Drew’s irksome philosophizing in particular makes Ashley want to run for the skyscrapers, especially since he can’t seem to keep his exasperating opinions— or his soulful poetry, steadfast support, and delightful hands— to himself. Pretty soon the girl who wanted nothing more than the escape of the big city finds she’s lost her heart in small town Tennessee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a full-length novel, can be read as a standalone, and is the fourth book in the 'Knitting in the City' series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>"Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he'd had three months to write. [It] was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said. 'Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.'"&lt;p&gt;With this basic instruction always in mind, Anne Lamott returns to offer us a new gift: a step-by-step guide on how to write and on how to manage the writer's life. From "Getting Started,' with "Short Assignments," through "Shitty First Drafts," "Character," "Plot," "Dialogue." all the way from "False Starts" to "How Do You Know When You're Done?" Lamott encourages, instructs, and inspires. She discusses "Writers Block," "Writing Groups," and "Publication." Bracingly honest, she is also one of the funniest people alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever wondered what it takes to be a writer, what it means to be a writer, what the contents of your school lunches said about what your parents were really like, this book is for you. From faith, love, and grace to pain, jealousy, and fear, Lamott insists that you keep your eyes open, and then shows you how to survive. And always, from the life of the artist she turns to the art of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beards, brothers, and bikers! Oh my! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Identical twins Beau and Duane Winston might share the same devastatingly handsome face, but where Beau is outgoing and sociable, Duane is broody and reserved. This is why Jessica James, recent college graduate and perpetual level-headed good girl, has been in naïve and unhealthy infatuation with Beau Winston for most of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His friendly smiles make her tongue-tied and weak-kneed, and she’s never been able to move beyond her childhood crush. Whereas Duane and Jessica have always been adversaries. She can’t stand him, and she’s pretty sure he can’t stand the sight of her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a case of mistaken identity, Jessica finds herself in a massive confusion kerfuffle. Jessica James has spent her whole life paralyzed by the fantasy of Beau and her assumptions of Duane’s disdain; therefore she’s unprepared for the reality that is Duane’s insatiable interest, as well as his hot hands and hot mouth and hotter looks. Not helping Jessica’s muddled mind and good girl sensibilities, Duane seems to have gotten himself in trouble with the local biker gang, the Iron Order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, Beau’s magic spell is broken. Yet when Jessica finds herself drawn to the man who was always her adversary, now more dangerous than ever, how much of her level-head heart is she willing to risk?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A woman's disappearance shakes up a strange northern town that is stuck in the 1980s, in a wildly imaginative novel that combines elements of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why can't a woman be more than one person in a lifetime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been months since Billie Jean Fontaine left her bedroom, trapped alone by grief. One night, out of the blue, she emerges and announces that she's going into town--but she never returns. Her husband and daughter undertake a frantic search for the beloved and beautiful Billie Jean. She was the only outsider ever to arrive in this strange town--a town founded decades ago by a charismatic cult leader, cut off from the world ever since, where the residents think the year is 1985, and listen to Whitesnake and Air Supply on their Walkmans. Now the residents wonder: has Billie Jean become the first person to leave, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the core of the novel is the deeply moving relationship between Billie Jean and her daughter: who idolizes her mother, is mystified by her, is frustrated by her. Told from three unforgettable perspectives&lt;i&gt;, Heartbreaker&lt;/i&gt; is the electrifying portrait of a woman who has risked everything for freedom and love, and the secrets she leaves in her wake.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;***This is not a cliffhanger!***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resisting an irresistible force wears you down and turns you out. I know. I've been doing it for years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not have a musical gift of my own, but I've got a nose for talent and an eye for the extraordinary. And Marlon James - Grip to his fans - is nothing short of extraordinary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago, we strung together a few magical nights, but I keep those memories in a locked drawer and I've thrown away the key. All that's left is friendship and work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's on the verge of unimaginable fame, all his dreams poised to come true. I manage his career, but I can't seem to manage my heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's wild, reckless, disobedient. And it remembers all the things I want to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; Make sure you grab FLOW, the FREE prequel first! FLOW is chronicling the week of magical days and nights that will haunt Grip &amp;amp; Bristol for years to come. GRIP is the full-length conclusion of their story.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In 8 years, Marlon James will be one of the brightest rising stars in the music industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristol Gray will be his tough, no-nonsense manager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when they first meet, she’s a college student finding her way in the world, and he’s an artist determined to make his way in it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From completely different worlds, all the things that should separate them only draw them closer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a beautiful beginning, but where will the story end? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;FLOW is the prequel chronicling the week of magical days and nights that will haunt Grip &amp;amp; Bristol for years to come.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you could make one simple choice that would change your life forever, would you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin is a documentary filmmaker on the brink of a professional breakthrough, Mark a handsome investment banker with big plans. Passionately in love, they embark on a dream honeymoon to the tropical island of Bora Bora, where they enjoy the sun, the sand, and each other. Then, while scuba diving in the crystal blue sea, they find something in the water. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could the life of your dreams be the stuff of nightmares?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the newlyweds must make a dangerous choice: to speak out or to protect their secret. After all, if no one else knows, who would be hurt? Their decision will trigger a devastating chain of events. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you ever wondered how long it takes to dig a grave?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder no longer. Catherine Steadman's enthralling voice shines throughout this spellbinding debut novel. With piercing insight and fascinating twists, &lt;i&gt;Something in the Water&lt;/i&gt; challenges the reader to confront the hopes we desperately cling to, the ideals we're tempted to abandon, and the perfect lies we tell ourselves.</description>

      <![CDATA[Loved this book. It started a bit slowly for me, but then...sort of like a roller coaster that’s inched to the top and then drops wickedly, the plot picked up and sped along. Sometimes the narrator, main character Erin, drove me a bit nuts with her impetuousness but then...we wouldn’t have a plot...]]>

And soon. &lt;br /&gt;Resolving to meet the threat head-on, Sam prepares for the toughest fight of her life but finds herself caught between two worlds; still caring for the man she once loved, as her affections grow for another, while fearing for her life and the lives of all women.

Go sit down. Have several seats. &lt;br /&gt;I'll just be over here ignoring the man carved from my fantasies with a lust-tipped chisel. &lt;br /&gt;Oh, I didn't say the struggle wasn't real. &lt;br /&gt;But I've got that one dollar, and Jared won't have me.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;All bets are off. This time the gamble is survival.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emika Chen barely made it out of the Warcross Championships alive. Now that she knows the truth behind Hideo's new NeuroLink algorithm, she can no longer trust the one person she's always looked up to, who she once thought was on her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to put a stop to Hideo's grim plans, Emika and the Phoenix Riders band together, only to find a new threat lurking on the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. Someone's put a bounty on Emika's head, and her sole chance for survival lies with Zero and the Blackcoats, his ruthless crew. But Emika soon learns that Zero isn't all that he seems—and his protection comes at a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caught in a web of betrayal, with the future of free will at risk, just how far will Emika go to take down the man she loves?</description>

  <description>New York Times best-selling author and professor Brené Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be. We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&lt;/i&gt;, a laugh-out-loud story of love, new friendships, and one unique food truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clara Shin lives for pranks and disruption. When she takes one joke too far, her dad sentences her to a summer working on his food truck, the KoBra, alongside her uptight classmate Rose Carver. Not the carefree summer Clara had imagined. But maybe Rose isn't so bad. Maybe the boy named Hamlet (yes, Hamlet) crushing on her is pretty cute. Maybe Clara actually feels invested in her dad’s business. What if taking this summer seriously means that Clara has to leave her old self behind? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Maurene Goo's signature warmth and humor, &lt;i&gt;The Way You Make Me Feel&lt;/i&gt; is a relatable story of falling in love and finding yourself in the places you’d never thought to look.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was like a breath of fresh air: the diversity of its characters, the vivid setting (LA itself was an character!) and the authenticity of the Clara's sassy, teenaged voice. Everything felt legit, relevant and honest - I loved that. Initially, I worried that the constant detailing of ever...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For readers of Gillian Flynn and Donna Tartt, a dark, propulsive and addictive debut thriller, splashed with all the glitz and glitter of New York City.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They go through both bottles of champagne right there on the High Line, with nothing but the stars over them... They drink and Lavinia tells Louise about all the places they will go together, when they finish their stories, when they are both great writers-to Paris and to Rome and to Trieste...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavinia will never go. She is going to die soon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise has nothing. Lavinia has everything. After a chance encounter, the two spiral into an intimate, intense, and possibly toxic friendship. A &lt;i&gt;Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/i&gt; for the digital age, this seductive story takes a classic tale of obsession and makes it irresistibly new.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Nature gave her a gift. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Evil turned it into a curse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Astrid doesn't remember much about her childhood, at least not before her parents death. After that her memories of the group home and the other eleven boys and girls that lived there are vague and scary. But not as scary as the doctors she had to visit each week or the shots that they gave her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But she isn't a child anymore. She's an adult and with her mentor's help, has carved a life for herself and the powers she wields. She's safe. She's capable. She's super. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until it all comes crashing down and the past races back into her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She's not alone in her abilities and one-by-one she'll find the others like her. She'll form a team. Find heartache and love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ultimately she'll have to take down one of her own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That's what it means to be one of the Elite. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;*The Elite is a superhero fantasy series with a healthy dose of kick-ass action, an unstoppable heroine, a sexy reverse harem love story and gadgets and cool toys that every superhero wishes to add to their arsenal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A startling new vision of paranormal romance: When a human ventures into the world of vampires—a decadent milieu of blood-bonds and betrayal—she discovers that not all is what it seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Reyna Carpenter, giving up her body isn’t a choice. It’s survival.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a civilization laid waste by poverty and desperation, Reyna accepts a high-paying position with the wealthy and hungry vampire elite. Her new job is as the live-in blood escort for the intimidating, demanding, and devilishly handsome Beckham Anderson. He’s everything she expected from a vampire, except for one thing—he won’t feed off her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reyna soon discovers that behind Beckham’s brooding, wicked façade lies a unique and complex man. And that, in a dark and divided world, she is more valuable than she ever would have believed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For with each passing night, Reyna can’t shake the sensation that it’s Beckham who’s afraid of &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: Reyna and Beckham’s story continues in &lt;i&gt;Blood Match&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ebook includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>From bestselling author L.J. Shen, comes a new, &lt;b&gt;standalone&lt;/b&gt;, contemporary romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have been easy.&lt;br /&gt;I needed the money. He needed a babysitter to keep him from snorting himself to death.&lt;br /&gt;I was cherry-picked especially for him. Responsible. Optimistic. Warm. Innocent.&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I should have known better.&lt;br /&gt;Alex Winslow. British rock star. Serial heartbreaker. Casanova with whiskey eyes.&lt;br /&gt;“Don’t get near the devil in a leather jacket. He’ll chew you up and spit you out.”&lt;br /&gt;Guess what? I didn’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;I signed the contract.&lt;br /&gt;World tour. Three months. Four Continents. One hundred shows.&lt;br /&gt;My name is Indigo Bellamy, and I sold my soul to a tattooed god.&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, my soul wasn’t enough for Alex Winslow. He ended up taking my body, too.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my heart.&lt;br /&gt;Then he took my all.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;*New York Times Bestseller*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not one thing in your life is more important than figuring out how to live in the face of unspoken pain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;One Thousand Gifts&lt;/em&gt; Ann Voskamp sits at the edge of her life and all of her own unspoken brokenness and asks: What if you really want to live abundantly before it's too late? What do you do if you really want to know abundant wholeness? This is the one begging question that’s behind every single aspect of our lives—and one that &lt;em&gt;The Broken Way&lt;/em&gt; rises up to explore in the most unexpected ways.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one's for the lovers and the sufferers. For those whose hopes and dreams and love grew so large it broke their willing hearts. This one's for the busted ones who are ready to bust free, the ones ready to break molds, break chains, break measuring sticks, and break all this bad brokenness with an unlikely good brokenness.  You could be one of the Beloved who is broken—and still lets yourself be loved.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could be one of them, one who believes freedom can be found not only beyond the fear and pain, but actually &lt;em&gt;within it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could discover and trust this broken way—the way to not be afraid of broken things.</description>

  <description>Prentisstown isn't like other towns. Everyone can hear everyone else's thoughts in an overwhelming, never-ending stream of Noise. Just a month away from the birthday that will make him a man, Todd and his dog, Manchee -- whose thoughts Todd can hear too, whether he wants to or not -- stumble upon an area of complete silence. They find that in a town where privacy is impossible, something terrible has been hidden -- a secret so awful that Todd and Manchee must run for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But how do you escape when your pursuers can hear your every thought?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ready for another round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ava Grace Landy’s music career is humming along until a shakeup at her label jeopardizes her recording contract and curses her with the world’s worst boss. Determined to satisfy him, she partners with Trinity Distillery to access a larger male audience. To her surprise, she’s the one who’s satisfied—by none other than Jonah Beck, the gorgeous, yet gruff man behind the bourbon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt about it, bourbon runs in Beck’s blood. But it’s audacious Ava Grace who makes it run hot. When she signs on as the spokesperson for his craft distillery, he doesn’t plan on hoisting her onto an oak barrel and rocking the rickhouse. Though he’s convinced their lives don’t mix—like a terrible cocktail—he can’t keep his hands off the alluring country star. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ava Grace and Beck try to keep their intoxicating relationship private, but the glare of her fame is too bright, revealing secrets they both want to remain hidden. With a spotlight shining on his tumultuous past, their future is at risk. Now they must decide if being together is worth sacrificing the career she loves and the company he’s poured his heart and soul into.</description>

  <description>This is an alternative cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35827081-so-near-the-horizon" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN B074N414J9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment she crosses paths with Danny, Jessica is fascinated. The dashing, confident twenty-year-old has everything she dreams of—looks, success, independence, money—and his kind, infinitely cheerful nature is spellbinding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Jessica sees something else lingering underneath Danny’s perfect facade. Bit by bit, she manages to pick it apart, unveiling harrowing truths about a deeply traumatic childhood that has left more than just emotional scars. Now, far away from his home and family, he is fighting to build a normal life for himself—even though he may be destined for a future as dark as his past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all adversity and against all reason, a deep and intimate love develops between Danny and Jessica. But soon they find themselves confronting the harsh realities of a superficial world, battling against prejudice and exclusion at every turn… and, worst of all, racing against time…</description>

The author deals with some pretty intense (and potentially triggering) subject matter, and knowing that this was a true story made it all the more dramatic.

  <description>Rachel Blum and Andy Landis are eight years old when they meet late one night in an ER waiting room. Born with a congenital heart defect, Rachel is a veteran of hospitals, and she's intrigued by the boy who shows up all alone with a broken arm. He tells her his name. She tells him a story. After Andy's taken back to the emergency room and Rachel's sent back to her bed, they think they'll never see each other again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel, the beloved, popular, and protected daughter of two doting parents, grows up wanting for nothing in a fancy Florida suburb. Andy grows up poor in Philadelphia with a single mom and a rare talent that will let him become one of the best runners of his generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of three decades, through high school and college, marriages and divorces, from the pinnacles of victory and the heartbreak of defeat, Andy and Rachel will find each other again and again, until they are finally given a chance to decide whether love can surmount difference and distance and if they've been running toward each other all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With honesty, wit, and clear-eyed observations about men and women, love and fate, and the truth about happy endings, Jennifer Weiner delivers two of her most memorable characters, and a love story you'll never forget.</description>

She’s charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone at Bexley &amp;amp; Gamin. Everyone except for coldly efficient, impeccably attired, physically intimidating Joshua Templeman. And the feeling is mutual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trapped in a shared office together 40 (OK, 50 or 60) hours a week, they’ve become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. There’s the Staring Game. The Mirror Game. The HR Game. Lucy can’t let Joshua beat her at anything—especially when a huge new promotion goes up for the taking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Lucy wins this game, she’ll be Joshua’s boss. If she loses, she’ll resign. So why is she suddenly having steamy dreams about Joshua, and dressing for work like she’s got a hot date? After a perfectly innocent elevator ride ends with an earth-shattering kiss, Lucy starts to wonder whether she’s got Joshua Templeman all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn’t hate Joshua Templeman. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Why is everyone talking about the ending of Sarah Pinborough's &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Behind Her Eyes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise is a single mom, a secretary, stuck in a modern-day rut. On a rare night out, she meets a man in a bar and sparks fly. Though he leaves after they kiss, she’s thrilled she finally connected with someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Louise arrives at work on Monday, she meets her new boss, David. The man from the bar. The very married man from the bar…who says the kiss was a terrible mistake but who still can’t keep his eyes off Louise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Louise bumps into Adele, who’s new to town and in need of a friend, but she also just happens to be married to David. David and Adele look like the picture-perfect husband and wife, but then why is David so controlling, and why is Adele so scared of him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Louise is drawn into David and Adele’s orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong, but Louise can’t guess how wrong―and how far a person might go to protect their marriage’s secrets.</description>

  <description>Once upon a time the daughter of a mafia king fell in love with a foot soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fairy tale didn’t have a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I barely managed to escape alive, and we’ve lived in relative hiding ever since. I’m safe now, but I can never forget the boy who gave his life to save mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except there’s a chance that he’s still alive. And he’s fighting a war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even knowing the risks, I have to find him. I have to find some way to protect him, the way he protected me. But he isn’t the boy I left behind. He’s a violent man. A criminal. And he’s been waiting for me—the final pawn in a dark game of survival and love.</description>

  <description>Young veterinarian Nathan Brooks spent every childhood summer with his neighbor’s granddaughter Julia Hart. As a small boy, he’d been impressed by her attack on him with a plastic bat after his border collie attempted to eat her kitten. He knew he’d marry her someday. Childish spats evolved into something sweeter until suddenly, cats and dogs didn’t seem so incompatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Nathan’s mother succumbed to cancer and his father and brother took solace in addiction. For Nathan, golden days grew few, and far between. Cast out of his home, Nathan had to make his own way in the world. For the first year, he managed to keep everything together. The year after that, his life fell apart and he left behind the only girl who ever mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years after Nathan left her, Julia Hart is living in her grandmother’s house next door. Nathan has returned home to open his own practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a lot of unfinished business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently, neither has been able to move on. But what can he offer her? They haven’t spoken since the day he walked out with no explanation, and Julia’s not about to let bygones be bygones. Not after she’s spent three years shoring up the walls around her broken heart. Besides, he’s not exactly convinced he’s the best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But fate has a way of knocking down walls when it gets good and ready. Even if Julia and Nathan are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first of two novellas containing animal antics and a second chance romance. Partial proceeds will be donated by the author to children’s cancer charities.</description>

  <description>In an unnamed city, the Elysian Society allows paying clients to reconnect with their lost loved ones. The workers, known as bodies, spend their days in a numb routine, wearing the discarded belongings of the dead and swallowing pills to summon spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edie has been a body for five years, an unusual record. Her success depends on her carefulness. When she channels the wife of Patrick Braddock, an enigmatic widower, she becomes obsessed with the glamorous couple. Despite the strange circumstances surrounding Sylvia Braddock's death, Edie pursues Patrick outside the Elysian Society walls, moving deeper into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of hiding, Edie can't tell whether she's falling in love or whether she's being possessed by Sylvia. She takes increasing risks to keep Patrick within her grasp. But as a disturbing murder case brings attention to the Elysian Society, Edie feels her quiet life unraveling. She grapples with both Sylvia's growing influence and with her own long-buried secrets.</description>

  <description>Twenty-four-year-old truck stop waitress and single mother Catherine Wright has simple goals: to give her five-year-old daughter a happy life and to never again be the talk of the town in Balsam, Pennsylvania: population two thousand outside of tourist season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then one foggy night, on a lonely road back from another failed attempt at a relationship, Catherine saves a man’s life. It isn’t until after the police have arrived that Catherine realizes exactly who it is she has saved: Brett Madden, hockey icon and media darling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine has already had her fifteen minutes of fame and the last thing she wants is to have her past dragged back into the spotlight, only this time on a national stage. So she hides her identity. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she finds the man she saved standing on her doorstep, desperate to thank her, all that changes. What begins as an immediate friendship quickly turns into something neither of them expected. Something that Catherine isn’t sure she can handle; something that Catherine is afraid to trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because how long can an extraordinary man like Brett be interested in an ordinary woman like Catherine…before the spark fades?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn’t just a game—it’s a way of life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obsession started ten years ago and its fan base now spans the globe, some eager to escape from reality and others hoping to make a profit. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down Warcross players who bet on the game illegally. But the bounty hunting world is a competitive one, and survival has not been easy. To make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships—only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced she’s going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game’s creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. He needs a spy on the inside of this year’s tournament in order to uncover a security problem . . . and he wants Emika for the job. With no time to lose, Emika’s whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she’s only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This guide reveals how writers can utilize cognitive storytelling strategies to craft stories that ignite readers’ brains and captivate them through each plot element.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Imagine knowing what the brain craves from every tale it encounters, what fuels the success of any great story, and what keeps readers transfixed. Wired for Story reveals these cognitive secrets—and it’s a game-changer for anyone who has ever set pen to paper.&lt;br /&gt;     The vast majority of writing advice focuses on “writing well” as if it were the same as telling a great story. This is exactly where many aspiring writers fail—they strive for beautiful metaphors, authentic dialogue, and interesting characters, losing sight of the one thing that every engaging story must do: ignite the brain’s hardwired desire to learn what happens next. When writers tap into the evolutionary purpose of story and electrify our curiosity, it triggers a delicious dopamine rush that tells us to pay attention. Without it, even the most perfect prose won’t hold anyone’s interest.&lt;br /&gt;     Backed by recent breakthroughs in neuroscience as well as examples from novels, screenplays, and short stories, Wired for Story offers a revolutionary look at story as the brain experiences it. Each chapter zeroes in on an aspect of the brain, its corresponding revelation about story, and the way to apply it to your storytelling right now.</description>

When her acceptance letter from NYU arrives she thinks maybe things are about to change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She just doesn’t realize how much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's quite thrilling enough to discover that her new home is a beautiful mansion. But then she discovers her housemates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Five wildly attractive young artists. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It's easy to get swept up in the fairytale of it all, but this house carries with it a secret... and so do the five enticing and charming men. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In time, Morgan learns the six of them must wield this knowledge--together--if they're going to save the world.</description>

  <description>On May 15, 1975, fifteen-year-old Ginny Lemon is abducted from a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale by a member of one of the most notorious and brutal motorcycle gangs in South Florida. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From that moment on, her life is forever changed. She gets a new name, a new identity and a new life in the midst of the gang’s base on the edge of the Florida Everglades—a frightening, rough and violent world much like the swamps themselves, where everyone has an alias and loyalty is tantamount to survival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And at the center of it all is the gang’s leader, Grizz: massive, ruggedly handsome, terrifying and somehow, when it comes to Ginny, tender. She becomes his obsession and the one true love of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So begins a tale of emotional obsession and manipulation, of a young woman ripped from everything she knows and forced to lean on the one person who provides attention, affection and care: her captor. Precocious and intelligent, but still very much a teenager, Ginny struggles to adapt to her existence, initially fighting and then coming to terms with her captivity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will she be rescued? Will she escape? Will she get out alive—or get out at all? Part psychological thriller, part coming-of-age novel, filled with mystery, romance and unexpected turns, Nine Minutes takes readers into the world of one motorcycle gang and inside the heart of a young girl, whose abduction brought about its fall.</description>

  <description>Ruby Santos knew exactly what she was getting herself into when she signed up to write a soldier overseas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The guidelines were simple: one letter or email a week for the length of his or her deployment. Care packages were optional. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Been there, done that. She thought she knew what to expect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she didn’t count on was falling in love with the guy.</description>

      <![CDATA[More of a 4.5. Loved this book, only wish the epilogue and last chapters were a little longer. I'm all for a slow burn (and Zapata does this deliciously well) but then I want a nice, healthy denouement ☺<br />Still - I adore anything by this author. She is so real...and she makes me care. Happy sigh.]]>

  <description>Yesterday, Rachel went to sleep listening to Taylor Swift, curled up in her grammy’s quilt, worrying about geometry. Today, she woke up in a ditch, bloodied, bruised, and missing a year of her life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She doesn’t recognize the person she’s become: she’s popular. She wears nothing but black. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black to cover the blood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she can fight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell no one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s not the only girl to go missing within the last year…but she’s the only girl to come back. She desperately wants to unravel what happened to her, to try and recover the rest of the Lost Girls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more she discovers, the more her memories return. And as much as her new life scares her, it calls to her. Seductively. The good girl gone bad, sex, drugs, and raves, and something darker…something she still craves—the rush of the fight, the thrill of the win—something she can’t resist, that might still get her killed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only rule is: There are no rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Stud Finder&lt;/b&gt; is a standalone, dual-POV novella that links characters from &lt;b&gt;The Knocked Up Plan&lt;/b&gt; with the &lt;b&gt;The Big Rock&lt;/b&gt; books and does not need to be read in any order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are three little words most guys don’t want to hear on the first date. Not those... I mean these... “knock me up.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This single gal has had enough of the games, the BS and the endless chase. I know what I want most, and it’s not true love. It’s a bun in the oven, and I’m not afraid to hit up my sex-on-a-stick co-worker to do the job. Ryder is gorgeous, witty and charming—and he’s also a notorious commitment-phobe. That makes him the perfect candidate to make a deposit in the bank of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I won’t fall for him, he won’t fall for me, and there’s no way baby will make three. &lt;br /&gt;Right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are four words every guy wants to hear on the first date—“your place or mine?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hot-as-sin co-worker makes me a no-strings-attached offer that involves her place, my place, any place—as well as any position—I can’t refuse. Besides, I've got my own reasons to take her up on her deal even with her one BIG condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s no way I’ll want more from one woman than any position, any where, any night? Except... what if I do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Be prepared to swoon and fan yourself from the heat! This full-length standalone contains lots of hot baby-making s-e-x, happy tears, naughty jokes and a hot, swoon-worthy hero you will fall madly in love with.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>These Royals will ruin you…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From mortal enemies to unexpected allies, two teenagers try to protect everything that matters most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Harper has met every challenge that life has thrown her way. She’s tough, resilient, and willing to do whatever it takes to defend the people she loves, but the challenge of a long-lost father and a boyfriend whose life is on the line might be too much for even Ella to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has a quick temper and even faster fists. But his tendency to meet every obstacle with violence has finally caught up with him. If he wants to save himself and the girl he loves, he’ll need to rise above his tortured past and tarnished reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one believes Ella can survive the Royals. Everyone is sure Reed will destroy them all.&lt;br /&gt;They may be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With everything and everyone conspiring to keep them apart, Ella and Reed must find a way to beat the law, save their families, and unravel all the secrets in their Twisted Palace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Are you trying to kill us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, but we love Ella so much and her adventures with the Royals that we needed to write this third book. You’ll see when you read it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: Who’s in this book? And don’t say Ella!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella, the five Royal brothers, and a few more huge surprises.</description>

  <description>I had everything a woman could want. …My husband, James. The house on the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life. Our perfect life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Alex came to visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I saw my husband's best friend, I didn't like him. Didn't like how James changed when he was around, didn't like how his penetrating eyes followed me everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that didn't stop me from wanting him. And, surprisingly, James didn't seem to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was meant to be fun. Something the three of us shared for those hot summer weeks Alex stayed with us. Nobody was supposed to fall in or out of love. I didn't need another man, not even one who oozed sex like honey and knew all the secrets I didn't know, the secrets my husband hadn't shared. After all, we had a perfect life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I loved my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I wasn't the only one.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;From wharf fights and school brawls to crumbling lives inside glittery mansions, one guy tries to save himself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE ROYALS WILL RUIN YOU...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed Royal has it all—looks, status, money. The girls at his elite prep school line up to date him, the guys want to be him, but Reed never gave a damn about anyone but his family until Ella Harper walked into his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started off as burning resentment and the need to make his father’s new ward suffer turned into something else entirely—keep Ella close. Keep Ella safe. But when one foolish mistake drives her out of Reed’s arms and brings chaos to the Royal household, Reed’s entire world begins to fall apart around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella doesn’t want him anymore. She says they’ll only destroy each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Secrets. Betrayal. Enemies. It’s like nothing Reed has ever dealt with before, and if he’s going to win back his princess, he’ll need to prove himself Royally worthy. &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>This summer, the temperature’s rising in Rio . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olivia Russell is a little desperate. What’s a girl to do when the excessively hot, sorta shy swimmer she’s always pined for finally appears to return her feelings? Right before he heads to Rio and the Olympic Games?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweet him, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Muller doesn’t know he ended up here. He’s been in love with Olivia for three years. But @ArieltheMermaid is funny and clever and doesn’t make him sweat. Should he holdout for the cool blonde he’s wanted forever, or fall for the cute, spunky girl he only knows through Twitter? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Chris discovers the truth, even the pool won’t be enough to cool him off.</description>

  <description>Growing up on Long Island, Shelby Richmond is an ordinary girl until one night an extraordinary tragedy changes her fate. Her best friend’s future is destroyed in an accident, while Shelby walks away with the burden of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when a life is turned inside out? When love is something so distant it may as well be a star in the sky? Faithful is the story of a survivor, filled with emotion—from dark suffering to true happiness—a moving portrait of a young woman finding her way in the modern world. A fan of Chinese food, dogs, bookstores, and men she should stay away from, Shelby has to fight her way back to her own future. In New York City she finds a circle of lost and found souls—including an angel who’s been watching over her ever since that fateful icy night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a character you will fall in love with, so believable and real and endearing, that she captures both the ache of loneliness and the joy of finding yourself at last. For anyone who’s ever been a hurt teenager, for every mother of a daughter who has lost her way, Faithful is a roadmap.</description>

  <description>Rio is hot, steamy, and a little bit dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe Rocha hasn’t been back to Rio since he and his mother left more than ten years ago. He’d always dreamed of showing his best friend Nick the real Rio, but when disaster strikes, he’s stuck with Jemma instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jemma Keane doesn’t like her boss, and she really doesn’t like her boss' best friend. He’s bossy and rude and makes her want things she can’t explain. She’s supposed to be working in Rio, but all she wants to do is play--with Gabe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jemma’s nothing like what Gabe imagined, and definitely nothing like Nick described. Gabe’s seen enough romantic comedies to know how a summer fling with Jemma might end, but what he anticipates the least is that he never wants it to.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a fun, sexy book set against the backdrop of last simmer's Olympics in Rio. The chemistry of the main characters, Jenna and Gabe, jumps off the page from the get-go, and I enjoyed both the sexual tension and the smart banter. ]]>

  <description>The rules are simple: unattached companionship, toe-curling sex and a clean break whenever it ends. Darby’s groundbreaking medical research will launch her into career stardom. Michael’s status as an architectural wunderkind will send him to a far-flung locale. Either one can say the single word that will break it off: Snapdragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soul-deep sex is just the beginning. Michael becomes a fierce ally against her misogynist boss, a light to chase away the shadow of her notorious father, and the antidote to her crushing loneliness. And Darby must fight hard not to fall in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, choosing love over ambition is the one thing she said she’d never do. And their wayward feelings may not change Michael's endgame. So she’ll walk the tightrope of their relationship, even though she fears the fall may kill her. For people like them, love doesn’t always conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SNAPDRAGON&lt;br /&gt;Deeply meaningful, desperately sexual, and inevitably bittersweet, Snapdragon deals with the quandary of choosing love over career, the weight of adulthood and the complexity of modern work-life. It rewrites the book on what a 21st century relationship should look like and keeps the reader wondering how it will end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Smart, grounded and sexy, this contemporary romance sizzled with great (and plenteous) love scenes...and entertained with great dialog and characterizations. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the next. Seriously. So hard to put down!]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21897496-the-lucky-charm" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN B00K4FJVJ2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT’S THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Izzy Dalton’s about to strike out. Her new job as the sideline reporter for the Portland Pioneers major league baseball team is problematic on several levels: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Baseball is her least-favorite sport. Falling behind golf, tennis, and maybe even curling. &lt;br /&gt;2. What Izzy knows about baseball could fill about three minutes of airtime. &lt;br /&gt;3. Her last experience in front of a camera was in college. Six years ago. &lt;br /&gt;4. The Pioneers’ second baseman has a wicked sense of humor and even wickeder blue eyes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND A FULL COUNT. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Bennett couldn’t be more uninterested in a little sideline action. He just wants to show up at the park and win baseball games. Izzy is the one woman he should steer clear of, but she’s also the key to his success–and his heart, too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Izzy has to do is convince her misogynistic boss she’s competent, learn what the heck an RBI is, and stay away from Jack Bennett. Izzy tells herself it’ll be a snap, but 162 games is longer than she ever imagined and Jack more irresistible than she counted on.</description>

  <description>I’m safe in the ivory tower Gabriel Miller made for me. That’s what he says. Enemies lurk outside, waiting to strike. An army of enemies held back by these walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except some animal instinct warns me the danger is much closer. It’s already here. Is Gabriel Miller my protector or my enemy? Is this house a castle or a cage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s nowhere for me to go, no one left for me to trust. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No escape from a past determined to capture its prize.</description>

      <![CDATA[Warren does a great job of taking trite and/or cliche themes and presenting them in fresh, unexpected ways. When I started the ending to the trilogy, I thought it was going to be something of a letdown...and then she turned the whole thing on its head. <br />So glad I found this series.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The power of pleasure...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Miller took everything from me. My family. My innocence. My home. The only thing I have left is the determination to get back what's mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He thinks he's beaten me. He thinks he's won. What he doesn't realize is that every pawn has the chance to become a queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the game has only just begun.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Sinfully sexy and darkly beautiful, The Pawn will play games with your heart and leave you craving more!"&lt;/b&gt; - Laura Kaye, New York Times bestselling author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The price of survival...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Miller swept into my life like a storm. He tore down my father with cold retribution, leaving him penniless in a hospital bed. I quit my private all-girl's college to take care of the only family I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's one way to save our house, one thing I have left of value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My virginity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A forbidden auction...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel appears at every turn. He seems to take pleasure in watching me fall. Other times he's the only kindness in a brutal underworld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except he's playing a deeper game than I know. Every move brings us together, every secret rips us apart. And when the final piece is played, only one of us can be left standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PAWN is a full-length contemporary novel from New York Times bestselling author Skye Warren about revenge and seduction in the game of love. &lt;/b&gt;It's the first book in the brand new ENDGAME series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Pawn is an emotionally charged roller coaster ride that will leave you breathless. From the start, the edgy and intense story will bring you to the edge of your seat and hold you there." - RT Book Reviews</description>

Sometimes this genre can be a little bit...flooded with cliche and cheesy love scenes, but not so with the Pawn. It's...]]>

  <description>Gina Royal is the definition of average—a shy Midwestern housewife with a happy marriage and two adorable children. But when a car accident reveals her husband’s secret life as a serial killer, she must remake herself as Gwen Proctor—the ultimate warrior mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her ex now in prison, Gwen has finally found refuge in a new home on remote Stillhouse Lake. Though still the target of stalkers and Internet trolls who think she had something to do with her husband’s crimes, Gwen dares to think her kids can finally grow up in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just when she’s starting to feel at ease in her new identity, a body turns up in the lake—and threatening letters start arriving from an all-too-familiar address. Gwen Proctor must keep friends close and enemies at bay to avoid being exposed—or watch her kids fall victim to a killer who takes pleasure in tormenting her. One thing is certain: she’s learned how to fight evil. And she’ll never stop.</description>

  <description>Newlyweds Alice and Jake are a picture-perfect couple. Alice, once a singer in a well-known rock band, is now a successful lawyer. Jake is a partner in an up-and-coming psychology practice. Their life together holds endless possibilities. After receiving an enticing wedding gift from one of Alice’s prominent clients, they decide to join an exclusive and mysterious group known only as The Pact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of The Pact seems simple: to keep marriages happy and intact, and most of its rules make sense: Always answer the phone when your spouse calls. Exchange thoughtful gifts monthly. Plan a trip together once per quarter. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mention The Pact to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice and Jake are initially seduced by the glamorous parties, the sense of community, their widening social circle of like-minded couples--and then one of them breaks the rules. The young lovers are about to discover that for adherents to The Pact, membership, like marriage, is for life, and The Pact will go to any lengths to enforce that rule. For Jake and Alice, the marriage of their dreams is about to become their worst nightmare.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ok, this is a rough one. More of a 3.5 to 4 stars.<br />On one hand, I enjoyed the direct approach to the prose. Descriptive without being flowery. I liked the premise a lot, as disturbing as it was. It reminded me a tiny bit of The Girl Before; a legalistic, overly strict approach to a lifestyle...]]>

  <description>From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;The Dovekeepers&lt;/i&gt;, a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller and Notable Book. The courage to face the unthinkable is at the core of this magnificent new novel. How do we manage to confront the truths in our lives and find forgiveness in the most unforgiving of circumstances? How do we love truly and deeply in a world that is as brutal as it is beautiful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ethan Ford fails to show up for work on a brilliant summer morning, none of his neighbors would guess that for more than thirteen years, he has been running from his past. His true nature has been locked away, as hidden as his real identity. But sometimes locks spring open, and the devastating truths of Ethan Ford's history shatter the small-town peace of Monroe, affecting family and friends alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deeply felt and compelling novel makes it clear why Alice Hoffman has been called "one of the best writers we have today" (&lt;b&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer&lt;/b&gt;). Honest, shattering, seductive, and ultimately healing, &lt;b&gt;Blue Diary&lt;/b&gt; is an unforgettable novel by a writer who tells "truths powerful enough to break a reader's heart" (&lt;b&gt;Time&lt;/b&gt;).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;One of Us Is Lying&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what happens when five strangers walk into detention and only four walk out alive. Everyone is a suspect, and everyone has something to hide.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay close attention and you might solve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.&lt;br /&gt; Bronwyn, &lt;b&gt;the brain, &lt;/b&gt; is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. &lt;br /&gt; Addy, &lt;b&gt; the beauty, &lt;/b&gt; is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. &lt;br /&gt; Nate, &lt;b&gt;the criminal&lt;/b&gt;, is already on probation for dealing.&lt;br /&gt; Cooper, &lt;b&gt;the athlete&lt;/b&gt;, is the all-star baseball pitcher.&lt;br /&gt; And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Simon, &lt;b&gt; the outcast&lt;/b&gt;, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention, Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose? &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly. --back cover</description>

  <description>“Hysterically droll, touching, elegant, and wise—a coming-of-age story from someone who possibly came of age before her parents” (Patricia Marx, &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; writer and bestselling author), &lt;i&gt;Trying to Float&lt;/i&gt; is a seventeen-year-old’s darkly funny, big-hearted memoir about growing up in New York City’s legendary Chelsea Hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York’s Chelsea Hotel may no longer be home to its most famous denizens—Andy Warhol, Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, to name a few—but the eccentric spirit of the Chelsea is alive and well. Meet the family Rips: father Michael, a lawyer turned writer with a penchant for fine tailoring; mother Sheila, a former model and renowned artist who matches her welding outfits with couture; and daughter Nicolaia, a precocious high school junior at work on a record of her peculiar seventeen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicolaia is a perpetual outsider who has struggled to find her place in public schools populated by cliquish girls and loudmouthed boys. But at the Chelsea, Nicolaia need not look far to find her tribe. There’s her neighbor Stormé, a tall woman who keeps a pink handgun strapped to her ankle; her babysitter, Paris, who may or may not have a second career as an escort; her friend Artie, former proprietor of New York’s most famous nightclubs. The kids at school might never understand her, but as Nicolaia endeavors to fit in she begins to understand that the Chelsea’s motley crew could hold the key to surviving the perils of a Manhattan childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not since Holden Caulfield has there been such a fabulously compelling teen guide to New York City: Nicolaia Rips’s debut is a disarming, humble, heartfelt, and wise tale of coming-of-age amid the contradictions, complexities, and shifting identities of life in New York City. A bohemian Eloise for our times, &lt;i&gt;Trying to Float&lt;/i&gt; is a triumphant parable for the power of embracing difference in all its forms.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

Besides being timely and relevant in today’s political/racial climate, it’s just damn good storytelling. I laughed and I cried. I LOVED it. I wish this was standard highschool reading...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This bad boy is about to get played…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting her heart broken by a player again, Whitney Porter is done with men. She's focusing on her future career and her first assignment at the college newspaper: Posing as a sports writer for an exposé on the extra perks jocks receive. But Hudson Decker, the bad boy of the hockey team, is about to test her resolve. To keep herself from breaking her no-sex rule with the temptingly tattooed athlete, she decides to use him for a side project: Anatomy of a Player, to help Whitney—and women everywhere—spot a player, learn what makes him tick, and how to avoid falling for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his life spiraling out of control, Hudson Decker's looking for a distraction. When his teammates bet him that he can't land the gorgeous but prickly new reporter, he accepts the challenge, boasting he'll have her in bed by the end of the semester. But Whitney is so much more than Hudson expected, and soon enough, he's in too deep. The last thing he needs is another complication, but staying away isn't an option. One thing's for certain: this girl totally throws him off his game.</description>

But together…anything is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an alliance in place, there will be no more “I wish I’d said…” or “If I could go back and do things differently...” These girls will show Jar Island that revenge is a dish best enjoyed together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The quintessential summer read: a sharp, poignant coming-of-age novel about the magic of camp and the enduring power of female friendship, for readers of Stephanie Danler, Anton DiSclafani, Jennifer Close, and Curtis Sittenfeld.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At what point does childhood end and adulthood begin? Mandy Berman's evocative debut novel captures, through the lens of summer camp, a place that only appears to be untouched by the passing of time, both the thrills and pain of growing up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel Rivkin and Fiona Larkin used to treasure their summers together as campers at Camp Marigold. Now, reunited as counselors after their first year of college, their relationship is more complicated. Rebellious Rachel, a street-smart city kid raised by a single mother, has been losing patience with her best friend's insecurities; Fiona, the middle child of a not-so-perfect suburban family, envies Rachel's popularity with their campers and fellow counselors. For the first time, the two friends start keeping secrets from each other. Through them, as well as from the perspectives of their fellow counselors, campers, and families, we witness the tensions of the turbulent summer build to a tragic event, which forces Rachel and Fiona to confront their pasts and the adults they're becoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A seductive blast of nostalgia, a striking portrait of adolescent longing, and a tribute to both the complicated nature and the enduring power of female friendship, &lt;i&gt;Perennials&lt;/i&gt; will speak to everyone who still remembers that bittersweet moment when innocence is lost forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[More of a 3.5. I enjoyed this book but didn't love it. The writing was good, and I liked the characters, but there was a bit too much going on. It ended abruptly. In terms of being a coming of age "slice of life" type book it succeeded. But it did wander.]]>

While every other college student is out having fun, Lyla is studying. With her cat. Well, she's played it "safe" quite enough, thank you. So she creates a "College Bucket List"―with item #7 being a night of uninhibited, mind-blowing sex...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she needs some help from her man-whore best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hockey player Beck Davenport thought Lyla's transformation would be subtle. Man, was he wrong. With every item she ticks off, Beck finds himself growing seriously hot for his sweet, brainiac best friend. And if he's not careful, he'll end up risking their friendship in order to convince Lyla that he might just be her lucky #7...</description>

  <description>Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unofficially, Kell is a smuggler, servicing people willing to pay for even the smallest glimpses of a world they'll never see. It's a defiant hobby with dangerous consequences, which Kell is now seeing firsthand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an exchange goes awry, Kell escapes to Grey London and runs into Delilah Bard, a cut-purse with lofty aspirations. She first robs him, then saves him from a deadly enemy, and finally forces Kell to spirit her to another world for a proper adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now perilous magic is afoot, and treachery lurks at every turn. To save all of the worlds, they'll first need to stay alive.</description>

  <description>Confronted by a restraining order and the threat of a lawsuit, failed journalist Leah Stevens needs to get out of Boston when she runs into an old friend, Emmy Grey, who has just left a troubled relationship. Emmy proposes they move to rural Pennsylvania, where Leah can get a teaching position and both women can start again. But their new start is threatened when a woman with an eerie resemblance to Leah is assaulted by the lake, and Emmy disappears days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to find Emmy, Leah cooperates with Kyle Donovan, a handsome young police officer on the case. As they investigate her friend’s life for clues, Leah begins to wonder: did she ever really know Emmy at all? With no friends, family, or a digital footprint, the police begin to suspect that there is no Emmy Grey. Soon Leah’s credibility is at stake, and she is forced to revisit her past: the article that ruined her career. To save herself, Leah must uncover the truth about Emmy Grey—and along the way, confront her old demons, find out who she can really trust, and clear her own name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in this rural Pennsylvanian town has something to hide—including Leah herself. How do you uncover the truth when you are busy hiding your own?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started at a dinner party. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors--a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all--a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately focuses on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they've kept for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family--a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Grand prize winner of the 2017 Writer's Digest Awards.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I only wish other writers had Laqueur's kind of talent. This precise and vivid word choice..."&lt;br /&gt;—Judge #65&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 11, 1973: Eleven-year-old Alejandro Penda watches from his apartment window as Santiago, Chile falls to a military coup, destroying his family and his childhood. Arriving alone in America, he’s taken in by the Larks: a prominent family in the town of Guelisten. Though burdened by unresolved grief for his disappeared parents, he becomes fiercely loyal to the Larks, eventually marrying one of their daughters, Valerie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 11, 2001: Javier Landes watches from his apartment window as New York City falls to terrorism. As one of Manhattan’s top-paid male escorts, this professional lover has never lacked for company and is loyal only to himself. But in the wake of 9/11, Jav is named guardian for an orphaned nephew in Guelisten and must open his carefully-guarded heart to pain he's long suppressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex, Valerie and Jav meet first in their twenties, with a sudden attraction each finds strange and compelling. When they meet again in their forties, they discover not only is their bond still strong, but their life experiences are strangely similar. All have been shaped by separate 9/11's, and their unfinished business from the past will change everything they know about love, loyalty and friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Life has rules. You cannot come in the middle of the night and take what we agreed isn't yours."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across three decades and two continents, Suanne Laqueur's fifth novel explores the unpredictability of sexual attraction, how family ties are forged, torn and mended, and how love's downfall can turn to exaltation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Publisher's Note: The &lt;i&gt;Venery&lt;/i&gt; series is often classified as Romance on Goodreads. It is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; Romance. &lt;i&gt;An Exaltation of Larks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Charm of Finches&lt;/i&gt; are Literary Fiction/Contemporary Fiction/LGBT Fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You stop fearing the devil when you’re holding his hand…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing much exciting rolls through Violet White’s sleepy, seaside town… until River West comes along. River rents the guest house behind Violet’s crumbling estate, and as eerie, grim things start to happen, Violet begins to wonder about the boy living in her backyard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is River just a crooked-smiling liar with pretty eyes and a mysterious past? Or could he be something more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet’s grandmother always warned her about the Devil, but she never said he could be a dark-haired boy who takes naps in the sun, who likes coffee, who kisses you in a cemetery... who makes you want to kiss back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet’s already so knee-deep in love, she can’t see straight. And that’s just how River likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blending faded decadence and the thrilling dread of gothic horror, April Genevieve Tucholke weaves a dreamy, twisting contemporary romance, as gorgeously told as it is terrifying—a debut to watch.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>1946. The boys are home from the war. Jules is looking for a way into polite society, but it seems like the moogs that didn’t go overseas have moved so far ahead he’ll never catch up.&lt;br /&gt;His luck seems to change when he goes to the movies with his buddies Bobby and Audie, the other two monkeys. They had marched across Europe together, and now they were picking up dames, drinking too much, and generally letting off steam, which translates into trouble. Jules meets Isbe at the movies. Close dancing in a smoky club leads to love. The same night, Jules hooks up with the Irish mob. Love is thawing his hard heart, the one needed for survival in his new and violent world. Isbe vows to stand by, but Jules likes it on the edge. That’s a good thing, because Isbe’s father is chief of police and it’s a tangled gray web he’s soon caught up in.</description>

  <description>She’s the only one who ever loved him—and the only one he can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude lost everything one spring day when he crashed his car into an apple tree on the side of the road. A man is dead, and there's no way he can ever right that wrong. He’d steer clear of Colebury, Vermont forever if he could. But an ex-con in recovery for his drug addiction can’t find a job just anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Sophie Haines, coming face to face with the man who broke her heart is gut-wrenching. Suddenly, he’s everywhere she turns. It’s hard not to stare at how much he’s changed. The bad boy who used to love her didn’t have big biceps and sun-kissed hair. And he’d never turn up volunteer in the church kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows it’s foolish to yearn for the man who returned all the heartsick letters she wrote him in prison. But the looks he sends her now speak volumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one wants to see Sophie and Jude back together, least of all Sophie's police chief father. But it's a small town. And forbidden love is a law unto itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The new series is set in Vermont. True North is populated by the tough, outdoorsy mountain men that populate the Green Mountain State. They raise cows and they grow apples. They chop a lot of wood, especially when they need to blow off steam. (Beards are optional but encouraged.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the orchard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last person Griffin Shipley expects to find stuck in a ditch on his Vermont country road is his ex-hookup. Five years ago they’d shared a couple of steamy nights together. But that was a lifetime ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At twenty-seven, Griff is now the accidental patriarch of his family farm. Even his enormous shoulders feel the strain of supporting his mother, three siblings and a dotty grandfather. He doesn’t have time for the sorority girl who’s shown up expecting to buy his harvest at half price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vermont was never in Audrey Kidder’s travel plans. Neither was Griff Shipley. But she needs a second chance with the restaurant conglomerate employing her. Okay—a fifth chance. And no self-righteous lumbersexual farmer will stand in her way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re adversaries. They want entirely different things from life. Too bad their sexual chemistry is as hot as Audrey’s top secret enchilada sauce, and then some.</description>

  <description>No one knows who she really is…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hattie Hoffman has spent her whole life playing many parts: the good student, the good daughter, the good girlfriend. But Hattie wants something more, something bigger, and ultimately something that turns out to be exceedingly dangerous. When she’s found brutally stabbed to death, the tragedy rips right through the fabric of her small-town community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soon comes to light that Hattie was engaged in a highly compromising and potentially explosive secret online relationship. The question is: Did anyone else know? And to what lengths might they have gone to end it? Hattie’s boyfriend seems distraught over her death, but had he fallen so deeply in love with her that she had become an obsession? Or did Hattie’s impulsive, daredevil nature simply put her in the wrong place at the wrong time, leading her to a violent death at the hands of a stranger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of twists and turns, Everything You Want Me to Be reconstructs a year in the life of a dangerously mesmerizing young woman, during which a small town’s darkest secrets come to the forefront…and she inches closer and closer to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evocative and razor-sharp, Everything You Want Me to Be challenges you to test the lines between innocence and culpability, identity and deception. Does love lead to self-discovery—or destruction?</description>

      <![CDATA[Such a great story, the plot intricately woven. It had been while since I immersed myself in a juicy murder mystery, and this did not disappoint. I thought I had it figured out, but I didn't! Really enjoyed.<br /><br /><i>I received a copy of this book as an ARC from Netgalley.</i><br />]]>

  <description>To five-year-old-Jack, Room is the world....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in the inventive, funny, and poignant voice of Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience—and a powerful story of a mother and son whose love lets them survive the impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough ... not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some kisses come at a price.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War has begun. Arin is in the thick of it with untrustworthy new allies and the empire as his enemy. Though he has convinced himself that he no longer loves Kestrel, Arin hasn’t forgotten her, or how she became exactly the kind of person he has always despised. She cared more for the empire than she did for the lives of innocent people—and certainly more than she did for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what he thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the frozen north, Kestrel is a prisoner in a brutal work camp. As she searches desperately for a way to escape, she wishes Arin could know what she sacrificed for him. She wishes she could make the empire pay for what they’ve done to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no one gets what they want just by wishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the war intensifies, both Kestrel and Arin discover that the world is changing. The East is pitted against the West, and they are caught in between. With so much to lose, can anybody really win?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of The Girl on the Train, The Silent Wife, and Gone Girl comes an enthralling psychological thriller that spins one woman's seemingly good fortune and another woman's mysterious fate through a kaleidoscope of duplicity, death, and deception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Ron Howard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The request seems odd, even intrusive - and for the two women who answer, the consequences are devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reeling from a traumatic break-in, Emma wants a new place to live. But none of the apartments she sees are affordable or feel safe. Until One Folgate Street. The house is an architectural masterpiece: a minimalist design of pale stone, plate glass, and soaring ceilings. But there are rules. The enigmatic architect who designed the house retains full control: no books, no throw pillows, no photos or clutter or personal effects of any kind. The space is intended to transform its occupant - and it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a personal tragedy, Jane needs a fresh start. When she finds One Folgate Street, she is instantly drawn to the space - and to its aloof but seductive creator. Moving in, Jane soon learns about the untimely death of the home's previous tenant, a woman similar to Jane in age and appearance. As Jane tries to untangle truth from lies, she unwittingly follows the same patterns, makes the same choices, crosses paths with the same people, and experiences the same terror as the girl before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 59 minutes&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There was once a time when darkness shrouded the world, and the darkness had a queen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adelina Amouteru is done suffering. She’s turned her back on those who have betrayed her and achieved the ultimate revenge: victory. Her reign as the White Wolf has been a triumphant one, but with each conquest her cruelty only grows. The darkness within her has begun to spiral out of control, threatening to destroy all she’s gained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a new danger appears, Adelina’s forced to revisit old wounds, putting not only herself at risk, but every Elite. In order to preserve her empire, Adelina and her Roses must join the Daggers on a perilous quest—though this uneasy alliance may prove to be the real danger.</description>

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laia is a slave. Elias is a soldier. Neither is free.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Under the Martial Empire, defiance is met with death. Those who do not vow their blood and bodies to the Emperor risk the execution of their loved ones and the destruction of all they hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; It is in this brutal world, inspired by ancient Rome, that Laia lives with her grandparents and older brother. The family ekes out an existence in the Empire’s impoverished backstreets. They do not challenge the Empire. They’ve seen what happens to those who do.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But when Laia’s brother is arrested for treason, Laia is forced to make a decision. In exchange for help from rebels who promise to rescue her brother, she will risk her life to spy for them from within the Empire’s greatest military academy.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; There, Laia meets Elias, the school’s finest soldier—and secretly, its most unwilling. Elias wants only to be free of the tyranny he’s being trained to enforce. He and Laia will soon realize that their destinies are intertwined—and that their choices will change the fate of the Empire itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love ignites in the City That Never Sleeps, but can it last?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopeless romantic Isla has had a crush on introspective cartoonist Josh since their first year at the School of America in Paris. And after a chance encounter in Manhattan over the summer, romance might be closer than Isla imagined. But as they begin their senior year back in France, Isla and Josh are forced to confront the challenges every young couple must face, including family drama, uncertainty about their college futures, and the very real possibility of being apart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring cameos from fan-favorites Anna, Étienne, Lola, and Cricket, this sweet and sexy story of true love—set against the stunning backdrops of New York City, Paris, and Barcelona—is a swoonworthy conclusion to Stephanie Perkins’s beloved series.</description>

Fixing your goals may not be easy. It may even involve some painful self-examination. But it will be worth whatever effort it costs, because as soon as you can name your goal, you can expect to enjoy many advantages. With contemporary commentary by Judith Williamson, the director of the Napoleon Hill World Learning Center, Napoleon Hill’s Keys to Personal Achievement will provide you with: &lt;br /&gt;Alert imagination&lt;br /&gt;Contagious enthusiasm&lt;br /&gt;Greater initiative&lt;br /&gt;Increased self-reliance&lt;br /&gt;A new world-view&lt;br /&gt;A larger vision&lt;br /&gt;Decreased problems&lt;br /&gt;Magnetic personality&lt;br /&gt;Higher hopes and ambitions&lt;br /&gt; Try it and see. Think of change as growth. You are the one who holds the key to your success. Nothing holds you back except yourself. Get out of your own way, and move forward. You Can Do It If You Believe You Can!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Swallow, Daughter, pull them in, those words that sit upon your lips. Lock them deep inside your soul, hide them ‘til they’ve time to grow. Close your mouth upon the power, curse not, cure not, ‘til the hour. You won’t speak and you won’t tell, you won’t call on heav’n or hell. You will learn and you will thrive. Silence, Daughter. Stay alive.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The day my mother was killed, she told my father I wouldn’t speak again, and she told him if I died, he would die too. Then she predicted the king would trade his soul and lose his son to the sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father has a claim to the throne, and he is waiting in the shadows for all of my mother’s words to come to pass. He wants desperately to be king, and I just want to be free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But freedom will require escape, and I’m a prisoner of my mother’s curse and my father’s greed. I can’t speak or make a sound, and I can’t wield a sword or beguile a king. In a land purged of enchantment, love might be the only magic left, and who could ever love . . . a bird?</description>

  <description>Feyre survived Amarantha's clutches to return to the Spring Court—but at a steep cost. Though she now has the powers of the High Fae, her heart remains human, and it can't forget the terrible deeds she performed to save Tamlin's people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor has Feyre forgotten her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court. As Feyre navigates its dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms—and she might be key to stopping it. But only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future—and the future of a world cleaved in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more than a million copies sold of her beloved Throne of Glass series, Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her seductive and action-packed series to new heights.</description>

      <![CDATA[This...was a rough one for me to review/assign stars to. It's more of a 3.5 for me but the writing is good and I like the world building and a lot of the characters, so I didn't feel right giving a lower 'score'. Definitely disappointed overall though, plot wise. Ah well.]]>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26171650-rooter" rel="nofollow"&gt;B015OWILP4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie doesn’t care what anyone says—she wants Rooter. Labeled by the local news as a “vicious criminal,” he is the very image of one. But the tattoos, muscles, and brooding countenance only manage to intensify her interest in him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Rooter saves her from a pair of dangerous thugs, Sophie begins to see the man behind the visage. Regardless of the past he brings with him, and the dangerous secrets she can tell he is hiding, Sophie believes Rooter is a good man—one who will protect her with his very life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swept into a passionate love affair, Sophie realizes that while Rooter isn’t as evil as everyone believes him to be, being with him isn’t as easy and perfect as she envisioned. When his ex “friend with benefits” refuses to stay out of their lives, she demands he take action. Rooter refuses to cut his ex-lover completely out of his life, and Sophie isn’t sure she can accept the status quo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the same ex makes the accusation of a brutal crime, Sophie and Rooter’s relationship is left reeling. Will they be able to come back from the edge of the precipice they find themselves on… or will their love end before they ever even have the chance to savor it?</description>

  <description>Sky changed her life for a man once, and she has no intention of doing it again - even if he is a six-foot, tattooed rock god who makes a mean bacon sandwich. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sky Davis is fed up of boyfriend Grant taking her for granted, and when she comes home to find him wearing a girl, Sky suspects the relationship is over. She takes an unscheduled vacation and leaves the life (and guy) she hates behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rock star Dylan Morgan is struggling with fame and infamy, sick of his life being controlled by other people. Dylan cuts his hair and walks away from his role as lead singer of Blue Phoenix, leaving behind chaos and speculation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Outside the English seaside town of Broadbeach, their cars and worlds collide. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sky decides Dylan is an arrogant guy with too many tattoos, and Dylan is amused by the smart-mouthed girl with no idea who he is. Dylan and Sky soon discover they’ve travelled to Broadbeach for the same reason - to escape from reality and head back to a place with happy childhood memories. Losing themselves in a world where they know nothing about each other, Sky and Dylan begin a holiday romance that soon heats up their rainy English summer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fantasies can’t last forever, and when reality crashes the party, Sky isn’t sure she wants to be more than his ‘summer Sky’ but Dylan doesn’t want to let her go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Returning to the real world, public scrutiny isn’t their only problem. Blue Phoenix lead guitarist, Jem Jones, has a reason for wanting Sky out of Dylan’s life, and is determined to come between them. Some things won’t stay hidden, even when they’re paid to ‘go away’. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Summer Sky is a contemporary romance with a rock star flavour where occasionally more than the bacon sizzles. It is the first in the Blue Phoenix series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Blue Phoenix books are a series of contemporary romance novels and novellas centred on the fictional rock band Blue Phoenix. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**This book is not a standalone and has a cliffhanger. Book Two: Falling Sky will be released June 10th 2014** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please note: This is written in UK English and includes English idiom and spelling. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37834723-shadow-and-bone" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alternative Cover Edition #1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surrounded by enemies, the once-great nation of Ravka has been torn in two by the Shadow Fold, a swath of near impenetrable darkness crawling with monsters who feast on human flesh. Now its fate may rest on the shoulders of one lonely refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Starkov has never been good at anything. But when her regiment is attacked on the Fold and her best friend is brutally injured, Alina reveals a dormant power that saves his life—a power that could be the key to setting her war-ravaged country free. Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . and the secrets of her heart.</description>

  <description>Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles?&lt;p&gt;Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house "spark joy" (and which don't), this international best seller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home - and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Carlos Fuentes doesn't want any part of the life his older brother, Alex, has laid out for him in Boulder, Colorado. He wants to keep living on the edge, and carve his own path-just like Alex did. Unfortunately, his ties to a Mexican gang aren't easy to break, and he soon finds himself being set up by a drug lord. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alex arranges for Carlos to live with his former professor and his family to keep him from being sent to jail, Carlos feels completely out of place. He's even more thrown by his strong feelings for the professor's daughter, Kiara, who is nothing like the girls he's usually drawn to. But Carlos and Kiara soon discover that in matters of the heart, the rules of attraction overpower the social differences that conspire to keep them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the danger grows for Carlos, he's shocked to discover that it's this seemingly All-American family who can save him. But is he willing to endanger their safety for a chance at the kind of life he's never even dreamed possible?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34857305-paper-princess" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From strip clubs and truck stops to southern coast mansions and prep schools, one girl tries to stay true to herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Royals will ruin you…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella Harper is a survivor—a pragmatic optimist. She’s spent her whole life moving from town to town with her flighty mother, struggling to make ends meet and believing that someday she’ll climb out of the gutter. After her mother’s death, Ella is truly alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Callum Royal appears, plucking Ella out of poverty and tossing her into his posh mansion among his five sons who all hate her. Each Royal boy is more magnetic than the last, but none as captivating as Reed Royal, the boy who is determined to send her back to the slums she came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed doesn’t want her. He says she doesn’t belong with the Royals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He might be right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealth. Excess. Deception. It’s like nothing Ella has ever experienced, and if she’s going to survive her time in the Royal palace, she’ll need to learn to issue her own Royal decrees. </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created 'perfect' life is about to unravel before her eyes. She's forced to be lab partners with Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the other side of town, and he is about to threaten everything she's worked so hard for: her flawless reputation, her relationship with her boyfriend, and the secret that her home life is anything but perfect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex is a bad boy and he knows it. So when he makes a bet with his friends to lure Brittany into his life, he thinks nothing of it. But soon Alex realizes Brittany is a real person with real problems, and suddenly the bet he made in arrogance turns into something much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a passionate story about looking beneath the surface, Simone Elkeles breaks through the stereotypes and barriers that threaten to keep Brittany and Alex apart.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>The Magnificent Conclusion to the Timeless Epic Saga&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through years of war and devastation, Tatiana and Alexander suffered the worst the twentieth century had to offer. Miraculously reunited in America, they now have a beautiful son, Anthony, the gift of a love strong enough to survive the most terrible upheavals. Though they are still young, the ordeals they endured have changed them--and after living apart in a world laid waste, they must now find a way to live together in postwar America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Cold War rising, dark forces at work in their adopted country threaten their lives, their family, and their hard-won peace. To regain the happiness they once knew, to wash away the lingering pain of the past, two lovers grown distant must somehow forge a new life . . .or watch the ghosts of their yesterdays destroy their firstborn son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Summer Garden . . . their odyssey is just beginning.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever longed for a comeback?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know what it feels like to have life disappoint us and not work out as we’d hoped. We all know what it’s like to long for something different, something better, something &lt;em&gt;more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Comeback &lt;/em&gt;celebrates new beginnings. It offers encouragement and perspective, and it’s for you if you feel frustrated or confused, if you’re sorrowing or in pain, if you’ve made mistakes or are grieving, if you’re disappointed or feel as though life doesn’t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that God is in the business of giving fresh starts to people. He gives hope to the hopeless. Direction to the directionless. Help to those who need help. God is always good, all the time, and God’s plans will always prevail, even when our plans don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God already knows what the solutions are. No matter what kind of disappointment or grief or pain or trouble or heartache you encounter, God always offers a new beginning, a change of heart, or a powerful spiritual turnaround. God offers the way forward, and his pathways are always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your current circumstances will not get the final say in your life. God is the God of the comeback, no matter what kind of challenge you’re facing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And your story can become a great comeback story too.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This is not your typical love story. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not so black and white. Lines are crossed. &lt;br /&gt;Walls are smashed. Good becomes bad. &lt;br /&gt;Bad becomes very, very good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shayda Hijazi&lt;/b&gt;—the perfect wife, the perfect mother, the perfect daughter. For thirty-three years, she has played by the rules, swallowing secrets, burying dreams and doing whatever it takes to anchor her family. Shayda Hijazi is about to come face to face with the one thing that can rip it all apart, the one thing her heart has always been denied: Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Troy Heathgate&lt;/b&gt;—untamed, exhilarating, dangerous—a man who does exactly as he pleases. Life bends to his will. Until he comes across the one thing he would give it all up for, but can never have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Born on the same day in opposite corners of the world, their lives collide. And nothing is ever the same again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning three decades, 53 Letters for My Lover is a fiercely sensual, emotional ride to the heart of an epic, forbidden love that defies it all—an intimate exploration of love, loyalty, passion, betrayal, and the human journey for hope, happiness and redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;***Indie Reader "Best Books of 2014"***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in The Girl on the Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, Megan Miranda’s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women—a decade apart—told in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace. Back again to tie up loose ends and care for her ailing father, Nic is soon plunged into a shocking drama that reawakens Corinne’s case and breaks open old wounds long since stitched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decade-old investigation focused on Nic, her brother Daniel, boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne’s boyfriend Jackson. Since then, only Nic has left Cooley Ridge. Daniel and his wife, Laura, are expecting a baby; Jackson works at the town bar; and Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, Nic’s younger neighbor and the group’s alibi the night Corinne disappeared. Then, within days of Nic’s return, Annaleise goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told backwards—Day 15 to Day 1—from the time Annaleise goes missing, Nic works to unravel the truth about her younger neighbor’s disappearance, revealing shocking truths about her friends, her family, and what really happened to Corinne that night ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like nothing you’ve ever read before, All the Missing Girls delivers in all the right ways. With twists and turns that lead down dark alleys and dead ends, you may think you’re walking a familiar path, but then Megan Miranda turns it all upside down and inside out and leaves us wondering just how far we would be willing to go to protect those we love.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was super twisty and intriguing - and quite hard to put down. I had to concentrate on it, though, because like the movie Memento, it was told reverse.<br /><br />After the opening scene, it starts to go backwards, through two weeks, to the beginning.

  <description>Beneath the streets of New York City live the Avicen, an ancient race of people with feathers for hair and magic running through their veins. Age-old enchantments keep them hidden from all but one human: Echo, a runaway pickpocket who survives by selling stolen treasures on the black market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Avicen are the only family Echo has ever known, so when a centuries-old war crests on the borders of her home, she decides it’s time to act. Legend has it that to end the conflict once and for all, Echo must find the firebird, a mythical entity believed to possess power the likes of which the world has never seen. It will be no easy task, though if life as a thief has taught Echo anything, it’s how to hunt down what she wants . . . and how to take it.</description>

  <description>Olivia Kaspen has just discovered that her ex-boyfriend, Caleb Drake, has lost his memory. With an already lousy reputation for taking advantage of situations, Olivia must decide how far she is willing to go to get Caleb back. Wrestling to keep her true identity and their sordid past under wraps, Olivia’s greatest obstacle is Caleb’s wicked, new girlfriend; Leah Smith. It is a race to the finish as these two vipers engage in a vicious tug of war to possess a man who no longer remembers them. But, soon enough Olivia must face the consequences of her lies, and in the process discover that sometimes love falls short of redemption.</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She’s trying to break out of prison—even though if she succeeds, she’ll be the Commonwealth’s most wanted fugitive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit’s grandmother is missing. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother’s whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her &lt;i&gt;prisoner&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: Alternate-cover edition for ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25987622-the-paper-swan" rel="nofollow"&gt;B012HZC11G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; They say it takes 21 days to form a habit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They lie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For 21 days she held on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; But on Day 22, she would have given anything for the sweet slumber of death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Because on Day 22, she realizes that her only way out means certain death for one of the two men she loves.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A haunting tale of passion, loss, and redemption, The Paper Swan is a darkly intense yet heartwarming love story, textured with grit, intrigue, and suspense. Please note: This is NOT a love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A full-length, standalone novel, intended for mature audiences due to violence, sex and language. Subject matter may be disturbing for some readers.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, &lt;i&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/i&gt; will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.</description>

  <description>Darcy Jones doesn't remember anything before the day she was abandoned as a child outside a Chicago firehouse. She has never really belonged anywhere—but she couldn't have guessed that she comes from an alternate world where the Great Chicago Fire didn't happen and deadly creatures called Shades terrorize the human population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memories begin to haunt Darcy when a new boy arrives at her high school, and he makes her feel both desire and desired in a way she hadn't thought possible. But Conn's interest in her is confusing. It doesn't line up with the way he first looked at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if she were his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Conn betrays Darcy, she realizes that she can't rely on anything—not herself, not the laws of nature, and certainly not him. Darcy decides to infiltrate the Shadow Society and uncover the Shades' latest terrorist plot. What she finds out will change her world forever . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this smart, compulsively readable novel, master storyteller Marie Rutkoski has crafted an utterly original world, characters you won't soon forget, and a tale full of intrigue and suspense.</description>

  <description>Book two of the dazzling Winner's Trilogy is a fight to the death as Kestrel risks betrayal of country for love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The engagement of Lady Kestrel to Valoria’s crown prince means one celebration after another. But to Kestrel it means living in a cage of her own making. As the wedding approaches, she aches to tell Arin the truth about her engagement... if she could only trust him. Yet can she even trust herself? For—unknown to Arin—Kestrel is becoming a skilled practitioner of deceit: an anonymous spy passing information to Herran, and close to uncovering a shocking secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Arin enlists dangerous allies in the struggle to keep his country’s freedom, he can’t fight the suspicion that Kestrel knows more than she shows. In the end, it might not be a dagger in the dark that cuts him open, but the truth. And when that happens, Kestrel and Arin learn just how much their crimes will cost them.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning what you want may cost you everything you love...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a general’s daughter in a vast empire that revels in war and enslaves those it conquers, seventeen-year-old Kestrel has two choices: she can join the military or get married. But Kestrel has other intentions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, she is startled to find a kindred spirit in a young slave up for auction. Arin’s eyes seem to defy everything and everyone. Following her instinct, Kestrel buys him—with unexpected consequences. It’s not long before she has to hide her growing love for Arin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he, too, has a secret, and Kestrel quickly learns that the price she paid for a fellow human is much higher than she ever could have imagined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in a richly imagined new world, &lt;i&gt;The Winner’s Curse&lt;/i&gt; by Marie Rutkoski is a story of deadly games where everything is at stake, and the gamble is whether you will keep your head or lose your heart.</description>

  <description>Sharing a summer house with a hot-as-hell roommate should be a dream come true, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not when it’s Justin…the only person I’d ever loved…who now hates me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my grandmother died and left me half of the house on Aquidneck Island, there was a catch: the other half would go to the boy she helped raise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same boy who turned into the teenager whose heart I broke years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same teenager who’s now a man with a hard body and a hardass personality to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn’t seen him in years, and now we’re living together because neither one of us is willing to give up the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part? He didn’t come alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d soon realize there’s a thin line between love and hate. I could see through that smug smile. Beneath it all…the boy is still there. So is our connection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is…now that I can’t have Justin, I’ve never wanted him more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Author's note&lt;/i&gt; – RoomHate is a full-length standalone novel. Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>On her first day of college, Emily meets a walking, talking god. With a gorgeous face, killer blue eyes, and a body to die for, it’s easy to see why Thomas Paige is the envy of every guy at Potomac Ridge University and why every girl within a fifty mile radius wants to get a piece of him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily’s not interested in becoming another notch on his bedpost. She’s convinced herself that her novel use of the word “no” is what’s got him hounding her all over campus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are two sides to every story, and Thomas is determined to make Emily hear his.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Everything repeats.&lt;br /&gt;You. Your best friend. Every person you know.&lt;br /&gt;Many worlds. Many lives--infinite possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the multiverse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Sasha Lawson has only ever known one small, ordinary life. When she was young, she loved her grandfather's stories of parallel worlds inhabited by girls who looked like her but led totally different lives. Sasha never believed such worlds were real--until now, when she finds herself thrust into one against her will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prevent imminent war, Sasha must slip into the life of an alternate version of herself, a princess who has vanished on the eve of her arranged marriage. If Sasha succeeds in fooling everyone, she will be returned home; if she fails, she'll be trapped in another girl's life forever. As time runs out, Sasha finds herself torn between two worlds, two lives, and two young men vying for her love--one who knows her secret, and one who thinks she's someone she's not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book in the Many-Worlds Trilogy, &lt;i&gt;Tandem&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting saga of love and betrayal set in parallel universes in which nothing--and no one--is what it seems.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s hiding something big. He’s hiding someone small.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet Crowley’s life was torn apart the day father was arrested for unspeakable crimes. Now the shock has worn off, but not the horror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a safe bet that Scarlet is the only first year at Harkness College who had to sneak past TV news trucks parked on her front lawn just to leave town. But college will be Scarlet’s fresh start. Clutching a shiny new student ID — with a newly minted name on it — she leaves it all behind. Even if it means lying to the boy she’s falling for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridger McCaulley is a varsity hockey star known for being a player both on and off the ice. But a sobering family crisis takes that all away. Protecting his sister means a precarious living arrangement and constant deception. The only bright spot in his week is the few stolen hours he spends with Scarlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two form a tentative relationship based on the understanding that some things must always be held back. But when grim developments threaten them both, going it alone just won’t work anymore. And if they can’t learn to trust one another now, the families who let them down will take everything they’ve struggled to keep.</description>

Born into a brothel, she is destined for the same fate as her mother: a desperate life trapped in the city’s sex trade. She must act soon to have any chance of escaping this grim future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the sprawling city, fifteen-year-old Grace enjoys a life of privilege. Her father, the CEO of one of India’s largest international banks, has brought his family to Mumbai where they live in unparalleled luxury. But Grace’s seemingly perfect life is shattered when she becomes a victim of a cruel online attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their paths intersect, Noor and Grace will be changed forever. Can two girls living in vastly different worlds find a common path?</description>

  <description>It's hard living on the wrong side of the tracks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen Seely has a criminal record to prove it. Determined not to follow in his father's footsteps, he fights instinct and tries honesty. But hunger becomes painful, and bills are due. Forced to choose between what is right and wrong, the boy from the hood learns abiding by the rules is nearly impossible when corruption is in your blood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling for an outlaw has changed everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poesy Ashby is the definition of ride or die, even when it means turning her back on freedom. The girl from the suburbs gives conformity the middle finger. Bonnie and Clyde have nothing on her love story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the run with consequences in the rearview mirror, Lowen and Poesy accept the truth: they are the bad guys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can they get away with their crimes?</description>

  <description>Sean Sparrow has one more job to pull: break into the bank, steal what he was hired to take, and get out. He plans everything to the very last detail, sure of success... until he sees Tessa. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tessa Martin lives a humdrum life. With a boring job and a crappy roommate, she's sure there must be more to life than this. She's not prepared for the muscle-bound bearded man who walks into her life, offering her everything she's ever wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Sean breaks down all of Tessa's walls, she has no choice but to fall hard and fast. But when the truth comes out, and Sean is fully revealed to her, will their instalove be enough to hold them together? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book hero is over- the-top obsessed, totally head over heels in love, and desperate to make babies with the heroine ASAP. If you want a fun read with SUPER hot steam, Kindle-melting love, and a beard to rub between thighs, then this book is for you.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; The sport she loves is out of reach. The boy she loves has someone else. What now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She expected to start Harkness College as a varsity ice hockey player. But a serious accident means that Corey Callahan will start school in a wheelchair instead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Across the hall, in the other handicapped-accessible dorm room, lives the too-delicious-to-be real Adam Hartley, another would-be hockey star with his leg broken in two places. He's way out of Corey's league.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, he's taken.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, an unlikely alliance blooms between Corey and Hartley in the "gimp ghetto" of McHerrin Hall. Over tequila, perilously balanced dining hall trays, and video games, the two cope with disappointments that nobody else understands.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They're just friends, of course, until one night when things fall apart. Or fall together. All Corey knows is that she's falling. Hard.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But will Hartley set aside his trophy girl to love someone as broken as Corey? If he won't, she will need to find the courage to make a life for herself at Harkness—one which does not revolve around the sport she can no longer play, or the brown-eyed boy who's afraid to love her back.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Jeanette Grey has become a must-read voice in romance. &lt;i&gt;Seven Nights to Surrender&lt;/i&gt; is lyrical, stunningly sexy, and brings swoons for days."&lt;br /&gt; --- Christina Lauren, &lt;i&gt;New York Times bestselling author&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day, he'll show her a side of Paris not found in any guidebook. By night, he'll introduce her to a passion beyond her wildest dreams. In this sensuous story of indulgence and desire, Jeanette Grey delivers one of the most romantic reads of the year and proves why she is fast becoming a must-read star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SEVEN NIGHTS TO SURRENDER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate arrives in Paris hoping to find inspiration. Instead she finds Rylan. In a swirl of stolen kisses and hot, tangled sheets, Kate is quickly swept away by the sexy stranger, longing to surrender to his expert touch. With Rylan, nothing is forbidden-except the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An American ex-pat worth millions, Rylan never flaunts his fortune. Rather, he guards his identity from everyone, especially women. No strings, no commitments, no complications. But the second his lips taste Kate's soft, sweet skin, everything changes. For the first time, Rylan has found someone to share his every want and need. Yet he knows that secrets stand between them. To keep her, he'll need to confess the truth before it's too late . . . even if doing so could mean losing Kate forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you could read my mind, you wouldn't be smiling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Samantha McAllister looks just like the rest of the popular girls in her junior class. But hidden beneath the straightened hair and expertly applied makeup is a secret that her friends would never understand: Sam has Purely-Obsessional OCD and is consumed by a stream of dark thoughts and worries that she can't turn off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second-guessing every move, thought, and word makes daily life a struggle, and it doesn't help that her lifelong friends will turn toxic at the first sign of a wrong outfit, wrong lunch, or wrong crush. Yet Sam knows she'd be &lt;i&gt;truly&lt;/i&gt; crazy to leave the protection of the most popular girls in school. So when Sam meets Caroline, she has to keep her new friend with a refreshing sense of humor and no style a secret, right up there with Sam's weekly visits to her psychiatrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline introduces Sam to Poet's Corner, a hidden room and a tight-knit group of misfits who have been ignored by the school at large. Sam is drawn to them immediately, especially a guitar-playing guy with a talent for verse, and starts to discover a whole new side of herself. Slowly, she begins to feel more "normal" than she ever has as part of the popular crowd . . . until she finds a new reason to question her sanity and all she holds dear.</description>

I learned things about myself - specific, insightful things - and saw situations in the story that have recently played out in my life over the last few years.

  <description>My name is Tate. He doesn't call me that, though. He would never refer to me so informally, if he referred to me at all. No, he'll barely even speak to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he still won't leave me alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were best friends once. Then he turned on me and made it his mission to ruin my life. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got more sadistic as time wore on, and I made myself sick trying to stay out of his way. I even went to France for a year, just to avoid him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm done hiding from him now, and there's no way in hell I'll allow him to ruin my senior year. He might not have changed, but I have. It's time to fight back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not going to let him bully me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This novel contains adult/mature young adult situations. It is only suitable for ages 18+ due to language, violence, and sexual situations.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Cinder is considered a technological mistake by most of society and a burden by her stepmother. Being cyborg does have its benefits, though: Cinder's brain interference has given her an uncanny ability to fix things (robots, hovers, her own malfunctioning parts), making her the best mechanic in New Beijing. This reputation brings Prince Kai himself to her weekly market booth, needing her to repair a broken android before the annual ball. He jokingly calls it "a matter of national security," but Cinder suspects it's more serious than he's letting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although eager to impress the prince, Cinder's intentions are derailed when her younger stepsister, and only human friend, is infected with the fatal plague that's been devastating Earth for a decade. Blaming Cinder for her daughter's illness, Cinder's stepmother volunteers her body for plague research, an "honor" that no one has survived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn't take long for the scientists to discover something unusual about their new guinea pig. Something others would kill for.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One Life to One Dawn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a land ruled by a murderous boy-king, each dawn brings heartache to a new family. Khalid, the eighteen-year-old Caliph of Khorasan, is a monster. Each night he takes a new bride only to have a silk cord wrapped around her throat come morning. When sixteen-year-old Shahrzad's dearest friend falls victim to Khalid, Shahrzad vows vengeance and volunteers to be his next bride. Shahrzad is determined not only to stay alive, but to end the caliph's reign of terror once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night after night, Shahrzad beguiles Khalid, weaving stories that enchant, ensuring her survival, though she knows each dawn could be her last. But something she never expected begins to happen: Khalid is nothing like what she'd imagined him to be. This monster is a boy with a tormented heart. Incredibly, Shahrzad finds herself falling in love. How is this possible? It's an unforgivable betrayal. Still, Shahrzad has come to understand all is not as it seems in this palace of marble and stone. She resolves to uncover whatever secrets lurk and, despite her love, be ready to take Khalid's life as retribution for the many lives he's stolen. Can their love survive this world of stories and secrets?</description>

  <description>The Mortal War is over, and sixteen-year-old Clary Fray is back home in New York, excited about all the possibilities before her. She’s training to become a Shadowhunter and to use her unique power. Her mother is getting married to the love of her life. Downworlders and Shadowhunters are at peace at last. And—most importantly of all—she can finally call Jace her boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But nothing comes without a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is murdering Shadowhunters, provoking tensions between Downworlders and Shadowhunters that could lead to a second, bloody war. Clary’s best friend, Simon, can’t help her—his mother just found out that he’s a vampire, and now he’s homeless. When Jace begins to pull away from her without explaining why, Clary is forced to delve into the heart of a mystery whose solution reveals her worst nightmare: she herself has set in motion a terrible chain of events that could lead to her losing everything she loves. Even Jace.</description>

  <description>The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Mortal Instruments continues—and so do the thrills and danger for Jace, Clary, and Simon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What price is too high to pay, even for love? When Jace and Clary meet again, Clary is horrified to discover that the demon Lilith’s magic has bound her beloved Jace together with her evil brother Sebastian, and that Jace has become a servant of evil. The Clave is out to destroy Sebastian, but there is no way to harm one boy without destroying the other. As Alec, Magnus, Simon, and Isabelle wheedle and bargain with Seelies, demons, and the merciless Iron Sisters to try to save Jace, Clary plays a dangerous game of her own. The price of losing is not just her own life, but Jace’s soul. She’s willing to do anything for Jace, but can she still trust him? Or is he truly lost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love. Blood. Betrayal. Revenge. Darkness threatens to claim the Shadowhunters in the harrowing fifth book of the Mortal Instruments series.</description>

  <description>In the magical underworld of Victorian London, Tessa Gray has at last found safety with the Shadowhunters. But that safety proves fleeting when rogue forces in the Clave plot to see her protector, Charlotte, replaced as head of the Institute. If Charlotte loses her position, Tessa will be out on the street—and easy prey for the mysterious Magister, who wants to use Tessa’s powers for his own dark ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of the handsome, self-destructive Will and the fiercely devoted Jem, Tessa discovers that the Magister’s war on the Shadowhunters is deeply personal. He blames them for a long-ago tragedy that shattered his life. To unravel the secrets of the past, the trio journeys from mist-shrouded Yorkshire to a manor house that holds untold horrors, from the slums of London to an enchanted ballroom where Tessa discovers that the truth of her parentage is more sinister than she had imagined. When they encounter a clockwork demon bearing a warning for Will, they realize that the Magister himself knows their every move—and that one of their own has betrayed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tessa finds her heart drawn more and more to Jem, but her longing for Will, despite his dark moods, continues to unsettle her. But something is changing in Will—the wall he has built around himself is crumbling. Could finding the Magister free Will from his secrets and give Tessa the answers about who she is and what she was born to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their dangerous search for the Magister and the truth leads the friends into peril, Tessa learns that when love and lies are mixed, they can corrupt even the purest heart.</description>

  <description>In the classic Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, the most important writer of the 20th century, explores the common ground upon which all of those of Christian faith stand together. Bringing together Lewis’ legendary broadcast talks during World War Two from his three previous books The Case for Christianity, Christian Behavior, and Beyond Personality, Mere Christianity provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear this powerful apologetic for the Christian faith.</description>

  <description>Nikolai Wroth, once a ruthless human warlord in the 1700s and now a general in the rebel vampire army, needs to find his bride, the one woman who can render him truly alive. As a turned human, he doesn't enjoy a heartbeat or breathing and is consequently weaker than fully blooded vampires. He wants his bride for the power she will bring him and can hardly believe it when his heart beats for Myst the Coveted, a mad, fey, mythological creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She eludes him for five years, but he has finally chased her to ground and stolen the jewel which commands her, giving him absolute power over her. While he possesses it, he can make her do anything, and he plans to in order for her to experience firsthand the agonizing, unending lust she'd purposely subjected him to for half a decade. Yet when Wroth realizes he wants more from her and frees her, will she come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: First published in the 2006 anthology,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6625.Playing_Easy_to_Get" rel="nofollow"&gt;Playing Easy to Get&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>Beloved #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover returns with an unforgettable love story between a writer and his unexpected muse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallon meets Ben, an aspiring novelist, the day before her scheduled cross-country move. Their untimely attraction leads them to spend Fallon’s last day in L.A. together, and her eventful life becomes the creative inspiration Ben has always sought for his novel. Over time and amidst the various relationships and tribulations of their own separate lives, they continue to meet on the same date every year. Until one day Fallon becomes unsure if Ben has been telling her the truth or fabricating a perfect reality for the sake of the ultimate plot twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Ben’s relationship with Fallon—and simultaneously his novel—be considered a love story if it ends in heartbreak?</description>

  <description>“Trust me, I’ve wanted to punch you in the face a time or five.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the man you worshipped as a kid becomes your coach, it’s supposed to be the greatest thing in the world. Keywords: supposed to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn't take a week for 27-year-old Sal Casillas to wonder what she'd seen in the international soccer icon - why she'd ever had his posters on her wall or ever envisioned marrying him and having super-playing soccer babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sal had long ago gotten over the worst non-break-up in the history of imaginary relationships with a man who hadn't known she'd existed. So she isn't prepared for this version of Reiner Kulti who shows up to her team's season: a quiet, reclusive shadow of the explosive, passionate man he'd once been.</description>
