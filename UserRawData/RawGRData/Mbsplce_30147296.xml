  <description>Within these pages lie kingdoms with castles and princes who fall in love with fair maidens, but make no mistake−this is no fairytale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His father’s kingdom is on the brink of upheaval and at the center of it all is an ordinary girl who could be the key to its undoing. When faced with the ultimate choice, will he choose the girl he’s falling in love with or the kingdom he has sworn to protect? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ordinary girl with an extraordinary past. All she wants is to be free. What she doesn’t realize is that freedom comes with a price she can’t afford to pay. She’s forced to accept the proposal of a prince she despises, even though her heart belongs to someone else . . . his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Rema lives in a brutal kingdom where travel between regions is forbidden, people are starving, and looking at someone the wrong way can mean death. Nineteen-year-old Darmik is the king’s son and Commander of the King’s Army. He spends his days roving the island, doing his father’s bidding and trying to maintain control over the people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a chance encounter throws Rema and Darmik together, they share an instantaneous connection, but any sort of relationship between them is strictly forbidden. Darmik’s brother, the Crown Prince, notices Darmik’s interest in Rema and, in a calculated, political move, blackmails her. Faced with an impossible choice, Rema is forced to sacrifice her heart in order to save her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rema is taken to the palace with the Crown Prince, Darmik confronts the growing rumor that a legitimate blood heir to the throne exists and is trying to overthrow Darmik’s family. In Darmik’s quest to hunt down and kill the threat, he discovers that nothing is as it seems. Locked in the king’s castle, Rema finds herself a key player in a massive power struggle. When Darmik shows up, she’s not sure if she can trust him. The line between friends, enemies, and loyalty becomes blurred. As truths are unlocked, Rema understands that she just might be the key to finding the rightful heir and restoring peace to the kingdom… if she can manage to stay alive long enough.</description>

  <description>Abigail Sutton’s beloved husband walks out one night, doesn’t return, and two years later is found dead, a victim of a long ago crime. It’s made her sympathetic to the missing and their families.&lt;br /&gt;Starting her new life, Abigail moves to small town and buys a fixer-upper house left empty when old Edna Summers died. Once it was also home to Edna’s younger sister, Emily, and her two children, Jenny and Christopher, who, people believe, drove away one night, thirty years ago, and just never came back.&lt;br /&gt;But in renovating the house Abigail finds scraps of paper hidden behind baseboards and tucked beneath the porch that hint the three could have been victims of foul play.&lt;br /&gt;Then she finds their graves hidden in the woods behind the house and with the help of eccentric townspeople and ex-homicide detective, Frank Lester, she discovers the three were murdered. Then she and Frank try to uncover who killed them and why…but in the process awaken the ire of the murderer. ***</description>

  <description>Kari Hagen didn’t want to come to Walker Creek, Texas, but she made a promise. She’s supposed to deliver a letter to her late mother’s first love, so now she just has to find him. Should she accept an offer of assistance from that tall cowboy who’s as handsome as any man she’s ever seen? The sooner Mr. Caleb Walker gets her mother’s letter, the sooner Kari can get busy earning money as a seamstress for her train fare back to Minnesota! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seth Davis isn't expecting any surprises when he meets the train. He plans to pick up his uncle’s new racehorse and head back to Walker Creek Ranch. Yet what about that pretty little miss standing alone on the platform…all honey-gold curls, blue calico, and no taller than his chin? Is she lost? He’s never seen her before, though she looks oddly familiar, something telling Seth that his day just got a whole lot more interesting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Walker Creek Brides, a sweet Western historical romance series by award-winning author Miriam Minger that reminds us angels are near and love is where you least expect to find it.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Book Background:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is set in thirteenth-century West Africa. It dramatises the conflicts, politics and triumphs of a number of West African Kingdoms, such as the Benin Kingdom, Ghanaian empire, Malian Kingdom and the Fulani people. The story stretches across countries, seas and continents, showing the great variation in language, customs and traditions between tribes but also the unity displayed by different characters to overcome adversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book Blurb:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A generation has passed, and the devastation of war is slowly fading away but the scars remain, lingering in the hearts and minds of many. In an era of peace, King Ewuare remains conflicted, torn between opening closed wounds or allowing his reign of peace and prosperity to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the King tries to resolve his moral conflict, the gods have a different agenda. Sinister and supernatural forces amass on the summit of the Agbon mountains, deep into the clouds, where no man dare stray, where the wind bites cold and the forest stays forever frozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within, lies a tale of Kings and Queens, warriors and commoners, slaves and sorcerers, and the consequences of their hurried actions. African tribes head to battle with swords forged of bronze and steel, wild beasts bending to the will of man and fighting side by side.</description>

  <description>Mary Todd Lincoln is probably the most maligned of famous women in our nation's history. The truth about the President's wife has for years been hidden under a mountain of myth built up largely by Lincoln's biographer and law partner, William H. Herndon. Now for the first time the true woman beneath that myth is presented in a warmly sympathetic biography based on new research. When the veil of legend surrounding her is torn aside, and entirely new picture of a woman and a marriage emerges.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Between 1941 and 1945, thousands of German Jews, in fear for their lives, made the choice to flee their impending deportations and live submerged in the shadows of the Nazi capital. Drawing on a wealth of archival evidence and interviews with survivors, this book reconstructs the daily lives of Jews who stayed in Berlin during the war years. Contrary to the received wisdom that “hidden” Jews stayed in attics and cellars and had minimal contact with the outside world, the author reveals a cohort of remarkable individuals who were constantly on the move and actively fought to ensure their own survival.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Hidden Duchess is published as an e-Book by Passion in Print Press, and in print by the author. Set in 1789 in the years leading up to the French Revolution, it is full of intrigue, romance and adventure.&lt;br /&gt;────&lt;br /&gt;Celeste, Duchesse de Saint Tours, is forced into hiding when she is falsely accused of the murder of her husband. She flees to the south of France, where her distant cousin, Marcel Daunou reluctantly agrees to hide her in plain sight on his farm. However, she must learn to live as a peasant farmer to complete the deception, a feat which appears next to impossible to the haughty Duchess. Especially knowing that the unsettling Marcel is watching over her at every turn. She can’t wait to return to her beloved Paris, and the exquisite, hedonistic lifestyle she has left behind.&lt;br /&gt;Marcel knows that he places his loved ones in danger when he agrees to hide Celeste. However, his committee has agreed to hide her in exchange for a large sum of money that will assist their gravely poor community, and since she is his family, he takes responsibility for her. But Republican fervor is running high and Marcel knows if the Duchess is found out, she will be marched back to Paris, and to the guillotine. And his family will face harsh retribution from the agitating revolutionaries for hiding a member of the despised nobility.&lt;br /&gt;Forced to work together, Celeste and Marcel discover a passion that they cannot resist. And Celeste discovers a feeling of belonging and acceptance from the people of the village that she has never felt before. She begins to dream about a future with Marcel.&lt;br /&gt;When her well-meaning lawyer appears in the village and gives her identity away, it isn’t only Marcel that Celeste stands to lose – it’s her life as well.&lt;br /&gt;How can a noble Duchess and a peasant farmer find their happily ever after?</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed reading this book so much. A good travel read but actually I'd read it anywhere. It's about a Duchess that is in hiding but eventually is able to come out. I don't want to give any of it away. You must read it for yourself. I know you'll enjoy it too. I gave it 5 stars. I'm waiting for...]]>

  <description>After Monsterland has imploded, the entire world is thrown into chaos. World leadership is gone, economies have collapsed, and communications are non-existent. Wyatt must go beyond the boundaries of his small town to reestablish contact with the outside world, and alert the government about a traitor-in-chief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During his journey he discovers a new threat released from the bowels of the defunct theme park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an army of relentless mummies, a life-sucking ooze called The Glob, and a hybrid reanimated Behemoth rise from the depths of Monsterland, who will survive?</description>

  <description>Wes Rockville, a disgraced law-enforcement agent, gets one last chance to prove himself and save his career when he's reassigned to a 232-year-old secret government organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Witches Protection Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His first assignment: uncover a billion-dollar cosmetics company's diabolical plan to use witchcraft for global domination, while protecting its heiress Morgan Pendragon from her aunt's evil deeds. Reluctantly paired with veteran witch protector, Alastair Verne, Wes must learn to believe in witches...and believe in himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with adventure and uspense, Michael Okon creates a rousing, tongue-in-cheek alternate reality where witches cast spells and wreak havoc in modern-day New York City.</description>

  <description>I’ve always known I was a monster, and I don’t mean some teenage vampire shit either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother abandoned me when I was ten years old because I have a freakish mutant disease that makes me incapable of feeling pain. I bounced from one foster family to another because too many people like to test my medical condition in a game of “Try To Make Ollie Scream.” At sixteen, I killed a man for taking that game too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, I’m still on the run in Kodiak, Alaska. Here, I’m the most dangerous person around, until I come face to face with a creature that should only exist in folklore. The monster is an aswang, and I, with my medical anomaly, am uniquely qualified to hunt the beast that haunts the night. At least, that’s what the two scarred, mostly crazy ‘swang hunters tell me when they kidnap me and take me to Fear University, a school where young students learn to hunt and kill aswangs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I arrive at the university a prisoner, but I stay because I finally find my freedom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once in my life, I belong. I’m needed. I make a home for myself inside the university masquerading as an old Alaskan prison. Something close to happiness warms my icy heart when I’m with my scarred, still mostly crazy tutor, Luke Aultstriver. For a murdering runaway like me, Fear University is a haven where I can put my skills to good use hunting monsters in the night.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when certain truths come to light and even more lies are exposed, I fear that I, Ollie Andrews, am the worst kind of monster of all. And, maybe, they should be hunting me.</description>

  <description>The Florida Prairie, 1860, cattle country. War looms, but to the settlers living along a jungled, tropical creek, it all seems very far away. For Becky Hackensaw, there are much more pressing matters, such as providing an education for her six children, but where to find someone willing to brave an uninhabited wilderness overrun with wild animals, alligators, poisonous snakes, and bloodthirsty mosquitoes?</description>

It is about a family and their way of life. I won't go into detail because you have to read it. I gave it 5 stars but wish I could give it more....]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The best gifts last a lifetime . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veterinarian J.T. "Rush" Rushford isn't looking forward to Christmas. It'll be his first without his beloved four-year-old daughter, Claire. A year ago, Rush's wife divorced him for another man--then broke his heart further by revealing that Claire was her lover's child. The final blow was Rush losing all parental rights. Now he's in Branding Iron, Texas, with his mobile vet practice, just hoping to get through the season--until something like a Christmas miracle happens . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out Claire's parents are going on an extended cruise, leaving Rush to take her for the holidays. It's bittersweet, knowing that he and Claire will have to part again, maybe forever. . . . Until a smart, not to mention beautiful, lady judge with a pregnant cat and an aging mutt takes a liking to the vet and his little girl and gets involved. With her on their side, and love in their hearts, this Christmas just might be the most joyous of all . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The story is full of Christmas spirit . . . Those looking for a little pre-holiday pick-me-up will find plenty to enjoy here."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews &lt;/i&gt;on&lt;i&gt; Just a Little Christmas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Kathleen is Boston born and bred, with a degree from the Boston Conservatory of Music. On her 18th birthday, her parents announce that she has been betrothed to a longtime friend--one she has always known as Uncle Elias. She ponders that fate, but not until she finds out that the betrothal was actually a deal struck in order to save her father's ailing business! As a bold response, she answers a Mail-Order Bride ad for one Dan Gallagher, a ranch owner in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, without knowing what future awaits her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his late father left it behind, Dan Gallagher struggles to keep the ranch alive, which seems like a difficult feat. His hardships with his brother, and his loneliness lead him to send for a mail order bride, with the expectation to fill his otherwise empty life. He hasn't even seen her, nor has she, which makes it even more difficult for them to meet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her adventure begins when she leaves Boston, but as it unfolds, she starts to wonder who was the mysterious gentleman she met on the train station. Was it the real Dan Gallagher? Despite the way they meet and all the duplicity around her, who will save whom and, most importantly, will she find love on her own terms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Love on Her Own Terms" is a historical western romance novel of approximately 80,000 words. No cheating, no cliffhangers, and a guaranteed happily ever after.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In this award-winning historical saga, passionate young lovers in a Jewish ghetto rise to become the foremost financial dynasty in the world.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the turn of the eighteenth century in Frankfurt, Germany, and young Gutle and Meir Amschel Rothschild struggle to establish themselves in the cramped and restricted &lt;i&gt;Judengasse&lt;/i&gt;. But when Meir’s talents as a novice banker catch the attention of a German prince, Meir is suddenly afforded entrée into the European world of finance and nobility, and the Rothschilds’ lives are changed forever. As proud as Gutle is of her husband’s success, she is also cautious—very much aware of the fact that her husband’s rise is tied to his patrons’ willingness to “see past” his Jewishness. As their family grows, and a dream of fortune comes true, so does their belief that money will ultimately bring the power needed to establish Jewish civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told through Gutle’s intimate journals, revealed across decades—from the French Revolution through personal tragedies and triumphs—&lt;i&gt;The First Mrs. Rothschild&lt;/i&gt; paints a rich and intimate tapestry of family drama, world-changing history, and one woman’s steadfast strength.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A recent abduction becomes an unexpected link to a decades-long spree of unspeakable crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight-year-old Brooklyn Mercer has gone missing. And as accustomed as FBI agents Eliza Sterling and Brandon Eddison are to such harrowing cases, this one has struck a nerve. It marks the anniversary of the disappearance of Eddison’s own little sister. Disturbing, too, is the girl’s resemblance to Eliza—so uncanny they could be mother and daughter.&lt;p&gt;With Eddison’s unsettled past rising again with rage and pain, Eliza is determined to solve this case at any cost. But the closer she looks, the more reluctant she is to divulge to her increasingly shaken partner what she finds. Brooklyn isn’t the only girl of her exact description to go missing. She’s just the latest in a frightening pattern going back decades in cities throughout the entire country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a race against time, Eliza’s determined to bring Brooklyn home and somehow find the link to the cold case that has haunted Eddison—and the entire Crimes Against Children team—since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Three women. Two families torn apart by secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crushed by guilt over the car accident that killed her father and sister, and torn apart by her mother’s resentment, Darcy Goodridge fled her family estate nine years ago and hasn’t looked back. Now an unexpected phone call threatens to upend what little serenity she’s found. Her nephew, Emerson, who was just a baby when his mother died, has gone missing. Darcy must return home and face her past in order to save him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once back in Ohio, Darcy realizes there’s more to Emerson’s disappearance—and to her mother, Rosalind’s, sudden retirement—than meets the eye. As she works to make inroads with Rosalind, Darcy begins to unravel a decades-old secret that devastated her family and forced a wedge between her and Michael Varano, the man she left heartbroken when she vanished after the funeral. After carrying the scars of that fateful night for almost a decade, Darcy is determined to find closure, healing, and maybe even love where she lost them all in the first place—right back home where she belongs.</description>

  <description>When Archie goes in search of his missing son, Arden, in the Spanish Canary Islands, he stumbles upon a higher mission: to save his ailing fourteen-year-old granddaughter, Ella. Using a portal-jumping device called the Tillastrion, Archie and a strange creature, a Bangol named Zeno, are transported—along with a cruise ship full of people, including Ella and her mother, Tessa—to a magnificent yet terrifying island in another realm, a place called Jarr-Wya, where Archie hopes to locate Ella’s cure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Jarr-Wya, the Bangols battle the Olearons—creatures made of fire—and the evil Millia sands for control of Jarr-Wya. When Ella is captured by the Bangols, her wit and resourcefulness emerge as she fights against all odds, and against all manner of creatures, to survive. Meanwhile, Tessa, must confront her long-buried secrets, broken marriage, and a confusing new love triangle, all while navigating the mysterious island in search of her daughter. And unbeknownst to everyone, there is an even greater foe to contend with: a wicked star anchored in the sea beneath them that is poisoning the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An epic adventure of three unlikely heroes, &lt;em&gt;Above the Star&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that no matter how young, or how old, our bravery transforms not only our lives but the world around us.</description>

  <description>Marjorie Steel is still healing from the events of the past year, and she’s happy to put her plans to study culinary arts on hold to help her best friend deal with a difficult pregnancy and two recently adopted troubled boys. The fact that Bryce Simpson spends a lot of time at the Steel Ranch is a benefit, and she’s ready to see if her attraction to him might be something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryce wants to do a hard day’s work on the ranch. Once his muscles give out and he collapses from exhaustion, maybe he’ll stop torturing himself over his late father’s horrific double life. The Steels have a different idea. They ask Bryce to take an executive position complete with a profit share. As he has a young son and widowed mother to support, it’s an offer he can’t refuse. The only catch is Marjorie. She’s beautiful, smart, feisty, and her kisses set him on fire. But he’s an empty shell with nothing to offer her, and she deserves the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sins of his father continue to haunt him, Bryce learns the horrors of the past may not yet be buried.</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Summer Wives&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Certain Age&lt;/em&gt; creates a dazzling epic of World War II-era Nassau—a hotbed of spies, traitors, and the most infamous couple of the age, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bahamas, 1941. Newly-widowed Leonora “Lulu” Randolph arrives in Nassau to investigate the Governor and his wife for a New York society magazine. After all, American readers have an insatiable appetite for news of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, that glamorous couple whose love affair nearly brought the British monarchy to its knees five years earlier. What more intriguing backdrop for their romance than a wartime Caribbean paradise, a colonial playground for kingpins of ill-gotten empires?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so Lulu imagines. But as she infiltrates the Duke and Duchess’s social circle, and the powerful cabal that controls the islands’ political and financial affairs, she uncovers evidence that beneath the glister of Wallis and Edward’s marriage lies an ugly—and even treasonous—reality. In fact, Windsor-era Nassau seethes with spies, financial swindles, and racial tension, and in the middle of it all stands Benedict Thorpe: a scientist of tremendous charm and murky national loyalties. Inevitably, the willful and wounded Lulu falls in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Nassau’s wealthiest man is murdered in one of the most notorious cases of the century, and the resulting coverup reeks of royal privilege. Benedict Thorpe disappears without a trace, and Lulu embarks on a journey to London and beyond to unpick Thorpe’s complicated family history: a fateful love affair, a wartime tragedy, and a mother from whom all joy is stolen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories of two unforgettable women thread together in this extraordinary epic of espionage, sacrifice, human love, and human courage, set against a shocking true crime . . . and the rise and fall of a legendary royal couple.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Two sisters struggle against generations of hidden traumas in a richly-woven story that celebrates the wondrous nature of family. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;St. Paul, MN, 1946: As little girls, the Malone sisters relied on each other for companionship and affection as their mother remained distant, beating back the demons of her own mysterious childhood. Now, the war’s finally over, womanhood approaches and both girls look forward to promising--though different--futures. But when tragedy rocks their family, silence and shame bloom and one sister leaves, possibly forever. Heart-broken and physically scarred, the other secretly vows to hold the invisible thread that runs deeply between them. In the course of her journey she encounters a child with a hidden past, and discovers the true meaning of family. But is it enough to bring her sister home?</description>

  <description>This is the third book of the Protectors of the Wood Series, a six-volume saga about a group of misfit teenagers who save the world from climate change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Book 3, Abby becomes the church gardener and moves into the old, run-down churchyard cottage. She soon discovers that she is watched night and day by professional investigators hired by the colossal corporation trying to take over the town, and force Abby to reveal the secrets of the forest and the source of dreamstone. Reverend Tuck, Abby, and their allies form a community council to run churchyard events and gather support for their efforts to engage the church in the fight against climate change. The community in Rivergate, an island in the wetland preserve, and Abby's childhood home, joins their mission. The struggle with Milton Morphy and his corporate empire reaches a dangerous climax as Abby flees for her life into the forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In Book #1, Phoebe arrives back in Middletown after a year away at college. She discovers shocking changes taking place in her familiar childhood home. An immense corporation already owns many local businesses, and is buying up property at an alarming rate. When the local minister preaches a sermon on climate change, an angry crowd walks out in protest. And a valuable gem called dreamstone is attracting extraordinary interest and many unanswered questions. &lt;br /&gt; Phoebe meets Abby, a mysterious young woman living in an abandoned house on the outside of town. She soon realizes that Abby possesses many secrets, and is hunted ruthlessly by her &lt;br /&gt; enemies. Phoebe also meets Jeremy, the new boy in town working at his cousin's gas station. They explore the forest together and find the secrets they have been seeking: large and very rare dreamstone crystals can inspire visions that help guide people through the crises and turning points of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In Book #2, Phoebe, her ex-boyfriend George, Abby, and Jeremy form a group to protect the world around them from exploitation and destruction. Jeremy, George and Eddie create a band to reach out to their community, and Phoebe begins to work at the toy store, and creates a following as a soccer coach. &lt;br /&gt; Abby's mysterious mission leads to a dangerous climax as the small group confronts a mob with torches at the abandoned house. After a wild thunderstorm and help from their allies, Abby finds a home in the small cottage in the churchyard. Phoebe discovers that Abby's goal all along has been to create a base for her mission in the heart of Middletown.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;From neuroscientist and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Still Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a powerful exploration of regret, forgiveness, freedom, and what it means to be alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An accomplished concert pianist, Richard received standing ovations from audiences all over the world in awe of his rare combination of emotional resonance and flawless technique. Every finger of his hands was a finely calibrated instrument, dancing across the keys and striking each note with exacting precision. That was eight months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard now has ALS, and his entire right arm is paralyzed. His fingers are impotent, still, devoid of possibility. The loss of his hand feels like a death, a loss of true love, a divorce—his divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He knows his left arm will go next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years ago, Karina removed their framed wedding picture from the living room wall and hung a mirror there instead. But she still hasn’t moved on. Karina is paralyzed by excuses and fear, stuck in an unfulfilling life as a piano teacher, afraid to pursue the path she abandoned as a young woman, blaming Richard and their failed marriage for all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Richard becomes increasingly paralyzed and is no longer able to live on his own, Karina becomes his reluctant caretaker. As Richard’s muscles, voice, and breath fade, both he and Karina try to reconcile their past before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Every Note Played &lt;/i&gt;is a masterful exploration of redemption and what it means to find peace inside of forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Absolute power corrupts, and the scientist at the center of Darrell Lee’s new science-fiction thriller The Apotheosis , is the perfect storm of ill-intentioned genius, wealth, and cruel obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channeling the propulsive action and scientific-authenticity of a Michael Crichton novel, Darrell Lee delivers an all to plausible bio-engineering disaster in the waiting. John Numen is the man with too much—money, status, and brilliance—for his own good. With a tale spanning nearly a century, Numen’s technological advancements remake the world in his own image to devastating results.</description>

  <description>Our young god has a new assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The planet Flo is supposed to produce a florescent dust for the gods, but they have closed their mining operation. Bernie's job is to get the mines reopened and working again. But there's a problem. Every time he tries to re-negotiate a trading arrangement with the owner of the mines, it fails. But that's just the beginning of the problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time Bernie returns to the planet, he finds things have changed. How can he get the mining operation restarted if the mine owner has difficulty remembering Bernie? And, to make it more difficult, other things are changing, too. The technology on the planet is advancing at an alarming rate. It's as if someone is changing the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernie's boss thinks the best solution is to eliminate all the people and repopulate the planet with a species less inclined to develop new technology. Bernie, of course, doesn't want that to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how can he get the mines reopened if things keep changing? Bernie must begin a search throughout time for the malevolent force determined to destroy Flo's timeline. If he can't find and stop it, everyone on Flo will be destroyed.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;For God School's latest graduate, the adventure continues...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernie fixes broken universes for a living. Unlike other gods who tend to take a hellfire-and-brimstone approach to problem-solving, Bernie prefers a more gentle approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a hard-to-please boss breathing down his neck and a personal life badly in need of relationship advice, Bernie's chances of success are dwindling fast. Yet he's determined to do everything in his power to save the civilization on this damaged world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the murderous wizard who is causing all the problems is powerful enough to hurt a god...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************&lt;br /&gt;All books in The Universe Builders are standalone and can be read in any order. The first book, &lt;i&gt;Bernie and the Putty&lt;/i&gt;, won 16 national and international awards for excellence.</description>

  <description>For readers of &lt;i&gt;Orphan Train &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale &lt;/i&gt;comes a "thought-provoking [and] complex tale about two families, two generations apart . . . based on a notorious true-life scandal."*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memphis, 1939.&lt;/b&gt; Twelve-year-old Rill Foss and her four younger siblings live a magical life aboard their family's Mississippi River shantyboat. But when their father must rush their mother to the hospital one stormy night, Rill is left in charge--until strangers arrive in force. Wrenched from all that is familiar and thrown into a Tennessee Children's Home Society orphanage, the Foss children are assured that they will soon be returned to their parents--but they quickly realize the dark truth. At the mercy of the facility's cruel director, Rill fights to keep her sisters and brother together in a world of danger and uncertainty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Aiken, South Carolina, present day.&lt;/b&gt; Born into wealth and privilege, Avery Stafford seems to have it all: a successful career as a federal prosecutor, a handsome fianc�, and a lavish wedding on the horizon. But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family's long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on one of America's most notorious real-life scandals--in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country--Lisa Wingate's riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong.</description>

  <description>Emotionally complex and gripping, Author RKC Puthran brings you an unforgettable story of the transcendental power of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of college with an MBA and a job at a prestigious bank in the US, Rohan Rai seemingly has more than any twenty-five-year old Indian could have. But he has a different dream for his life, and a clear-cut plan to get there. A cocky workaholic determined to climb the corporate ladder as fast as possible in order to achieve his goals, he doesn’t care who he alienates on his meteoric rise to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he meets Shona. She’s everything Rohan’s not—an easy-going Irish girl who lives in the moment, loves Whitney Houston, and enjoys life to the fullest. Although there’s no room for any love in Rohan’s three-year plan, he finds himself increasingly drawn to her. As their relationship blossoms, Rohan slowly finds himself viewing life differently, until a past grudge escalates and his inner demons resurface. Torn between his ambition, his responsibilities, and love, he must now re-examine everything he believes in…or risk losing it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovecarnation – The Promise is the heart-wrenching first book of the Lovecarnation trilogy, a thought-provoking series about fate, destiny, and the timelessness of true love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of a legendary designer who pioneered high-end streetwear, from a storefront in Harlem to the red carpet in Hollywood, dressing everyone from Salt-N-Pepa and Eric B. &amp;amp; Rakim to Beyoncé and Jay-Z along the way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his now-legendary store on 125th Street in Harlem, Dapper Dan pioneered high-end streetwear in the early 1980s, remixing classic luxury-brand logos into his own flamboyant designs. But before reinventing fashion, he was a hungry boy with holes in his shoes, a teen who daringly gambled drug dealers out of their money, a young man in a prison cell who found nourishment in books, and, finally, a designer who broke barriers to outfit a whos-who of music, sport, and crime world celebrities in looks that went on to define an era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns playful, poignant, and inspiring, and featuring two incredible eight-page color photo inserts, including the only existing, never-before-seen images of the notorious Mike Tyson-Mitch Green street fight, Dapper Dan's memoir is a high-stakes coming-of-age story, spanning more than seventy years and set against the backdrop of an ever-evolving America.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the Academy Award-winning screenwriter and political activist, a candid, vivid, powerfully resonant memoir about growing up as a gay Mormon in Texas that is, as well, a moving tribute to the mother who taught him about surviving against all odds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dustin Lance Black wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for &lt;i&gt;Milk&lt;/i&gt; and helped overturn California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8, but as an LGBTQ+ activist he has unlikely origins. Raised in a military, Mormon household outside San Antonio, Texas, Black always found inspiration in his plucky, determined mother. Having contracted polio as a small girl, she endured leg braces and iron lungs, and was repeatedly told that she could never have children or live a normal life. Defying expectations, she raised Black and his two brothers, built a career, escaped two abusive husbands, and eventually moved the family to a new life in Northern California. While Black struggled to come to terms with his sexuality--something antithetical to his mother's religious views--she remained his source of strength and his guiding light. Later, she would stand by his side when he helped bring the historic gay marriage case to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mama's Boy&lt;/i&gt; is a stirring celebration of the connections between mother and son, Red states and Blue, and the spirit of optimism and perseverance that can create positive change in the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Mother knows best” takes on a sinister new meaning in this unsettling thriller perfect for fans of Neil Gaiman and&lt;/em&gt; Grimms’ Fairy Tales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says Lauren Tranter is exhausted, that she needs rest. And they’re right; with newborn twins, Morgan and Riley, she’s never been more tired in her life. But she knows what she saw: that night, in her hospital room, a woman tried to take her babies and replace them with her own…creatures. Yet when the police arrived, they saw no one. Everyone, from her doctor to her husband, thinks she’s imagining things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month passes. And one bright summer morning, the babies disappear from Lauren’s side in a park. But when they’re found, something is different about them. The infants look like Morgan and Riley―to everyone else. But to Lauren, something is off. As everyone around her celebrates their return, Lauren begins to scream, &lt;em&gt;These are not my babies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to bring her true infant sons home, Lauren will risk the unthinkable. But if she’s wrong about what she saw…she’ll be making the biggest mistake of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsive, creepy, and inspired by some our darkest fairy tales, &lt;em&gt;Little Darlings&lt;/em&gt; will have you checking―and rechecking―your own little ones. Just to be sure. Just to be safe.</description>

  <description>Rejected by his race. Hunted by the Klan. Yet, standing up to hatred is still the only choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York, Early 1900s: Jimmy Montgomery comes from old New York money and grows up among the Manhattan elite. At the age of eighteen, Jimmy discovers he’s been living a lie. He follows his roots back to Tulsa, Oklahoma to answer the burning questions in his life. Who is he? What is he? Where does he belong? He finds love and friendship along the way, but full acceptance from either the White or the Black world eludes him. When trouble pits the White population of Tulsa against the Black community of Greenwood, Jimmy must finally make a choice---he can no longer live in the middle. His decision will alter the course of his life and those he’d come to love. What will he decide? Pick up a copy to find out.&lt;br /&gt;LIVING IN THE MIDDLE is a powerful African American historical novel based on the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. If you like passionate heroes, no-holds-barred history, high-stakes emotional tension, then you’ll love A. Robert Allen’s eye-opening story.&lt;br /&gt;LIVING IN THE MIDDLE is a stand-alone story connected by theme to the other volumes in A. Robert Allen’s Slavery and Beyond series.</description>

  <description>The stunning story of an Alabama serial killer and the true-crime book that Harper Lee worked on obsessively in the years after To Kill a Mockingbird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reverend Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim. Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell’s murderer was acquitted–thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the audience during the vigilante’s trial was Harper Lee, who had traveled from New York City to her native Alabama with the idea of writing her own In Cold Blood, the true-crime classic she had helped her friend Truman Capote research seventeen years earlier. Lee spent a year in town reporting, and many more working on her own version of the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Casey Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders to the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South.</description>

  <description>Natalie, a young art student in New York City, is struggling to pay her bills when a friend makes a suggestion: Why not go online and find a sugar daddy—a wealthy, older man who will pay her for dates, and even give her a monthly allowance? Lots of girls do it, Nat learns. All that’s required is to look pretty and hang on his every word. Sexual favours are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though more than thirty years her senior, Gabe, a handsome corporate finance attorney, seems like the perfect candidate, and within a month, they are madly in love. At least, Nat is…Gabe already has a family, whom he has no intention of leaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when he abruptly ends things, Nat can’t let go. She begins drinking heavily and stalking him: watching him at work, spying on his wife, even befriending his daughter, who is not much younger than she is. But Gabe’s not about to let his sugar baby destroy his perfect life. What was supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement devolves into a nightmare of deception, obsession, and, when a body is found near Gabe’s posh Upper East Side apartment, murder.</description>

  <description>Dexter T. Rexter is on a plane—for the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dexter can’t wait to go on vacation with his best friend, Jack. Supercool orange sunglasses? Check. Nifty travel hat? Check. Plane tickets? Uh, what? Dexter may be the toughest, coolest dinosaur around, but everyone knows T. rexes don’t fly! If anyone could do it, he could. It’s just that he’s suddenly feeling a little hot. And maybe a little nervous. But just as he starts to melt down, he notices Jack looks upset. Dexter realizes he has to be brave enough for both of them. And maybe, just maybe, he’ll start to have a bit of fun in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both nervous and funny, Dexter tells the readers what he’s feeling and even asks their advice as he comes to understand that being brave with a friend makes everything a little better. And hey, those cookies during the flight don’t hurt, either!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The “gripping… page-turner” (&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;) hitting all the best of summer reading lists, &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for book clubs and fans of Liane Moriarty and Celeste Ng&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How far will you go to protect your family? Will you keep their secrets? Ignore their lies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a small town in Virginia, a group of people know each other because they’re part of a special treatment center, a hyperbaric chamber that may cure a range of conditions from infertility to autism. But then the chamber explodes, two people die, and it’s clear the explosion wasn’t an accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A powerful showdown unfolds as the story moves across characters who are all maybe keeping secrets, hiding betrayals. Chapter by chapter, we shift alliances and gather evidence: Was it the careless mother of a patient? Was it the owners, hoping to cash in on a big insurance payment and send their daughter to college? Could it have been a protester, trying to prove the treatment isn’t safe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A stunning debut about parents, children and the unwavering hope of a better life, even when all hope seems lost" (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post), Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt; uncovers the worst prejudice and best intentions, tense rivalries and the challenges of parenting a child with special needs. It’s “a quick-paced murder mystery that plumbs the power and perils of community” (&lt;i&gt;O Magazine&lt;/i&gt;) as it carefully pieces together the tense atmosphere of a courtroom drama and the complexities of life as an immigrant family. Drawing on the author’s own experiences as a Korean-American, former trial lawyer, and mother of a “miracle submarine” patient, this is a novel steeped in suspense and igniting discussion. Recommended by Erin Morgenstern, Jean Kwok, Jennifer Weiner, Scott Turow, Laura Lippman, and more-- &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek&lt;/i&gt; is a brave, moving debut from an unforgettable new voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries comes a sparkling new series about an oft-widowed mother's grown children, who blaze through society in their quest for the truth about their fathers . . . and in the process find that love just might conquer all . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A series of stepfathers and a difficult childhood have left Fletcher "Grey" Pryde, 5th Duke of Greycourt, with a guarded heart, enviable wealth, and the undeserved reputation of a rogue. Grey's focus on expanding his dukedom allows him little time to find a wife. But when his mother is widowed yet again and he meets the charmingly unconventional woman managing his stepfather's funeral, he's shocked to discover how much they have in common. Still, Grey isn't interested in love, no matter how pretty, or delightfully outspoken, the lady . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beatrice Wolfe gave up on romance long ago, and the arrogant Duke of Greycourt with his rakish reputation isn't exactly changing her mind. Then Grey agrees to assist his grief-stricken mother with her latest "project" schooling spirited, unfashionable Beatrice for her debut. Now that Beatrice is seeing through Grey's charms to his wounded heart, she's having trouble keeping him at arm's length. But once Grey starts digging into her family's secrets, she must decide whether her loyalties lie with her family . . . or with the man whose lessons capture her heart . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Deeply buried secrets make for a disturbing family reunion in bestselling author Catherine McKenzie’s tantalizing novel of psychological suspense.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to Amanda Holmes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty years ago, she was found bludgeoned in a rowboat at the MacAllister family’s Camp Macaw. No one was ever charged with the crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after their parents’ sudden deaths, the MacAllister siblings return to camp to read the will and decide what to do with the prime real estate the camp occupies. Ryan needs to sell. Margaux hasn’t made up her mind. Mary believes in leaving well enough alone. Kate and Liddie—the twins—have opposing views. And Sean Booth, the groundskeeper, just hopes he still has a home when all is said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s more complicated than a simple vote. The will stipulates that until they unravel the mystery of what happened to Amanda, they can’t settle the estate. Any one of them could have done it, and each one is holding a piece of the puzzle. Will they work together to finally discover the truth, or will their secrets finally tear the family apart?</description>

  <description>The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author brings us her most ambitious and provocative work yet—a searing and timely novel that explores the most volatile issue of our time—domestic violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the break of dawn, Caroline Shelby rolls into Oysterville, Washington, a tiny hamlet at the edge of the raging Pacific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s come home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home to a place she thought she’d left forever, home of her heart and memories, but not her future. Ten years ago, Caroline launched a career in the glamorous fashion world of Manhattan. But her success in New York imploded on a wave of scandal and tragedy, forcing her to flee to the only safe place she knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the backseat of Caroline’s car are two children who were orphaned in a single chilling moment—five-year-old Addie and six-year-old Flick. She’s now their legal guardian—a role she’s not sure she’s ready for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Oysterville she left behind has changed. Her siblings have their own complicated lives and her aging parents are hoping to pass on their thriving seafood restaurant to the next generation. And there’s Will Jensen, a decorated Navy SEAL who’s also returned home after being wounded overseas. Will and Caroline were forever friends as children, with the promise of something more . . . until he fell in love with Sierra, Caroline’s best friend and the most beautiful girl in town. With her modeling jobs drying up, Sierra, too, is on the cusp of reinventing herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caroline returns to her favorite place: the sewing shop owned by Mrs. Lindy Bloom, the woman who inspired her and taught her to sew. There she discovers that even in an idyllic beach town, there are women living with the deepest of secrets. Thus begins the Oysterville Sewing Circle—where women can join forces to support each other through the troubles they keep hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet just as Caroline regains her creativity and fighting spirit, and the children begin to heal from their loss, an unexpected challenge tests her courage and her heart. This time, though, Caroline is not going to run away. She’s going to stand and fight for everything—and everyone—she loves.</description>

  <description>From #1 New York Times bestselling author Lisa Jackson comes a new novel of nerve-jangling suspense as a woman haunted by guilt realizes that nothing can be trusted—not even her own memory …&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are people in Edgewater, Oregon, who think that twenty years ago, Rachel Gaston got away with murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rachel still has no idea how a foolish teenaged game turned deadly—or who replaced her soft pellet air gun with a real weapon. When a figure leapt out at her from the darkness, she fired without thinking. Too late, she recognized her half-brother, Luke, and saw blood blooming around his chest.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite counseling, Rachel’s horrifying dreams about that night continue. Her anxiety contributed to her divorce from Detective Cade Ryder, though he blames himself too. But as Rachel’s high school reunion nears, she feels her imagination playing tricks, convincing her that objects in her house have moved. That there’s a hint of unfamiliar cologne in the air. That someone is tailing her car. Watching her home.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s right to be scared. And as connections surface between a new string of murders and Luke’s death, Rachel realizes there’s no escaping the past, and the truth may be darker than her worst fears …</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In this game, even winning can be deadly...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it--teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy's sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it's naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way--a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they're alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn't give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she's going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect herself and her family and save the life she's built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can't beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson's trademark humor, &lt;em&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/em&gt; explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An incredibly timely, terrifically witty and moving debut about a young writer's assistant on a late night comedy show and what transpires when she accepts an invitation from its enigmatic host to spend a long weekend at his mansion in Connecticut.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June Bloom is a broke, cynical twenty-nine-year-old writer's assistant on the late-night comedy show, &lt;i&gt;Stay Up with Hugo Best. &lt;/i&gt;Hugo Best is in his sixties, a beloved icon of TV and humor, and a notorious womanizer. After he unexpectedly retires and a party is held for his now unemployed staff, June ends up at a dive bar for an open-mic night and prepares for the sad return to the anonymous comedian lifestyle. What she’s not prepared for is a run-in with Hugo at that dive bar. Nor for the invitation that swiftly follows: Hugo asks June to come to his mansion in Greenwich for the long Memorial Day weekend. “No funny business,” he insists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June, in need of a job and money, confident she can handle herself, but secretly harboring the remains of a childhood crush on the charming older comedian and former role model, accepts. The exact terms of the visit are never spelled out, but June is realistic and clear-eyed enough to guess. Even so, as the weekend unfolds and the enigmatic Hugo gradually reveals himself, their dynamic proves to be much more complicated and less predictable than she expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At once hilarious and poignant, brilliantly incisive and terrifically propulsive, &lt;i&gt;Stay Up with Hugo Best &lt;/i&gt;is an incredibly timely exploration of sexual politics in the #MeToo age, and the unforgettable story of one young woman’s poignant stumbling into adulthood.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Marketplace Buzz Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; selection&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in Appalachia and the Midwest at the turn of the twentieth century, this exquisite debut novel paints an intimately rendered portrait of one resilient farm family's challenges and hard-won triumphs--helmed by an unforgettable heroine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up on their hardscrabble farm in rural Kentucky, fifteen-year-old Albertina "Bertie" Winslow has learned a lot from her mama, Polly. She knows how to lance a boil, make a pie crust, butcher a pig, and tend to every chore that needs doing. What she doesn't know, but is forced to reckon with all too soon, is how to look after children as a mother should ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Polly succumbs to a long illness, Bertie takes on responsibility for her four younger siblings and their dissolute, unreliable daddy. Yet no matter how hard she tries to hold the family together, the task is overwhelming. Nine-year-old Dacia, especially, is resentful and stubborn, hinting at secrets in their mama's life. Finally, Bertie makes the only choice she can--breaking up the family for its own survival, keeping the girls with her, sending the boys off to their grown brothers, long gone from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever pragmatic, Bertie marries young, grateful to find a husband willing to take on the care of her sisters, and eventually moves to the oil fields of Kansas. But marriage alone cannot resolve the grief and guilt she carries over a long-ago tragedy, or prepare her for the heartaches still to come. Only by confronting wrenching truths can she open herself to joy--and learn how to not only give, but receive, unfettered love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by stories told by the author's mother and aunts, &lt;i&gt;All the Forgivenesses &lt;/i&gt;is as authentic as it is lyrical--a captivating novel of family loyalty, redemption, and resilience.</description>

  <description>“IT’S TIME! They have my cattle and now they have one of my boys. Range War begins tomorrow at Bundy Ranch.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These words, pounded out on a laptop at Cliven Bundy’s besieged Nevada ranch on April 6, 2014, ignited a new American revolution. Across the country, a certain type of citizen snapped to attention: This was the flashpoint the they’d been waiting for, a chance to help a fellow American stand up to a tyrannical and corrupt federal government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up in Arms chronicles how an isolated clan of desert-dwelling Mormons became the guiding light—and then the outright leaders—of America’s Patriot movement. The nation was riveted in 2014, when hundreds of armed Bundy supporters forced federal agents to abandon a court-ordered cattle roundup in the largest gathering of government-loathing organizations the FBI had ever witnessed. Then, in 2016, Ammon Bundy, one of Cliven’s 13 children, led a 41-day armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those events and the subsequent shootings, arrests, and trials captured headlines, but they’re just part of a story that has never been fully told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Temple, award-winning journalist and author of American Pain, gives readers an unprecedented and objective look at the real people and families at the heart of this highly publicized standoff. Eye-opening and instantly gripping, Up in Arms offers a propulsive and thoroughly researched narrative populated by rifle-toting cowboys, apocalyptic militiamen, undercover infiltrators, and the devout and charismatic Bundys themselves. In its main storyline, the book chronicles Ammon Bundy’s transformation from successful Phoenix businessman to the leader of an armed insurgency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In engrossing and plainspoken prose, Temple uses the Bundy family’s story to illuminate the rise of the Patriot militia movement in America. A seasoned investigative reporter, Temple embedded himself in a corner of the West where many citizens believe they’re treated like colonial subjects, not full-fledged Americans. Neither mainstream nor conservative media outlets have contextualized the religious, political, environmental, and economic factors, decades in the making, that set the stage for these events. Up In Arms presents the Bundys and their supporters as they truly are: neither violent criminals nor folk heroes, but a diverse collection of American rebels who believe government overreach justifies the taking up of arms.</description>

  <description>My mother once said that angels come in many forms: people, animals, insects, flowers or even objects. Some stay with us for just a short time, helping us through difficult times, others stay forever, deep inside our soul, carrying us from one moment to the next. I always wanted to believe it was true, that maybe in a world where there was so much bad, there was still hope for some good. As I grew older and the innocence of childhood waned, tainting my views on life, I was finding that perhaps it was just my mother’s way of feeding my young imagination. That all changed the day I met him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that feeling you get deep inside your gut? The one that tells you something is dangerous, or something is meant to be. The one that sees the bad or good in a person before they even utter a single syllable to you. The one that rattles your very soul, making you question your own sanity because you know you must be completely mad for having such an intense connection to someone you’ve just met. That’s the feeling I had when I first saw him. It was so much more than his good looks, his charming personality and his caring ways. It was something unexplainable and unimaginable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time we met, I felt it, and I was pretty certain he did too. Familiar strangers searching for someone, or something deep inside the other. Maybe I was losing my mind or maybe I was just caught up in a daydream of how I wished my life could be. But from the first moment I had gotten caught up in his gaze, I knew I had stared into those pale-blue eyes once before…maybe not in this lifetime, but perhaps a lifetime before.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture from Paramount Pictures starring John Lithgow, Jason Clarke, and Amy Seimetz!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen King’s #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Pet Sematary&lt;/i&gt;, a classic about evil that exists far beyond the grave—among King’s most iconic and beloved novels.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dr. Louis Creed takes a new job and moves his family to the idyllic rural town of Ludlow, Maine, this new beginning seems too good to be true. Despite Ludlow’s tranquility, an undercurrent of danger exists here. Those trucks on the road outside the Creed’s beautiful old home travel by just a little too quickly, for one thing…as is evidenced by the makeshift graveyard in the nearby woods where generations of children have buried their beloved pets. Then there are the warnings to Louis both real and from the depths of his nightmares that he should not venture beyond the borders of this little graveyard where another burial ground lures with seductive promises and ungodly temptations. A blood-chilling truth is hidden there—one more terrifying than death itself, and hideously more powerful. As Louis is about to discover for himself sometimes&lt;i&gt;, dead is better&lt;/i&gt;…</description>

  <description>Roots, once suffocating under cement, tear through the streets of London to throttle buildings. Vegetable homunculi hold up banks with automatic weapons. There is a green and blooming world beyond our own, fighting back against the human pollutant. We will launch a rescue mission to this Otherworld. But it is cruel and unknowable, and should we become tangled in its vines, more than cities will fall. From Dan Watters (Limbo, The Shadow, Assassin’s Creed) and Val Rodrigues comes a story of two worlds, of myth and man, of science and fiction, and the roots they share.</description>

  <description>In a world where a woman’s purity is the fine line between being Queen and being killed, he was given one duty—to protect my purity and above all, to protect me. Both were a battle we weren’t ready for.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forced by tradition, and as their chosen Queen, I must endure my trials and the suitor phase, ultimately giving myself to a man from the Royal Houses. Each one competes to be my King, all wanting what no other has had…my purity. &lt;br /&gt;To have what I truly want would risk my entire reign, but to do what is expected of me would destroy my heart. My only protection is to follow through, giving each royal the opportunity to win their prize…me in a bedroom suite and a crown atop their head. &lt;br /&gt;Behind closed doors, I commit my biggest sin, loving a man I’m forbidden to have. When the time comes for me to be crowned, I’ll be forced to make a choice—risk our love or risk my life.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DRIZZT RETURNS TO THE UNDERDARK!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“After a quarter of a century, R.A. Salvatore just keeps getting better and better, and The Companions is another masterful leap forward for one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time.”&lt;br /&gt;—Philip Athans, best-selling author of &lt;i&gt;Annihilation&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Writing Monsters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;R.A. Salvatore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Archmage&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pall that had descended over the North is gone, and a new day has dawned on a victorious Mithral Hall, but no matter how bright things seem on the surface, Drizzt and his companions know that what lurks just under their feet remains steeped in evil and charged with unimaginable power.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The dark elves of Menzoberranzan, including the powerful Archmage Gromph, aren’t done with Drizzt yet. And consumed by their own power struggles, feeling backed into a corner, the drow may just be desperate enough to call on demonic forces from the deepest reaches of the Abyss, and unleash a disaster even the Underdark could never have prepared for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Archmage &lt;/i&gt;has everything Drizzt’s fans crave: action, adventure, characters that resonate with equal measures of warrior spirit and deep compassion, and no shortage of wicked dark elves!</description>

  <description>Christmas is my favorite time of the year. I love the decorations, being surrounded by family, time of quiet reflection and busy (sometimes crazy) get-together with loved ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then of course there are the presents. I used to have a bit of a “love/hate” relationship with Christmas presents. I loved being able to give nice gifts, but always felt like we had to keep up with what everyone else was doing. The whole commercialization and keeping up with dollar amounts was getting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s when I decided to focus on more meaningful homemade gifts that didn’t cost much to make.&lt;br /&gt;They were very well received by family and friends. In this short book, I would like to share some of those ideas with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don’t need to be super crafty for many of these gift ideas. I’m including a wide variety of ideas and I’m sure just reading through the pages will give you more ideas of your own as well. You’ll be ready to make gifts for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Handmade treasures for your kids or grand-kids&lt;br /&gt;* Meaningful gifts for close relatives and friends&lt;br /&gt;* Quick ideas for thoughtful gifts for teachers, mailmen etc.&lt;br /&gt;* Help your kids make gifts for grandparents, teacher and friends&lt;br /&gt;* Heartfelt gifts for neighbors, friends and more …</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The trial ended years ago, but her nightmare is just beginning.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Former juror Jess Dawson is facing a difficult time in her life, raising an autistic son and navigating a failing marriage, when her past service as a juror on a high-profile death penalty case comes back to haunt her. Mikael Kriskan, a young Russian the jury sentenced to death for killing his adoptive American parents one cold Colorado night, is nearing his execution date when the foreman of their jury and his wife are found dead, killed in the same manner as Kriskan’s parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, a second juror appears to commit suicide and leaves a disturbing note to his fellow jurors attached to his chest: KJ - do the right thing. Only Jess knows the true meaning of the message but as others begin to suspect the truth, Jess quickly finds herself in the crosshairs of Kriskan’s prosecutor, also her lover, who’s intent on executing Kriskan, and members of the Russian mob, who are hell bent on returning the genius Kriskan to his Russian roots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice they give former juror Jess Dawson seems easy: Kill Mikael, kill her son. Save Mikael, save her son. But in a case where the post-conviction appeals have run out, the impact the truth will have upon her family is dire, and the lives of her fellow jurors are equally at stake—this choice will be anything but easy.</description>

  <description>A child is missing and the gutsy filmmaker trying to find her is brutally abducted. Alex Desocarras’ main suspect—a fellow RCMP officer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of Innocence, a debut novel in a mystery thriller series, introduces Det. Sgt. Alex Desocarras, an Indigenous RCMP Detective stationed in the town of 100 Mile House in British Columbia’s beautiful and rugged South Cariboo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young girl, Carey Bolton, is kidnapped in the small Northern town of Terrace, BC. The police have no leads and no ID on the young man who took her. Weeks later, her distraught family’s hopes are raised when an anonymous caller claims Carey is being held at an address in Vancouver, BC — 1,200 kilometres from home. The Vancouver Police are there within the hour but report the house vacant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carey’s desperate mother asks family and friends living in Vancouver to follow up. Several hours later, they find a woman at the house, but she claims Carey was never there. Suspicious and looking for answers, family friend, Anishinaabe filmmaker Morgan O’Meara returns alone early the next morning and leaves a note. Three days later, she is brutally abducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When O’Meara’s case lands in Desocarras’ jurisdiction, Det. Jeri Fernice of the VPD MPU reaches out to him with evidence that the Bolton and O’Meara cases are linked. Following a hunch on who the anonymous caller might be, Alex is forced undercover when a fellow high-ranking officer becomes his main suspect.</description>

  <description>An old friend calls Catherine Lockhart and Liam Taggart to his famous Italian restaurant to enlist their help. His aunt is being evicted from her home in the Tuscan hills by a powerful corporation claiming they own the deeds, even though she can produce her own set of deeds to her land. Catherine and Liam’s only clue is a bound handwritten manuscript, entirely in German, and hidden in its pages is a story long-forgotten…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ada Baumgarten was born in Berlin in 1918, at the end of the Great War. The daughter of an accomplished first-chair violinist in the prestigious Berlin Philharmonic, she herself was a violin prodigy, Ada’s life was full of the rich culture of Berlin’s interwar society. She formed a deep attachment to her childhood friend Kurt, but they were torn apart by the growing unrest as her Jewish family came under suspicion. As the tides of history turned, it was her extraordinary talent that would carry her through an unraveling society turned to war, and make her a target even as it saved her, allowing her to move to Bologna―though Italy was not the haven her family had hoped, and further heartache awaited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What became of Ada? How is she connected to the conflicting land deeds of a small Italian villa? As they dig through the layers of lies, corruption, and human evil, Catherine and Liam uncover an unfinished story of heart, redemption, and hope―the ending of which is yet to be written.</description>

  <description>In the late summer of 1969, the nation was transfixed by a series of gruesome murders in the hills of Los Angeles. Newspapers and television programs detailed the brutal slayings of a beautiful actress--twenty six years old and eight months pregnant with her first child--as well as a hair stylist, an heiress, a businessman, and other victims. The City of Angels was plunged into a nightmare of fear and dread. In the weeks and months that followed, law enforcement faced intense pressure to solve crimes that seemed to have no connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after months of dead-ends, false leads, and near-misses, Charles Manson and members of his "family" were arrested. The bewildering trials that followed once again captured the nation and forever secured &lt;em&gt;Manson&lt;/em&gt; as a byword for the evil that men do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing upon deep archival research and exclusive personal interviews--including unique access to Manson Family parole hearings--former federal prosecutor and Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl has written a propulsive, page-turning historical thriller of the crimes and manhunt that mesmerized the nation. And in the process, she reveals how the social and political context that gave rise to Manson is eerily similar to our own.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bram Stoker kept secret a tale even more terrifying than &lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It begins among the Carpathian peaks, when an intrepid explorer discovers a mysterious golden box. She brings it back with her to the foggy streets of Victorian London, unaware of its dangerous power…or that an evil beyond imagining has already taken root in the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stoker, a successful theater manager but frustrated writer, is drawn into a deadly web spun by the wealthy founders of a mission house for the poor. Far from a safe haven, the mission harbors a dark and terrifying secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save the souls of thousands, Stoker—aided by the explorer and a match girl grieving the loss of her child—must pursue an enemy as ancient as the Saharan sands where it originated. Their journey will take them through the city’s overgrown graveyards and rat-infested tunnels and even onto the maiden voyage of the world’s first “unsinkable” ship…</description>

  <description>Listening Length: 8 hours and 21 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heart-stirring novel of family and forgiveness from bestselling author Ashley Farley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her grand home in Charleston, Willa Bellemore raised two girls during the tumultuous 1970s. One was her daughter, Lady. The other was Lady’s best friend, Nell—adopted after the sudden, heartbreaking death of her mother, the Bellemores’ beloved maid. Willa showered Nell with love and support, all the while ignoring the disdainful whispers of her neighbors. After all, they were family. Nell and Lady were sisters at heart—sisters who vowed to never let anything come between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on the night of Lady’s sixteenth birthday, something went terribly wrong, sparking painful secrets and bitter resentments that went unspoken for three decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Willa is dying, and Lady and Nell—each with a teenager of her own—are brought together after all these years. It’s Willa’s last wish. The time has come to confront what happened on that fateful night. But it may take a tragic twist of fate to reconcile the past and come to terms with the true meaning of family.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Mafia and the Gays&lt;/i&gt; meticulously documents how the mob controlled gay bars for decades in New York and Chicago due to their once illicit status, and relies upon an extensive collection of primary sources including FBI files many of which were not publicly available until acquired by author Phillip Crawford Jr. through the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Crawford illustrates how the gay bars historically were integrated into the Mafia rackets. For example, the establishments often were financed through mob-tied coin-op vendors and their related loan companies. Jukebox king Alfred Miniaci funded dozens of gay bars and other joints controlled by the Mafia in the 1950s and 1960s including the Peppermint Lounge. Miniaci supplied slot machines in the 1930s to Frank Costello, and had dined with the Genovese boss on the May 2, 1957 night he was shot. Gay bars sometimes served as drug drops. Forget about the pizza connection; this was the pansy connection. Club 82 in New York's East Village was a popular club with drag revues, and in the 1950s also was part of the distribution network in the Genovese family's heroin trade for which boss Vito was convicted in 1959.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gay bars were profit centers for all the Mafia families. Among the powerful mobsters who oversaw vast interests in LGBT nightlife were Gambino underboss Aniello Dellacroce, Genovese capo Matty Ianniello, Colombo underboss Sonny Franzese in New York and Joseph DiVarco who ran the Rush Street crew on the Near North Side for the Outfit in Chicago. The Mafia had ties to some of the most iconic gay establishments including the Continental Baths in the Hotel Ansonia from 1969 to 1976 on the Upper West Side which received protection from the Colombo family in exchange for installing its vending machines. Continental owner Steve Ostrow – a classically-trained opera singer – developed such close ties with Joe Colombo that he was performing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the June 29, 1970 Italian-American Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle when the mob boss was shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LGBT community once was married to the mob out of forced necessity but after gay bars became legal the relationship often continued in many establishments out of mutual convenience. Gay bars no longer were busted simply for homosexual assembly but they still risked raids if serving as sex clubs or drug drops. Accordingly, the mob still had both services to provide and protection to offer particularly during the party decades following the Stonewall riots. If a bar had a back room for anonymous sex, operated afterhours or sold drugs or boys, then odds are it was a Mafia joint, and that involved numerous places during the 1970s and 1980s. Indeed, the Mafia hijacked gay liberation for political cover and used so-called Auntie Gays – the Uncle Toms of the gay community – as frontmen for their bars to evade suspicion. The wiseguys allegedly even infiltrated the Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee and Christopher Street Festival Committee which ran New York City's gay pride parade and some related events for much of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the decades there has been a fair number of gay guys in the mob's ranks including cross-dressing Genovese soldier David Petillo who once was a boy prostitute, hitman Vito Arena from Roy DeMeo's Gambino crew and DeCavalcante boss John D'Amato. There is no shortage of bad gays in &lt;i&gt;The Mafia and the Gays&lt;/i&gt;, and most disturbing are the allegations of the mob's role in running underage boy prostitution rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Crawford has detailed in his book such an integral relationship between the LGBT community and the underworld over so many decades that one only can ask if the wiseguys still to this day perhaps may have a remaining role in a bar or two?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We’re rewriting the play, and the play is this country, the world, the future. We break Jane’s heart, we’ll also break her will.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was one of the FBI’s top agents until she became the nation’s most-wanted fugitive. Now Jane Hawk may be all that stands between a free nation and its enslavement by a powerful secret society’s terrifying mind-control technology. She couldn’t save her husband, or the others whose lives have been destroyed, but equipped with superior tactical and survival skills—and the fury born of a broken heart and a hunger for justice—Jane has struck major blows against the insidious cabal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jane’s enemies are about to hit back hard. If their best operatives can’t outrun her, they mean to bring her running to them, using her five-year-old son as bait. Jane knows there’s no underestimating their capabilities, but she must battle her way back across the country to the remote shelter where her boy is safely hidden . . . for now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she moves resolutely forward, new threats begin to emerge: a growing number of brain-altered victims driven hopelessly, violently insane. With the madness spreading like a virus, the war between Jane and her enemies will become a fight for all their lives—against the lethal terror unleashed from behind the forbidden door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; &lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER - NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE ON NETFLIX - A remarkable tale of the island of Guernsey during the German Occupation, and of a society as extraordinary as its name.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers." &lt;/i&gt;January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;2 CHILDREN FOR SALE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrawled sign, peddling young siblings on a farmhouse porch, captures the desperation sweeping the country in 1931. It’s an era of breadlines, bank runs, and impossible choices. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For struggling reporter Ellis Reed, the gut-wrenching scene evokes memories of his family’s dark past. He snaps a photograph of the children, not meant for publication. But when the image leads to his big break, the consequences are devastating in ways he never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by secrets of her own, secretary Lillian Palmer sees more in the picture than a good story and is soon drawn into the fray. Together, the two set out to right a wrongdoing and mend a fractured family, at the risk of everything they value. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by an actual newspaper photo that stunned readers across the nation, this touching novel explores the tale within the frame and behind the lens—a journey of ambition, love, and the far-reaching effects of our actions.</description>

  <description>Once the mighty fortress had stood strong, defended by the mightiest of all Drenai heroes, Druss, the Legend. But now a tyrannical, mad emperor had seized control of the fortress, and his twisted will was carried throughout the land by the Joinings --- abominations that were half-man, half-beast. Tenaka Khan was a half-breed himself, hated by the Drenai for his Nadir blood and despised by the Nadir for his Drenai ancestry. But he alone had a plan to destroy the emperor. The last heroes of the Drenai joined with him in a desperate gamble to bring down the emperor -- even at the cost of their own destruction.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #1: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking… and what she’s hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #2: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #3: Should a punishment always fit the crime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>A thirteen-year-old girl and her father live in Forest Park, an enormous nature preserve in Portland, Oregon. They inhabit an elaborate cave shelter, wash in a nearby creek, store perishables at the water’s edge, use a makeshift septic system, tend a garden, even keep a library of sorts. Once a week they go to the city to buy groceries and otherwise merge with the civilized world. But one small mistake allows a backcountry jogger to discover them, which derails their entire existence, ultimately provoking a deeper flight.&lt;br /&gt; Inspired by a true story and told through the startlingly sincere voice of its young narrator, Caroline, &lt;i&gt;My Abandonment&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting journey into life at the margins and a mesmerizing tale of survival and hope.</description>

  <description>In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, Black students who called themselves “the Emmett Till generation” launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle for civil rights into a mass movement. Till’s lynching became the most notorious hate crime in American history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what actually happened to Emmett Till—not the icon of injustice, but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history, drawing on a wealth of new evidence, including a shocking admission of Till’s innocence from the woman in whose name he was killed. this book provides fresh insight into the way race has informed and deformed our democratic institutions.</description>

  <description>How would it be if Snow White were the real villain &amp;amp; the wicked queen just a sadly maligned innocent? What if awakening the Sleeping Beauty should be the mistake of a lifetime--of several lifetimes? What if the famous folk tales were retold with an eye to more horrific possibilities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Tanith Lee could do justice to it. In RED AS BLOOD, she displays her soaring imagination at its most fantastically mischievous. Not for nothing was the title story named as a Nebula nominee. Not for nothing was the author of THE BIRTHGRAVE &amp;amp; THE STORM LORD called by New York's Village Voice, "Goddess-Empress of the Hot Read."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the world-famous tales of such as the Brothers Grimm as they might have been retold by the Sisters Grimmer! Fairy tales for children? Not on your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;Paid Piper (1981)&lt;br /&gt;Red as Blood (1979)&lt;br /&gt;Thorns (1972)&lt;br /&gt;When the Clock Strikes (1980)&lt;br /&gt;The Golden Rope (1983)&lt;br /&gt;The Princess and Her Future (1983)&lt;br /&gt;Wolfland (1980)&lt;br /&gt;Black as Ink (1983)&lt;br /&gt;Beauty (1983)</description>

  <description>Malcolm Polstead is the kind of boy who notices everything but is not much noticed himself. And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a spy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm's father runs an inn called the Trout, on the banks of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his dæmon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal, but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new: intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance called Dust--and the spy it was intended for finds &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, Malcolm sees suspicious characters everywhere; Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium; an Egyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with an evil monkey for a dæmon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl--just a baby--named Lyra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lyra is the kind of person who draws people in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices, to bring her safely through the storm.</description>

  <description>They want to move on—but one terrible truth could shatter it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a widowed mother of three, new love seems impossible for Freya—until she meets Duncan, and suddenly she feels alive again. But there are secrets afflicting Freya’s family, some more sinister than others, that could destroy their relationship before it has a chance to flourish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Freya’s older children are less than welcoming, six-year-old Sophie helps Duncan find his place in the family—but even Sophie harbours fears that threaten to overshadow any chance of a new start. The past is hard to leave behind when pictures of Freya’s idolised late husband hang in every room, and the more Duncan tries to find the source of Sophie’s anxiety, the more he is convinced that Reuben was not the perfect husband and father Freya remembers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tormented by concern and his own insecurity, Duncan begins an obsessive investigation into the dead man’s past. But when his good intentions lead him in too deep, he risks destroying everything he has built with Freya—and the whole family’s second chance at happiness.</description>

  <description>Valérie and Jake were always good friends until they discovered that Jake had been affected by the Parum est virus, also called the short man virus. Stuck at a height below three feet wasn’t bad enough but Valérie seemed to be the opposite, growing to a height of six feet and five inches. As his fear of the giant world around him increased, Jake locked himself in as a recluse where he became a successful billionaire financial advisor. What Jake didn’t know was that though he had not seen her face to face for years, Valérie never forgot him and was working on a formula to control height. When he decided to move away to a private island to live around, Jake’s younger sister who was a champion of the couple being together, informed Valérie of Jake’s pending departure. Will Valérie be able to make the serum that will alter their heights and cure Jake from his fear of the giant world? Is there any hope for them in a world where to be different is to be ridiculed? Short on Love is an erotica novella with steamy and explicit scenes between a couple who are opposite in height.</description>

  <description>Clay Finnes is the sheriff of a small town in Georgia called Bulwark. Recently separated from his wife, all he can think about is what went wrong, and will Jenna ever come back to him. He's troubled by a bothersome reporter trying to build a story from what he thinks is a normal day in his life. Clay has to admit that the fantastical stories, told by an accident victim as well as unusual sightings of wolves, things are getting a bit strange. A visit to the ominous Gingerbread House makes him realize that his life as he knows it will never be the same.</description>

  <description>Gods vs. Wizards ~ an epic struggle for survival&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernie fixes broken universes for a living. Unlike other gods, who tend to take a hell-fire-and-brimstone approach to problem-solving, Bernie prefers a more gentle approach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernie's job is to restore production on the planet Photox, but he soon discovers a world caught up in a civil war. With a hard-to-please boss breathing down his neck and a personal life in desperate need of relationship advice, Bernie's chances of success are dwindling fast. The gods on Bernie's world are no help. If he fails to restore production, they will destroy Photox's entire population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernie is desperate to keep this from happening, even if the murderous wizard causing all the problems is powerful enough to hurt a god…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************** &lt;br /&gt;All books in The Universe Builders series are standalone and can be read in any order. The first book, Bernie and the Putty, won 16 national and international awards for excellence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance Review Copies available: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://argonpress.com/request/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://argonpress.com/request/&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>A corpse in the fireplace of an old house. It’s been there for thirty years, but who is it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s clearly murder, but who is the murdered person and what connection does the body have to the previous owners of the house. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And then why a fireplace? It was bound to be discovered eventually but was that what the murderer wanted? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The main suspects are all old and dying, or already dead. Yet again, there’s a motive, but what is it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Isaac Cook and his team have their work cut out trying to put the pieces together. Those who know are not talking out of an old-fashioned belief in that a family’s dirty laundry is not to be aired in public, and certainly not to a policeman - even if that means the murderer is never brought to justice! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

After she returns to her childhood home years following this unexplainable disappearance, she discovers evidence buried in the past, and she can't ignore the apparent truth of what may lead to her mother's whereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the rural family farm where she once grew up embraces its own secrets, and the small community of the local Georgia town holds closely to their hearts more than they are willing to reveal. In Rae's search, she attempts to find a footing in her own life while looking for answers through an intricate landscape that trace back to the unknown life of her mother's past. She finds haunting revelations and undertakes trying detours along the way.

  <description>Join Muffy, the curious and happy-go-lucky Goldendoodle puppy and her fun-loving family, the Gabriels as they adopt a new pack member. Winter, the big white dog, is lost in the mountains of Tennessee and must be rescued by Captain Ross in Edna, the plucky little airplane. Muffy has a run-in with Mama Porkee, the porcupine, and meets Shi-mi, the Medicine Cat who spends her time helping all the animals at the vet. Winter flies in a helicopter, and meets the good people of Rolling Acres Sheep Farm where Chewey the Great Pyrenees teaches him how to guard the sheep. Hang out once more with this endearing and orderly pack; check in with Oliver, the heroic little Papillion, and Radar the retriever, and Jazz who is “blue”. Muffy and the Medicine Cat is a wonderful doggie adventure for kids aged seven through twelve, with colorful illustrations. And in the end……well, you’ll have to read it to find out, now won’t you?</description>

  <description>Forgetting the past isn’t always a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Hayes is desperate for answers. After waking from a coma, she faces a harsh reality. Amnesia has stolen six years of her life. The only thing keeping her sane is her brother, Brighton, who vows to protect her at all cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As fear and confusion dominate Jo, she struggles to regain her memories. Pieces slowly emerge once she meets the mysterious Adam Hart. Something about him strikes a nerve she can’t ignore, and the more she’s with him, the harder she fights to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the flashbacks bring Jo closer to the truth, they leave her physically drained. If her memories don’t return naturally, the truth may destroy more than her mind. It may be the one thing that kills her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartstrings is the first installment in the Heart &amp;amp; Soul Series. If you like riveting romances blended with love, loss, and hope, then you’ll enjoy Kelli McCracken’s gripping look at one woman’s struggle to overcome the odds.</description>

  <description>How far would you go to eliminate a threat to your business?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving back to his hometown of Silver Hollow, South Dakota, gives Oscar the opportunity to reconnect with Doug, his childhood friend. He soon becomes fascinated with Doug's home brewed beers and, when Doug finds himself unemployed, convinces him to open a craft brewery with Oscar's financial backing. But the area already has a brewery and its owner is not pleased to have competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although married, Oscar insists Doug move in to his guest room while the brewery takes off. This puts a strain on Oscar's already rocky marriage and his wife does not hold back her frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the brewery's successful grand opening, the two friends continue to learn about each other and the stress of running a business. Their sole employee appears to be a valuable addition, but his character is soon called into question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tension mounts, will Oscar and Doug's bond wind up crossing a line that changes their relationship forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust and loyalty clash with deceit and revenge as author Brad Carl explores the depths of friendship and business in Craft Beer Burning.</description>

  <description>Doorway to Your Dreams by John P. Goetz is a science fiction thriller about Oban DeCarlo's master plan to use humans with supernatural powers to create remote weapons of mass destruction. His program, Operation Traumland, is a fully funded Black Ops program located in an abandoned lab on Plum Island, New York. DeCarlo has created a laboratory where human ethics have been consciously abandoned, and the success of the mission is more important than any human life. When the novel begins, DeCarlo has already disposed of dozens in preliminary tests and is now ready for subjects with superhuman powers to finalize his first version of the eagerly anticipated U.S. weapon system. DeCarlo identifies and captures a US Army Helicopter Pilot serving in Vinh Long, South Vietnam in July 1967, by organizing a covert operation using North Vietnamese soldiers to kidnap the American they have nicknamed, “Demon” for his uncanny ability to easily find and kill their comrades. “Demon,” known as “Spooncake” by his fellow US Army colleagues, can hear the thought-noise from those around him, and sees spikes of color emanating from people many miles away. The spears of color in the sky depict the emotions of those below. Red, yellow, pink, black, white, turquoise, orange, and green indicate the collective feelings of calm, commotion, intensity, confidence, confusion, and death. His abilities make finding enemy troops easy; he needs only to fly toward the color red signifying anger and let his gunner, Baxter Hammond, take care of the rest. Their hit ratio is legendary. DeCarlo has also identified Linda Fisher, a beautiful card shark living in Las Vegas with a psychic ability to know how the cards will play before they are dealt, making her excessive winning streak a target for the Vegas casino bosses. DeCarlo’s men kidnap her and take her to his laboratory to be another specimen in Operation Traumland. “Spooncake” and Linda are to be used as Operation Traumland’s Adam and Eve. On the island, their supernatural and psychic abilities are channeled and amplified to build an undetectable human war machine. Ultimately, Linda becomes the only person able to bring the tragic, almost dead war hero, “Spooncake,” back to life and plots their escape. Their story follows a perilous journey to freedom, while maintaining honor, seeking revenge, and escaping the horrors of a fanatical sadist focused on doing anything to complete his dream of creating an unimaginable army of unseen killers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Laurie is a very active little girl. She loves school, but she has to keep busy all the time or she starts to fidget. She loves playing soccer and she's even the captain of her soccer team. So when Laurie suddenly lacks energy and her cheeks lose their rosy glow, her parents are understandably worried. They take her to see the family doctor and he runs a bunch of tests. The results are not happy news. Laurie has leukemia. She has to be hospitalized immediately and the only visitors allowed are her parents and they have to be thoroughly sanitized and gowned before they can visit her. Laurie becomes very despondent and sad. When her class sends her a big card with lots of messages and a special Sami Bear to keep her company, things start to improve and, with Sami Bear's help, Laurie is determined to fight her battle with leukemia.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic.</description>

  <description>Orphaned into an unforgiving foster home and raised as an outsider, Weird-Eye shoulders her unflattering nickname. She relies on her vivid imagination to sustain her work as a midwife bringing newborns into the world while World War II overruns her native Finland, desecrating life. She finds herself drawn to the handsome, otherworldly Johannes Angelhurst, a war photographer working for the SS. To be near him, Weird-Eye—whom Johannes lovingly calls Wild-Eye—volunteers to serve as a nurse at the prison camp where he has been assigned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the brutality of the camps to the splendor of the aurora borealis above the Arctic Sea, The Midwife tells of a stormy romance, the desolate beauty of a protective fjord, and the deeply personal battles waged as World War II came to an end.</description>

  <description>Seven year old Tony has one...choice to live or to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony Bruno just wants to fit in, but the bullies at his school are cruel and relentless. At home, he leans on his mother Teresa for strength and comfort, but she’s no match for his father, Carmen. His father, a fighter and bully himself, hates Tony. He is embarrassed by the child for not fighting back and wishes that Tony was never born. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then as a teen, in one act of blind courage, Tony fights back shifting the balance of power with his peers. Even after Tony sets things straight with the neighborhood boys, his father continues to terrorize him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At school, Tony is now respected by his classmates. One day he stands up for a bullied kid named, Salvatore, and the boys become friends. One night, Salvatore commits a horrific crime and Tony suffers the consequences of his friends’ actions. Tony’s punishment changes the course of his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All alone and nowhere to call home, Tony sets out to find the life he longs for, one filled with love and acceptance. But nothing comes easily for him, and he is forced to draw upon strength from deep within to survive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the dark world he lives in, Tony does unimaginable things to leave his unwanted life behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a haunting story of one bullied child deprived of love and taunted by corrupt individuals along his journey. Tony’s story will make you question the balance between good and evil.</description>

  <description>This short novel, or novella, is 83-year-old Tony Whelpton's second this year, and his fifth since he switched from being a best-selling author of school and college textbooks in his late seventies, a change which he wishes he had made many years ago because of the enthusiasm which his novels have inspired. &lt;br /&gt;In the summer of 1986 Wilf Broadhurst is a desperately unhappy and lonely old man, a former factory hand living in Nottingham. Now a widower in his mid-seventies, he lives alone, has virtually no friends, and lost touch with his only daughter nearly thirty years ago in acrimonious and heart-rending circumstances. In despair he consults his doctor, but the only help he is offered is a suggestion that he should get out more – perhaps get a dog or start going to church – or even to the pub. &lt;br /&gt;In Wilf’s place, which option would you choose? And how would you rate your chances of having a happy Christmas? You will enjoy reading how Wilf's determination, resourcefulness and intelligence see him through.</description>

  <description>2019 Readers' Favorite Honorable Mention&lt;br /&gt;2018 Kindle Book Awards Finalist&lt;br /&gt;2016 Kindle Scout Winner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing fifteen-year-old Kaylee wants to do is participate in a childish scavenger hunt--especially inside the abandoned retirement home on the edge of town. When she finds a bruised, deaf boy hiding inside one of the rooms, she vows to lead him to safety . . . only to discover the front doors are now padlocked, and her friends are nowhere to be found. Kaylee is about to learn that not everything that goes "bump in the night" is imaginary, and sometimes there are worse things to fear than ghosts.</description>

  <description>An enraged man abducts his estranged wife and child, holes up in a secluded mountain cabin, threatening to kill them both. A right wing survivalist amasses a cache of weapons and resists calls to surrender. A drug trafficker barricades himself and his family in a railroad car, and begins shooting. A cult leader in Waco, Texas faces the FBI in an armed stand-off that leaves many dead in a fiery blaze. A sniper, claiming to be God, terrorizes the DC metropolitan area. For most of us, these are events we hear about on the news. For Gary Noesner, head of the FBI’s groundbreaking Crisis Negotiation Unit, it was just another day on the job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Stalling for Time&lt;/i&gt;, Noesner takes readers on a heart-pounding tour through many of the most famous hostage crises of the past thirty years. Specially trained in non-violent confrontation and communication techniques, Noesner’s unit successfully defused many potentially volatile standoffs, but perhaps their most hard-won victory was earning the recognition and respect of their law enforcement peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noesner pursued his dream of joining the FBI all the way to Quantico, where he not only became a Special Agent, but also—in the course of a distinguished thirty-year career—the FBI’s Chief Negotiator. Gaining respect for the fledgling art of crisis negotiation in the hard-boiled culture of The Bureau, where the shadow of J. Edgar Hoover still loomed large, was an uphill battle, educating FBI and law enforcement leaders on the job at an incident, and advocating the use of psychology rather than force whenever possible. Noesner’s many bloodless victories rarely garnered as much media attention as the notorious incident management blunders like the Branch Davidian disaster in Waco and the Ruby Ridge tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noesner offers a candid as well as fascinating look back at his years as a rebel in the ranks and a pioneer on the front lines. Whether vividly recounting showdowns with the radical Republic of Texas militia, the terrorist hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, and self-styled messiah David Koresh, or clashes with colleagues and superiors that expose the internal politics and power-plays of America’s premier law enforcement agency, &lt;i&gt;Stalling for Time&lt;/i&gt; crackles with breathtaking suspense and insight in equal measure. Case by case, minute by minute, it’s a behind the scenes view of a visionary crime-fighter in action.</description>

  <description>The Devil Wears Prada meets The Office. Twenty-something Karsynn is now a boss but she's not so much The Devil Wears Prada as she is The Angel Wears Payless. With a brighter career, things should be going better for Karsynn, right? Wrong. There's now a new director at the office--Carter Lockwood, and he's brought his reputation for wrecking havoc amongst the ladies. Karsynn prides herself in being the only one impervious to Carter's good looks. In fact, she takes great pleasure in blowing on the embers of Carter's hostility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karsynn thinks Carter is arrogant and obnoxious. Carter thinks Karsynn is an ignorant, sassy spitfire. But when they start working closely together, they discover that first impressions can be deceptive. Karsynn may be winning the battle against Carter, but will she lose the war? And more importantly, will she lose her heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lisa Lim's debut novel was shortlisted for Goodreads No Young Adult Best Chick Lit Reads *</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE INSTANT #1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, director, actor, and YouTube superstar Shane Dawson returns with another highly entertaining and uproariously funny essay collection, chronicling a mix of real life moments both extraordinary and mortifying, yet always full of heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shane Dawson shared some of his best and worst experiences in &lt;i&gt;I Hate Myselfie, &lt;/i&gt;the critically acclaimed book that secured his place as a gifted humorist and keen observer of millennial culture. Fans felt as though they knew him after devouring the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly, Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/i&gt;bestseller. They were right… almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this new collection of original personal essays, Shane goes even deeper, sharing never-before-revealed stories from his life, giving readers a no-holds-barred look at moments both bizarre and relatable, from cult-like Christian after-school activities, dressing in drag, and losing his virginity, to hiring a psychic, clashes with celebrities, and coming to terms with his bisexuality. Every step of the way, Shane maintains his signature brand of humor, proving that even the toughest breaks can be funny when you learn to laugh at yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;Let's Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Running With Scissors&lt;/i&gt; for the millennial generation: an inspiring, intelligent, and brutally honest collection of true stories by a YouTube sensation-turned one of the freshest new voices out there.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first book to explain the new science of self-control and how it can be harnessed to improve our health, happiness, and productivity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of watching her students struggling with their choices, health psychologist Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., realized that much of what people believe about willpower is actually sabotaging their success. Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called "The Science of Willpower" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful &lt;i&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/i&gt; blog with the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the groundbreaking tradition of &lt;i&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Willpower Instinct&lt;/i&gt; combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Lincoln’s Dressmaker&lt;/i&gt; returns with a riveting work of historical fiction following the notorious John Wilkes Booth and the four women who kept his perilous confidence.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;John Wilkes Booth, the mercurial son of an acclaimed British stage actor and a Covent Garden flower girl, committed one of the most notorious acts in American history—the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The subject of more than a century of scholarship, speculation, and even obsession, Booth is often portrayed as a shadowy figure, a violent loner whose single murderous act made him the most hated man in America. Lost to history until now is the story of the four women whom he loved and who loved him in return: Mary Ann, the steadfast matriarch of the Booth family; Asia, his loyal sister and confidante; Lucy Lambert Hale, the senator’s daughter who adored Booth yet tragically misunderstood the intensity of his wrath; and Mary Surratt, the Confederate widow entrusted with the secrets of his vengeful plot. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fates and Traitors&lt;/i&gt; brings to life pivotal actors—some willing, others unwitting—who made an indelible mark on the history of our nation. Chiaverini portrays not just a soul in turmoil but a country at the precipice of immense change.</description>

  <description>After the only girl he ever loved told him he would never be enough, Rowdy St. James knocked the Texas dust off his boots and decided he was going to do everything in his power to live up to his nickname. Life was all about a good time, good friends and never taking much too seriously. Rowdy learned his lesson early on, when you care that much about anything it can destroy you, and he never wants to risk feeling like that again. Only now he has a new coworker, a ghost from the past who’s making him question every lesson he ever learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salem Cruz grew up in a house with too many rules, too many regulations, and no fun allowed. That never worked for her so she left it all behind as soon as she could, but she never forgot the sweet, blue-eyed boy next door who’d been in love with her little sister. Fate and good intentions from an old friend have placed her right in Rowdy’s path and she’s determined to show him he picked the wrong sister all those years ago. A mission that is going along perfectly until the one person that ties them together shows up and could very well tear them back.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;You can’t stop the future. &lt;br /&gt;You can’t rewind the past.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to learn the secret . . . is to press play.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a strange package with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker–his classmate and crush–who committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah’s voice tells him that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he’ll find out why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay spends the night crisscrossing his town with Hannah as his guide. He becomes a firsthand witness to Hannah’s pain, and as he follows Hannah’s recorded words throughout his town, what he discovers changes his life forever.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;A swashbuckling novel of political intrigue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the concluding installment of Alexandre Dumas's celebrated cycle of the Three Musketeers, D'Artagnan remains in the service of the corrupt King Louis XIV after the Three Musketeers have retired and gone their separate ways. Unbeknownst to D'Artagnan, Aramis and Porthos plot to remove the inept king and place the king's twin brother on the throne of France. Meanwhile, a twenty-three-year-old prisoner known only as "Philippe" wastes away deep inside the Bastille. Forced to wear an iron mask, Phillippe has been imprisoned for eight years, has no knowledge of his true identity, and has not been told what crime he's committed. When the destinies of the king and Phillippe converge, the Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan find themselves caught between conflicting loyalties.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A novel about the complicated world of a family in California over years to come, after the sudden death of the father.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening in 1962 with the fatal heart attack of forty-three-year-old Michael Gannon, a WWII veteran and former POW in the Pacific, SHINING SEA plunges into the turbulent lives of his widow and kids over subsequent decades, crisscrossing from the beaches of southern California to the Woodstock rock festival, London’s gritty nightlife in the eighties to Scotland’s remote Inner Hebrides islands, the dry heat of Arizona desert to the fertile farmland of Massachusetts. Beautifully rendered and profoundly moving, SHINING SEA by Anne Korkeakivi is a family story, about the ripple effects of war, the passing down of memory, and the power of the ideal of heroism to lead us astray but also to keep us afloat.</description>

  <description>The 50 classic rock and pop songs listed in this book are arguably some of the greatest of all-time. These tracks still sound good or "hold up" against today's popular music. The publication is intended to spark conversation and discussion. It is not a definitive list. Your opinions are welcome and encouraged. So get your stereo ready and listen while reading. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>In this innovative book, Emma Adbåge encourages children to get outside, where they can have fun interacting with the natural world while learning math. Adbåge has created twenty-two outdoor activities, organized by season. Through play, children will learn about numeracy and arithmetic, as well as math concepts such as shapes, time, greater/less than, even and odd numbers, patterns and grids. The activities have simple-to-follow instructions and are accompanied by adorable illustrations that provide clear visual demonstrations. The natural materials required --- stones, pinecones, snowballs, worms --- are easy to find in many environments. Supplementary spreads introduce the numbers 1 to 10 and further explore addition/subtraction and multiplication/division, with simplified explanations and illustrated examples. Studies have shown that learning outdoors helps kids retain information and skills, and that physically active children perform better in a variety of subjects --- including math. This book could be used alongside other math coursework all school year, since the activities have direct curricular applications. While the thrust of the book is math, there are also science lessons here, particularly regarding the properties of nature and how things change during the four seasons. Many of the activities can be done in pairs or groups, promoting teamwork and cooperation. A list of activities in the back matter indexes the activities and categorizes them by the math skills they develop.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Detective Wade Jackson is in for a shock when he’s summoned to the police chief’s office—his sergeant has been poisoned, and Jackson’s been tapped to lead the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before the Eugene Violent Crimes unit has a chance to respond, two people are gunned down at a licensed marijuana nursery. Jackson and his colleague Detective Lara Evans are on the case—but there are more suspects than evidence, and the crime is baffling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, more people are hospitalized, and when Evans discovers a link between the poisonings and edible pot, she and Jackson suspect that the product tampering and shootings are connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the task force investigates new leads, it’s clear that the detectives are on a dangerous trail, one that forces them to question everyone—even their own team. But they’ll have to uncover the truth fast…before the next victim falls prey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Every day, nine-year-old Yasmin borrows a book from Book Uncle, a retired teacher who has set up a free lending library next to her apartment building. But when the mayor tries to shut down the rickety bookstand, Yasmin has to take her nose out of her book and do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what can she do? The local elections are coming up but she’s just a kid. She can’t even vote!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, Yasmin has friends — her best friend, Reeni, and Anil, who even has a black belt in karate. And she has grownup family and neighbors who, no matter how preoccupied they are, care about what goes on in their community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Yasmin remembers a story that Book Uncle selected for her. It’s an old folktale about a flock of doves trapped in a hunter’s net. The birds realize that if they all flap their wings at the same time, they can lift the net and fly to safety, where they seek the help of a friendly mole who chews a hole in the net and sets them free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so the children get to work, launching a campaign to make sure the voices of the community are heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An energetic, funny and quirky story that explores the themes of community activism, friendship, and the love of books.</description>

  <description>It begins with a shocking act of vengeance. Barista Ethan Falk chases a customer into the parking lot and kills him. He tells police that years ago the older man abducted and tortured him. Then Ethan’s story takes an even stranger turn: he says he was rescued by a guy named Scorpion. Of course, there is no record of either the kidnapping or the rescue, because Scorpion—Jonathan Grave—operates outside the law and leaves no evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Grave struggles to find a way to defend his former precious cargo without blowing his cover, he learns the dead man has secrets that trace to an ongoing terrorist plot against the heart of America. It’s up to Grave and his team to stop it. But first they must rescue Ethan Falk—a second time.</description>

They are being generated by ruptures along cryptic, mysterious, deeply buried thrust faults (blind thrusts) that, unlike many faults, do not break the surface during large-scale seismic events. Somehow the cause of the unusual earthquakes must be unraveled and the cataclysms stopped before they result in more carnage and devastation. But are they the result of natural tectonic adjustments, hydro- fracking, conventional subsurface sequestering, or clandestine operations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental Geologist Joe Higheagle is on a mission to find out the answer. But he soon finds himself in a deadly duel of wits against powerful forces. With his team of techie sleuths, Higheagle goes toe to toe against his adversaries while grappling to collect, analyze, and leverage the scientific data needed to prove his case. But at every turn he is thwarted by his shadowy enemy and, with the cataclysms worsening, he may not have enough on his side to solve the mystery and save Colorado from more devastation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he solve the enigma of the earthquakes and gather enough evidence to stop those responsible? Will the tremors continue to wreak death and mayhem across the Front Range? Or will Higheagle and his outgunned team be defeated and ultimately crushed by their adversaries? If the earthquakes are not stopped, thousands more will perish and more towns and homes will be destroyed, leaving countless injured and homeless as well as untold financial damage across the Front Range. But can the resourceful Higheagle and his team stop those responsible? In the end, all they can do is try.</description>

When the motorcade pulls to the curb in Civic Center Plaza, a prominent leader steps from one of the vehicles and takes the stage to make an important speech. Moments later, a loud BOOM echoes through the Plaza and the man slumps to the platform like a stringless marionette. The mysterious sniper, whose very existence is unknown to the international law enforcement community, has just assassinated U.S. President-elect William Ambrose Kieger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aftermath of the shocking political crime, the shooter escapes and a Task Force is swiftly assembled, headed up by Special Agent Kenneth Patton of the FBI’s Denver Field Office. A ten year vet in Domestic Terrorism, the unconventional Ken is driven to solve the crime by both professional and personal motives. His search leads him to a secret society whose diabolical and far-reaching plot threatens the very highest levels of the U.S. government. Yet the group’s motives, secret membership, and ambitious plans remain elusive. Can Ken and his team uncover the plot in time to save the day? Can they beat the countdown on the clock and catch the assassin and the shadowy group in the background pulling the strings? Or will time run out?</description>

  <description>Sixteen year-old, Skyla Messenger is a dead girl walking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her newly remarried mother moves the family to Paragon Island, to a house that is rumored to be haunted, Skyla finds refuge in Logan Oliver, a boy who shares her unique ability to read minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Skyla discovers Logan holds the answers to the questions she’s been looking for, but Logan’s reluctance to give her the knowledge she desires leaves her believing Logan has a few secrets of his own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skyla’s bloodlines may just be connected to the most powerful angelic beings that roam the earth, and the more she knows, the more danger she seems to be in. Suddenly an entire faction of earthbound angels wants her dead, at least she still has Logan, or does she?</description>

  <description>Flaky PI Devlin Haskell continues making bad choices and ending up in the wrong bed. Now he's hired by Weldon Sofmann, a ruthless ice-cream entrepreneur known as Mr. Softee. But it seems Mr. Softee's empire might be made up of more than just ice-cream trucks. Dev finds the tables turned and suddenly he's painted himself into a corner with the police pointing the finger at him. Maybe it's time to get help from an old Army buddy, Tony 'Dog' Colli, but then again...&lt;br /&gt;There's the usual bullets, bombs, and mayhem. Throw in a gorgeous woman or two and you've got just your average week in St. Paul.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started when I saw myself dead...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Rose Gardner, working at the DMV on a Friday afternoon is bad even before she sees a vision of herself dead. She’s had plenty of visions, usually boring ones like someone’s toilet’s overflowed, but she’s never seen one of herself before. When her overbearing momma winds up murdered on her sofa instead, two things are certain: There isn’t enough hydrogen peroxide in the state of Arkansas to get that stain out, and Rose is the prime suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose realizes she’s wasted twenty-four years of living and makes a list on the back of a Wal-Mart receipt: twenty-eight things she wants to accomplish before her vision comes true. She’s well on her way with the help of her next door neighbor Joe, who has no trouble teaching Rose the rules of drinking, but won’t help with number fifteen– do more with a man. Joe’s new to town, but it doesn’t take a vision for Rose to realize he’s got plenty secrets of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody thinks Rose has something they want and they’ll do anything to get it. Her house is broken into, someone else she knows is murdered, and suddenly, dying a virgin in the Fenton County jail isn’t her biggest worry after all.</description>

  <description>Jessica had the nightmares for as long as she can remember. Nightmares of being judged by people who have died, of being branded by the angels. Her friends and family think she's crazy because of it all. Yet she carries the mark of the condemned, seared into the back of her neck, and hides it and herself away from the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when two men she can't ignore enter her life everything changes, including the nightmares. The two of them couldn't be more different. She will do anything to be with one of them. Even tell him the truth about angels, why she never sleeps, and the scar on the back of her neck. But one of the two has set events into motion that will pull her toward her own judgment and turn her into the object of her greatest fear.</description>

  <description>When Iola Anne Poole, an old-timer on Hatteras Island, passes away in her bed at ninety-one, the struggling young mother in her rental cottage, Tandi Jo Reese, finds herself charged with the task of cleaning out Iola's rambling Victorian house.Running from a messy, dangerous past, Tandi never expects to find more than a temporary hiding place within Iola's walls, but everything changes with the discovery of eighty-one carefully decorated prayer boxes, one for each year, spanning from Iola's youth to her last days. Hidden in the boxes is the story of a lifetime, written on random bits of paper--the hopes and wishes, fears and thoughts of an unassuming but complex woman passing through the seasons of an extraordinary, unsung life filled with journeys of faith, observations on love, and one final lesson that could change everything for Tandi.</description>

  <description>What would you sacrifice to learn the truth? When a deadly act of self defense brings college student Alex Bowen suspicious admiration, only a fit of rage can sooth her anger. But when her shattered mirror reveals a hidden room, she never suspects the two incidents could be linked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to discover the truth behind her spies, Alex finds herself cut off from family and friends and forced to make allies wherever she can find them, all while evading the people who've been spying. It isn't long before Alex questions everything she knows and what she thought coincidence, may be anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with her life and sanity on the line, Alex must resist her enemy's mind games if she wants to expose every dark secret. To succumb would result in her true identity being lost forever and countless others suffering the same fate. But to succeed, would shatter everything she knows.</description>

  <description>What are the things that you need most in life—the things you crave? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Solara longs for freedom. Having been raised under the Kingdom’s lock and key since the age of two, she wants to see the world. Upon turning seventeen and receiving no mark from the Lord, she believes freedom is finally within her grasp. Unfortunately, she is wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Kingdom has been fooled. She is marked by an angel of light and one of the fallen dark ones. Solara is God’s chosen, and with her birth, the new covenant made with mankind is made manifest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Solara also longs for love, strong enough to last a lifetime, and beyond. Riven loves her. But is one of the fallen prophesied to betray the chosen. Can she trust him? Love him? Prophesy states that she is the key. The fate of humanity rests with her decision. She alone will determine whether the doors of Heaven or the gates of Hell open upon the Earth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But how can a normal girl, who has been raised with no knowledge of either side, make such a decision? And how can she turn away from finally tasting those things she has craved for so long. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Four women who have never met ... &lt;br /&gt;Four lives inextricably joined ... &lt;br /&gt;Four friendships that will last forever ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Named after Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, Amelia Thompson always thought life would have given her wings. Instead, she finds herself stuck at home with three small children, and a body she no longer recognises. Hoping to connect with like-minded people, she decides to reach out on a women’s forum to try to find others with whom to start a blog. &lt;br /&gt;To her delight, she gets a response. Sara, a romance author whose elderly mother has just moved in with her. Kelly, whose husband only wants to spend time down the pub, and Charlotte, who is suffering from empty nest syndrome now her daughter has left home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in the medium of their blog posts and emails to each other, The Sound of Crickets is a touching novel of friendship in the digital age.</description>

  <description>Read about the goings-on in a busy shopping mall, that climax in murder in a department store. Is the scented vandalism connected with the murder? An ailing child, an incompetent boss, an ex-husband in mourning for his lost love, and a pushy boyfriend add to Marissa's problems, making a complex situation seem almost chaotic. In her search for answers, Marissa learns people aren't what they seem, particularly the dead woman.</description>

  <description>When hungry aliens begin their 'rain' of terror, break out the umbrellas--the aliens can't eat you with an umbrella shoved in their huge mouths.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Looking for yummy human tenders, Admiral Nact-bauk invades the local school. Zack and Zoey lead the counterattack armed with rulers, protractors, and dodge balls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They might have a chance, if Nact-bauk didn't gulp down the only teacher brave enough to stand up to him. Even worse, he forces Zoey onboard the alien vessel for dinner--along with a bucket of honey-mustard sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack will do just about anything to save her. If Principal Blathers won't help, Zack sees no choice but to 'borrow' the principal's car. Chasing the alien saucers, he meets up with a wrinkly WWII hero who thinks he knows the alien's weakness: electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wielding only umbrellas and battery-powered dental weapons, things look grim. Even if the pair manage to rescue Zoey, there's the small matter of escaping a spacecraft flying at over two hundred miles an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you say, Jetpacks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zack &amp;amp; Zoey's Alien Apocalypse is approximately 17,000 words (similar in length to Diary of a Wimpy Kid) and contains no cursing or strong language.</description>

  <description>***Warning Not suitable for anyone under 18!*** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She doesn't know why bad feels so good... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What seems like out of nowhere, Hope Zigler’s life has transformed: the normal Georgia life of an aspiring singer and student is now turned upside down when she moves away with her dad to Cherry California, and California is truly bizarre. Her heart tells her she can adjust, while her head begs for her old life back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suddenly she's a misfit in a town of rich snobs and cruel teens. After almost being killed at a rock concert, she's dying to find out more about the guy who saved her...is he trouble? Is Hope in over her head? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Slade Andrews, the tattooed bad boy and lead singer of the Evil Kings of Ink, is haunted by his past. When Hope moves to town, Slade is strangely drawn to her and determined to prove he is not the guy the town paints him to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a town full of lies, one secret could change everything. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Ink series: Your next book boyfriend!</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1630s two young girls fresh from England settle with their families in the Connecticut River Valley. There, on the frontier of a terrifying wilderness surrounded by warring natives, they must face the rigors of life among the Puritans -- a people steeped in superstition and piety. Based on the lives of Mary Bliss Parsons and Sarah Lyman Bridgeman and the men they loved, this fictional account of a true story transports us to a land founded on a dream, where life was uncertain, and where fear and jealousy would lead to ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Eve Carlisle had a singular purpose - sell the rustic house nestled in the Colorado ski resort town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tortured by her husband’s betrayal, the beautiful divorcee refused to give her heart to another man. But Jake had been a happy surprise, with his mesmerizing blue eyes, warm smile, strong but gentle nature – as well as being incredibly sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had convinced herself the relationship with Jake was nothing more than a fling. After all, she had a life in Newport, with society friends and a lucrative career as a family court judge. Still, Jake had a definitive hold over her, and she was finding it hard to think clearly where he was concerned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The demons of prior failed marriages haunt them both, and threaten to end things just as they are beginning. When Jake tells Eve he is falling in love with her, Eve refuses to believe it can last. Returning to Newport, the hollowness of her existence exposed, she must confront her fears before she loses Jake forever.</description>

  <description>Deadly Offerings is an ebook with a blend of pulsing passion and razor-sharp suspense. It is the first adventure in this sizzling romantic suspense trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Mason thinks she’ll be safe living in the Midwest building a wind farm. She may be dead wrong. Someone is dumping bodies in her corn field and telling Anne they are gifts—for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count rises, Anne realizes a cold-blooded serial killer is patiently waiting and watching her every move. And he won’t stop until he ends her life. It is clear there are no limits to this killer’s thirst for revenge or how far he will go to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a nasty divorce, Anne Mason does not want to get romantically involved, especially with ex-husband’s attorney, Michael Brandt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ruggedly handsome new County Prosecutor is the last person Anne can trust, but may offer her only chance at survival from a psychopathic killer. But will she survive the passion that rages between them?</description>

  <description>It's hard to figure out what normal is when you're surrounded by crazy, but Melissa Palmer never stops trying. Her mother's mental illness and her father's questionable business dealings are a cloud covering the New Jersey family in a shadow of secrecy. And all of it leaves a bigger mark on Melissa than she or her brother can admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Melissa is a child, her mom makes the first trip to the psych ward. The second trip comes when she’s a teen. Then Melissa’s first year away at college, her mom commits suicide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the darkness the light is always there to bring Melissa through, and that light is and always will be the same: love. As crazy as the family seems, they do love each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Melissa meets Chris in graduate school, she’s not sure if their love is enough to help her reconcile with the demons of the past. But she’s got to try if they are to have a future together. Besides, when it comes down to it, aren't we all a little messed up?</description>

  <description>Dreary, desolate, shrouded. And most unnerving of all, forbidden. Such was the bizarre circumstance surrounding the north wing of Rochester Manor, as Abigail was about to discover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late in the summer of 1887, shortly after her 19th birthday, Abigail Parker's life took an unforeseen turn. Although she wasn’t looking for love, it found her in the form of a handsome, wealthy stranger who swept her off her feet, and soon she would embark upon a journey filled with the promise of bliss. Exciting though it was, it was also daunting for her to enter into a lifestyle she was ill-equipped to handle. While this fact was evident, no one could have prepared her for the true challenge she was to face, and the staggering secret waiting to be unearthed in "The North Wing".</description>

  <description>1685. King Charles II dies unexpectedly, and is succeeded by his brother James II, England's first Catholic monarch since Bloody Mary. English Protestants feel threatened, and King Charles’s illegitimate son, the handsome young duke of Monmouth, rises against his uncle in armed rebellion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The rebellion turns young Ann Carter’s world upside down. Eighteen years old, she is betrothed to Tom Goodchild, a Protestant shoemaker; but secretly loves Robert Pole, an officer in King James’s army, who offers to take her to London as his mistress. Ann knows it is her duty to marry Tom, but does not love him; so when he marches away with the rebels, she imagines him being killed – which would set her free. But she knows such thoughts are wicked; her father is a rebel soldier too, like all the men of her village. So who should she pray for, when musket balls start to fly? What matters most – love or loyalty? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If God could see into my heart, she wonders, what would He tell me to do? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her father, Adam, is a brave man tormented by fear. He has two fears: first, that he may be a coward, and run from the enemy; and second, that he is not one of God’s Elect, and will go to Hell when he dies. But like all the men of Colyton, ‘England’s most rebellious town’, he marches to war, risking his life for what he believes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When England’s most notorious judge, Judge Jeffreys, is sent to punish the rebels, Ann and her father are faced with the hardest choices of all.</description>

  <description>If you love Shakespeare, you will enjoy Richard Revisited, an historical novel about King Richard III&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For centuries Richard III counted as the villainous murderer of his young cousins and usurper of his brother's throne. But how much of this reputation was born of the facts, and how much of political urgency of the Tudors? Within the frame of the recent discovery of the Richard III skeleton in Leicester, Richard Revisited offers a poignant image of three inquisitive minds caught up in an age-old struggle. The statesman Thomas More, Master of the Revels George Buc, and lastly Jennifer Simpson, witness in the Trial of Richard III broadcast in 1984. In their efforts to be true to themselves each risks either humiliation or loss of integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this controversial novel questions the sources Shakespeare used while writing his famous history-play about the last Plantagenet king. To what extent did the dramatist falsify the facts?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book the following questions will be raised:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- did Thomas More regret his Portrait of King Richard III?&lt;br /&gt;- who ordered the young princes to be murdered?&lt;br /&gt;- for what reason was Hastings executed?&lt;br /&gt;- did Richard's marriage to Ann Neville produce a son?&lt;br /&gt;- was Shakespeare careless or opportunistic?&lt;br /&gt;- and who was Shakespeare?</description>

  <description>Rebekah is not your ordinary pre-veterinary student: she's only seventeen years old, and she's Amish! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, Rebekah seems to be adjusting well to college life. She's dating Braeden, a sophomore hottie, and she's even getting along with her flighty, messy roommate Allie. But as Rebekah struggles with her demanding classes and the competitive atmosphere on campus, she realizes that there is something missing from her college experience: the beautiful Amish faith that she grew up with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebekah visits her Amish community, where she is pressured by her family and the church elders to rejoin the Amish faith. She faces gut-wrenching questions: Can she bring her faith to college life, or must she return to live among the Amish? Can she find a way to excel academically, or will freshman biology and chemistry steal away her dreams? And is there a place for Braeden in her life, or must she leave her love behind to be true to her faith?</description>

  <description>One summer. One cabin on a lake. Four thirtysomething sisters. Anything can and does happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine spending an entire summer in a cabin on a lake - simply because you can. That’s exactly what Samantha McGreggor, a thirtysomething eco-journalist, does in SUMMER OF FIREFLY MEMORIES. She trades Arizona’s summer heat for Minnesota’s cool lake breezes by spending her summer at the same resort her family used to go to when she was young. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her summer agenda - relaxation, beach reads, soul-searching, bonding with her three grown sisters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her concerns - she and her sisters haven’t been back to the resort since their parents’ death twenty years ago when they were all practically teenagers, and, well, they tend to act like emotional teenagers when they’re all together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her summer reality – fun in the sun, secrets, sibling rivalries, lost memories, new love, hope. If you enjoy feeling nostalgic any time of the year, then you'll enjoy SUMMER OF FIREFLY MEMORIES! Come dive in!</description>

  <description>Sahily, in all of her mysterious Spanish beauty and seeming-desire to be with him, remains out of reach. He is an author struggling to raise his two children and pay his bills and still somehow find a way to meet the challenge of all the greats who have come before him.&lt;br /&gt;By night the living voices of dead writers mock him. There is Bukowski and Nin, but most of all there is Papa. The great Ernest Hemingway, a proud heavyweight who parades in his golden championship belt, telling us that it will never, ever be taken.&lt;br /&gt;A work of romance without falsity and literature without pretension. It is heart-wrenching and passionate, dangerous and defiant, and will leave readers with a sense of both loss and victory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Girl From Tenerife is exquisitely written and deeply moving.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Wanted: nanny. Needed: wife.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laurent Fletcher has to admit his life would be a whole heap better if there was woman in it. His kids are running wild, and his dog is acting crazy; he’s been finding it tough to juggle everything since his wife died, and run his successful custom-built furniture business. But maybe there is a solution that won’t demand any emotional input from him: hire a female to whip his turbulent household back into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Peabody is a British nanny, looking for a new life in the New World. When she arrives at River Bend and finds two small motherless children, a miserable pet and a man who’s placed his emotions in the deep-freeze, she realizes she’s joined a broken family and it will be down to her to put it back together again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids and the dog are easy—all they need are routines and love. Their father is something else. Laurent isn't about to drop his guard and let Emma work her magic—and it doesn’t help that she finds this dark, brooding man incredibly attractive…</description>

  <description>How does a girl become a witch? By accident, of course! &lt;br /&gt;Leigh Epstein is a grief stricken and lonely elementary school teacher that is devastated by the brutal and unexpected death of her true love at the hands of a careless writer.

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I’d pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring… until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something… unexpected happens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon’s touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I’m getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don’t kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>Detective Matthew Longo is a police detective for the small town of Hutchville, NY. As the first page unfolds, Matthew has been shot on duty. His assailant is on the run. While recuperating, Matthew experiences haunting dreams of death he observed earlier in his career as a cop. These dreams are vivid, appear to be real, and are not like anything you have read before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Matthew's partner, Detective Donny Mello is in Italy attending a funeral for his grandfather. It is a death not met by natural causes but by an assassin's bullet. Donny's grandfather was the head of a mafia family. His past caught up to him in the most lethal way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Hutchville, things get worse for Matthew with the arrival of a beautiful FBI agent. She is seeking Donny Mello for questioning. Matthew is unaware of the agent's intentions but believes it has something to do with a secret he is holding deep within himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Matthew keep from answering the agent's questions? Will Donny return to help find the person responsible for shooting his partner? You will have to read, &lt;i&gt;In A Small Town&lt;/i&gt; to find out.</description>

  <description>Annie's People Book 1- A new series from The New York Times bestselling author of the ABRAM'S DAUGHTERS series! The Preacher's Daughter begins a remarkable journey of heartache and homespun delight--a series readers will find impossible to forget. Paradise, Pennsylvania, is likened to a little slice of heaven on earth...but for Annie Zook--the preacher's eldest daughter--it seems like a dead-end street. She is expected to join the Amish church, but at 20 she is "still deciding." Because of the strict rules that guide the Plain community, she must continually squelch her artistic passion, although it has become her solace. In her signature style, with character depth and unexpected plot twists, beloved novelist Beverly Lewis once again opens the door to the world of the Amish.</description>

Along with her dad and sister Lizzy, Winnie is learning how to live without her mom -- who was also a natural horse gentler. As Winnie teaches her horses about unconditional love and blind trust, God shows Winnie that He can be trusted as well. Readers will be hooked by the series' vivid cast of characters whose quirky personalities fill Winnie's life with friendship and adventure.</description>

  <description>Having been drawn to the wild for a number of years, young Luke McKinney is forced to leave 1839 St. Louis for the North Country even sooner than he expected to go. At seventeen, along with a female companion and an elderly father figure, he is literally running for his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the law pursuing him and the wilderness unforgiving, he finds himself caught up in a survival system that has nothing to do with civilization or laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the unthinkable happens, the love of his life is taken from him. It is during the pursuit of her captors that Luke finds a strength and determination that will shape his moral existence for the remainder of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a trilogy of books that spans the lives of Luke McKinney and Breanne Bruyere, their undying love, through hell and high water, for over fifty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daring, thrilling, romantic, historic... What else is there? UNFORGETABLE!</description>

Discover The Secrets and Benefits of The Atkins diet  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; **SPECIAL PRICE**, get this Amazon Guide for just $0.99. Regularly priced &lt;br /&gt;at $4.99. Read on your PC, Mac, smart phone, tablet or Kindle device.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Atkins diet was suggested by Dr. Atkins, a cardiologist, who devised this diet to help people get rid of their extra fats by utilizing fats in energy processes instead of carbohydrates. Dr. Atkins published a book titled as ‘Dr. Atkins’ new diet revolution’. The key point that was addressed by Dr. Atkins in his book was to increase the use of fats as body processes carbs more as compared to the lipids. &lt;br /&gt;Atkins diet is a low carbs and a high protein diet that causes the body to use lipids or fats instead of carbs to make energy for the body. It involves sating bye to junk, processed and packed food and welcoming the natural foods including fish, cheese and steaks. This weight loss diet is gaining popularity and has become a fad owing to the debates happening on its benefits and hazards. &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Atkins explained in his book about the working of Atkins diet. He described that if your body gets a less than 40 grams of carbs a day, it will start the process of ketosis. Ketosis is the process where metabolic processes shift to fats to produce energy instead of carbohydrates. It influences the insulin production by the body and prevents piling of more and more fats. In absence of carbs, fats become the main fuel of body &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This book Consists of Simple Chapters  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
