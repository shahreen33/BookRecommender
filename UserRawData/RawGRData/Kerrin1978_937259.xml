  <description>No one is more surprised than Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara when he answers his doorbell one night to see members of Salem’s Wiccan community standing on his doorstep with an unbelievable story to tell. According to them, members of their coven are being murdered in a modern-day witch hunt and they want Ronan to look into the matter for them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm is skeptical of the witches’ claims. After the initial investigation turns up ordinary deaths in car accidents, house fires, and by suicide, Ten feels that the witches’ suspicions, are just that: suspicions. His sixth sense is not giving him any clues that these are anything but untimely and tragic deaths. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When another witch dies mysteriously, Ronan turns up the heat on the Salem Police Department to investigate and finds himself in an unusual position: in hot water with Fitzgibbon and his husband. Suspended from the Boston Police Department and abandoned by his family and friends, Ronan goes rogue, conducting the investigation on his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Uncovering an insidious plot with roots reaching back to the Salem Witch Trials, Ronan must battle a force so evil, it has managed to stay hidden for centuries. Without the power of his badge or the backing of Tennyson, does Ronan have the strength to survive something that hunts in the dead of night? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Keller Peters lives to piss off his uppity mother. What could the woman expect who judges people by their careers instead of their heart? It's one thing for her to criticize his career as a life couch to those trying to get off drugs and be productive citizens in the world. He could handle her. He'd been doing it his whole life, but her constant rudeness where his best friend and roommate is concerned is about to send him over the edge, especially since Webber Bines is the best person he knows. What better way is there to make the woman straight climb the wall with her head on backwards and hissing, than to bring home his new "boyfriend" who also happens to be the roommate who works "mall security and has that hobby with the heavy weights." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Webber Bines knows posing as his best friend and roommates boyfriend for Thanksgiving is probably a terrible idea, but he's never succeeded in telling Keller no since the day he met him, so it comes as no surprise to find himself at Keller's parent's home over Thanksgiving. It is, however, very surprising to find himself the recipient of a long, dirty kiss on the couch in the middle of the living room. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That one kiss changes everything for the two as feelings they were both denying come screaming to the surface, demanding to be acknowledged. They keep telling themselves they are going to keep their hands to themselves, but that's a lot harder said than done, and things aren't helped when Keller decides to pull the fake boyfriend gig back out in order to scare off a man who seems hell bent on ruining Webber's family Christmas… because that is what friends are for. Not because he's dying to be Webber's boyfriend again, even if it is only fake. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Webber is Book 8 in the Training Days series about men finding love in and out of the gym.</description>

  <description>A Cold Case Psychic Spin off Novella&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Museum curator, Harrison Kirkpatrick, has been fascinated by the American Revolution since childhood, but never in his wildest dreams did he ever imagine falling in love from afar with a soldier who fought for America’s freedom. Through a series of events too wild to be believed, Harrison is thrown back in time to 1775, mere days before the Battle of Bunker Hill, finding himself at the business end of a musket held by the very man he has been pining for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Massachusetts Militiaman, Gannon Chalmers, does not know what to make of the strange man he finds wandering around Bunker Hill days before his unit is to engage the British Redcoats. Is this man friend or foe? What he does know is that there is an undeniable attraction growing between them that he must resist at all costs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the battle draws closer, so do Gannon and Harrison. Can they deny the passion threatening to explode between them like a powder keg? Or will Gannon’s abundance of caution keep him from giving in to the one man who could lay claim to his heart? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the brink of a war that will change the history of the world, the pair must decide what price they are willing to pay for freedom, and how much they are willing to sacrifice for love. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Detective, Ronan O’Mara, has set sail on the honeymoon of his dreams to sunny Bermuda. He’s looking forward to a week of fun in the sun with his husband, Tennyson, but nothing is going as planned. From a fight between Truman and Carson that’s threatening to break up their marriage, to Captain Fitzgibbon’s on-again, off-again lover not showing up to meet the ship, to dealing with his always challenging mother-in-law, to frenemy, Jude Byrne, showing up with a suitcase loaded with sex toys and lube, Ronan has all he can do to stay sane. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm, is on the ship to work as well as honeymoon. The cruise ship line has hired him to be the “celebrity” on their celebrity cruise. In between private and group readings reuniting family members with those who have crossed over, Ten is running himself ragged attempting to put the pieces of Truman and Carson’s marriage back together and trying to keep Jude from horn-dogging after the ship’s captain, all while trying to squeeze in a few stolen, passionate moments with his husband. He isn’t having much luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During the return trip to Boston, Ronan and Tennyson are enjoying a performance of Murder Mystery Night staged by the ship’s crew. When the crewmember playing the murder victim turns up dead for real, Ronan and Tennyson must set “fun in the sun” aside when the ship’s captain allows them to investigate the crime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Putting the clues together, the Boston detectives corner the cagey killer who takes someone close to them hostage. Can Tennyson and Ronan save the day before they end up dead in the water? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Detective and newlywed, Ronan O’Mara, is sitting on top of the world. When he returns to work after his honeymoon, he finds more waiting for him than a stack of dusty cold case files. Hidden in the mail on Ronan’s desk is a letter from Tank Hutchins, aka The Riverside Ripper. Convicted of murdering a woman three years ago, Tank claims he is innocent and asks Ronan and Tennyson for their help in proving who really committed the crime: his twin brother, Tim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic, Tennyson Grimm, is reluctant to meet with the convicted murderer who’s placed his faith in Ten’s gift. When Tennyson realizes Tank is innocent of the crime for which he’s serving twenty-five to life, he knows that he and Ronan have to do whatever it takes to set things right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together with Tank’s private investigator, the mysterious Jude Byrne, Ronan and Tennyson retrace the steps of the original investigation hoping to find the one piece of evidence that will get Tank’s conviction overturned and bring the real killer to light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When new evidence leads them to believe there’s a larger conspiracy at play, will Tennyson and Ronan be able to find the killer before he returns to complete his diabolical plan?</description>

  <description>After moving from Denali, Alaska, to San Francisco in order to get over a failed crush and try his hand at dating new people, Josh Little hosts a big poker night for the Marians and his co-workers at the National Park Service. Little does he know, that his own true love may not be someone new after all. Could it be that The One That Got Away is finally back for good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been eight long years since Cyrus Dimakos had to leave the love of his life to take care of his great-grandmother on a remote island in Greece. A family obligation may have kept his body away from Josh all this time, but his heart never left him. Despite having broken things off with Josh shortly after leaving him, Cyrus hopes it’s not too late to convince Josh to give him a second chance at forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10,000 word short. Josh’s story takes place after A Very Marian Christmas and can be considered Made Marian 7.5.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Hollydale, a magical town where things aren’t always as they appear.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hollydale Omegas&lt;/b&gt; is a sweet, feel good series about finding love in a small town… with a little supernatural help. This is a non-shifter, contemporary mpreg series. From elves and ghosts, to cupid and leprechauns—this series stole your heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You fell in love with this crazy town starting with Rafe and Milo’s story in Pumpkin Spiced Omega and over thirteen books. Now it’s time to revisit our favorite town and see how they’re doing today. This is NOT a full length book! This is 11k of brand-new bonus material that was written for the bundled version. I’ve made these extra scenes available in this edition for the readers who already own the complete series but also want to add the new epilogues to their collection. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: there will be red balls appearing in odd locations, Tom freaking out about turning forty, and two of our favorite supernatural hotties having a dance-off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is not a new book in the series, but it is new material!&lt;/b&gt; This is a compilation of the four epilogues that were included in the second bundled version of the series. These bonus stories show what happened in the years after the original stories ended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;These are bonus shorts for the &lt;b&gt;Hollydale&lt;/b&gt; series, and should only be read after finishing the entire series. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a bunch of snort-laughs and a good helping of cuteness. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>West is a pest and Gabriel is cold and uncaring. Gabriel doesn't think West can give him what he wants in life, and West doesn't think someone as standoffish as Gabriel could ever want the things that he wants. It's funny what a little communication can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel Todd&lt;br /&gt;I'm a tough, no-nonsense chief of police of Purdy Nebraska. With all the craziness in my town, I don't have time for wild, snarky FBI agents who happened to have perfect skin, a beautifully chiseled face, and a gorgeous body. The truth is, I'm looking to settle down, and all that could come from riding this wave of attraction for the annoying, sometimes funny FBI agent is a one-night stand or a fling at the most. There is no way this twenty-something human is ready to settle down and mate. Unfortunately, I can't seem to stay away. I have no idea why I need to be in his presence all the time… until I taste him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Dyer&lt;br /&gt;Seeing all the mated couples around me and the new babies, I'm starting to get a little bit of the family fever. I want the type of happiness that I see when I look at my friends and their mates, but the one man who makes me feel like the world is tipping on its side, is a standoffish, cold tiger shifter, who can barely stand people, much less someone like me. But when I do something… A little naughty, who do you think is right there all up in my business? And how the hell did one night, a kidnapping, and a case of poisoning, change everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;AJ:&lt;/b&gt; I know Dante’s story better than anyone. After all, I was the one who rescued him from his homophobic, abusive father eight years ago. Since then, I’ve kept my distance, but when I run into him at the Marian House gala and he doesn’t recognize me, I can’t resist the incredible, sensitive man he’s become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would do anything to protect Dante Marian, but what if his past keeps me from being part of his future?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dante:&lt;/b&gt; Every new relationship has obstacles, it just turns out that ours involves my bumbling inexperience (ugh), an octogenarian naughty toy party (don’t ask), and being on the run in an RV with Aunt Tilly (it involves the Secret Service— no really, don’t ask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my biological father takes his homophobic views on a national platform, the only way to stand up for what I believe in is to claim my past and confront him. So now it’s time to decide: do I put the past behind me and walk away from AJ for good or face my biggest fear and fight for what’s mine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fair warning: Dante and AJ’s story contains frequent detailed scenes of man parts touching, little old ladies being inappropriate (this time with, ah, props), and two hearts finding their HEA when they least expect it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it can also be read on its own, Delivering Dante is the sixth in the Made Marian series. Each book tells the story of one of the Marian brothers' search for true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trigger Warning: Delivering Dante includes references to domestic violence and conversion therapy.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening Length: 7 hours and 30 minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude: Reaching the top of the country music charts brings out the crazy, and there’s no one crazier than my ex. Unfortunately, his threats to out me are escalating. Enter the bodyguard of my dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d probably chafe under his constant presence if his attention to my body wasn’t so… ah… thorough. Now I have to worry about outing myself to millions of fans if I can’t keep my hands off him in public. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Derek: Now I’m an ex-Marine turned babysitter. If I have to hear Jude sing his mega-hit Bluebells one more time, I might murder him myself, and after 6 years in special ops, I know my way around a weapon. Unfortunately, so does he. Except his arsenal includes washboard abs and a killer set of pipes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve faced guns, knives, explosives and yet it’s Jude Marian who may end up bringing me to my knees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Jude and Derek's story contains frequent detailed scenes of man parts touching, little old ladies being inappropriate, and two lonely hearts coming together in perfect harmony. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While it can also be read on its own, Jumping Jude is the third in the Made Marian series. Each book tells the story of one of the Marian brothers' search for true love. The first in the series, Borrowing Blue, is available now on Amazon.</description>

  <description>Former Army Ranger turned government assassin Álvaro Montero and CIA Officer Caiden Cardosa crossed paths two years ago in Vienna, where their encounter ended less than amicably—despite the explosive sexual chemistry between them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now Caiden is riding a desk at Langley after his cover is blown. And Álvaro—who was “killed”—has a new identity and purpose as Delta/D, an operative for the Locke and Keyes Agency, under the leadership of the mysterious Alpha Orion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When D and Caiden team up in a deadly black ops mission, the urge to kill each other will have to take a back seat to the desire for revenge against the man who betrayed them both. Surviving the mission won’t be easy. Resisting the passion between them—that might be impossible. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Wellston is in love with his father's best friend, but to save his heart, he tries to avoid the man who only sees him as the kid he used to know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wilder came back home after eight years to find that the kid he used to know was gone and in his place was a gorgeous man with no sign of the shy child he remembered. Two years have passed since that reunion, and he is no less enamored by the twenty-two-year-old and endlessly drawn in by the need to rile the messy, but somewhat uptight young man. He knows he needs to step back. How the hell would pursuing something with Wellston even work? How would he ever face his best friend?</description>

  <description>Mitchell is an alpha among alphas in the brutal Mountain Ridge Pack. He rules with equal parts fear and respect, but his pack is growing restless after decades without an heir to his proverbial throne. Only an alpha and an omega pair can sire another alpha to lead the pack, but Mitchell's not-so-secret shame is the fact that he hasn't been able to impregnate any of his female omegas. &lt;p&gt;Unlike the other weaker packs, the Mountain Ridge wolves have always kept their omegas in line and at a safe distance through the infamous yet efficient Breeding Program. On the recommendation of an old rival turned tentative friend, Mitchell decides to try his hand--among other things--in a last-ditch effort at siring an heir with a rare male omega. When a transfer request for one of the only male omegas in the pack uncovers unspeakable abuse and corruption within the Breeding Program, the very future of the pack is thrown into question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angel's heart has turned to stone after a lifetime of abuse at the hands of the alpha shifters who oversee the Breeding Program in his pack unit. The only love he has left belongs to the three other omegas he shares his little corner of hell with. Angel will do whatever it takes to protect them, even if it means becoming the mate of the top alpha himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angel knows better than to believe the gruff Mitchell when he claims that he's not like the others. Despite his best attempts to steel himself against the strange bond that forms between them, Angel discovers that Mitchell is the most dangerous alpha of all because he wants the one thing Angel has sworn never to give--his heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With war looming on the horizon, a pack in chaos and two hardened hearts melted by an unlikely spark of love, only one outcome is certain. The Mountain Ridge Pack will never be the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: See inside cover for content warnings. This is the second book in The Mountain Shifters series. Reading His Unclaimed Omega may provide context, but this book can be read as a standalone.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Watching his across the street neighbor as he goes about his life has been one fo Boyce's favorite pass-times for several months. There is just something about the man that draws his attention even before he meets the man. Imaging how surprised he is when the object of this small obsession asks him for help. Not only does he jump in feet first, so does his dog. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wynn is pretty sure asking Boyce, his ridiculously hot neighbor with the delicious body and the gorgeous dog to help him with updating his security and monitoring system at the daycare was the smartest thing he'd ever done, especially when it leads to a friendship he didn't see coming. He knows that Boyce is aware of shifters and that he used to work for the immortal division of the FBI, so he's not at all surprised by the fact that the man wears a scent blocking bracelet. But he IS shocked when he ISN'T wearing it. Like, how could he have missed what was right under his nose shocked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finding your mate is the easy part. What do you do when life pulls you in every direction, but you would rather stay right where you are?</description>

  <description>When the idyllic Silver Lake pack is struck by tragedy, young omega Cameron wants nothing more than to use his healing abilities to restore peace to his home -- and his alpha. Can he convince Barnabas of what his heart has always known before he's given to another alpha? &lt;p&gt;Barnabas is a one-man kind of alpha and when his beloved mate and omega is taken from him, he's left an empty shell. Cameron's gentle strength and unfailing devotion might be what it takes to save him, but Barnabas sees claiming another omega as an act of treachery. Despite his best intentions, Barnabas' instincts as an alpha without an heir are pulling him in the direction of the young unmated omega he's sworn to protect and find a mate of his own. Giving Cameron to the alpha of a neighboring Council pack is the only way he can do right by the orphaned omega and keep the vow he made to his fallen mate so long ago, but can Barnabas' heart withstand the pain of losing yet another omega he loves? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the elder of the Council makes a shocking decision about Cameron's destiny, the Silver Lake pack is thrown into chaos. Cameron is getting what he's always wanted, but he soon learns that being claimed by his alpha in name only is a worse fate than being held at arm's length. Only time will tell if Barnabas can shed the heavy weight of his guilt to claim the omega who belongs to him, or whether his pain will be exploited by the brutal Mountain Ridge pack that has designs on Silver Lake territory -- and its unique omega. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grief, love and passion combine to give Cameron a crash course on what it means to be an omega. Luckily the young wolf understands better than anyone that love heals wounds that even time can't touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Psychic Tennyson Grimm was kicked out of his house and disowned by his religious parents when he came out to them as gay and psychic. The last thing Tennyson’s father said before the teenager boarded a Greyhound bus to Boston was that his son was dead to him. Flash forward thirteen years later, Tennyson couldn’t have been more surprised when he woke to find the newly dead spirit of his father sitting on the end of his bed. David Grimm had one request of his estranged son. Go to Kansas and reunite with his mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold Case Detective Ronan O’Mara was all for this family reunion. Still recovering from injuries suffered during his last criminal investigation, he figures they’ll fly to Kansas, bury Tennyson’s father, and the hatchet with Kaye Grimm, then come back to Boston in time to plan their upcoming wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Union Chapel Sheriff comes to Tennyson and Ronan with a years-old cold case he’d like them to look into, the Boston-based duo can’t turn down taking a peek at the case file. Tennyson is easily able to figure out whodunit, but the sheriff is leery to believe in his gift, bringing old prejudices back to life, and leaving Ronan to hunt for physical evidence the killer left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ronan be able to solve the cold case and help Tennyson resolve the decade-old feud with his mother? Or will the tornado, with its sights set on the tiny town of Union Chapel, Kansas, make the other questions moot?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Do you remember what you promised?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maverick: I haven't been back to Rabbit Island, South Carolina, since my parents died and my grandmother, Mimi, rejected me. I'm only returning now to attend her funeral and sell an estate I never wanted. But the moment I step foot on the island and fall into Beau’s arms, I realize it might not be so easy to say goodbye after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau Talmadge was always the boy next door, but now he’s no longer a kid. The man is hot as hell and pushes all my buttons in the very best way. I'm supposed to leave in a week. Sell everything, close the door on my past, and walk away forever. So why am I letting myself fall for someone who lives thousands of miles away? And how the hell am I going to break it off when it's time to go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“That I’d come back.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau: It took one short summer to fall in love with Maverick Mitchell and fifteen long years to forget him when he left. I’d never expected to see him again, but when he shows up at Mimi’s funeral looking lost and lonely I can’t resist doing anything I can to comfort him. Falling into bed with Maverick is easy and the nights we spend together are as hot and steamy as a South Carolina thunderstorm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it's not smart. I know it's not what he planned. But dammit, Mav belongs in my arms, in my bed, and in my life. So how the hell do I get him to stay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;”Took you long enough.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Moving Maverick is a 73k word gay romance novel featuring sweet tea vodka, fancy salt and pepper shakers, guys catching crabs (not that kind), Aunt Tilly with a knife, and multiple detailed instances of man parts touching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving Maverick is the fifth book in the best-selling Made Marian series. It can be read on its own but is much more fun read as part of the series.</description>

  <description>When Kennedy, the gorgeous actor Recker has been obsessed with for several months gets into a tussle on the news, his chosen mark is exposed to the world. Only a few will understand what the mark means, but those few could be dangerous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recker gets hired on as Kennedy's new bodyguard, replacing the idiots who nearly got him injured in the first place, and confirms what he'd been starting to believe... Kennedy is his mate. But how do you introduce someone who lives their life in the spotlight to shifters and... everything else?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cody Evans has spent the past six years hidden from the world. Held by a shifter trafficking ring, he’s been forced to serve any man who paid the right price for a submissive omega. Now, the unthinkable has happened: Cody is pregnant. Desperate to save the life inside him but with only a hint of possible help, he sneaks a phone and places a call to the help number he’d held in his head in case he ever got near a phone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the moment Levi Thurman scented the pregnant, emotionally broken omega, he had no doubt: Cody was his mate. He knows the young man will need time to uncover the dark secrets of his past so that he can heal, but they’re both shocked when Levi’s secret is revealed first: his soft, lacy, satin covered secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What surprises them even more is Cody’s need to be in charge… and Levi’s pleasure in obeying his commands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even as Cody unveils Levi’s softer side and Levi strengthens Cody’s belief in himself, the evil of Cody’s past haunts him—and when it comes to protecting his omega, Levi is all alpha, and there’s no way the men who hurt them can escape his justice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the second book in this exciting series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and occasional violence. Be prepared for sexy manties and an omega with a need for control. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trigger warnings: graphic violence, attempted rape, mention of past sexual trauma&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listening Length:&lt;/b&gt; 5 hours and 13 minutes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Preston Tierney, the omega son of a prominent senator, has been taken by a secret group with an ax to grind. Party boy Preston was just out looking for a good time until he was grabbed—plucked right from a party in the middle of a crowd. When he wakes up, he finds himself caged like an animal in a remote cabin far from home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah Perkins is a strong alpha who leads his unit with a strong hand—and a great sense of humor. The last thing he expected when he went to free the sassy little thing in the cage was to scent his own fated mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah and his crazy crew must free Preston from captivity—from his kidnappers, and again from a source much closer to home than they would’ve imagined—while Noah tries to figure out how to tame his bristly omega and truly embrace the team’s motto: Accept, Love, Protect, Honor—Always. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first in a new series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. No jackals were harmed in the writing of this book—unless they kinda deserved it. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An MM Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;Listening Length: 3 hours and 26 minutes</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Take one pregnant omega who’s all alone in the world…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After accidentally getting pregnant by his best friend and occasional hookup buddy, Owen Grant finds himself on his own… again. After being abandoned at birth and growing up in the foster system, he’s used to having to say goodbye. If he's learned one lesson in life, it's this: people don't stay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Add in one alpha who just won’t leave…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Austin Logan is a quirky alpha who’s accepted that he’ll never marry and have a family of his own. His focus is on being the favorite uncle to all of his brothers' kids. He’s happy with the well-maintained and structured routine of his life, and doesn’t need anything more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mix in one fake marriage of convenience…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meeting Owen shakes things up in Austin’s world. He has to beg and barter with the guy to convince him to accept his help, even going so far as to sign a prenup that absolves Owen of any rights to Austin’s wealth, just to get him to agree to a fake marriage that will provide him with the medical insurance he so desperately needs for himself and his unborn child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And remember not to fall in love with your fake groom!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when your fake husband turns out to be an awesome dad to your child and doesn’t seem in any hurry to let you go? And what if you slowly find yourself falling for the stranger you married? You sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the final book in the Lone Star Brothers series. This mm book contains mpreg, and is intended for 18+ readers. This 60k novel is a slow-burn strangers to friends to lovers romance with all the feels you’re used to from Susi Hawke, and definitely includes an HEA and all the laughs, naughty-knotty times, and family fun you’d expect!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What do you get when you cross a cursed bookshop, three hot fictional men, and a punk rock heroine nursing a broken heart?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After being fired from her fashion internship in New York City, Mina Wilde decides it's time to reevaluate her life. She returns to the quaint English village where she grew up to take a job at the local bookshop, hoping that being surrounded by great literature will help her heal from a devastating blow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But Mina soon discovers her life is stranger than fiction - a mysterious curse on the bookshop brings fictional characters to life in lust-worthy bodies. Mina finds herself babysitting Poe's raven, making hot dogs for Heathcliff, and getting IT help from James Moriarty, all while trying not to fall for the three broken men who should only exist within her imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Mina's ex-best friend shows up dead with a knife in her back, she's the chief suspect. She'll have to solve the murder if she wants to clear her name. Will her fictional boyfriends be able to keep her out of prison?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Nevermore Bookshop Mysteries are what you get when all your book boyfriends come to life. Join a brooding antihero, a master criminal, a cheeky raven, and a heroine with a big heart (and an even bigger book collection) in this brand new steamy reverse harem paranormal mystery series by &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Steffanie Holmes.</description>

  <description>Length: 6 hrs and 57 mins &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy: If there’s one thing I don’t do, it’s commitment. You don’t become an award-winning photographer by staying in one place. I’m always on the road, looking for the next shot, the next award, the next hot guy to take to my bed. Which is how I end up on Dr. James Marian’s front porch in the middle-of-nowhere Alaska. He’s known as the Wildlife Whisperer, and I want to photograph him in action. He’s reluctant at first, but I can be persuasive and soon enough I have him in bed saying yes over and over and over again. Think of it as one of the perks of the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie: I always thought of myself as the marrying type. Then I got left at the altar. Now I have a new motto: never commit and never fall in love. So when a cocky nature photographer decides I’m the key to his next masterpiece, it seems like the perfect arrangement: he’s only in town for a brief assignment and then he’ll be gone. No commitment, no strings, and no chance of getting my heart broken again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem: I think I’m falling in love. Now I’m afraid that maybe I’m the marrying type after all. And he definitely is not.</description>

  <description>Wright can't help it if he's holding a grudge. These are the annoyances people have to put up with when they basically run you off on the very day you were about to confess your love and then proceed to pop up every offing where!</description>

  <description>Naughty brat needs a strong guiding hand. Must love dogs. Reply ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toby Andrews is a busy, forgetful, scatterbrained musician with ADHD, a precocious dog named Ruffles, and a bad rep for partying too hard. When Toby's actions put an all-important contract with a large label in jeopardy, his manager sarcastically suggests the omega needs a keeper who'll redden his bottom if he steps out of line. Toby is intrigued, so when he sees an ad for a discreet company called Rent-a-Dom while scrolling his social media page, he impulsively sends a request for a Daddy Dom to help him stay on track. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thorne Barrett is a jaded, worn-out daddy of a dom who has no desire to babysit some naughty, out-of-control celebrity brat. The alpha reluctantly takes the job, promising himself he'll find new employment when the contract is over. He doesn't know what his next step might be, but whatever it is, he hopes it will leave him stable enough so he can settle down and think about having a family of his own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither man is precisely what the other expected. Once Thorne gets his naughty "boy" settled into a routine, Toby begins to blossom and find better ways to focus...and most importantly, stay of out trouble with the paparazzi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between band issues, a crazed stalker, an unexpected pregnancy, and a 30-day cross-country tour, Toby has a lot on his plate. Can he find stability for himself and Ruffles with Daddy Thorne? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This MM audiobook contains Mpreg, D/S elements, and is intended for 18-plus listeners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Don't listen unless you like fun stories with feisty Chihuahuas, naughty boys who really want to be good, hot daddy alphas, a story that will keep you in stitches, and steam-filled passion. But then again, this is a Susi Hawke and Piper Scott collaboration - you already knew to expect that, didn't you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening Length: 4 hours and 18 minutes.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watch out for the Assassin’s Claws…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clay Moreno is a paid killer, just like his four brothers. It’s the family business—they fight together, they die together. Whether they’re working as a group or alone, they are a tight unit who protect their own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clay drew the short straw on their latest mission: assassinate the American president. He knew the case was going to be tough, but the last thing he expected to find was his mate… the president’s own son. The fact that he began the case with plans to seduce his way into the White House via that same son is beside the point. What his mate doesn’t know shouldn’t hurt him… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nick Jackson is lonely and ordinary in a family of overachievers. He doesn’t want to do photo ops for the press, prep for the next year’s tests over the summer or any of the hundreds of other things his mother hassles him about. All he wants is to relax after his first year of college, work on his tan… and maybe find a boy to flirt with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first in a new series of short reads. Note: While mpreg exists in this world, we won’t have a birth in every book. This book contains killer cats, ninja bunnies and a life-changing mating bite. Get ready for naughty-knotty fun and low-ball humor as only Susi Hawke can provide.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 9 hours and 38 minutes.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Austin Michaels didn’t think life could get any better after he was accepted into the most notorious narcotics task force on the East Coast, headed up by two of the baddest’ Lieutenants with the Atlanta Police Department - Cashel Godfrey and Leonidis Day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michaels knew he would fit right in as the team’s sniper, having received his fair share of commendations for marksmanship. He was just as badass as the rest of the twenty brothers that made up their team. But when Michaels lets their prime suspect get away from a huge bust with over a quarter of a million dollars in drugs, he’s willing to do whatever it takes to make it right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Left with no other options, God chooses to bring in outside help, calling on his long-time friend and bounty hunter, Judge Josephson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judge was considered one of the best trackers during his enlistment in the United States Marine Corps. After retiring, he used those skills to become one of the most sought out fugitive trackers in the country. When Judge gets a call from his old friend needing his help, he quickly tells God, yes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still embarrassed, and intent to prove himself, Michaels immediately volunteers to partner up with Judge to get their suspect back quickly and quietly. Neither man wanted or needed a partner. But, after Judge and Michaels get on the road, the hate/lust relationship they quickly develop between them will either make them heroes… Or get them killed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;After thousands of years, they’re back…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awkward outcast omega Emery Jones isn’t expecting to find anything more than adventure when he leaves his favorite hiking path and follows a strange series of markers through the woods… and he’s certainly not expecting to come face to face with the most gorgeous man he’s ever seen. He’s instantly smitten, but there’s one problem—his dream guy insists that he’s a dragon prince from another time, and Emery is his fated mate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After thousands of years in stasis, Coryphaeus of Novis, the draconian Crown Prince, has been awakened by a kiss from his fated mate. But when the shy little omega denies his draconian heritage and tells Cory that dragons are nothing more than fairytales, Cory knows that the world isn’t as he remembers it. The dragons that once ruled the world are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s too bad the threat they previously faced hasn’t gone extinct, too…</description>

  <description>Farris &lt;br /&gt;When I first saw Banner, two thoughts occurred to me. I was going to marry him some day, and his face was way too smooth, He needed to laugh more. And then I proceeded to all the things that made him frown and glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Banner &lt;br /&gt;When I first saw Farris, two thoughts occurred to me. He had the most beautiful smile I'd ever seen, complete with dimples, and dragging his down with my gloom and doom personality was out of the question. So, I proceeded to try to avoid the unavoidable.</description>

  <description>Jordan Fox &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From one abusive life to another, I've had more bruised skin than I've had healthy. When My dad found out I was gay in an extremely humiliating way, I wasn't surprised when he nearly killed me. He'd been beating me for as long as I can remember. I wasn't even surprised to find myself in a conversion camp the next day being beat by men I didn’t even know. I was a little surprised to be scooped up by leader and forced into a "relationship" I didn't want. As the years pass, and I'm allowed more freedom, I eventually sneak around and get a job. And then sneak around and leave. The gym is the only place I can hide since Wade doesn't even know I work there, and I start secretly living out of it, hoping like crazy the big, gruff, delicious owner never finds out. Especially since I'm not longer afraid of him, but I'm absolutely terrified of the way he makes me feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Langston Bell &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The moment I see the beautiful young man huddled under the desk in fear, I know I have to take care of him. So, when a friend of his ex's shows up at the gym, looking for him, I'm more than happy to help hide him. And when a tripped alarm in the middle of the night shows me that the sweet man had nothing and no one, I move him in with me, fully intending to be on my best behavior, especially since I'm like twice his age. But I've never craved another man the way I crave him, and I'm clearly not as strong as I thought I was. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this series is pretty fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laugh… or at least smile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Brighton Walker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a bit of a mess. I'm hyperactive, but lazy at the same time. I apparently have an annoying pen tapping problem. I can't cook even pre-made meals without a major catastrophe happening and I'm a little on the forgetful side. All reasons having a roommate isn't really a great idea. Which makes it a bit of a problem when my aunt kicks me out of the house I have been living in since I was born. Now I need a place to live, and Knox, one of my closest friends and the man who stole my heart almost from the moment I met him, is kind enough to offer the spare room in his house, but I just know I'm going to fuck this up. I'm just waiting for the day when the crazy ball of reckless energy that surrounds me at every turn is going to bounce right off of Knox's head and mess up his routine life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knox Green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man of routine and I don't like for that routine to be interrupted… with the exception of it being interrupted by Brighton. He is funny and sweet and gorgeous and hates walking with the type of dedication professional athletes put into their career, which is why I usually carry him everywhere. When Brighton needs help with a place to live, I am more than happy to take him in. Spending time with the man has never been a hardship, and my feelings for him aside, having someone around all the time would be nice. I might not have been prepared for the type of life having him in my house has become, but even with one catastrophe after another, my feelings for him grow daily. Now if I could just find a way to prove to him that I won't ditch him at the first sign of trouble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this series is pretty fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laugh… or at least smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>Chandler Bell &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my boyfriend breaks up with me because I'm overweight, I go to the one place I feel the most comfortable. Oddly enough, it's the gym I was basically raised in. Things have changed over the years, but the people inside are my family. Some of them literally. Baker reluctantly agrees to help me get in shape, and so begins the torture. Baker and I have always been close and though I've had a crush on him basically since I was floating around in amniotic fluid, I've always known he was off limits. I mean, come on. The guy is scorching hot with women throwing themselves at him constantly, and I can't even keep a man who wears tweed shorts around. It's kinda a no-brainer where I fall on the food chain. Plus, he's straight, and apparently pining after someone? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Baker Storm &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Chandler's douche bag boyfriend dumps him and makes him feel like he needs to change, I reluctantly agree to help. Mostly because I've never been able to say no to him. In my eyes, Chandler is perfect. Always has been. I know I'm not good enough for him, I mean I barely graduated high school, and I only did that because he tutored me the whole time, but it doesn't stop me from having those secret wants. A chance encounter with the man who made him feel like shit leads to me all but peeing on him in public, and I maybe go a little too far and reveal some things about myself that I'd been holding on to for years. Will I have the confidence to be the man Chandler seems to think I am, or will my self-doubt cause me to miss out on something I've only ever dreamed about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this series is pretty fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laugh… or at least smile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; Length: 3 hrs and 18 mins &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An M/M Omegaverse Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The best gifts in life will sometimes catch you by surprise.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luke is a YouTuber known for his popular &lt;i&gt;Omega Manny Diary&lt;/i&gt; videos. After a brief-yet-secret fling with his boss Ian’s best friend, he finds himself left with an even larger secret: Grazer’s baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grazer had a lot of fun with Luke, but he’d been upfront with him from the beginning. He’d always preferred to chase silver foxes—not young, fertile pups. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nearly two years after their last hot night together, Grazer returns to Hollydale, fresh from a year of guarding the toddler of a celebrity. He’s at loose ends, not to mention lonely, and wondering if maybe he’d been too brash when writing off love and fatherhood in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Grazer runs into Luke and discovers his life-altering secret, can they find a way to forgive the mistakes of the past and grab their second chance at romance? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for this second chance, secret baby romance where May learns to be the December in an age gap relationship. This is the seventh book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 34k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; 2 hrs and 39 mins &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I know you're not the kind of omega who needs an alpha to protect him. You’re strong enough on your own. That's why you're my bromega... a bro who happens to be an omega that I would give anything for... "&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greg may be an omega, but he doesn't let that define him. Aside from his almost compulsive need to clean, the most important thing to him is his job as the long-time bartender at The Big O. Greg is far from a delicate omega. In fact, he’s the same size as his best friend - an alpha who he always falls back into bed with when they’re between relationships. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braden is a casual kind of alpha bro. He spends his time - and makes his money - playing video games. A slacker who never leaves the house, let alone bothers with unnecessary details like getting dressed, Braden is happy to settle into a non-relationship agreement with his bestie. It’s not like they’re gonna do anything silly like fall in love anyway - they’re just bros being bros. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Greg saves the life of a quirky Irishman, he’s given an unexpected boon - his lifelong infertility is miraculously cured and he finds himself pregnant. Too bad nobody gave him the heads up that this was even a possibility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for a friends to lovers tale of two guys who are perfect for each other, if they can just open their hearts and risk their friendship by taking a chance on love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the sixth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 27k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 2 hours and 42 minutes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because Stix are better than Ballz... &lt;br /&gt;Come in for our eclairs, and stay for the fabulous coffee. &lt;br /&gt;Show this flyer for a 10% discount! &lt;br /&gt;Ask about our Flakey Tasters Club!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kent crumpled the lame azz flyer in his hand and looked across the street at the Salty Stix bakery and thought to himself... this is war.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single father Pierre Duchamp has recently returned to Hollydale with plans to open Salty Stix, an authentic French bakery like the one he apprenticed at in Paris. The omega doesn’t have, need, or even want an alpha in his life—especially a provincial small town rube that doesn’t understand the concept of a little healthy competition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kent Hawkins doesn’t want drama. He just wants to spend his days making candy for Sweet Ballz—a place that is so much more than just a job, it’s his life. If only the thieving French baker across the street would quit revamping and one-upping Kent’s recipes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A one-night stand gone wrong… two dessert loving men who can’t find a way to reduce their boil to a simmer… and a mysterious hippie who keeps accidentally making things worse while he blithely totes around his little harp. Celebrate Valentine’s Day in Hollydale—a sweet little town where strange things happen but your friends are always there to have your back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the fifth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 27k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 2 hours and 52 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I promise, I'm not going anywhere. I found everything that I never thought I wanted right here with you." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cecil is an unconventional omega. Owner of Second Chances, Hollydale’s Thrift Store and Consignment Shop, the closest he wants to get to an alpha is when he picks one up for a few hours of fun on a Saturday night. And even then, they’d better be polite enough to disappear before he wakes up. Yet for some reason, after picking up Hollydale’s most elusive playboy bachelor for a spot of fun after Tom’s wedding, Cecil is almost relieved to find Ian still there the following morning when he gets the call from a social worker that he’s been named the guardian of an orphaned two day old infant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ian’s entire adult life has been spent climbing the ladder to partnership at his law firm, and squeezing in a little fun with omegas in his spare time. Settling down with one and starting a family is so far from his thoughts it’s laughable. So why does he find himself sticking around to help the adorably awkward omega as he struggles to keep a tiny human alive? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for a little post-holiday fun while Ian and Cecil figure out that, sometimes, sticking around is more fun than a one night stand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 30k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>Malik Newton &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was fairly severely burned when I was young. Before anyone gets too emotional about it, it was an accident. My sister and I were being dumb and accidentally caught me on fire. For the most part, I've gotten used to people staring at my burn scars. It's not really something I can hide and though most people try to hide their reaction, I get human nature grabs the eyes and holds on tight when something is different. Usually, I just ignore it. But there are still times when the unwanted attention of others can really hurt. Like when they curl their lip or show disgust. Or when the first guy you ever really wanted to impress spends the first hour in your company failing at not getting caught staring at your scars. Rowe Belk is simply not a subtle man. What he is though, is someone who might just be too sweet for a world like ours, and I vow to myself that I will find a way to make him see past the scars to a man who would do anything to keep his amazing heart protected and safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rowe Belk &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shy doesn't even begin to describe me. I'm also awkward and a little weird. I'm always getting made fun of for not wanting to kill bugs and have even had more than one person get mad at me for it. Most people take one look at my size and just assume I'm a certain way, only to be disappointed when they find out I'm nothing like what they expected. I would give anything to be able to disappear in a room, but I'm kinda hard to miss, given my size. The first time I meet my mate, I literally don't notice the scars at first. I notice the way he carries himself. The authority he gives off, the energy. I notice his sweet scent, and lovely eyes. I know as a chosen, he needs to be protected from men who hunt people like him as part of a competition that feeds something much worse, but as I get to know him better, I realize, though I may be protecting him physically, he's actually the one taking care of me, and it's everything I've ever wanted in my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Holt the ME is a socially awkward, highly distrustful kangaroo mouse shifter who takes one look at Leighton, who seems to like him, and knows he's being played. A man like that doesn't fall for the big-eared weirdo that spends more time with dead people than live ones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leighton, a harpy who has never done anything the easy way takes one look at the cutie with the oversized ears and evasive attitude, and feels something he's never felt before. But if he's going to get the cautious man to take him seriously, he's going to have to break down some walls. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;More details coming soon!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 8 hours and 30 minutes.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detectives Mark Ruxsberg and Chris Green are very good at their jobs. Being the enforcers for God and Day's notorious Atlanta PD Narcotics Task Force causes the crazy duo to get into more trouble than they can often get out of. The pair never misses out on an opportunity to drive their Lieutenants crazy with their dangerous, reckless, and costly stunts, landing them in the hot seat in front God... often. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruxs and Green love their jobs and they don't mind the very demanding schedule that leaves them little time for socializing or dating. It was fine with them, they enjoyed hanging out with each other anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, most of the men in their close circle of friends and colleagues are pairing off and settling down. God has Day, Ro has Johnson, and their Sergeant Syn has Furious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past several years, Ruxs has only sought out the advice and company of one person, his partner and best friend Green, and vice versa. Both of these alpha males are presumed straight, but neither can deny the heat that's building in their once 'just friends' relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Braden Wilson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've spent more time in captivity in the last six months than I have out of it. Thankfully, an injury from when I was young makes me less valuable to the people who might want to use me as breeding stock, so I've managed to escape being claimed. When a gorgeous but gruff man who specializes in interrogation shows up to save me, I know there is something about him that makes him special to me, but he's reading hot and cold, and I can't figure him out. He thinks he's too rough around the edges for me, but nobody has ever done for me what he does or treated me like I was worth anything. If only I could make him feel as worthy as he makes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meyers Andrews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone doesn't enjoy the job I have so much unless they are just as messed up as the people they interrogate. I might not think hurting innocent people is okay, but I have very little remorse about hurting those who have, and I've never felt bad about my job… until I meet my mate, a man who has been neglected practically his whole life but somehow manages to keep from getting bitter. He's beautiful and strong both inside and out, and I would give anything to be the man he deserves, but I don't think I have that kind of goodness in me, and I'm terrified of tainting something so precious with my darkness. I need to walk away for his own good, but I don't know if I'm strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>Enid Daniels &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tell all my deepest secrets to a tiger shifter I have never seen in human form, who I've named Roarsen. Somehow, though he never speaks, for obvious reasons, he has the ability to make me laugh and feel comfortable, even with telling him the hard truths about my life. I spend every night for months sitting on that back porch, snuggling my tiger friend and talking for hours. I have this fantasy that someday, I'll finally be ready for him to shift and the chemistry will be out of this world. We'll fall in love and I'll have a partner that knows everything about me and still accepts and loves me. Too bad Decker has to ruin everything by being the man I can't stop craving, who just happens to also be a great guy. But I can't tell someone like Decker the things I've had to do in my past. He'd never understand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Decker Reed &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was an accident! I never meant to deceive my mate. I simply followed my tiger nose to the beautiful man sitting on my brother's back porch and became the confidant to a person in need of an ear that he thought might not judge him. And I don't judge him. I want nothing more than to hold him in my arms and tell him how amazing I find him. Too bad he won't let me shift yet, so I can show him how happy I am to have him as a mate, no matter what his past looks like. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As with all my books, this is pretty freaking fluffy. Not much angst at all, no cheating and definitely a happy ending! Meant to be a light hearted read to make you laugh… or at least smile. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One night equals a test of faith for Father Lance…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trouble always finds Mateo and he’s succumbed to it several times with or without help. However, after running with the wrong kinds of people, he’s decided to turn a new leaf. His attention to detail lands him a job as a tattoo artist, making people’s dreams come true through body art. With this steady gig and his grandmother’s support, Mateo is convinced he can live mostly anxiety free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Father Lance has always suppressed his needs to care for others. The older alpha is Vale’s most handsome and available bachelor, but Lance has no interest in hooking up. Instead, he puts all his energies into his church. Although loneliness is a constant partner, Lance refuses to let it stand in the way of his goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wintery night, Lance spots a man in need of assistance and immediately calls for help. Despite Lance’s instincts crying out to the victim, he ignores those desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he's being rushed to the emergency room, Mateo feels his destined mate near. Once he recovers, he’s determined to find his forever partner to build the relationship that will stabilize the young omega’s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: On page violence and a near death experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Breakable Faith is the eighth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story features a tattooed omega that has the hots for the priest. Naughtiness and general unholy thoughts are the running themes in this book. Be prepared to clutch your rosary and have a fan nearby.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a lonely omega witch casts a holiday spell to fetch the alpha of his dreams and gets a jaded paranormal investigator instead, can love heal two damaged hearts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A lonely omega witch casts a forbidden spell.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his adoptive grandmother dies, initiate witch, Mark has only a dead end job and no romantic prospects. Worse, despite being raised by the coven leader, Mark can’t even manifest a familiar, the minimum requirement to become a full witch. Mark recognizes he’s a magical dunce, but if he could find love, maybe saying goodbye to his dreams of being a real witch won’t be so bad. So he takes a desperate step, casts a forbidden love spell, and everything falls apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A jaded paranormal investigator has one chance to save his career.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaded alpha and paranormal investigator J.C. Hart doesn’t believe in magic or crystals or anything but himself. He’s on a mission to debunk the supernatural, but with his ratings falling, he has to produce a blockbuster holiday special that shows his softer side. Will a trip to the magical town of Vale Valley, and a handsome omega witch, restore J.C.’s faith in the fantastic ...and love, before the town’s source of magic is destroyed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Find out in A Holiday Magical Mixup, Book 7 in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each book can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book contains witchcraft, sleight of hand, pseudoscience, humor, Mpreg, holiday feels, a hint of danger and most of all a very happy ending. Pull up a chair, grab your hot cocoa, and settle in for holiday romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning: This book contains a villain with creepy magic powers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;If you're looking for a holiday read that keeps you turning pages, makes you laugh out loud, and leaves you with a grin at the end, grab A Holiday Magic Mixup today!&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>An MM Shifter Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a cheery reindeer omega help heal a grinchy snow leopard?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Max Drum&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max is a snow leopard alpha trying to forget a painful childhood. He left his hometown at 19, settled in Vale Valley, and never looked back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By day, he's a hard-working carpenter. By night, he's an aspiring novelist. He's happy living a solitary life. Or so he thinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, he meets Ren. The thought of relying on anyone emotionally sends Max into a panicky tailspin, but he can't resist Ren's scent, nor his delightfully delicious crepes, so they decide on a casual relationship full of heat and passion. When tragedy strikes, the blurred lines are tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another complication arises when Max’s brother begs him to forgive their father for inflicting so much misery on them as children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he have the faith and courage to take the leap into the unknown? And can Ren help him see the true meaning of Christmas? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Ren Svenson&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ren, a reindeer omega, is all about holiday cheer, at least at first glance. Rejected by his reindeer herd as a child, he settled in Vale Valley and is now on his way to realizing his dreams after opening his very own creperie, Sweet Bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s been content to dabble in casual affairs, but something changes when he gets a taste of Max, a handsome and brooding snow leopard omega. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misfortune brings them closer than they intended, and when he finds out about their own special Christmas bundle of joy, he has to consider how to navigate their relationship going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can he learn to trust again and let Max into his heart? Or will his childhood rejection continue to cripple his ability to commit? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;His Christmas Lullaby is the sixth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It features a sassy omega, a brooding alpha, delicious crepes, and enough holiday spirit to last you all year! Grab your hot cocoa, snuggle up on the couch, and settle in for a knotty, heartwarming holiday read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Chris and Jason thought they’d lost their way home, but wound up finding the exact place … and person … they’d been looking for.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;A young couple--Chris, a beta, and Jason, an omega--come upon a small, snowy town that seems too magical to be true. Is it just the snow and the Christmas season that makes them feel like anything is possible? Or does that feeling really come from the knowledge that nothing is holding them back from a relationship they never could have imagined in their wildest dreams? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rafe Montgomery has been single for over five years. He lives with his daughter, Grace, and some staff in his enormous mansion in the woods. As much as he tries to give everything to Grace, he still can't give her the comfort and security that comes with having both an alpha daddy and an omega daddy. But he's sworn off love after losing his cherished mate in an accident. When he sees Chris and Jason he's struck by something he doesn't understand, but soon realizes that the three of them fit together in a beautiful relationship he'd never even considered.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Five Gold Rings is the fifth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home.  Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is about a relationship between an older, tall, dark, handsome, and wealthy, alpha dom, a young beta sub, and a young omega sub. You will find incredibly hot sex between three men, male pregnancy, loads of holiday decorations and snow, and a very sweet, cuddly HEA in front of a roaring fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An Alpha wolf and an omega swan can’t be fated mates… Right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned by his swan herd and lost in a snowstorm, Kellan has nowhere to go. When he’s near death, he’s discovered by a wolf shifter in the woods surrounding a mysterious town filled with magic and hope. Could there also be love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vic, the owner of Vale Valley Inn and Restaurant, has been alone since a virus claimed the lives of most of his pack. He’s found acceptance and built a good life for himself in the beautiful town that has become his home. Still, facing another Christmas without a mate is heartbreaking, even if he’s accepted that he’ll never find his true wolf omega.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Vic rescues Kellan, he plans to do anything he can to help the skittish man forge a new life in Vale Valley. He’s all too familiar with having to start over. But as they grow closer, something else starts happening that he’s not familiar with—the mating pull and a swan’s heat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Swan for Christmas is the fourth book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mpreg romance story features an omega virgin desperate for love, a lonely Alpha who is perplexed by the mechanics of nesting and a whole lot of hurt/comfort and smexy times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sometimes the ones who got away never really did…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omega Bryce, stuck in a dead-end job that barely makes ends meet, doesn’t have time to act as executor for his dearly departed uncle’s estate—especially since it means going back to Vale Valley, home of many of his best (and long-past) memories. He’s even more unwilling to let his uncle down. But when Bryce arrives only to discover the lawyer he needs to meet with has closed up shop for the holidays, he decides to stay in his uncle’s cabin for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Houston had no intention of ever returning to Vale Valley after he joined the Coast Guard nearly a decade earlier. But the news that he’s been named Sal’s executor draws him back. He decides to stay at the cabin and is shocked when he returns with groceries to find Bryce, his old crush, looking and smelling every bit as delicious as Houston remembered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha Dante never left Vale Valley—not that it mattered, since both his hearts took off years ago. When Sal passes and names him executor of the estate, it’s like a door finally closing on that chapter of his life. After all, why would either Houston or Bryce ever return? When he sees them again, though, he feels his past has returned and is being dangled in front of him as a possible future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three men fall back into their old friendship with ease—and the lust they felt all those years ago is only magnified. This time, though, they don’t ignore it, allowing the magic of the season to thrust them into what they always truly wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with adult commitments looming and so much time lost, is it too late for their happily ever after?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; Twice as Joyful is part of a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestle up with your cup of cocoa and enjoy this MMM non-shifter super sweet with knotty omegaverse second-chance romance featuring three reunited best friends, some mistletoe mischief, and a surprise gift that will warm your heart, all set in the mystical, magical, love-filled Vale Valley!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Two mismatched men. One unlikely friendship.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jordan Kingsley is Hollydale’s most hated alpha. The man is seen as nothing more than a pretentious twit who doesn’t care about anyone but himself. So then, why does he find himself diving into a pond to save a life? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trevor Johnson is the most accident-prone omega around. Kicked out by his father after finding himself pregnant, he wanders around town trying to figure out what to do. A fall into the duck pond at Plumtree park is nearly his undoing until Jordan rescues him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Citing the old proverb that he’s responsible for the life he saved, Jordan shocks himself by befriending Trevor and offering him a place to stay. While other people have found the omega’s klutzy tendencies to be annoying, Jordan can’t help but be charmed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite an age gap and the unplanned baby that’s on the way with no sire in sight, these unlikely friends just might find that they’re a perfect match. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance filled with all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the thirteenth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 26k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>This is a short story from the Rent-a-Dom universe by Susi Hawke and Piper Scott. Cecil is a sassy, British twink of an omega, now living in Las Vegas and although quite pregnant, has been resistant to settling down with his alpha boyfriend, Michael. He doesn't think a surprise pregnancy should push their relationship to move faster, but... he wouldn't mind having his man there full-time. Especially now that he's so far along and will soon have a baby to care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fun anniversary outing turns into a kinky show in a leather club that has to be seen to be believed. Be prepared for a side-splitting laughter and a steamy 'scene' with one completely trussed-up alpha who's at his omega's mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Free Read through Insta-Freebee from August 28th to September 4th together with other authors -&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://claims.instafreebie.com/gg/FCUgWKEbfjrArvzGZcYb?ct=t(Charlie_Cochet_s_October_2017_News_COPY_02)&amp;amp;mc_cid=c4346505de&amp;amp;mc_eid=8417099867" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://claims.instafreebie.com/gg/FC...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Omega looking for alpha for... unusual request. Must be physically impressive. Please inquire for further details.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christian Kelley is down on his luck--big time. After moving to Las Vegas in the hopes of becoming an entertainer, he's been met with nothing but rejection, so when a friend suggests he sign up with Rent-a-Dom as a service provider, he's eager to give it a shot. While more naturally submissive than dominant, Christian is sure he can pull off the act well enough... at least, until the founder of Rent-a-Dom himself contacts him with an unusual proposal, and his world turns upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monty Mills, the mysterious founder of Rent-a-Dom, has a problem he can't fix. With Rent-a-Dom's fifth year anniversary on the horizon, he sees potential for exposure like never before. The problem? He'll risk Rent-a-Dom's credibility if he shows his face in public. What he needs is a beard--someone who can make the world think he's someone he's not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone like Christian Kelley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly when Monty and Christian meet, but with Monty's business riding on their success, and Christian's future hinged on this performance, love isn't on the agenda. Is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This final installment in the Rent-a-Dom series contains mpreg, D/s elements, and is intended for 18+ readers. Warning: Don't read unless you like fun books with mysterious and powerful omega Doms, bubble bath disasters, rugged alphas with secret piercings who long to submit, and scenes that'll make Vegas temperatures cool in comparison. But then again, this is a Susi Hawke and Piper Scott collaboration--you already knew to expect that, didn't you?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Loving omega/beta couple needs help establishing a more alpha-like dynamic. Please reply ASAP.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Asher Townsend is big, sweet lug of a beta. When he's not running heavy equipment in his job at a local rock quarry, he’s spending his time romancing his omega boyfriend, Dakota, and trying to find ways to make their relationship stronger. All Asher wants is to love and be loved—romance is king, and he longs to make his partner feel just like royalty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dakota Coleman isn't your typical omega. He doesn't want hearts, flowers, or any of that other mushy sap. All he needs is a trusting relationship filled with good companionship and hot sex. Other than that, he’s happy in his high-pressure sales job and doesn’t need much else, although he has dreams of starting a family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After Dakota's failed attempt to get his too-vanilla boyfriend to be more dominant and creative in the bedroom blows up in their faces, Asher suggests they contact Rent-a-Dom for an alpha who can teach him the skills he needs to fulfill Dakota's fantasies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Guy Daily has three firm rules—no kissing, no cuddling, and no overnights. When he finds himself breaking all three with his intriguing new clients, he's not very happy about it. And yet, he also can't stop thinking about the two men who've caught his attention. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This 61k MMM book contains mpreg, D/s elements, and is intended for 18+ readers. Warning: Don't read unless you like sweet books about hot Doms, three people finding their way to make a family, heartfelt stories that make you smile, and a triple-sized amount of steam-filled passion. But then again, this is a Susi Hawke and Piper Scott collaboration—you already knew to expect that, didn’t you?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Successful alpha in need of an omega unafraid to take control. Willing to be generou$$$. Looking forward to hearing from you.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Troy Sullivan is the current owner of The Palisade, one of the most popular casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. With more money in the bank than he could spend in a lifetime, and surrounded by yes-men more interested in staying in his good graces than helping him improve his business, Troy craves what he can’t have—someone to tell him “no.” When he discovers Rent-a-Dom, he’s convinced he’s found his solution: a master decades his junior who specializes in financial domination, and who won’t so much as let Troy see his face… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Robin Mills is a young entrepreneur with the weight of the world on his shoulders. After signing over his half of his start-up, Rent-a-Dom, to his brother Monty, he’s made a business out of counting cards in order to afford their mother’s expensive medical treatments. But when Monty contacts Robin about a particular client, Robin finds himself drawn back into the world of BDSM, this time as Master to the man who makes his blood boil—Troy Sullivan. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the last year and a half, Robin has dominated Troy from across the country, denying him every chance he gets. But when a betrayal at the executive level leaves Troy blindsided and in need of a strong hand, Robin is faced with a tantalizing choice: let his submissive crash and burn, or step in and stake a claim on the world he thought he’d left behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This MM book contains mpreg, D/s elements, and is intended for 18+ readers. Warning: Don't read unless you like fun books with snarky, headstrong omega Doms; naughty, lacy things in all the right places; alphas who know exactly what they want and aren’t afraid to admit it; and scenes so hot, they won’t only melt your kindle, they’ll burn down your house. But then again, this is a Susi Hawke and Piper Scott collaboration—you already knew to expect that, didn’t you?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Naughty brat needs a strong guiding hand. Must love dogs. Reply ASAP&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toby Andrews is a busy, forgetful, scatterbrained musician with ADHD, a precocious dog named Ruffles, and a bad rep for partying too hard. When Toby’s actions put an all-important contract with a large label in jeopardy, his manager sarcastically suggests that the omega needs a keeper who'll redden his bottom if he steps out of line. Toby is intrigued, so when he sees an ad for a discreet company called Rent-a-Dom while scrolling his social media page, he impulsively sends a request for a Daddy Dom to help him stay on track. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thorne Barrett is a jaded, worn-out daddy of a Dom who has no desire to babysit some naughty, out of control, celebrity brat. The alpha reluctantly takes the job, promising himself he’ll find new employment when the contract is over. He doesn't know what his next step might be, but whatever it is, he hopes it will leave him stable enough so he can settle down and think about having a family of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither man is precisely what the other expected. Once Thorne gets his naughty 'boy' settled into a routine, Toby begins to blossom and find better ways to focus... and most importantly, stay of out trouble with the paparazzi. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between band issues, a crazed stalker, an unexpected pregnancy, and a thirty-day cross-country tour, Toby has a lot on his plate. Can he find stability for himself and Ruffles with Daddy Thorne? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This MM book contains mpreg, D/s elements, and is intended for 18+ readers. Warning: Don't read unless you like fun books with feisty Chihuahuas, naughty boys who really want to be good, hot daddy alphas, a story that will keep you in stitches, and steam-filled passion. But then again, this is a Susi Hawke and Piper Scott collaboration—you already knew to expect that, didn’t you?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Half-vampire Catherine Crawfield is going after the undead with a vengeance, hoping that one of these deadbeats is her father—the one responsible for ruining her mother's life. Then she's captured by Bones, a vampire bounty hunter, and is forced into an unlikely partnership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In exchange for help finding her father, Cat agrees to train with the sexy night stalker until her battle reflexes are as sharp as his fangs. She's amazed she doesn't end up as his dinner…are there actually good vampires? Pretty soon, Bones will have her convinced that being half-dead doesn't have to be all bad. But before she can enjoy her status as kick-ass demon hunter, Cat and Bones are pursued by a group of killers. Now Cat will have to choose a side...and Bones is turning out to be as tempting as any man with a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeaniene Frost lives with her husband and their very spoiled dog in Florida. Although not a vampire herself, she confesses to having pale skin, wearing a lot of black, and sleeping in late whenever possible. And while she can't see ghosts, she loves to walk through old cemeteries. Jeaniene also loves poetry and animals but fears children and hates to cook. She is currently at work on the next novel in her best-selling Night Huntress series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;©2007 Jeaniene Frost (P)2010 Blackstone Audio, Inc.</description>

  <description>Sergeant Corbin "Syn" Sydney had dedicated his life to becoming the best detective. So when he heard there was an opening on the notorious Atlanta Narcotics Task Force, he jumped at the chance. But, what he wasn't ready for was realizing just how lonely he'd made himself, when he observed the loving and dedicated relationship between the two men he served under: Lieutenant Cashel "God" Godfrey and Lieutenant Leonidis Day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syn prepared himself to accept his lonely fate until he walked into a small pub and met the long-haired, tattooed bartender, Furious Barkley. Before Syn can even understand why, he's overcome with feelings he barely recognizes: passion, yearning, craving. And if the dark, lustful gazes are anything to go by, Furious might be feeling the same things for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just two thing needs to happen before Syn and Furi can give each other what's been missing from their lives for so long...Syn needs to find the evidence that proves Furi's innocence of murder, as well as protect him from a past that refuses to let go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains mature themes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Austen Payne, THIRDS Squadron Specialist Agent (SSA) for Destructive Delta and TIN operative, has seen the worst the world has to offer, faced lethal killers, and helped bring down dangerous organizations. But nothing terrifies him more than falling in love. After years of undercover work, Austen is a master at defending himself and protecting his heart… until he meets Osmond Zachary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRDS Defense Agent Osmond Zachary has a huge, doting family, yet something is missing in his life. After meeting grumpy, foul-mouthed, jittery cheetah Therian Austen Payne, Zach knows exactly what that something—or someone—is. Unfortunately Austen seems determined to avoid Zach at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zach foils an assassination attempt, he ends up in the killer’s crosshairs, and Austen is Zach’s best chance at staying alive. Zach hopes the crisis will bring them closer, but Austen has every intention of walking away as soon as the danger is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily ever after isn’t for guys like Austen, but Zach is determined to show him it can be….</description>

  <description>For Ward “King” Kingston the role of protector, forged by fire and tragedy, is one he takes seriously. When King is asked to safeguard the son of a four-star general and friend, he is pulled back into the world of government black ops on a mission that raises painful memories from his past. The moment King meets Leo, amid the chaos of a lockdown at a secret black site, it’s clear he’s never faced a challenge like this—one that will test his unwavering sense of control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leopold de Loughrey is a misunderstood genius whose anxiety and insecurities are sent into overdrive when he is forcefully recruited to work on a top-secret project. Terrified of what his role as "invaluable asset" means, Leo’s stress leads to disappearances, arguments, and blowups that threaten the project and Leo’s future. King’s arrival is a calm in the storm for Leo and his frenetic thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King and Leo couldn’t be more different, yet as they navigate the dangers of a secret multi-agency operation and face unknown threats, their differences could be what saves them. Neither man believes a happily ever after is in the cards, but their hearts might just prove them wrong… if they can survive a deadly betrayal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lost. Stolen. Forgotten… until the Alphabits step in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Team A.L.P.H.A. spinoff series.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gizmo Jones has an obsession with technology, and he doesn’t care who knows it. The smarter, more connected, and shinier it is, the better. When Gizmo and Ozzy are sent to the backwoods of West Virginia, the worst Gizmo thinks he’ll face is a couple of rednecks trying to shoot down one of his fleet of drones. He doesn’t expect to run smack dab into a cult masquerading as a summer camp who are determined to separate shifter kids from their animal sides. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Caleb Brooks had been one of those kids once. He’d escaped by pretending he was “cured”, and then holing up in the middle of the woods with no connection to technology, shifting freely, but staying close, because he couldn’t abandon the kids still trapped there. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Alphabits know they need to bring the law down on the camp, but they aren’t the only ones coming for them. STAHP is on the loose and where they prowl... mayhem follows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Alphabits aren’t vigilantes. These former soldiers and officers of the law have to do things by the book—even when it tears them apart to do so. But once all their ducks are in a row, the bad guys had better beware! You do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want this team of protective alphas on your tail. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the third in the Alphabits series, and should be read in order for maximum enjoyment. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. Prepare for the return of your favorite cat shifters, two best friends who will do anything for each other, and more surveillance equipment than the NSA. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown? &lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lost. Stolen. Forgotten… until the Alphabits step in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Team A.L.P.H.A. spinoff series.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pierce Steele was the Alphabits first recruit, and is team leader Sam’s right hand man. This whole investigating thing is fairly new for a man used to being a pilot, but he’s always loved pups. When he and the awkward bear shifter Cyrus are sent to investigate a lead on a missing child case down in the armpit of Florida, he expected it to be easy. Interview a few people. Grab the kid, take him home to his parents. Case closed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He did not expect the fiery omega Adrian Shultz to stand in his way. He certainly didn’t expect the daycare worker to be his fated mate. Pierce thought he was done with love forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adrian really wants to take arrogant tough alpha down a notch or two, but when his heat kicks in, he’ll settle for getting down with him. And while he’s at it, he’s going to make sure Pierce doesn’t take Dex away from his real family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The case turns out to be trickier than the team thought. Pierce and Cyrus end up dragging Adrian, the manny Tony, and missing child Dex back home to Chicago so the Alphabits can learn where the truth actually lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Alphabits aren’t vigilantes. These former soldiers and officers of the law have to do things by the book—even when it tears them apart to do so. But once all their ducks are in a row, the bad guys had better beware! You do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want this team of protective alphas on your tail. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the second in the Alphabits series, and should be read in order for maximum enjoyment. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. You’ll need a fan--both to ward of Cyrus’s noxious gas and to cool yourself off after the bedroom scenes, and make sure you go to the bathroom before you’re laughing too hard to move. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Warren Williams &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In high school, I was bullied. I know, bullies are a dime a dozen and most of the behaviors of young, dumb children can be forgiven and even forgotten. But there is one bully I'll never forget. His name was Asher Douglas and I had the most ridiculous crush on him… until the day he and his friends tricked me into thinking he liked me and then dumped actual feces on my head and filmed the whole thing. It was my biggest humiliation, and not just because of the crap. It was because I'd honestly thought Asher was a good guy up until that point. It's too bad he's now my brother's best friend and business partner… and the man investigating the disappearance of a girl I might have information about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Asher Douglas &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My biggest regret revolves around a gorgeous young man I had a crush on years before and people I thought were my friends. I never got the chance to set the record straight with Warren, because he moved to a new school and wouldn't answer any correspondence from me at all over the years. Not that I could blame him. When a job takes me to Crossville where my partner and best friend has decided to move with his mate, I'm excited for the chance to maybe FINALLY tell Warren what really happened that day in the school parking lot, years before. What I didn't expect was that he would turn out to be my mate… and not interested in my explanation, or me at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Beckett Anders &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At eighteen, I've already experienced far too much and lived a life that most would be terrified of. Needless to say, I don't feel like an eighteen year old kid. Too bad a kid is exactly how Grayson Meadows sees me. Call it a hero worship, call it youthful naivety, but I have a massive crush on one of the men who rescued me from the bunker where my best friend and I had spent weeks being held against our will. I'd maybe believe what I felt was due to gratitude or even the fact that I was young and dumb if I was, in fact, dumb or hadn't met every single one of my rescuers and didn't feel the same kind of crazy longing I felt for Grayson. Something about the man makes me feel safe and crazed at the same time. I want him more than I've ever wanted anything ever. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be his type, and he treats me like a little kid. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grayson Meadows &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only is my mate young, but he was just rescued from being held in a fallout shelter. It doesn't take a psychologist to know the decisions he makes for the next few months around going to be with a clear mind and heart. When I claim my mate, I want to do it knowing I didn't take advantage of him at a time when he was vulnerable, because of what happened. And everyone knows eighteen-year-olds are great at making terrible decisions. Unfortunately, I will need to be going back to Oregon soon and I don't know if I can leave my Beckett behind without losing my mind completely. Which is another reason why I can't tell him what he is to me. It's one thing for me to have to suffer knowing my mate is out there, possibly living happily without me, but I couldn't handle knowing he was suffering the effects of mate withdrawal too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Turner Burks &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've pretty much always given up what I want for the happiness of others. It seems to be a pattern with me. It's why nobody even thought to ask anyone else when things started going nuts with my alpha and he suddenly needed a babysitter. "Of course, Turner will drop everything, including his education to come to the rescue of the streak." So, I'm not even really that surprised when the man who is perfect for me in every way, my mate, shows up in Crossville, looking for his missing… HUSBAND. Looks like one more thing I'm going to have to give up. But how am I ever going to survive letting my mate go to live happily with another man? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kendrick Williams &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my brother calls home after three weeks of being missing to inform us that he'd been kidnapped, held for weeks, found, saved and was fine, but didn't want to come home, my family and I really aren't sure what to think. Being a private investigator––I spend most of my time behind a desk pouring over a computer––I use my rescorses to track him down, needing to make sure he really is fine and not Stockholming it up in Tennessee somewhere. When I lie about being Warren's husband, I immediately regret it when his landlord turns out to be the most amazing man I've ever met. Now if only getting passed the hurdle that is the man I want thinking I'm married to my brother was the strangest thing I'll have to deal with while in Crossville. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Spence Rodgers &lt;br /&gt;Being bodyguarded by a gorgeous, enormous, slightly terrifying police officer might sound like fun and games, but there is a real live serial killer running around targeting blond haired, blue eyed boys… and I happen to be blond haired and blue eyed and a boy. With me not having a big strong mate of my own, my brother has pawned me off on the unflappable Mitch Arborrow. Like seriously, I can't flap him. But I sure love to try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mitch Arborrow &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The beautiful bartender that I've been trying to figure out for a while now and failing completely is suddenly in my care and I honestly don't even know exactly how that happened, but now I've got to figure what to do with him… besides all the things I'm tempted to do with him. He needs me to keep him safe, but my beast keeps pushing me for more. I can't afford to be distracted while there is a serial killer on Terra Mortis, but the idea that his protection be left to anyone else makes my beast and me agitated enough to want to scoop him up and run. I'm going to have to figure it out, because the bodies keep piling up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it.

  <description>Hanson Rodgers &lt;br /&gt; My dad's best friend is big and burly and gorgeous and has the ability to make my harpy's blood––yes, I'm a male harpy––boil. When he offered my brother and I a job on Terra Mortis, I knew it was probably a bad idea, no matter how much I wanted to live on the island and be a part of a world where everyone was as much different as they were the same. It was just too much temptation to live and work with a man I had wanted as mine since I was a teenager. And boy was I right. Now that I'm grown up, all I want is for Ridge to see me as something other than his best friend's son. Too bad Ridge is nearly two-hundred years old and completely set in his ways. Once a son of his best friend, always a son of his best friend. It's enough to make me want to smoke all the cigarettes on Terra Mortis. And I just might… because it makes Ridge growl when I poison my lungs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ridge Burris &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once a son of my best friend, always a son of my best friend. The fact that Hanson Rodgers is a full grown man with full grown man parts does not change the fact that he is the son of my best friend, no matter how blown away my antavros beast and I are by him. Unfortunately, when it comes to the little blond beauty who likes to smoke just to make me growl and drink just to hear me cuss, I have little to no control over my reactions and I just know one of these days he is going to push me to do something incredibly stupid, like kiss his brains out. Yeah… kiss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff!

  <description>Seeley Walt &lt;br /&gt;I've been obsessing with the troll that owns the little trinket shop across the street from my brother in-law's café. I watch him whenever I can from the window at Bentley's and try to find anything I can on him on social media, especially pictures of his big, sexy, capable hands. When I take advice from a friend and send the guy a message, we start chatting quite regularly, and he is absolutely perfect, bringing things out of me that I never even knew was there. Unfortunately, he just doesn't seem all that interested in meeting me in person. Even worse, when I go a bit too far with a message, he stops talking to me all together. When he finds out who I am by accident and comes close enough for me to actually catch his scent, it becomes a lot more important that I patch things up with him and make him see that I'm not the type of guy I portrayed myself to be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maddon Burris &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes being different in the looks department means you spend more time worrying about how people are going to react to the way you look then actually dealing with bad reactions. Being a troll and living around people who are considered "normal" looking and constantly worrying about whether or not I will be accepted when I walk into a room, makes it to where I'd just rather not leave my shop and my home more often than I need to. But it's hard to meet people like that and I get more and more lonely every day. When a man starts sending me messages saying sweet things and making me laugh, I almost can't believe it. And then he sends me a message that proves in my head that it's all way too good to be true, especially when I find out it's Seeley Walt. How can I possibly believe that a man like Seeley would want to be with someone as different and as boring as me? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cagney Wilkins &lt;br /&gt;Strange or not, I'm starting to fall for the invisible presence that follows me around, picking on me. He's funny, he's kind and he's protective. Every day I grow more and more attached. Even with the complication of him being invisible, things seem to just fit. When I start seeing a beautiful blond man around Terra Mortis, I'm devastated to realize I'm attracted to him. How can I be so drawn to two men, especially when it becomes clear that my invisible friend is my mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Guthrie Bourne &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm beautiful. I'm not bragging. It's what I am. If my brother is to be believed, it's all that I am. The best part about being an elf for someone like me who hates being the center of attention is the ability to be invisible whenever I want. And I always want. The gargoyle Cagney intrigues me. I didn't set out to mislead him, but I don't want him to be like everyone else, so distracted by my looks, he doesn't see the person I am beneath it all. Unfortunately, staying invisible all the time takes a lot of energy and when I accidentally reveal myself a few times, I inadvertently hurt the man I'm falling hard for. Will he understand my reasons? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22873744-nothing-special" rel="nofollow"&gt;ASIN: B00MC82KIS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Cashel 'Cash' Godfrey is big, tattooed and angry so people typically keep their distance. He's fresh out of the police academy, however, no one is looking to partner with the six foot four beast with a huge chip on his shoulder and an inability to trust. When Cash scans the orientation room he wasn't expecting to find sexy hazel eyes locked onto him. Eyes of the handsome Detective Leonidis 'Leo' Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo is charming, witty, hilariously sarcastic and the only one that can make Cash smile. He’s proud, out and one bad-ass detective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together Cash and Leo become the most revered and successful narcotics detectives Atlanta’s ever seen. Able to communicate and understand each other, without even having to voice it, they quickly climb up the promotional ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Cash saves Leo's life in a raid that turns deadly, Leo begins to see something in the big man that no one else does…something special. But Leo fears he'll never break through the impenetrable wall that protects Cash's heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing Special takes the reader through various emotions throughout the richly fulfilling plot that’s full of erotic gay romance, heartache, passion, trials and tribulations, police action scenes, and an intriguing twist that comes to an amazing ending that’s impossible to see coming.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lost. Stolen. Forgotten… until the Alphabits step in.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Team A.L.P.H.A. spinoff series.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam Remington, former leader of Team Beta, has a new dream: to lead a team whose sole purpose is to protect those most vulnerable—shifter pups. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His new mate, Dean, shares his passion. As a child counselor, Dean is all too familiar with the darker side of the world when it comes to pups. If Sam can rescue them, Dean will do his best to help fix them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sanctioned by Team Alpha’s bossman, the great Ray Perkins himself, Alphabits is Sam’s baby. This new hand-picked team consists of five highly-trained wolf alphas—and one bumbling bear who couldn’t take a hint. As always with a new team, personalities will clash. But at the end of the day, they all share a common goal help lost, missing, and hurting children—starting with the needy wolf pup who lives across the street from Sam and Dean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Alphabits aren’t vigilantes. These former soldiers and officers of the law have to do things by the book—even when it tears them apart to do so. But once all their ducks are in a row, the bad guys had better beware! You do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want this team of protective alphas on your tail. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first in a new series in the Team A.L.P.H.A. world, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. Prepare your box of tissues and lock up your heart, because this book contains a fluffy little wolf pup who’s about to steal it away. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Killian knew his mate was out there. Being celibate in hopes he'll find his female hasn't been a hardship, but he's growing impatient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then he sees her. She's human, gorgeous, and will be his. He doesn't even know her name, but her smell is sugary and tells his possessive inner bear she's supposed to be his in all ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice planned a weekend of relaxation, but instead, she found herself mated to a bear shifter. Alice doesn't fight the attraction she has for Killian, not when she wants to be between the sheets with him in the worst possible way. Alice is single one day and mated to a growly bear shifter the next, but can it last forever?&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This title was previously published as Feral Cravings. It has had a complete overhaul, new content has been added, old content has been taken out, and it has been re-edited.*&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;”Shane is my stepbrother; he's family and strictly off-limits.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shane Prescott is a fun-loving omega with a knack for landing in trouble. He prides himself on efficiently running the waitstaff at his brother’s restaurant, Kamasouptra. Between his brother-slash-bestie, Keith, and his dog, Rocky, Shane doesn’t need anything else to make him happy. Love would be nice, but that ship sailed the day his mom married Keith’s dad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Keith Anderson is focused on two things: making Kamasouptra the premiere place to dine in Hollydale and not giving into his feelings for his stepbrother. For the past several years, his life has been running smoothly to the point of being in rut. Keith’s life begins to change when an offbeat old lady befriends him and starts to make Keith think that it’s time to alpha up and chase what he really wants. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Between a smarmy food critic, April Fools pranks gone wrong, and two helpful old coots who dispense their unsolicited folksy wisdom to the brothers—you’ll be in stitches as you root for a pair of men who are so busy trying to follow societal expectations that they’re oblivious to the clear signs that maybe… just maybe… they were never meant to have a brotherly relationship in the first place. Things are about to change in major ways for this pair of stepbrothers, if they can just be brave enough to take a chance for happiness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the eleventh book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 32k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Bundle includes: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just Ridley: Chosen Book 1 &lt;br /&gt;Ridley Scott and Flynn Becker have been making eyes at each other through the diner window for months. Ridley just doesn't have the confidence to approach a man so gorgeous and Flynn is worried about introducing his mate to the shifter world. But Ridley knows about shifters, and when Ridley's car breaks down close to the leap house, he get's pulled into leap life in a way none of them expected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grumpy Old Bear: Chosen Book 2 &lt;br /&gt;Thompsyn Lane is a grumpy, old, reclusive bear shifter that has no intention of changing anything about his life for anyone. So Imagine how shocked he is to find out his mate is a twenty-year-old leopard shifter who's barely even lived his life. What is he supposed to do with such a young mate? When he botches their first meeting and the Bennett thinks he's been rejected, he's going to have to work extra hard to win his mate over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sweet Sutton: Chosen Book 3 &lt;br /&gt;Sutton Hilliard has been sneaking around at night watching his sexy neighbor run around his backyard naked for months. And he's spent the same amount of time hiding from the man during the day. When he tries to save the man from being mauled by a bear and an leopard at the same time, he gets a crash course in shifters and a lot more... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>THIRDS agent Dexter J. Daley can’t wait to marry his fiancé, Team Leader Sloane Brodie, but first he’s looking forward to celebrating his bachelor party—which he intends to be a shenanigans-free evening of getting his groove on with family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course events don’t work out as planned, but for Dex that’s nothing new. One thing is for sure, dodging drug dealers and hired thugs amid booze, dancing—and even a bear costume—will guarantee it’s a night Dex will never forget. Now he just needs to survive all the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this bonus story from the THIRDS universe. These events occur between Darkest Hour Before Dawn and Tried &amp;amp; True in the series timeline. While reading this story would enhance your experience of the THIRDS series, it is not necessary to read before Tried &amp;amp; True.</description>

  <description>Crawford Russell &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Reed saved my life one night nearly five years ago when my drunken father almost killed me. I left town that night with my little sister and didn't come back until my father died two years later, and by that time, Lincoln was going to college out of state. I haven't seen him in person since that night, but we've kept in touch via text, call and video chat almost since I've been back to Crossville TN and falling more and more in love with him each day. Now he's coming back to town and needs a place to stay until he finds his own. In a moment of stupidity, I offer him the extra room in my house. I know I don't have a chance with the gorgeous man. He's a sleek, beautiful, educated man with a heart of gold, and I'm a grizzled bar owner who's scarily close to following in his father's alcoholic footsteps. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Reed &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Accepting Crawford's offer to come stay with him when I get back to Crossville is both a dream come true and absolutely terrifying. As a shifter, there is always that chance I'm going to find my mate which SHOULD deter me from falling in love with anyone who isn't him. Should. Hasn't. I'm head over heels for my brother's best friend and I'm about to be spending a lot more time with him. To say I'm shocked when I first see Crawford in person after five years––or more appropriately my first smell him––is an understatement, and it explains everything. My excitement is short lived when he disappears one day while I'm out, and a slip up from a streak member tells me I have every reason to be worried about what has happened to my mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lexic &lt;br /&gt;I'm a minion. Most of my kind don't venture out of their comfort zone to do anything beyond what the king they serve asks. It's just not in our nature. But I've never been like the rest of my kind. Though we have a king, even Grey would tell you I basically run the fifth kingdom. And I'm good at it. Really good. Unfortunately, my confidence in my abilities as an assistant to the king is really the only confidence I have. I know next to nothing about relationships. My comfort zone might be big for a minion, but it's still a zone with barrios I'm too scared to cross. And that is why I will never tell the man I want how I feel about him. There is just too much risk and I unfortunately know nothing about the possible reward. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blalock &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm old, I'm cranky and I've been pining for a man that can never be mine. I'm not good enough for him. All this time, I'd thought what I felt for Lexic was crazy. What normal person misses a man like he hasn't seen him in years when he literally just walked him to his bedroom door? That kind of obsession isn't normal, right? That's what I have thought these last four years. But then one night, Ragyn starts talking about his feelings for Grey and how all-consuming they are, and suddenly, I understand why I've been acting so crazy. Lexic is my mate. Unfortunately, it doesn't change anything. He's still way too good for me. He needs someone as extraordinary as him. Not a man whose life is predictable, but definitely not set in stone. Too bad I'd kill anyone who even though about touching him. So… I guess I'll just spend the rest of my life following this precious minion around, scaring off all the men that try to come into his life… and basically making him as miserable as I am. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cold Case Detective Ronan O'Mara is looking forward to starting a new life in his new home, but when a strange house warming gift appears on his doorstep, he has no idea that it marks the start of a series of events that will put his life and the lives of everyone close to him in danger. When murders similar to those committed by a dead serial killer, Rod Jacobson, start occurring around Boston, Ronan is certain he has a copycat killer on his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic Tennyson Grimm is approached by friends for help dealing with issues surrounding their son. He quickly realizes there is more going with the boy than teenaged angst. Though he doesn't want to believe it, his psychic abilities and a series of strange paranormal occurrences point to a link between the troubled teen and the murder victims that are turning up all over Boston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ronan is attacked during the investigation, it's up to Tennyson and Captain Fitzgibbon to find the killer without him. Will they be able to stop the murderer before the evil that surrounds him destroys them all?</description>

  <description>After a dramatic end to the Justin Wilson case, Psychic, Tennyson Grimm heads to a small island off the coast of Maine, hoping to clear his mind and renew his spirit. When the dead won’t let Tennyson rest, the psychic curses his gift and orders the spirits to leave him. He wakes the next morning to silence, and finds truth in the saying, "Be careful what you wish for.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Ronan O’Mara has been tasked by his boss with the chore of finding a more "sedate" cold case to investigate this time around. The handsome cop is only too happy to oblige. He chooses the twenty-year-old case of a family patriarch who was murdered on Christmas night, 1997. The only possible suspects are either his wife or his daughter, who were both with him at the time of his death. Ronan figures this one will be a piece of cake. All he has to do is get his favorite medium to talk to the deceased man's spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tennyson reveals the truth about what happened in Maine, he’s forced to take a hard look at who he thought he was, and what his gift really means. Ronan does his best to help his lover cope with his new normal while he uses good old-fashioned police work to figure out a family who put the 'dis' in dysfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Tennyson be able to find the key to unlock his gift, or will the spirits stay dead silent?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;10 hrs 8 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRDS Team Leader Sebastian Hobbs and Chief Medical Examiner Hudson Colbourn are as much in love now as they were nearly seven years ago when a tragic event on the job destroyed their relationship. The two drift together only to be pulled apart time and time again. When Hudson draws the interest of dangerous enemies, both within and outside the organization, Seb wants nothing more than to protect the man who still means everything to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As life and death events, an uncertain future, and startling truths draw Hudson and Seb to each other yet again, they must make a choice: trust their love and take strength from what they share, or lose what matters most for good this time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length : 3 hours and 4 minutes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Collins is a lonely omega. One by one, Tom's watched his friends pair up and find their forever mates while Tom goes out alone to flirt with randos at the Big O. Manager of Sweet Ballz, the popular candy shop in downtown Hollydale, Tom has his career on track. Now if he could just find an alpha to stick around for longer than a night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Colin Samuels is busy. As an alpha specializing in emergency medicine, he keeps a punishing schedule. He doesn't have time, patience or even the energy to take up with an omega. Especially not a sassy little brat like the one he keeps running into. All he wanted was one hot night with the guy, not forever. So why can't he get the frustrating twink out of his mind? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Tom finally find love? Will Dr. Samuels get that speculum dislodged from his rear pocket and give them a chance? And who is the little girl that hits both men right smack in the feels? And what's the story with Tofer O'Toole, the new cage dancer at the Big O? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the third book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 30k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kyle isn’t a victim… he’s a survivor who needs to learn his worth.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An omega who’s narrowly escaped an abusive relationship seeks shelter with his flirty friend and boss…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After low self-esteem sent Kyle into the arms of the wrong alpha—a cop with a Napoleon complex—he finds himself in an untenable situation that quickly escalates from bad to worse. After his relationship ends in the worst way imaginable, his boss takes him in, giving him a safe harbor and a friendly shoulder to lean on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;… an alpha with a gentle spirit and a heart of gold.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dallas has longed for a family of his own, and he’s had his eye on the tall, thick omega with the sweet nature and juicy… smile. After Kyle repeatedly turned him down for dinner dates and got into a bad relationship, Dallas backed off but couldn’t quit flirting with his friend/employee. He’d never have interrupted another person’s relationship, but darn it, he saw Kyle first! Besides, what’s a little flirtation between friends? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two men who are meant to be together but have a long road to get there.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dallas knows that Kyle doesn’t need another bossy alpha. He needs to find his own inner warrior and make peace with himself before they can be more than friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kyle is so obsessed with the size of his waist, that he almost misses his shot with the one alpha who will love him unconditionally in addition to being his best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A simple bet about getting fit can offer huge rewards in the heart department. But how his Kyle supposed to decrease his waistline and get that six-pack he’s always wanted if he finds himself pregnant? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This mm book contains mpreg, and intended for 18+ readers. Trigger warning: this book contains scenes of domestic abuse. Please be aware that while this is part of the story, it is only in the beginning and there is a guaranteed happy ending. Parts of this book are a little darker than you’re used to from Susi Hawke, but an HEA and all the laughs, naughty-knotty times, and shmoopy feels that you’d expect are definitely included! This book is about 48k&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When the spirit of a young male prostitute comes to psychic Tennyson Grimm asking him to find the john who brutally murdered him, Tennyson can’t say no. Only able to communicate through the use of images, rather than words, getting any information out of the young man is frustrating and slow going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold Case Detective Ronan O’Mara has been on a roll solving cases since he and Tennyson last teamed up to solve the Michael Frye case. Unfortunately, the red-hot romance that had blossomed between them during that investigation is now off in a ditch, thanks to Ronan’s self-confessed pigheadedness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to work together despite the rift in their relationship, Tennyson and Ronan discover they are in for more than they bargained for when more victims start to reveal themselves to Tennyson. &lt;p&gt;Realizing they might have a serial killer on their hands, the two men work tirelessly to stop this madman from killing again, but when the killer targets the son of a prominent member of the Boston Police Department, can Ronan and Tennyson save him before it’s too late?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The only thing about me that’s a size zero is the filter on my mouth. I’ve got a big personality, a big rack, and a big number on the scale. And I’m perfectly fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when some random guy suggests I might not be eating alone if I’d ordered a salad instead of a hamburger I’m shocked silent, which is a feat, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings us to one sexy fireman named Frankie Hartigan. He’s hot. He’s funny… And he’s just apologized for being late for our “date” then glared at the fat-shaming jerk. Next thing I know, he’s sitting down and ordering himself dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem telling him I don’t need a pity date… unless of course it’s to my high school reunion next week. Oops where did that last bit come from? And what do I do now that he’s said yes?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is no make-over story, and I think Frankie is using me for something. I just have to figure out what…</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For Ward “King” Kingston the role of protector, forged by fire and tragedy, is one he takes seriously. When King is asked to safeguard the son of a four-star general and friend, he is pulled back into the world of government black ops on a mission that raises painful memories from his past. The moment King meets Leo, amid the chaos of a lockdown at a secret black site, it’s clear he’s never faced a challenge like this—one that will test his unwavering sense of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leopold de Loughrey is a misunderstood genius whose anxiety and insecurities are sent into overdrive when he is forcefully recruited to work on a top-secret project. Terrified of what his role as "invaluable asset" means, Leo’s stress leads to disappearances, arguments, and blowups that threaten the project and Leo’s future. King’s arrival is a calm in the storm for Leo and his frenetic thoughts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King and Leo couldn’t be more different, yet as they navigate the dangers of a secret multi-agency operation and face unknown threats, their differences could be what saves them. Neither man believes a happily ever after is in the cards, but their hearts might just prove them wrong… if they can survive a deadly betrayal.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two broken omegas and one hard-edged alpha… three men who are stronger than they think… especially when they trust each other enough to be vulnerable.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A pair of omegas who are everything to each other...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only are they best friends, they’re also lovers. In all the years that they’ve been on the streets fighting to survive, they’ve had one end goal: to one day find an alpha strong enough to love both of them equally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An alpha without a purpose...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since his return to civilian life, Beaumont has yet to reconnect with society. Instead, he spends his nights running from nightmares and memories of war. While out on one of his nightly wanderings, the alpha catches sight of two of the prettiest angels he’s ever seen. Intrigued, he follows them home… only to find them taking refuge on a filthy, discarded mattress in an abandoned warehouse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three broken men who can heal each other’s wounds...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beau goes from stalker to protector in the blink of an eye when his angels need him to intervene in a bad situation. Before he realizes it's happening, life as he knows it changes to become something new and precious. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lukas is the protector. He’s tough, snarky, and would happily give his own life if necessary to protect his Gid. Time and time again, he’s proven his strength by rescuing Gideon from would-be attackers. Now he needs to find the courage to let go and trust Beau to protect them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sweet, angelic Gideon is used to being protected and adored. None of the horrible things in his life seem to affect him, because at the end of the day, he’s always had Lukas... and that’s all that matters. When the chips are down, can Gid discover his inner strength and step up to be an equal partner in this fragile new triad? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This mmm book contains mpreg, and intended for 18+ readers. Possible triggers for attempted sexual assault, violence, and breath play kink. Parts of this book are a little darker than you’re used to from Susi Hawke, but an HEA and all the laughs and shmoopy feels that you’d expect are definitely included!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Listening Length: 5 hours and 25 minutes.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Listening Length: 3 hours and 1 minute&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I vow to love you and protect you as my omega, my husband, and my mate. I vow to be a good father to every child born of your womb whether born of my seed or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian Hawkins, owner and operator of Greasy Fingers Garage in Hollydale is in a rut. His life is spent taking care of his business and looking after his younger brother Kent. The scent of cinnamon is everywhere as the alpha finds himself haunted by the memory of the omega that he ran into...literally...on his way home from work one night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the run from the abusive ex who had no desire to be a father to the child he carries, omega Liam Leigh finds himself homeless, hungry, alone, and pregnant in the sweet little town of Hollydale just a couple weeks before Thanksgiving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Christian and Liam both keep running into each other, as well as an odd little old man with a penchant for appearing just when he's most needed. But what's up with the unique golden tipped white feathers that keep popping up? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the second book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is 31k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. Caution for possible triggers: The homeless MC is an assault survivor. No assault scenes are shown, just a factual, non-detailed accounting of past events.</description>

  <description>Carson Craig, the West Side Psychic, has just had a vision. This shouldn’t be a strange occurrence since he makes his living offering people glimpses of “the other side.” The problem is that Carson is a fraud. He’s never even seen a glimmer of what the future holds, but now this vision of a green-eyed man, his chest bleeding from a gunshot wound, brings the charlatan-seer to his knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Human Resources Manager, Truman Wesley, has just fired an employee. Although unpleasant, it’s a normal part of his job. What makes this incident unusual is that the firing occurs three weeks before Christmas and the enraged employee vows to get his revenge. Truman is badly shaken after the incident but tries to put it out of his mind so he can enjoy his favorite time of year with his family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Carson wants to do when he sets out to find the handsome man in his vision is save the man’s life. It seems that fate and the hearts of these two men have other plans. As Christmas draws near, Carson finds himself falling in love and struggling to find a way to tell Truman the truth about what brought them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Truman discovers the truth about his lover all on his own and walks away from their relationship, will Carson be able to save him before these frightening visions become a reality?</description>

  <description>Like your favorite Hallmark Christmas movie...only way more gay.&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Dragon In Denial...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Wallace spread his wings (literally) and left Vale Valley for business school in the city the moment he was able. Ambitious and full of big ideas, he wanted to find his own place in the world. With an MBA under his belt and a startup business venture in New York, things are looking up. Until he gets the call that his mother has passed away and left him The Dozing Dragon, her bed and breakfast, in the will. Sebastian returns to his hometown, hoping to make it a quick trip. But when he reconnects with a sweet omega in the Valley, everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A Haunted Omega...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Sterling can see things no one should. In a town full of shifters and other paranormals, you'd think seeing ghosts would be no biggie. Afraid of his own power, Will does his best to live a "normal" life and keeps himself busy at the local garden shop. But things are starting to change in Vale Valley. The yearly fireworks show ended five years ago when a stray rocket sent the place up in flames. And now The Dozing Dragon's sudden closure fills Will with dread for what might come next. When the owner's son returns to town, dare he hope for a better future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Sebastian's help, can they save the Dozing Dragon and bring back the fireworks in time for Christmas? And does Will's secret power hold the key to both?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Mated Under The Mistletoe is the first book in a multi-author series about Vale Valley, a small town open to everyone in need of love and a home. Each installment can be read as a standalone. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains way too many dirty jokes, plants with a mind of their own, mpreg, and more sweets than Willy Wonka's factory. Pull up a chair, grab your hot cocoa, and settle in for this heartwarming holiday read!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Julian “Quinn” Quintero, a gruff, tough Miami SWAT officer, has been injured on the job, and all he’s looking for is a little peace and quiet to recover—difficult to achieve with his large Cuban family. An adventure in picking up his prescriptions puts him in the path of his geeky, brownie-baking neighbor, Spencer Morgan. Spencer sweeps into Quinn’s life like a tropical storm of sunshine and rainbows. Not surprisingly, it’s chaos at first sight. Quinn’s in need of a little tender loving care, and Spencer decides he’s just the man for the job. Their very different lives might clash, but they might also find some common ground—and maybe more.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eduardo “Lucky” Morales is a fighter, from his childhood days in Cuba to his time as a Special Forces Green Beret. Scarred by the wars of his past, Lucky has learned nothing lasts forever. Guarding his heart is second nature, and getting emotionally involved is not an option. As co-owner of Four Kings Security, Lucky works hard alongside his former brothers-in-arms and fellow Kings, but he also plays hard. Flirting with sexy Texas cowboy and detective Mason Cooper is too much fun to resist, until Mason turns the tables on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mason Cooper may not be a soldier, but he’s fought his share of battles as an openly gay cop and now a detective for Major Crimes. Mason has no idea when things changed between him and Lucky, but the gorgeous, fiery Cuban has turned his world upside down. When a mistake leads to his suspension from the force, Mason turns to the least likely person for help: Ward Kingston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to keep Mason at arms’ length, Lucky is surprised to find the man at Four Kings Security. The Florida nights might be getting cooler, but the heat between Lucky and Mason burns hotter with every passing moment. Working private security can be dangerous and unpredictable, but so can falling in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listening length:&lt;/b&gt; 7 hrs and 42 mins.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Listening Length: 3 hours and 29 minutes&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I will always love you, both in this life and the next. I vow to love you, honor you, and stay by your side through haunted houses, dead relatives, and random appearances of red croquet balls.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Milo is a mild-mannered omega who just wants to save his Sweet Ballz, the candy shop he owns on Main St. in Hollydale. Someday maybe he will find an alpha as awesome as the book boyfriends he reads about in the popular books by his favorite author. But for now, Milo is content to be at home curled up with his favorite romance books. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rafe is a lonely alpha trying to juggle his writing career while settling into the gorgeous old manor he's just purchased in quaint Hollydale. He just wants to have a home of his own away from the craziness of his rich, socialite family. All Rafe wants is peace and quiet to secretly write his popular romance novels, and to maybe someday find a sweet omega to love like the ones he writes about every night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rafe can't explain the odd happenings in his new home, or the strangely sweet little old lady who comes and goes, even when the doors are locked. Is he being gas-lighted or is there more going on? Rafe and Milo could be perfect for each other, if they can first overcome the red croquet balls that life keeps throwing at them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the first book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is 35k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>Former Special Forces medical sergeant Russell “Red” McKinley knows a thing or two about wounds, like the fact some can take a lifetime to heal, if they heal at all. The scars Red carries run deep, and living with PTSD often means battling the memories of his past. Injuries he received while working an executive protection case with fellow Kings and co-owners of Four Kings Security, have once again forced past heartaches to the surface, but Red is determined not to let it derail his blossoming romance with sweet and sexy fashion photographer Lazarus Galanos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laz can’t deny there’s something special developing between him and Red, but Laz has wounds of his own. He’s hesitant to jump into a new relationship after his recent explosive breakup. Experience has taught Laz to doubt his judgement when it comes to men. Guys who seem too good to be true, usually are, and no one appears more perfect than Red. &lt;br /&gt;When an attempt is made on Laz’s life, Red is determined to keep him safe. Laz may not be a client, and Red is still off duty, but Laz is one of their own, and nothing means more to the Kings than family. While an investigation is underway, Red and Laz are growing closer, but can they find a way to help each other heal and take a chance on love, or will their fears and insecurities cost them more than their future together?</description>

  <description>Demoted to the cold case squad after shooting a suspect in the line of duty, Detective Ronan O’Mara knows that his career with the Boston Police Department is hanging by a thread. His first assignment is the case of Michael Frye, a five-year-old boy who has been missing for seven years. With no new leads or witnesses to interview, Ronan has to start from scratch to solve this mystery. When he sees a handsome local psychic on television, Ronan figures he’s got nothing to lose in enlisting the man’s help to find Michael.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psychic Tennyson Grimm is riding high after helping South Shore cops find a missing child. He’s even being courted by the Reality Show Network about a program showcasing his abilities. He has no idea that his midday appointment with a customer, who instead turns out to be a police detective, is going to change the course of his life and his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the blessing of the BPD, which badly needs an image make-over, Ronan is allowed to bring Tennyson in to assist with the Frye case. Being thrown together in front of cameras is never easy, but add in an emotional missing person’s investigation, a tight-lipped spirit, and a cop who’s a skeptic, and it definitely puts a strain on both men and their working relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the child’s body is found, the work to identify his killer begins. As Ronan and Tennyson get closer to solving the case, the initial attraction they feel for one another explodes into a passion neither man can contain. &lt;p&gt;Will working together to bring Michael’s killer to justice seal their fledgeling bond, or will unexpected revelations in the case tear them apart forever?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When his lover Jason’s drug addiction spiraled out of control, TV celebrity chef and cookbook author Adam de Leon walked away from him. Adam also abandoned his renowned restaurant in San Francisco to start a small bistro in the Sierra Foothills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years later Adam is battling the conservative leaders of Stone Acres, California, to open a new restaurant in historic Old Town when Jason turns up on his doorstep—a recovered Jason, now going by the name David and claiming he's overcome his addictions. What’s more, he begs Adam to take him back and says he’s ready for their happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam has enough on his plate with problems plaguing the opening of his restaurant. And now he’s having a hard time deciding which to follow—his head or his heart.</description>

  <description>Even broken Lycans deserve happily ever after. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dakota Stone knew his PTSD and irreparably damaged body made him unworthy and condemned him to a mateless future. Resigned to his fate, Koda abandoned his pack choosing isolation over pity. Though not content, he’d mostly adapted to his new life. Then, Ella Quinn invaded Sanctuary turning his world upside down. The Irish spitfire was everything Koda wanted, but couldn’t have. He had to get rid of her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Veterinarian Ella Quinn devoted her career to rehabilitating the injured, aggressive, and displaced. She never imagined her life’s calling would apply to the man who despised her on sight. Dakoda Stone’s wounded soul called to her. Despite his antagonistic attitude, she found herself falling for him. Ella had to decide if fighting for Koda was worth the heartache she’d suffer if she lost the battle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wolf was fed up with Koda’s obstinance and decided it was time the beast became the master. When the opportunity arose, Wolf seized it, determined to make Ella theirs. Unfortunately, the outcome he envisioned didn’t happen. Now, they may have lost her forever unless they found a way to gain Ella’s forgiveness. Or was it too little, too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;7 hrs 58 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the fiercest Defense Agent at the THIRDS, Destructive Delta’s Ash Keeler is foul-mouthed and foul-tempered. But his hard-lined approach always yields results, evident by his recent infiltration of the Coalition. Thanks to Ash’s skills and the help of his team, they finally put an end to the murdering extremist group for good, though not before Ash takes a bullet to save teammate Cael Maddock. As a result, Ash’s secrets start to surface, and he can no longer ignore what’s in his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cael Maddock is no stranger to heartache. As a Recon Agent for Destructive Delta, he has successfully maneuvered through the urban jungle that is New York City, picking up his own scars along the way. Yet nothing he’s ever faced has been more of a challenge than the heart of Ash Keeler, his supposedly straight teammate. Being in love isn’t the only danger he and Ash face as wounds reopen and new secrets emerge, forcing them to question old loyalties.</description>

  <description>After an attack by the Coalition leaves THIRDS Team Leader Sloane Brodie critically injured, agent Dexter J. Daley swears to make Beck Hogan pay for what he’s done. But Dex’s plans for retribution are short-lived. With Ash still on leave with his own injuries, Sloane in the hospital, and Destructive Delta in the Coalition’s crosshairs, Lieutenant Sparks isn’t taking any chances. Dex’s team is pulled from the case, with the investigation handed to Team Leader Sebastian Hobbs. Dex refuses to stand by while another team goes after Hogan, and decides to put his old HPF detective skills to work to find Hogan before Theta Destructive, no matter the cost. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a lengthy and painful recovery ahead of him, the last thing Sloane needs is his partner out scouring the city, especially when the lies—however well intentioned—begin to spiral out of control. Sloane is all too familiar with the desire to retaliate, but some things are more important, like the man who’s pledged to stand beside him. As Dex starts down a dark path, it’s up to Sloane to show him what’s at stake, and finally put a name to what’s in his heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;7 hrs 6 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City’s streets are more dangerous than ever with the leaderless Order of Adrasteia and the Ikelos Coalition, a newly immerged Therian group, at war. Innocent civilians are caught in the crossfire and although the THIRDS round up more and more members of the Order in the hopes of keeping the volatile group from reorganizing, the members of the Coalition continue to escape and wreak havoc in the name of vigilante justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, someone inside the THIRDS has been feeding the Coalition information. It’s up to Destructive Delta to draw out the mole and put an end to the war before anyone else gets hurt. But to get the job done, the team will have to work through the aftereffects of the Therian Youth Center bombing. A skirmish with Coalition members leads Agent Dexter J. Daley to a shocking discovery and suddenly it becomes clear that the random violence isn’t so random. There’s more going on than Dex and Sloane originally believed, and their fiery partnership is put to the test. As the case takes an explosive turn, Dex and Sloane are in danger of losing more than their relationship.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When the cards are stacked against you, the Kings will even the odds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ex-Special Forces soldier Anston “Ace” Sharpe is fighting a different battle these days—one involving the world of private security across the state of Florida. As part owner of Four Kings Security, Ace and his fellow Kings tackle everything from armed transport and investigations to cyber intelligence and executive protection. Cocky, fearless, and brash, Ace isn’t afraid to take risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of working alongside his father, Colton Connolly is ready to take the helm at Connolly Maritime, but his father’s retirement is put on hold when Colton begins receiving death threats. If that isn’t bad enough, his father signs a contract with Four Kings Security to provide Colton with round-the-clock protection, despite his adamant refusal. Colton’s life has been turned upside down, the last thing he needs is a shadow, especially in the form of infuriating, sexy-as-sin Ace Sharpe, who seems to be on a mission to drive Colton mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparks fly the moment Colton and Ace meet on a sultry night club dance floor. But getting involved with a client, even one as fiery and beautiful as Colton Connolly, is a line Ace is unwilling to cross. Colton might be attracted to Ace, but he’d been burned before. He might be willing to put his life in Ace’s hands, but not his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Florida nights heat up, so does their passion, and Ace and Colton are faced with a difficult choice—take the plunge and risk it all, or play it safe and walk away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Ace can keep a deadly threat from robbing Colton of a future….</description>

  <description>Big, burly CEO Abe Behr is dismayed to discover someone—possibly a family member—is stealing from Behr Construction, which primarily employs Behr relatives. Abe takes the unprecedented step of hiring an outsider, likeable CPA Jeff Mason, to go over the books and help find the culprit. They are drawn to each other as they talk to workers, including Abe’s two younger brothers and their shifty cousin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since he has sacrificed romance all his life to build the business, Abe’s surprised by his feelings for the handsome Jeff. He’s even more shocked when they are confronted by bigotry in the Sierra Nevada foothills community, which is being inundated by gays moving from the San Francisco area. As he and Jeff get closer, Abe must come to grips with coming out to a family and community that aren’t very tolerant. Fortunately, being the head Behr helps him find his footing and grab onto love when it bites him.</description>

  <description>Every morning, Alexandra drinks in the sexy vision of Mr. Buff through his office window across the alleyway. He takes his workouts seriously, and Alexandra never misses the opportunity to see him return half-naked, sweaty and pumped, to his office suite to shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when Alexandra bumps into Mr. Buff, aka Andrew Carter, at a club, things go from visual to physical. Turns out Andrew enjoys the view from his office just as much as she does from hers and can’t take his hands off the woman who makes his blood roar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Andrew is framed for the murder of his secretary, Alexandra goes “undercover” to get the confession from the real killer. All the while, someone else wants her dead for exposing a massive embezzling scheme. With a laundry list of people who want Alexandra dead, Andrew will have a hard time trying to keep her alive long enough to ask her to marry him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;**Previously published as a short story under the same title. This is now a full length with over 35K words added to it.**</description>

  <description>Hollyster Roman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguing with Cowen over video chats it one of my absolute favorite things to do. And though we've never met, I've found that calling him to yell at him about the way he treats my people is the highlight of my week. But the man really does need a partner, and his boss insists it's someone from my department, so after several failed attempts at placing another agent with him, I take on the daunting task myself.&lt;br /&gt;Who knew fighting with Cowen in person rather than video chat would be even more… stimulating? When the boys from Purdy need our help to find out who all is on the side of the evil bastard Heath, we quickly realize just how well we work together. And we discover some other things too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowen Maxwell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having Hollyster in my house, taking over my space and being a general pain in my ass should be the torture. What's torture is realizing my little obsession with him is quickly turning into more. When the delphinium keeping me from catching his scent falls off in the middle of the night, it is suddenly very clear why I can't look at him without wanting. Why the idea of him leaving my house makes my stomach churn. Why the idea of using him as bait to get inside the bunker where Heath is keeping his new collection of chosen makes me so damn angry and utterly terrified. But will Hollyster be able to accept a cranky old man with a bad attitude as the man he spends forever with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>Shepard Stone &lt;br /&gt;It's probably not a very well kept secret that Camp Walt drives me absolutely insane. He pesters me at every turn, shows up at my place of employment and touches all my stuff and finds my cold, sometime rude demeanor humorous. It's like he finds all my buttons and tromps all over them. And yet, I have the most ridiculous crush on the man. Can't get him out of my head. When a few bounties, little gremlin hunters whose sole purpose in life is to hunt and kill hellhounds, are brave enough to show up on Terra Mortis in my lab, I manage to get away and pop up in the only place I've always known I will feel safe. Camp Walt's arms. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Camp Walt &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a shifter, not being able to smell the person I feel in my heart is probably my mate, means many, many frustrating encounters with an unfriendly being that I find incredibly endearing. When I find out he is a hellhound, I just know he has to be my mate and all I have to do is talk him into letting me scent him. When I finally just ask him on a date, I'm actually surprised when he agrees. But before I even get the chance to take him out, he's attacked, and due to what these little beasts can do to him if they catch him, I'm going to become his bodyguard and shadow. When Shepard agrees, I don't think he quite understands just how thorough I plan to be at my job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers.

  <description>Graham Ross &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night of my seventeenth birthday, I finally told my best friend I was gay…and he left town, not returning for a year and a half. A year and a half of short communications via social media and zero information on why he'd left. But deep down, I'd always known I'd run him off. Somehow, he knew that being gay wasn't the only secret I was keeping from him. I was also madly in love with him. Now, Witt is back and trying to pick up where we left off. The only problem is, I still have those feelings for him and I'm terrified when he finds out, he'll just leave like last time. I don't know if I can open myself up to feeling that kind of pain again because the year and a half that he spent away from me was almost more than I could handle, and the pain never got easier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witt Turner &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham had been my best friend since he walked through the doors of that boys home, a toe-headed little hellion who looked like he was ready to pick a fight with the first person to breathe on him wrong. There had always been that pull to be in his presence and I'd only started fighting it when I realized it wasn't just a pull to be his friend. When the beast in of me started pushing me to claim what wasn't ready to be claimed, I knew I needed to find out more about myself and what these urges were about. I hadn't planned on staying away, but once the truth started to unwind, I knew I had to learn to get myself under control before I could go back and claim my mate. Following him to Purdy is just another step to proving that I'm back for good, but it turns out to be one of the best things either of us has ever done when we both learn about chosen and find out the significance of Graham's gorgeous mark on his thigh. Unfortunately, I'm not the only one who followed Graham to Purdy and another man's unhealthy obsession means my plans to infiltrate my mate's life might need to be stepped up when I have to act as bodyguard to keep Graham safe. The only question is, will Graham appreciate the effort or have I already ruined my chances with the only man I've ever wanted? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>Marshall Matthew Dillon (Yes, my mother did that to me) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not having Thanksgiving with my family and missing my grandmother's stuffing was the only reason I'd finally caved and looked at all my social media feeds after avoiding them for months. When I find out my grandmother is really sick and in the hospital, of course I make the trip home to see her before it's too late. Though it's great to see my family, I know my home is no longer here in Oregon. It's back in Nebraska with all my new and interesting friends. And when my grandmother finally gets released from the hospital, I decide to go back. Unfortunately, my brother and his friend have other plans and I'm suddenly very aware that my brother was the reason I was kidnapped and held like a prisoner for so long in the first place. Thankfully my friend comes to my rescue. With help. With really, sexy, really my type help. Help that makes it clear he isn't ready to be tied down. Isn't that just my luck? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quinn Davenport &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I told my friend he was going to have to introduce me to a few chosen when I came to visit, I'd honestly been joking. I was by no means ready for a mate. I still had wild oats to sow or however that saying goes. I'm twenty-five, I'm not supposed to metaphor yet. Really, when I came to Purdy, Nebraska, I'd been hunting a purpose, hoping being close to my long lost friend and a random group of shifters would give me some idea what I wanted to do with my life. But there's been a scent in the leap house that I keep catching bits of and I can't seem to control this need I have to hunt its source. Which leads me to the bedroom door of Marshall Dillon, the missing chosen that had been living there for months. It looks like my mate might have been kidnapped again. And though I'm not sure what I'm going to do with him once I find him, I know that I can't just let him be sold to someone else. But how am I supposed to live the life I want and find my purpose if I have a mate tagging along? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s true. I’m not what most people would call “pretty” and, well, high school was rough. Fast forward ten years and life is good… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a bunch of jerks think it’s hilarious to put the “butterface” (AKA me) on a wedding Kiss Cam with the hottest guy ever—and that old humiliation hits hard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize him immediately. The sexiest cop in Waterbury and totally out of my league. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then he kisses me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we totally forget the room, the crowd, everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he tells everyone we’ve been dating for months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon everything starts to feel too real, from adorable fights over “necessary” tools to fix my broken porch to surviving a free-for-all dinner with his six siblings to picking up where our last kiss left off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there’s something he’s not telling me about why he’s really hanging around, and I’m pretty sure it has to do with my mob-connected brothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is not a make-over story, and Cinderella is only a fairy tale…&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Deck the halls with knives, chains, and dangerous children’s toys!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Team Alpha is celebrating the holidays, but a surprise blizzard has snowed them in at Bossman and Papa P’s house, along with a few friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not that Papa P minds. He’ll take any excuse to keep his loved ones close and stuff them full of good food. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It’s not only snow that’s flying through the air, however. Omega counselor Dean and Team Beta leader Sam may have found more than a little holiday cheer while joining the team’s holiday festivities. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without Bossman and Papa P recounting the joy of their anniversary… and the hard times that came before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is best enjoyed if you’ve already read the previous Team Alpha stories, as there are plenty of in-jokes, purple sparkly knives, and growing children sprinkled throughout this tale. As always, you can expect some naughty knotty fun, humor not suitable to share with your mother-in-law, and all your favorite characters. Trigger warnings: graphic violence and mention of human trafficking. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An MM Mpreg Romance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jonah McKiernan has a phobia of germs, dirt, and the government, so naturally his mate turned out to be an FBI agent who he found near death at the back of a shipping container under piles of filth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matthew Hutchins had been working undercover for years, until a fellow agent--and former friend--exposed him to cover up his own dirty dealings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Matthew is determined to bring his betrayer to justice, and Team ALPHA finds out that maybe their loose ends aren’t completely tied up. But while Jonah wants to go full shifter justice on their remaining enemies, Matthew is a man of the law and will not budge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But sometimes, you have to fight dirty to get clean, and both men’s core beliefs will be challenged as they approach the final showdown. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the sixth book in this exciting series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and occasional violence. Be prepared for copious and inappropriate uses of sanitizer, the return of STAHP, and all your favorite characters. Trigger warnings: graphic violence and mention of human trafficking. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cain McKiernan had been told his brother Jonah was dead, and he’d never believed it. But what else could he do? An unprotected omega kid on the streets was as good as dead… or worse. But even as an adult, Cain hasn’t been able to escape. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Team A.L.P.H.A. captured him, thinking he worked for the cartel, and one of them tortured him. Until his mate found him. Until his brother saw him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ezra Dempsey isn’t sure he can forgive his twin brother for carving a tic-tac-toe board on his mate’s chest. His beautiful, scared, broken but strong mate. Ezra will do anything to protect his mate, even if it means choosing Cain over his brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But his brother isn’t the biggest danger they face. The cartel that took Cain from Jonah so many years ago is still out there, and they need to pay. Cain knows all the secrets, and if the team will just trust him, they may be able to take down one of the largest threats to shifters ever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the fifth book in this exciting series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and occasional violence. Be prepared for way too many kids running around and more than one unexpected pregnancy. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trigger warnings: graphic violence, mention of past trauma and human trafficking&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An MM Mpreg Romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pax is the mysterious, faceless hacker the team turns to when their usual sources fail--and he likes to keep it that way. But when one of their information requests ends up with his bunker being raided by the cartel, they’re the only ones he can turn to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zeke Dempsey is raw, rough, and utterly unprepared for the lipstick clad spitfire that suddenly bursts into his life, claiming both his heart and his dull knife. He always thought finding your true mate made the whole falling in love thing easy--he couldn’t have been more wrong. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pax’s past hasn’t given him any reason to trust anyone, and just because Zeke’s his true mate doesn’t change that. Can Zeke unlock Pax’s fashionably armored heart amidst the distractions of fighting the cartel, rescuing omegas, and meeting Zeke’s family? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the fourth book in our top-selling series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. No humans were harmed in the writing of this book—unless they kinda deserved it. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An MM Mpreg Romance.</description>

  <description>An MM Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;David Dempsey, the younger omega brother of Team ALPHA’s crazy twin duo, has gone missing after a camping trip with some human friends. He'd only planned to celebrate his upcoming college graduation—but somehow ended up taken captive by a sketchy group after catching them in a criminal act when he wandered too far away from his group. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Simon "Boomer" Chiarelli is a laid-back alpha with a love for things of an incendiary nature—but nothing has ever been as explosive as the connection he feels when he catches the scent of his mate. But why, of all the shifters on the planet, does his mate have to be related to the twins? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can Team ALPHA stay united when tension breaks out among their own? Between dodging Zeke’s famous knife and Ezra’s penchant for hitting things—while still trying to connect with his new mate—Boomer’s life is about to blow-up in a whole new way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the third book in our top-selling series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence.

  <description>For Ward “King” Kingston the role of protector, forged by fire and tragedy, is one he takes seriously. When King is asked to safeguard the son of a four-star general and friend, he is pulled back into the world of government black ops on a mission that raises painful memories from his past. The moment King meets Leo, amid the chaos of a lockdown at a secret black site, it’s clear he’s never faced a challenge like this—one that will test his unwavering sense of control. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leopold de Loughrey is a misunderstood genius whose anxiety and insecurities are sent into overdrive when he is forcefully recruited to work on a top-secret project. Terrified of what his role as "invaluable asset" means, Leo’s stress leads to disappearances, arguments, and blowups that threaten the project and Leo’s future. King’s arrival is a calm in the storm for Leo and his frenetic thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King and Leo couldn’t be more different, yet as they navigate the dangers of a secret multi-agency operation and face unknown threats, their differences could be what saves them. Neither man believes a happily ever after is in the cards, but their hearts might just prove them wrong… if they can survive a deadly betrayal.</description>

  <description>Eduardo “Lucky” Morales is a fighter, from his childhood days in Cuba to his time as a Special Forces Green Beret. Scarred by the wars of his past, Lucky has learned nothing lasts forever. Guarding his heart is second nature, and getting emotionally involved is not an option. As co-owner of Four Kings Security, Lucky works hard alongside his former brothers-in-arms and fellow Kings, but he also plays hard. Flirting with sexy Texas cowboy and detective, Mason Cooper, is too much fun to resist, until Mason turns the tables on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mason Cooper may not be a soldier, but he’s fought his share of battles as an openly gay cop and now a detective for Major Crimes. Mason has no idea when things changed between him and Lucky, but the gorgeous, fiery Cuban has turned his world upside down. When a mistake leads to his suspension from the force, Mason turns to the least likely person for help: Ward Kingston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to keep Mason at arms’ length, Lucky is surprised to find the man at Four Kings Security. The Florida nights might be getting cooler, but the heat between Lucky and Mason burns hotter with every passing moment. Working private security can be dangerous and unpredictable, but so can falling in love.&lt;br /&gt;k.</description>

  <description>Look but don’t touch. That’s the rule concerning dancers at Sapphire Sands, the prestigious members-only nightclub where Seth works at as a bartender. Seth has never had a problem following the rules until the day one of the dancers falls into his lap. Literally. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit loves his job dancing at Sapphire Sands. Every day his job brings him closer to his dream of opening his own dance studio, so risking it all on the hot bartender is not an option. Or is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short can be read as a standalone even if you haven't read any of the books in the series.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Take one pregnant omega who’s all alone in the world…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After accidentally getting pregnant by his best friend and occasional hookup buddy, Owen Grant finds himself on his own… again. After being abandoned at birth and growing up in the foster system, he’s used to having to say goodbye. If he's learned one lesson in life, it's this: people don't stay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Add in one alpha who just won’t leave…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Austin Logan is a quirky alpha who’s accepted that he’ll never marry and have a family of his own. His focus is on being the favorite uncle to all of his brothers' kids. He’s happy with the well-maintained and structured routine of his life, and doesn’t need anything more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mix in one fake marriage of convenience…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meeting Owen shakes things up in Austin’s world. He has to beg and barter with the guy to convince him to accept his help, even going so far as to sign a prenup that absolves Owen of any rights to Austin’s wealth, just to get him to agree to a fake marriage that will provide him with the medical insurance he so desperately needs for himself and his unborn child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And remember not to fall in love with your fake groom!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What happens when your fake husband turns out to be an awesome dad to your child and doesn’t seem in any hurry to let you go? And what if you slowly find yourself falling for the stranger you married? You sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the final book in the Lone Star Brothers series. This mm book contains mpreg, and is intended for 18+ readers. This 60k novel is a slow-burn strangers to friends to lovers romance with all the feels you’re used to from Susi Hawke, and definitely includes an HEA and all the laughs, naughty-knotty times, and family fun you’d expect!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Secrets always come out in the end.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you’re having a fling with your brother’s best friend…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Houston is a hot, snarky omega who will do anything for those he loves. He’s only done one sneaky thing in his life, and that was going to come out as soon as his secret boyfriend, Cody, got home from his latest tour of duty. Once they announced their relationship to his family, especially his brother who was a former squadmate and good buddy of Cody’s, things would be fabulous. What could possibly go wrong? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;…but then the alpha soldier goes MIA after a chopper crash while on mission.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cody was held captive by insurgents after his helicopter went down. When he finally gets home a year later, he’s battling a severe case of PTSD along with partial amnesia. He has no memory of being involved with his buddy’s sexy little brother with the cute-as-a-bug baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two men who started with the best intentions until life pulled them apart.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How can Houston tell anyone, let alone Cody, that he’s the father of his baby when the anxious soldier doesn’t seem to remember having so much as dated him? Heck, Cody still thinks of him as the teen kid who came to see his brother graduate from basic training. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Skip ahead a few years, and Cody is enthralled by Baxley, Houston’s sweet three-and-a-half-year-old son. He’s kicking himself for not having asked the guy out when he had a chance. What would he have to offer him now? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A simple lab test for a desperately ill child is all it takes for secrets to emerge and Cody’s world to tilt on its axis. Cody and Houston have decisions to make. It will take faith, hope, the support of family, and maybe even a lifesaving gift to make things work out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This mm book contains mpreg, and intended for 18+ readers. Trigger warning: this book contains scenes of a sick child and an adult living with PTSD. Grab your kleenex because this 50k novel has triple the feels you’re used to from Susi Hawke, and definitely includes an HEA and all the laughs, naughty-knotty times, and family fun you’d expect!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Kyle isn’t a victim… he’s a survivor who needs to learn his worth.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An omega who’s narrowly escaped an abusive relationship seeks shelter with his flirty friend and boss…&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After low self-esteem sent Kyle into the arms of the wrong alpha—a cop with a Napoleon complex—he finds himself in an untenable situation that quickly escalates from bad to worse. After his relationship ends in the worst way imaginable, his boss takes him in, giving him a safe harbor and a friendly shoulder to lean on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;… an alpha with a gentle spirit and a heart of gold.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dallas has longed for a family of his own, and he’s had his eye on the tall, thick omega with the sweet nature and juicy… smile. After Kyle repeatedly turned him down for dinner dates and got into a bad relationship, Dallas backed off but couldn’t quit flirting with his friend/employee. He’d never have interrupted another person’s relationship, but darn it, he saw Kyle first! Besides, what’s a little flirtation between friends? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two men who are meant to be together but have a long road to get there.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dallas knows that Kyle doesn’t need another bossy alpha. He needs to find his own inner warrior and make peace with himself before they can be more than friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kyle is so obsessed with the size of his waist, that he almost misses his shot with the one alpha who will love him unconditionally in addition to being his best friend. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A simple bet about getting fit can offer huge rewards in the heart department. But how his Kyle supposed to decrease his waistline and get that six-pack he’s always wanted if he finds himself pregnant? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This mm book contains mpreg, and intended for 18+ readers. Trigger warning: this book contains scenes of domestic abuse. Please be aware that while this is part of the story, it is only in the beginning and there is a guaranteed happy ending. Parts of this book are a little darker than you’re used to from Susi Hawke, but an HEA and all the laughs, naughty-knotty times, and shmoopy feels that you’d expect are definitely included! This book is about 48k&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;***STORY PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED AS PART OF AN ANTHOLOGY***&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This SHORT STORY was previously published as part of the Heart2Heart Anthology. As the anthology is no longer available, and the story universe is being expanded into a series, this story is being offered as the first book in the Compromised series, serving as the prequel. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;No new content has been added, so if you purchased the anthology, there is no need to own this version unless you would like to own a second copy with updated cover.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lymond:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Relationships are a challenge for anyone, but when you’re a deadly assassin leading a double life, losing your heart can mean losing your life. I gave up on happy ever after a long time ago, so when my annoying younger brother Jerrott sets me up on a blind date—through a dating app no less—I’m quick to make my displeasure known. Talked into not letting down the poor loser expecting me to show up, I give in. If anything, I’ll at least get laid. What could it hurt? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daniel:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What’s wrong with a little romance? For once I’d like to wake up to the sound of a man murmuring sweet nothings in my ear rather than the sound of him hitting the bushes after a swift getaway through my bedroom window. I’m done with gorgeous guys who are nothing but trouble. As it stands, the only boys drooling over me are the playful pups I walk for a living. With Valentine’s Day quickly approaching, I let my bestie talk me into yet another blind date. Is it too much to hope for that I’ll meet the man of my dreams? I guess there’s only one way to find out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please note that this short story was previously titled The Assassin and The Dog Walker and published as part of the Heart2Heart anthology. Due to the nature of the anthology, a specific wordcount was required. &lt;br /&gt;The story can be read as a standalone with a HEA. Although the story has gone through additional edits since its original release, no new content has been added. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Renowned interior designer Fredi Zimmer is surprised when outdoorsman Max Greene, owner of Greene’s Outdoors, hires Fredi to revamp his rustic cabin in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Fredi is an out-and-proud Metro male whose contact with the outdoors is from his car to the doorway of the million-dollar homes he remodels, and Max is just too hunky for words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Max comes on to Fredi, the designer can't imagine why. But he’s game to put a little spice into Max’s life, even if it’s just in the colors and fixtures he’ll use to turn Max's dilapidated cabin into a showplace. Who can blame a guy for adding a little sensual pleasure as he retools Max’s life visually?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max, for his part, is grateful when Fredi takes him in hand, both metaphorically and literally. Coming out is the most exciting and wonderful time in his life, despite the conservative former friends who think they’re saving him from sliding into hell.</description>

  <description>Barista Jimmy Patterson thinks it's a good idea to get rip-roaring drunk on his birthday after he’s dumped by his boyfriend. When the burly owner of Stonewall’s Saloon rescues Jimmy, the night starts to look up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Jimmy just wants to know the bartender's first name since he's worn a different name tag every time Jimmy's seen him. "Guy" Stone gives Jimmy seven guesses, one for each night he takes Jimmy out on a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Jimmy’s trying to come up with his name, he's distracted by the destruction of his coffee shop and what looks more and more like a hate crime.</description>

  <description>Ragyn (I just got freed. I don't have an effing last name yet but I'll probably be writing Wright in all my notebooks.) &lt;br /&gt;I'm free. I don't know why my father has decided to let me off my tightly wielded leash when he has been so adamant about controlling my every move until now, but I wasn't going to argue, even if I do think it's too good to be true and he's going to change his mind eventually, I'm going to enjoy my taste of freedom and spend as much time as demonly possible in the sun. Logically, I'm going to visit my brother and his odd group of friends because I literally have no one else. The only problem is he seems to always be around. Grey Wright, king of the fifth kingdom of the demon realm. The ex fiancé of my brother and the man that has been my obsession since I nosily poked around to find out all I could about him when I thought he was going to take my brother from me. Obviously, since Karney is now mated to Cast, I don't have to feel guilty about wanting him anymore. Not that it really matters. How can a man who has nothing offer anything to a man who has everything? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grey Wright &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My mate. After over a thousand years, I've finally found my mate. And he's the brother to the man I was once engaged to. He's beautiful and sassy and a bit cagey and I truly adore all of those things about him. Now if I could just get rid of that vulnerability in his eyes. He's been through a lot and it's going to take some serious strength to convince him he is worthy of a loving mate who would burn worlds to the ground for him if necessary, but I'm a demon king, I definitely have the strength. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>This story is a prequel to the Trillium Creek series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finn is focused on continuing the success of his family's bakery. Eventually, he'll settle down with an alpha and start a family, but for now, he's content to satisfy his needs with casual hook-ups. Then a gorgeous stranger walks into the bakery, and Finn's whole world shifts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Levi's father was a wolf shifter, but he was raised by his human mother and—like most hybrids—has never shown any wolf characteristics. That all changes when he enters Lupine Bakery and every instinct tells him the omega behind the counter is his. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both Finn and Levi try to ignore what their hearts and bodies are telling them, but an unexpected pregnancy may force them to face what fate has in store. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trillium Creek Book 1: Love at Long Last is coming soon.</description>

  <description>Griff: I learned early on that the easiest way to avoid a broken heart is to always be the first out the door. Caring about anyone or anything is asking to be disappointed, which is why I avoid relationships and chase freelance gigs — ghost writing restaurant reviews and penning articles about the efficacy of cheesy pick up lines — instead of chasing my dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Besides, dreams don’t come true for people like me. And no one, not even the sexy-as-hell bartender at the club can convince me otherwise. Because I’m never risking my heart again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sam: As a bartender I’ve watched a million pick-up artists work their magic, but none as talented as Griffin Marian. He’s a flirt, a good time. Hooking up with him was supposed to be just a fling. I wasn’t supposed to care abut his fractured past or his buried dreams. I have my own future to worry about, especially after that stupid food critic scuttled my hopes of finally opening my own restaurant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, the more time I spend with Griff, the more I’m beginning to realize that my plans mean nothing without him. If only I can convince him to give us a chance to follow our dreams together. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: this book includes flirty sweetness, detailed descriptions of man parts touching, and the dirtiest thing to come out of Aunt Tilly's mouth yet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grounding Griffin is the fourth book in the best-selling Made Marian series. It can be read on its own but is much more fun read as part of the series. The series begins with Borrowing Blue and each book follows a Marian brother's search for his HEA.</description>

  <description>Keller: After watching my long-time crush marry the man of his dreams, I realize I’m not so much heartbroken as envious. I want what they have – love, companionship, a hot body to tangle the sheets with. But as long as I’m spending most of my time at the vineyard, I’ll never meet someone like that, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I stumble into Aunt Tilly’s art class and catch sight of the nude model in the center of the room. I can’t stop thinking about all of the ways I’d want him to pose if I was ever lucky enough for a solo session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eli: When my brother convinces me to take his place as a nude model for a painting workshop in Napa, I reluctantly agree. What harm could come from dangling my naughty bits in front of a room full of tittering old women? But those little ladies are actually dirty-mouthed matchmakers in disguise and my entire concept of being laid bare is put to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I’m figuring out how to handle the gossiping artists, the handsome host shows up to paint me into a corner.</description>

  <description>Jude: Reaching the top of the country music charts brings out the crazy, and there’s no one crazier than my ex. Unfortunately, his threats to out me are escalating. Enter the bodyguard of my dreams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’d probably chafe under his constant presence if his attention to my body wasn’t so… ah… thorough. Now I have to worry about outing myself to millions of fans if I can’t keep my hands off him in public. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Derek: Now I’m an ex-Marine turned babysitter. If I have to hear Jude sing his mega-hit Bluebells one more time, I might murder him myself, and after 6 years in special ops, I know my way around a weapon. Unfortunately, so does he. Except his arsenal includes washboard abs and a killer set of pipes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I’ve faced guns, knives, explosives and yet it’s Jude Marian who may end up bringing me to my knees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Jude and Derek's story contains frequent detailed scenes of man parts touching, little old ladies being inappropriate, and two lonely hearts coming together in perfect harmony. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While it can also be read on its own, Jumping Jude is the third in the Made Marian series. Each book tells the story of one of the Marian brothers' search for true love. The first in the series, Borrowing Blue, is available now on Amazon.</description>

  <description>Teddy: If there’s one thing I don’t do, it’s commitment. You don’t become an award-winning photographer by staying in one place. I’m always on the road, looking for the next shot, the next award, the next hot body. Which is how I end up on Dr. James Marian’s front porch in the middle-of-nowhere Alaska. He’s known as the Wildlife Whisperer, and I want to photograph him in action. He’s reluctant at first, but I can be persuasive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon enough I have him in bed saying yes over and over and over again, but my ability to shoot and scoot is frozen by a Denali snowstorm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jamie: I always thought of myself as the marrying type. Until I got left at the altar. Now I have a new motto: never commit and never fall in love. So when a cocky nature photographer decides I’m the key to his next masterpiece, it seems like the perfect arrangement: the hotshot’s only in town for a brief assignment and then he’ll be gone. No commitment, no strings, and no chance of getting my heart broken again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s just one problem: I think I’m falling in love. Now I’m afraid that maybe I’m the marrying type after all. And he definitely is not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Jamie and Teddy's story contains scenes of delicious man parts touching, Aunt Tilly dropping F-bombs, and two stubborn hearts finding each other in the wilds of Alaska. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While it can also be read on its own, Taming Teddy is the second in the new Made Marian series. Each book tells the story of one of the Marian brothers' search for true love. The first in the series, Borrowing Blue, is available now on Amazon.</description>

  <description>When Brad opens his Vegas hotel room door to find a hot police officer waiting on the other side, he assumes crazy Aunt Tilly has sent him a strip-o-gram. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead of getting naked, Detective Gorgeous pulls out his cuffs — turns out, the badge and uniform aren’t just props, this cop is the real deal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brad is a free 10k word short story in the Made Marian series by best-selling author Lucy Lennox. It can be found here: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instafreebie.com/free/LrvnV" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.instafreebie.com/free/LrvnV&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Blue: When my ex walks into the resort bar with his new husband on his arm, I want nothing more than to prove to him that I've moved on. Thankfully, the sexy stranger sitting next to me is more than willing to share a few kisses in the name of revenge. It gets even better when those scorching kisses turn into a night of fiery passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem? Turns out the stranger's brother is marrying my sister later this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tristan: I have one rule: no messing with the guests at my vineyard resort. Of course the one exception I make turns out to be the brother of the woman my brother's about to marry. Now we're stuck together for a week of wedding activities, and there's no avoiding the heat burning between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fine, we make a deal: one week. One week to enjoy each other's bodies and get it out of our system. Once the bride and groom say I do and we become family, it'll all be over between us. Right? &lt;br /&gt;Fair warning: Blue and Tristan's story contains smoking hot scenes of man parts touching, pee-in-pants descriptions of grannies cursing, and the sweet improbability of two strangers finding their happily ever after when they least expect it.</description>

  <description>Edmond Aldridge &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I want what my brother has. Well, not exactly. As great as Carpenter is, he doesn't do it for me. But I want the love, devotion and crazy attraction he has with his mate. I want someone to look at me the way they look at each other. The way most of the leap looks at each other. After a horrible relationship with a man who tended to like to hurt me and not in a good way, I just want to find that one man who will treat me like I'm something special and not something to be abused and left behind. Ever since I first saw Axel, I had hoped I could have that with the tiger shifter from Tennessee who is visiting the leap as a favor to his alpha. But as drawn as I am to the man, he doesn't seem to have any interest in me. I guess I'm just not meant to be his after all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Axel Oakes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm not meant to have a mate. A head injury when I was young left me with a sense of smell barely better than that of a human's. Though I've learned to work around it for the most part, I know I probably won't be able to sense my mate even if I was standing right on top of him. As tempting as it is to spend a little time with the adorable little Edmond, I have absolutely nothing to offer someone so perfect when I'm so flawed and I'm not here for a hookup anyway. My alpha has sent me to see if our streak can come meet the chosen. While I don't agree with it or how he plans on making our streak whole again, I have to do my duty. When Edmond's ex shows up in Purdy and tries to hurt the precious little human, this redneck tiger with little to no sense of smell isn't about to let anyting happen to him because even if I can't smell Edmond Aldridge, he tastes like mine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cast Edwards &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm in love with my roommate and best friend. I know, I know. It's been done before. It’s stupid. It's a terrible position to put myself in. There is just something that keeps pulling me in his direction and I can’t seem to break its hold. And I can't tell him either. Karney Hill is just too perfect and pure and all around WAY too good for me. So I’m content to just be his friend for the rest of forever and enjoy the perfection of Karney in the only way available to me. But when his brother comes to Terra Mortis claiming Karney is betrothed to someone else, I claim him as mine in the heat of the moment, outing my feelings and starting something I don’t understand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karney Hill &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the first moment I saw him, I had this feeling Cast was mine. Which didn’t make a bit of sense considering water nymphs don’t have mates. And I don’t know enough about my demon half to even guess, but I’ve never heard of anyone on my father’s side having mates either. I guess it doesn’t really matter anyway, because my father promised me to someone else before I was born and apparently, my time is up. But when a get a strange visitor, things suddenly start to make a little more sense and maybe the prospect of belonging to Cast isn't so out of reach. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first rule of business is that you don’t mix it with pleasure. But if you &lt;/i&gt;do&lt;i&gt; get involved with your business partner? Try not to knock him up… it goofs up the dividends.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tired of the playboy lifestyle, Gabe Smythe is ready for change. To start his new life, he’s come to Hollydale with one goal—to reunite with his long-lost brother, Rafe. Along the way, if he happens to meet a sweet omega who’d make a nice little homemaker, even better! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cody Harper isn’t looking to settle down, and he’s definitely not ever tying himself to anyone. Casual sex and friends with extra-special benefits? Sure! Romance and relationships? Nope. Not gonna happen—especially not with Gabe, his sexy business partner at Nut Juices, the hot new smoothie shop they run together with the help of their quirky employee, Tofer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can their friendship and partnership survive an accidental pregnancy? As Cody and Gabe laugh their way from partners… to friends with bennies… to co-parents, they’ll discover that life isn’t always black and white, and sometimes a little compromise comes in handy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky, holiday romance full of all the fluffy feels and sweet heat that you’d expect from a Hollydale story. This is the tenth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 34k novel and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;You can’t plan when you’ll fall in love—sometimes it just kinda sneaks up on you.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Todd Foxx was only looking to unwind from the stress of running The Sausage Shack when he went out for an evening of fun at The Big O. After he ended the evening by hooking up with a hot new alpha in town, he certainly never thought he’d see him again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugo Keller left his high-profile job as a certified cicerone back east and moved across country to take a brewmaster job in Hollydale’s unique beer garden and sausage restaurant. A single dad, his only plans involved giving his young son a place to put down roots and focusing on his new job—even if it was a major step down from where he began. He certainly never expected to see his smoking hot one night stand again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can two men—and one precocious little boy—find a way to make a family? As Hugo and Todd slowly journey from lovers to coworkers to friends and back to lovers, they’ll need to deal with an ex-wife with boundary issues, a surprise pregnancy, and mysterious “mill girls” who like to giggle in the night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with a quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels and sweet heat that you’d expect from a Hollydale story. This is the ninth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 42k novel and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes love will come in the most unexpected places.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scott is a YouTuber known for his popular &lt;i&gt;Outdoor Omega&lt;/i&gt; adventure videos. While on a trip through the Winnipeg area to film a zip lining adventure, he detours to a small neighboring town for their annual sugaring off festival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Justin is a seasoned constable with the RCMP… yep, he’s a hot, alpha Mountie and Scott can’t stop sneaking peeks at the guy who seems to pop up around every corner. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Through a weird twist of fate—and a little help from a local legend named Amik—Scott and Justin find themselves stranded together in a remote cabin for several days. The two hit it off with an almost instant connection, but Scott is an American whose travel visa is about to expire and his law-abiding Mountie isn’t about to let him stay illegally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to the world of Hollydale with quirky romance full of all the fluffy feels that you’d expect from a Hollydale novella. This is the eighth book of The Hollydale Omegas series but is absolutely able to be read as a standalone. This is a 26k novella and definitely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>An M/M Omegaverse Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The best gifts in life will sometimes catch you by surprise.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luke is a YouTuber known for his popular &lt;i&gt;Omega Manny Diary&lt;/i&gt; videos. After a brief-yet-secret fling with his boss Ian’s best friend, he finds himself left with an even larger secret: Grazer’s baby. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grazer had a lot of fun with Luke, but he’d been upfront with him from the beginning. He’d always preferred to chase silver foxes—not young, fertile pups. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nearly two years after their last hot night together, Grazer returns to Hollydale, fresh from a year of guarding the toddler of a celebrity. He’s at loose ends, not to mention lonely, and wondering if maybe he’d been too brash when writing off love and fatherhood in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Grazer runs into Luke and discovers his life-altering secret, can they find a way to forgive the mistakes of the past and grab their second chance at romance? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for this second chance, secret baby romance where May learns to be the December in an age gap relationship. This is the seventh book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 34k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I know you're not the kind of omega who needs an alpha to protect him. You’re strong enough on your own. That's why you're my bromega... a bro who happens to be an omega that I would give anything for... "&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Greg may be an omega, but he doesn't let that define him. Aside from his almost compulsive need to clean, the most important thing to him is his job as the long-time bartender at The Big O. Greg is far from a delicate omega. In fact, he’s the same size as his best friend - an alpha who he always falls back into bed with when they’re between relationships. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braden is a casual kind of alpha bro. He spends his time - and makes his money - playing video games. A slacker who never leaves the house, let alone bothers with unnecessary details like getting dressed, Braden is happy to settle into a non-relationship agreement with his bestie. It’s not like they’re gonna do anything silly like fall in love anyway - they’re just bros being bros. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Greg saves the life of a quirky Irishman, he’s given an unexpected boon - his lifelong infertility is miraculously cured and he finds himself pregnant. Too bad nobody gave him the heads up that this was even a possibility. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to Hollydale for a friends to lovers tale of two guys who are perfect for each other, if they can just open their hearts and risk their friendship by taking a chance on love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the sixth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 27k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Because Stix are better than Ballz... &lt;br /&gt;Come in for our eclairs, and stay for the fabulous coffee. &lt;br /&gt;Show this flyer for a 10% discount! &lt;br /&gt;Ask about our Flakey Tasters Club!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kent crumpled the lame azz flyer in his hand and looked across the street at the Salty Stix bakery and thought to himself... this is war.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single father Pierre Duchamp has recently returned to Hollydale with plans to open Salty Stix, an authentic French bakery like the one he apprenticed at in Paris. The omega doesn’t have, need, or even want an alpha in his life—especially a provincial small town rube that doesn’t understand the concept of a little healthy competition. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kent Hawkins doesn’t want drama. He just wants to spend his days making candy for Sweet Ballz—a place that is so much more than just a job, it’s his life. If only the thieving French baker across the street would quit revamping and one-upping Kent’s recipes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A one-night stand gone wrong… two dessert loving men who can’t find a way to reduce their boil to a simmer… and a mysterious hippie who keeps accidentally making things worse while he blithely totes around his little harp. Celebrate Valentine’s Day in Hollydale—a sweet little town where strange things happen but your friends are always there to have your back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the fifth book of The Hollydale Omegas series. This book is about 27k and most likely contains an HEA. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, adults adulting in sexy grown-up ways, and way more than an occasional use of potty mouth language.</description>

  <description>Moore Aldridge &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finding out my mother and father have been hiding a pretty important secret form my brother and sister and me isn't the highlight of my week. But considering, up until yesterday I was bing held in a dingy, freezing cell with no blanket, it's also not the worst thing. So what if I can get pregnant and have amazing children that can possibly levitate or blow stuff up with there minds, I always knew I was pretty freaking extraordinary. Too bad I have a giant, massive, occasionally-can't-keep-from-stopping-in-the-middle-of-a-sentence-to-get-my-sh*t-together crush on the tank-in-a-tight-tee who rescued us from stinky balls and using a bucket as a bathroom. Because my nosy a** just overheard him telling somebody he already has a mate and apparently, they're effing perfect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carpenter King &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My little s'more is effing perfect. Gorgeous, funny, sweet when nobody is looking and snarky as hell. He apparently lives to push my buttons and I so love my buttons being pushed. Too bad I just overheard him telling someone he doesn't think he can handle being the superior-baby-breeding-bun-oven to some shifter he hardly knows. It takes me a moment to get my sh*t together, but when I do it's with the determination to win my mate over and remind him of all the perks of being with a shifter. But now we're being followed, and I need my mate to not only like me but trust me so I can keep him out of trouble and out of the hands of a man wanting revenge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Martigan Phillips &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In junior high, I was that kid. You know the one. The one that was somehow always on the outside looking in. The one that never understood why people made it their life goal to find everything that was wrong with me. I was that kid that kids picked on to fit in with other kids. Somehow that all changed when I moved to a different school and discovered my hardened personality and inability to trust anyone made me mysterious and cool to people who didn't previously know me. And then I met the group and suddenly I wasn't alone in the world. Too bad that doesn't always keep the demons at bay and I still have days when I'm that kid waiting for someone to pull some kind of prank on me that will inevitably bring all my hard work crumbling down around me. So imagine how leery I am when Miller Walt, the man I've been crushing on for months and I'm pretty sure doesn't even know my name agrees to be my fake boyfriend to fool my cousin. And when I hear him and his brother talking about me, of course I'm going to assume they are planning something to humiliate me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Miller Walt &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm pretty sure Martigan Phillips is my mate. How could I not know, you ask. Well, a shifter's ability to know their mate relies on being able to smell them and Martigan Phillips has no scent. There is another way, but we'll keep it PG. I agree to be his boyfriend for three reasons. ONE: His cousin is a nasty excuse for a human being and really needs to be knocked down a peg. TWO: The idea of anyone else stepping into that role pisses my wolf and me off. And THREE: I'm desperate for a good reason to get closer to Martigan and also to discover if he is, in fact, my mate. I'll just need to get the nineteen-year-old who is leery of everyone and everything to trust me. That shouldn't be hard, right? When his cousin's attempts to embarrass him turn dangerous, I get my chance to scent my dragon mate and I've never been happier. But Martigan has built up quite a shell over the years and breaking though isn't going to be easy. It's probably a good thing his friends are on my side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers.

  <description>Young Blackburn &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been head-over-heels in lust with one of my closest friend's dad since the very first time I met him. But how could I not? He's strong and beautiful and so, so commanding. His every statement is like a dare to the rebel inside me. But, he's Larrin's dad. Though he looks not a day over twenty-five, he's actually over four hundred years old. If the man were looking for a relationship, he'd be in one, right? And a twenty-year-old who regularly sends drunk/high texts, plays endless amounts of pranks on the people he holds near and dear, and weighs every bad decision on whether or not he can survive the punishment after is definitely not going to be his first choice. Right? But when Larrin is hurt and Shaw comes to stay on Terra Mortis to sooth his fatherly worries, I can't seem to keep myself away. And I'm starting to get the impression he might not want me to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaw Brenner &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How the hell am I supposed to ignore the temptation that is Young Blackburn? I should be annoyed by the drunk texting and constant innuendo from the young vampire, but all I can do is find it is oddly endearing and distractingly sexy. When another student loses their life because of the strange neon pills circulating the island, it's suddenly very important that Young is careful who he feeds from. And then there is the small matter of the fairy who is addicted to blood-letting stalking and attacking him in hopes of locking him up and using his hunger and need to feed as a drug. One kiss, unexpected and amazing, tells me Young is my mate, but in order to keep him, I'm going to have to fight a fairy, Young's rebellious streak, and possibly the sensibilities of my own son. I will though. Happily. Because now that I know Young is mine, I'm not letting him go. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff!

  <description>Richmond Pratt &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like being a PI, but I don't love it. I like my life in Tennessee, but I don't love it. I like the apartment I live in but I don't love it. Basically my life is full of stuff that I can live with or without. With the exception of my mom and my sister, but they have their own lives. When a case takes me to Purdy, Nebraska, I learn about shifters and I meet a man I can't get out of my head. But I'm straight. At least, I think I am. I've never really been too passionate about anyone or anything. Being around Payne and the leap of shifters opens my eyes to the fact that I haven't really been living a life so much as just keeping my heart beating from day to day. Moving to Purdy and starting a new life that involves people and things I actually enjoy being around is my new life goal. But that means moving. Is it a good thing or an absolute disaster that Payne volunteers to tag along and help out? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Payne Brooks &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm good with disaster. It's familiar. I've watched everyone, including my best friend and partner in distraction find their mate, and though I have no idea what to do with one myself, I would love to have the kind of connection I've watched bloom around me. Finding my mate in the human man who brought it upon himself to come all the way here from another state to stop a hitman from killing my friend's mate would be absolutely amazing…if the man wasn't straight. How do I convince a man who's never been with another man take a chance on a relationship with me, when I'm not even sure I know how to be in one to begin with. But I have to try. Moving him from Tennessee to Nebraska seems like an easy task and maybe a way to win my mate over. Too bad his strange neighbor has other plans for my mate. Now I have to protect him from a tiger shifter who is looking to take over the alpha position by bringing home a chosen like a trophy, while moving him across country and convincing him I'm worth flipping his world upside down for. Should be easy, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Reid Wilson &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Living with a large group of people is really starting to grow on me, especially since before I was kidnapped, I was feeling more and more alone every day. My days used to be an endless cycle of passive aggressive comments about my size and appearance, disguised as constructive criticism from someone who "just didn't want me to feel out of place" in his world. I may like to workout, but I also like to eat. Now, living on leap land with people who seem to like me just fine at my size, I'm more content than I've ever been. There might me nights I wish I had someone to hold me the way many of my friend's mates hold them, but getting into another relationship and having to deal with the same kind of treatment as before would more lonely than sleeping alone at night. Trust me, I've been there. And someone as physically perfect as Sloan Richardson couldn't possibly have any more patience with my eating habits than my ex had been, can he? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sloan Richarson &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reid Wilson is perfect…and kinda a d*ck. When he's not all out laughing in my face at the suggestion of a date, he is thoroughly ignoring the fuu…dge out of me. Having a conversation with him that doesn't end in me wanting to both curl in a ball and cry myself to sleep and stab something repeatedly, is an absolute miracle and possibly not even a thing. But I have every intention of wearing him down because he's my mate and he belongs with me. And I'll do everything I can to do it. Even run directly into the line of fire from a hitman's gun, or avoid the slice of the knife Reid's always carrying around, covered in blood, paint and pumpkin guts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it.

  <description>Larrin Brenner &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know there is more to Kross than most people see. I mean, it's not like I've been stalking the guy, but I may or may not have happened by all the places my hand-to-hand combat instructor goes and possibly watched as he played with the kids at the daycare and helped at the animal shelter in his free time. I also may be obsessed with the man, but as long as my friends keep me from making drunken confessions that will only prove just how much Kross is not into me when he rejects me like a bad check, all will be fine. Until one of the other gargoyles on Terra Mortis falls asleep a real girl and is rubble only hours later. Suddenly, Kross's protective instincts are in overdrive and as it turns out, that's because I'm his mate. As a member of the regiulapis bloodline of gargoyles, I was born without the ability to scent my mate, but Kross is bellalapis and had known since the first time we met. Though his reason for not telling me immediately is solid and becomes more so once I meet the man who raised him, I can't help but be hurt. And it might not matter, if the unknown person using forbidden magic against me succeeds in their mission to get rid of me completely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kross McCabe &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A century is a long time to train for something, only to find out it was never meant to be in my life anyway. And that's exactly the shock I get, when I find my mate facedown on the sidewalk in front of the castle that serves as a training facility for special factions of immortal warriors. Terra Mortis is an island in the Caribbean where that training facility is located, and it's supposed to be the last milestone before I'm sworn in as a master for the Praemani, a group of men who devote their entire life to the study of immortal history and hand-to-hand combat. The problem is, I can't have a mate and be a master. Full devotion is needed for both. I've chosen my mate, but before I'm ready to claim him, I have to figure out who I am outside of the only thing I've ever known. And did I mention that celibacy is part of the full devotion to Praemani? So, yeah. I'm a hundred-year-old virgin. Can I convince my mate to accept me when I'm still struggling with being myself? And what if I'm the reason a practitioner of forbidden magic is targeting him? Can I forgive myself if I trusted the wrong person and my mate suffers for it? Can he? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! (Though the MCs in this book aren't and cannot get pregnant, this is a spin-off series from my Chosen series. Occasional Mpreg characters might have cameos. You've been warned!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers.

  <description>Pierce Brown &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If it weren't for the one thing in the whole world I can't leave behind, I would have escaped, or been killed trying by now. At nineteen, the prospect of dying trying to get away from a fancy hotel in Las Vegas shouldn't even be a thought process you have, but a month in the presence of a man like Oscar Burns is enough to make you feel like evil is infecting your skin. When rescue comes in the form of Boston Long, I can't help but be a little skeptical. It's not just my well being at stake, and nothing has ever worked out as planned for me before. But Boston and his group of the strangest FBI agents ever prove how resourceful they can be, and soon I'm looking at living a life again. Boston can kind of come off like a serial killer, but there is definitely something about him I can't get out of my head. And it's not just the adorably awkward way he smiles. So, why didn't he tell me we were mates? Is the prospect of mating with a nineteen-year-old who lives a life that is closer to that of a middle-aged man not exciting enough for someone who lives dangerously everyday? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Boston Long &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can't believe it when I find my mate sitting obediently next to Oscar's desk, like a little pet that jumps to it when the man says so. Just how loyal is he to the slime-ball of a human? When it becomes clear that Oscar is forcing Pierce's compliance by holding on to something my mate can't ever leave behind, the mission is…tweaked. Once we have Pierce and the rest of the chosen safely back at the leap house and Oscar locked in the bunker where we can question him, I'm still nervous about telling my mate what he is to me. He's been through a lot, and I don't want him confusing gratitude with actual feelings, but it might cost me when he finally finds out and thinks I don't want him. When an old enemy wanting revenge shows up and releases Oscar and convinces him to come after what's mine, I might lose everything. I might lose the only thin in a very long time that can make me smile…awkwardly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Silver Bell &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Football has been both my freedom and my restraints. I'm my happiest when I'm on the field. I have an assignment. I know what I need to do and I get it done. I don’t have to worry about my parents and their demands or anything else going on or not going on in my life. It paid my way through college, which meant not having to rely on my parents for my education. Unfortunately, it gives them a reason to actually give a crap about me, and pay far too much attention to my life. Between them and my fear of losing football if anyone ever found out the truth about me, I've never been able to fully be myself. Which I never thought of as being that big of a deal…until I get kidnapped. Or, I guess until I get rescued. Parker Bradley is the sexiest, most tempting man I've ever met. He makes me want in a way I never have before. In a way that makes me want to be far braver than I have the ability to be in my life. For someone whose life is just as bound and buried in the closet as I was in that crazy wolf-shifter's office, that's terrifying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Parker Bradley &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While on a mission to finally rid our department and our friends at the Becker pack of the cult and it's Alpha Supreme, I literally find my mate trussed up in a closet. And boy does he come out hard. With one problem out of the way, my new, self-imposed mission features getting my mate to accept me. Unfortunately, he has more than one reason to keep his sexuality hidden and continue to live the only life he's known how up until now. Secrets included. I can work around that. Or in the very least, I can wait it out. But in order for Silver to get back to the way things were before, we have to find the person who sold him to the travelling sell-a-mate show, because whoever it was knows things about him only people close to him would. And if they got away with selling him once, who's to say they won't do it again? Can I help my mate get his old life back knowing it means putting our happy ever after on hold indefinitely? Or will I risk his happiness so I can selfishly keep my lineman? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Carter Benson &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being sold to men who were intent on basically auctioning me off into sexual slavery isn't the worst thing I've been through, but getting into that would mean talking about revenge and things better left forgotten. And you just didn't tell the gorgeous FBI agent who rescued you from a life of popping out pups at a near constant rate that you did something so bad, you should actually be sitting in prison making shanks out of hardened mashed potatoes and a spork? Especially when he turns out to be your mate. But, how do you start a relationship with something that big hanging over it like a black cloud? You don't. And that's why I can't have this gorgeous man who brings out things in me I haven't seen since my mom was still alive and my life was normal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harley Daniels &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Going to Carter Benson's house to question his roommate about his disappearance is both a happy revelation and a terrifying one, because as soon as I smell the scent coming off of the items in the young chosen's room, I know he's my mate. How am I(he of zero filter) supposed to take care a a traumatized mate without making things worth? Getting him out is the easy part, convincing him to trust me is not. Neither is convincing him not to run scared because my job is dangerous and I’m the first person he’s allowed himself to care about in years. As we grow closer, he teaches me to be happy with who I am, and I remind him how to feel. How do I get my fierce little protector to see how much we need each other and to stop sweating the little sh*t? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it.

  <description>Bentley Jeffers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My life has been a series of ups and downs. Downside: I lost my right arm just below he elbow when I was six years old due to a car accident. Upside: It made my usefulness to my parents nonexistent and therefore they didn't treat me the way they treated my twin brother. Downside: Not many people in the circle my family spent all its time in wanted to be friends with someone like me. Upside: My brother would burn the world down to make me happy, and I had plenty of time to pursue my love of cooking and baking. Downside: My mother tells me nobody wants to be served by, or eat anything made by an arm that looks like mine. Upside: My brother loses it on her and moves us to Purdy, Nebraska with a food truck where I can bake and sell my food. Upside: I've finally found friends that actually like me for me, and aren't put-off by my missing limb or extreme lack of confidence. Downside: I'm kidnapped by men who want to sell me to other men for my baby-making abilities. Upside: I have no doubt I'll be rescued soon. Downside: The man that rescues me is the most gorgeous, intelligent, considerate, sweet being in the world, and I think I'm falling hard for him. But how can a man so perfect want a mate that isn't whole? Who isn't "mate material?" Will I ever get back to a point in my life where I feel like someone who is worth being a mate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinsey Walt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a man is given a gift, he is thankful. And when I see my beautiful mate for the first time, I'm the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. This perfect creature was gifted to me, and I'll fight for him, no matter what. I'll fight sex traffickers, his brother and even him and his insecurities to hold on the one that belongs to me. When I take my mate back to his new home so that his new family can see that I haven't kidnapped the man myself, the dangers we knew were a possibility, become a reality, and I'm hurt. Seeing my mate scared and crying makes me question whether or not I can put him through something that is more often than not a possibility in my line of work, and I decide to accept a job offer from the place my brothers and sister work on an island in the Caribbean. Almost immediately, I regret not discussing it with my mate first, especially when it becomes clear that he is distancing himself from me before I get a chance to leave him behind. But how could he possibly think I would or even could run off and leave my precious boy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>Marlow Jeffers &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm a former child star, whose own mother and father treated like a meal ticket. When burn out, and my mother's hateful words to my twin brother drove me away from the life of fortune and semi-fame, the only logical solution is to buy a food truck so my brother can follow his passion, and move to Purdy, Nebraska. I'm used to having a few creepers staring too long and even following me around. I didn't get as far as I did in my professional life because I'm unattractive. But the aggressive way one customer grabs my wrist to examine my birthmark and then practically sets up camp outside my truck makes me more nervous than any obsessive fan ever has. When the gorgeous and funny Arry Martin with his dark skin, pretty blue eyes and ridiculous Goatee comes to my rescue, my brother and I find out we are part of a world we never knew existed. Unfortunately, I almost throw the best thing that ever happened to me away with careless ignorant words. I've only ever been what others needed and wanted me to be. I don't know if I have anything left to give in the way of being what someone else needs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Arry Martin &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time I see Marlow, I'm blown away by how gorgeous he is with his movie star face and perfect body, quickly followed by being exceedingly pleased by his sassy whit and confidence. He really is my perfect match, but he's had to deal with the stress of pleasing everyone else his whole life. Not understanding how perfectly he already fits into my life, he rejects our mating, and in a fit of grief, I take off. Marlow fears I'll never be able to forgive him. Can I? Can I trust that he won't freak out again? Can I deal with his sexy, sassy mouth, when he won't quit making fun of my facial hair? With the cult most likely gunning for my leap, and somebody kidnapping chosen and selling them as breeders, my mate and his brother are in danger, and we'll need our friendly fox and his FBI cohorts to keep us all safe. Can my mate handle the stress of being in my world, when he came here for a break? And can my little Blondie handle 1998 with a goat? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt, and I try to avoid things that make me sad like I SHOULD be avoiding carbs. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses::</description>

  <description>Davis Sanders &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm a bit on the chubby side, and I tend to somehow walk around with at least one foot hanging out of my mouth at all times. It's amazing how spectacularly I can vomit out a run-on sentence with every phrase being more offensive than the last. When my father sends me to Purdy, Nebraska to talk my favorite author into signing on with his publishing company, I know he doesn't know what kind of author the man is, and that the whole venture is a lost cause. One, an author of gay romance wouldn't touch Sanders' Publishing with their worst enemies…pen. And two, has there actually ever been someone with less social skills than me? But he's the overly controlling parent that I can't seem to get out from under the thumb of. And I'd really like to meet one of my favorite authors in person. And then I do. And he's truly the most gorgeous, delicious man I've ever met in my life, and me fantasizing about all the things I want to do to him is pointless. Right? Except, all the things he writes about in his books are real, and my birthmark makes me something I've never been in my entire life. Important. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ward Butler &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm a quiet man, usually. Not because I'm shy, or even antisocial, but because I like to sit back and watch. I'm an observer. And sometimes, I'm lonely. I was starting to worry that our leap was going to meet its quota of soulmates before I found mine. I mean can we even fit any more gay men into our micro-town? I feel like there is a law somewhere about it. When the old, bigoted geezer from Sanders' Publishing shows up at my not-job to offer a contract I've turned down multiple times already, I'm ready to throw him out on his wrinkly rear-end. Only, the delicious little chubby I find waiting for me is definitely NOT Alder Sanders. But he IS my mate, and he's flipping perfect. His body was made for tying to the bed and devouring. If we can somehow make it past Alder Sanders, my mate's insecurities and the creepy cult's terrifying new chemical weapon, maybe it will actually work out. One could hope, right? Because I'd really like to get Davis back to my room and do ALL the hot stuff. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt. And definitely a HEA! I write 'em short and sweet, because I like to read 'em short and sweet. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers that are chapter after chapter of emotional upheaval. (I read those too, but I have to be mentally prepared, and have a few days to put aside for recovery!) "These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Rory Stevens &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I was six, monsters attacked and killed my mom, while we were unloading groceries. I thought I'd been rescued by the nice man we'd met the day before at the pool, but throughout the twelve years I spent in his basement, I started to realize things. He was one of the monsters, and my basement bedroom was my cage. Now, on the run from the people who wanted to sell me to the highest bidder, I want desperately to make a new life for myself, but my face tells the horrors of my past in the badly scarred claw mark running down the left side. When I find Purdy, I feel safe. And when I find Green, I feel something else. I want something someone like me can't have. Hope is dangerous, and I can't let myself be pulled in by it. Even if all my dreams truly are wrapped up in this one man, and everything he's offering seems perfect. And then I learn about the monsters, about shifters and about Green, and my connection to them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Green Wilkes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The moment I see my delicate, but strong mate, I feel elated. Followed very quickly by cold fury when I see the suffering written all over his scarred, but still beautiful face. When I follow him one day after his shift at Bunny's diner, I also find out he's homeless, and still suffering. Convincing Rory that I want him is a bit of a struggle, but I know it will be worth it once I have him living under my roof, where he belongs. The plan to get him there didn't originally involve the wolves that kidnapped him as a child showing up, but I'll take what I can get. Getting him to stay once he finds out about my kind and their correlation with the monsters that killed his mother might be tough, but I'm hoping I give him more reasons to stay than to go. Unfortunately, a bad decision involving communication that leads to Rory thinking I'm only in it for the money I can get for him might make it impossible. Until I can make him mine, I'll just have to continue to be the guardian of my pretty angel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it.

  <description>Foster Bryant &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been pretty sure Burke was my was my mate from the first time I saw him on the screen he and his brother were using to talk to each other from two different places. But as long as my leopard doesn't smell him, I can give us both the time we need to get our lives together. The key is not meeting him physically, until the time is right. The day I walk into my best friend's house and smell the most amazing scent on the air, I know that I've run out of time to get my crap figured out. In person, he's everything I've ever dreamed he'd be. And I'm all too happy to claim him. But he's been attacked by a shifter, and just found out he's chosen. I don't want to spring this on him too, and end up making him run back to Georgia, like he's always threatening. What I don't realize, is that my fear of scaring my mate, is actually breaking his heart. Can I make it right with Burke? And can I save him from a crazed, shifter stalker, who is convinced Burke is his? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Burke Hilliard &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think I might be going crazy. Maybe it's all the work. Maybe it's my creepy, stalkerish lab partner. But only a mental break can explain said creepy lab partner's face going all scary, and him attacking and biting me. Right? When I go to Purdy, Nebraska to get away from it all and visit my adopted brother Sutton, it comes with a special surprise. My brother's best friend of five years. The one I've never actually met, but have been in constant battle with for almost as long. The man I've secretly had the biggest crush on, since the very first time he annoyed and then bossed me, while I was video chatting my brother. When I learn about shifters and mates, and what the mark on my rear-end is all about, I finally understand this draw I've always had to the annoying man. But if that is true, then why isn't Foster saying anything? Am I alone in this crazy pull? And is it too much to ask for him to drop that stupid nickname, and continue to call me baby? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: Mpreg elements! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, my books have little to no angst, and lots and lots of fluff! They are better read in order, because I kind of write them like a continuation of a story, and I don't like to repeat explanations over and over if I can help it. No cheating, because that makes my heart hurt. Sorry, I just don't want anyone being disappointed if they like the angst filled heart-rippers. These read more like a romantic comedy than a romantic drama. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!! ::blowing you kisses:: &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“Getting Aries as my mate is a fantasy that I never would have had the imagination to dream up on my own, but to get those two beautiful angels too? That's just the complete package.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Micah is a young alpha, on a mission to find the infant daughter of an old friend. When he also finds two other lost little angels, he has no choice but to rescue them as well. Before he is able to return them home to their dad, they already have staked their claim on his heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aries is an omega whose babies were stolen from him, ripped from his arms right at birth. He's tried to stay strong, but the pain of their absence haunts him every moment of every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When he discovers that his children have been found, by an alpha that is already on the way to deliver them into his arms, Aries is beside himself with nervous excitement. What he doesn't expect is that the alpha is the one man that he has reason to hate due to a regrettable incident from the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What neither of them expected to happen when Micah arrived with the children, was to find their fated mate. Can these two men who have zero respect for each other find their way to somehow form a family together with the children that they both adore? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Warning: This book is not intended for readers under the age of 18. It contains pottymouth language, adults adulting in fun and naughty ways, and a strong dose of insta-love. Possible trigger warning: Contains references to a past kidnapping/sexual assault. No assault scenes are included in this book.</description>

  <description>Sutton Hilliard &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been watching my sexy neighbor lounge around his back yard in the nude for like three months now. Like a creepy weirdo, I do it with all the lights in my house off, so he won't know I'm there. When I think he is being attacked by wild animals, I run out to save him, shotgun in hand. And that is how I find out about shifters, mates and chosen. I can have babies?! WTF? Also, my gorgeous neighbor thinks I'm his mate. I've lived a life of people being forced to put up with me, when they didn't have a choice. Can I accept this mating, even to the most amazing man I've ever met, if the choice isn't even his? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Barron "Ronny" Franks &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm a boring, serial-white-t-shirt-wearing, plain-looking grease monkey, who can't quite get over this curious obsession with my neighbor. Even though I'm sure I would have scented if he was my mate over three months ago when he moved in, my leopard and I are stuck on the man. When he tries to save me from my friends, and finds out about shifters, I finally get close enough to the sexy man to smell the truth. He really is my mate. And he's chosen. I couldn't be more happy with the gift I've been given, but his lack of understanding, the added comments of ignorant, bigoted leap members, and the continued investigation of cult activity among my people, might make it impossible for me to claim my sweet Sutton. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>THE LAST THING HE WAS LOOKING FOR... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jake is an alpha wolf on a mission to find his missing sister, who's been kidnapped by the Alpha of his former pack. What he didn't expect to find was a whole group of omega's being held captive along with her. When he catches the scent of his fated mate among the group of omegas, he knows that he will do whatever it takes to get them all to safety - even if it means taking them all, along with a group of his alpha buddies and forming their own pack, a thousand miles to the north. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WAS THE ONE PERSON HE NEEDED. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kai was shocked when his own father sold him to the evil Alpha Fremont for a paltry sum of gold. He is befriended by the ragtag group of omegas who also being held in a life of captivity. That is, until the night that a gorgeous Alpha appears, looking to rescue his sister. He takes all of them to safety, along with his studly posse of alpha wolves, moving them all up north to form a new pack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;HIS FATED MATE...THE FATHER OF HIS CHILD? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kai soon becomes pregnant, settling into his new-found role as the Alpha's mate, he begins to feel safe for the first time in his life. As his pregnancy progresses, so does the danger, as the former Alpha tracks them down - putting their new pack, and Kai's future happiness, at risk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the first book of the new Northern Lodge Pack series. Every book is guaranteed to have a HEA, but it's advised to read them in order for maximum appreciation. 18+ readers only please! And yes, this book contains M/PREG, knotting, adults doing lots of sexy naughty things to each other, and the occasional use of potty mouth language!</description>

  <description>Bennett James &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks I'm just a young, thrill seeking sass mouth who accidentally stumbled upon my status in the command by being the alpha-mate's best friend. The truth is, I'm a lot more mature than people give me credit for. Including my mate. From the time I was young, while all the other little boys were dreaming of being warriors and fighting for their leap, all I ever dreamed about is meeting my mate and living happily ever after. But my first meeting with my mate didn't go to plan, and he rejected me. Now, living the life everyone else wanted and didn't think I deserved, I couldn't enjoy it or anything else, because I was walking around as only half a person. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thompsyn Lane &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm old and grumpy and a bit of a bastard. I'm worried about bringing such a young mate into my life of near seclusion and I react badly to finding out he is only twenty. I regret my behavior immediately, but I'm still not sure I have anything to offer a gorgeous, funny, full of life person like my mate. When I start stalking him like a complete creep, I have to admit to myself that I made a huge mistake. But am I going to be too late to repair the damage I've caused? Maybe using an ability that nobody knows about to track down his missing best friend will be my chance to redeem myself as more than just a grumpy old bear. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition of ASIN B07CK6FRX4.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridley Scott &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I'm a genuinely happy person, regardless of the fact that both of my parents are dead, I'm a college dropout, I work at a diner as a cook in Purdy, Nebraska and I'm a tall, lanky virgin gay man with more freckles than not, bright red hair, and a creepy obsession with a gorgeous god of a man who always catches me stealing glances of him and doing awkward things, such as nearly killing myself with a mop bucket or frying pan. When my car breaks down not far rom said gorgeous, god's house, I learn that Flynn is my best friend's alpha and there is more to my obsession than my ridiculous habit of accidental suicide attempts. We're connected. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Flynn Becker &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I've been watching my mate for months and waiting for the perfect time to finally claim him. When he comes sputtering to a stop not far from the leap house where I'm the alpha of a large leap of leopards, I'm both excited to finally have him close and worried about how to explain our world. When I find out he already knows about shifters and his best friend is a member of my leap, I feel like this mating just got easier. But fighting both, members of my own kind, and my precious mate's insecurities, might be too much for even a chosen bond. I have to find a way to protect my mate from a crazed she-leopard and prove to him that he could never be, JUST Ridley. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cage McCann and Carrie Miller go way back. As kids, they meant everything to each other. But Cage left town years ago to escape his future as leader of the local motorcycle gang, the Aces, and though he promised to come back, Carrie has given up on seeing him again. Until he shows up at her bar and pulls her into a sensuous, soul-shaking kiss and back into his life, which is currently full of danger and secrets beyond what Carrie can imagine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cage has never forgotten Carrie. After serving in the special forces and then starting up a private security company, he has just been waiting for the right time to go back, claim her as his…and tell her that the man she has always loved can actually shift into a bear. But when Carrie is in danger from the very biker gang he tried to escape, Cage drops everything to protect her. The only problem? In order to make sure she is never in danger again, he has to go undercover as an Ace. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Making Carrie fall in love with him while wearing Ace leather isn’t going to be easy, but if Cage blows his cover, he risks losing his chance to rid the town of the Aces once and for all. Now Cage will just have to prove that the Aces may be bad to the bone, but Cage is bear to the bone, and no one messes with what a bear holds dear.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two broken omegas and one hard-edged alpha… three men who are stronger than they think… especially when they trust each other enough to be vulnerable.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A pair of omegas who are everything to each other...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only are they best friends, they’re also lovers. In all the years that they’ve been on the streets fighting to survive, they’ve had one end goal: to one day find an alpha strong enough to love both of them equally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An alpha without a purpose...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since his return to civilian life, Beaumont has yet to reconnect with society. Instead, he spends his nights running from nightmares and memories of war. While out on one of his nightly wanderings, the alpha catches sight of two of the prettiest angels he’s ever seen. Intrigued, he follows them home… only to find them taking refuge on a filthy, discarded mattress in an abandoned warehouse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three broken men who can heal each other’s wounds...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beau goes from stalker to protector in the blink of an eye when his angels need him to intervene in a bad situation. Before he realizes it's happening, life as he knows it changes to become something new and precious. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lukas is the protector. He’s tough, snarky, and would happily give his own life if necessary to protect his Gid. Time and time again, he’s proven his strength by rescuing Gideon from would-be attackers. Now he needs to find the courage to let go and trust Beau to protect them all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sweet, angelic Gideon is used to being protected and adored. None of the horrible things in his life seem to affect him, because at the end of the day, he’s always had Lukas... and that’s all that matters. When the chips are down, can Gid discover his inner strength and step up to be an equal partner in this fragile new triad? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This mmm book contains mpreg, and intended for 18+ readers. Possible triggers for attempted sexual assault, violence, and breath play kink. Parts of this book are a little darker than you’re used to from Susi Hawke, but an HEA and all the laughs and shmoopy feels that you’d expect are definitely included!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Austen Payne, THIRDS Squadron Specialist Agent (SSA) for Destructive Delta and TIN operative, has seen the worst the world has to offer, faced lethal killers, and helped bring down dangerous organizations. But nothing terrifies him more than falling in love. After years of undercover work, Austen is a master at defending himself and protecting his heart… until he meets Osmond Zachary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRDS Defense Agent Osmond Zachary has a huge, doting family, yet something is missing in his life. After meeting grumpy, foul-mouthed, jittery cheetah Therian Austen Payne, Zach knows exactly what that something—or someone—is. Unfortunately Austen seems determined to avoid Zach at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zach foils an assassination attempt, he ends up in the killer’s crosshairs, and Austen is Zach’s best chance at staying alive. Zach hopes the crisis will bring them closer, but Austen has every intention of walking away as soon as the danger is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily ever after isn’t for guys like Austen, but Zach is determined to show him it can be….</description>

  <description>An MM Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cody Evans has spent the past six years hidden from the world. Held by a shifter trafficking ring, he’s been forced to serve any man who paid the right price for a submissive omega. Now, the unthinkable has happened: Cody is pregnant. Desperate to save the life inside him but with only a hint of possible help, he sneaks a phone and places a call to the help number he’d held in his head in case he ever got near a phone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From the moment Levi Thurman scented the pregnant, emotionally broken omega, he had no doubt: Cody was his mate. He knows the young man will need time to uncover the dark secrets of his past so that he can heal, but they’re both shocked when Levi’s secret is revealed first: his soft, lacy, satin covered secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What surprises them even more is Cody’s need to be in charge… and Levi’s pleasure in obeying his commands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even as Cody unveils Levi’s softer side and Levi strengthens Cody’s belief in himself, the evil of Cody’s past haunts him—and when it comes to protecting his omega, Levi is all alpha, and there’s no way the men who hurt them can escape his justice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the second book in this exciting series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and occasional violence. Be prepared for sexy manties and an omega with a need for control. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trigger warnings: graphic violence, attempted rape, mention of past sexual trauma&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Team: A.L.P.H.A.:Six battle-hardened alphas with one goal—to save any omega in peril&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Preston Tierney, the omega son of a prominent senator, has been taken by a secret group with an ax to grind. Party boy Preston was just out looking for a good time until he was grabbed—plucked right from a party in the middle of a crowd. When he wakes up, he finds himself caged like an animal in a remote cabin far from home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah Perkins is a strong alpha who leads his unit with a strong hand—and a great sense of humor. The last thing he expected when he went to free the sassy little thing in the cage was to scent his own fated mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Noah and his crazy crew must free Preston from captivity—from his kidnappers, and again from a source much closer to home than they would’ve imagined—while Noah tries to figure out how to tame his bristly omega and truly embrace the team’s motto: Accept, Love, Protect, Honor—Always. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the first in a new series, but can definitely be read as a stand-alone novel. You can expect to find naughty, knotty scenes of steamy passion, along with a lot of potty-mouth language and some violence. No jackals were harmed in the writing of this book—unless they kinda deserved it. HEA definitely included, intended for 18+ readers only. Seriously, would you expect anything less from Susi Hawke and Crista Crown?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An MM Mpreg Romance</description>

  <description>Former Special Forces medical sergeant Russell “Red” McKinley knows a thing or two about wounds, like the fact some can take a lifetime to heal, if they heal at all. The scars Red carries run deep, and living with PTSD often means battling the memories of his past. Injuries he received while working an executive protection case with fellow Kings and co-owners of Four Kings Security, have once again forced past heartaches to the surface, but Red is determined not to let it derail his blossoming romance with sweet and sexy fashion photographer Lazarus Galanos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laz can’t deny there’s something special developing between him and Red, but Laz has wounds of his own. He’s hesitant to jump into a new relationship after his recent explosive breakup. Experience has taught Laz to doubt his judgement when it comes to men. Guys who seem too good to be true, usually are, and no one appears more perfect than Red. &lt;br /&gt;When an attempt is made on Laz’s life, Red is determined to keep him safe. Laz may not be a client, and Red is still off duty, but Laz is one of their own, and nothing means more to the Kings than family. While an investigation is underway, Red and Laz are growing closer, but can they find a way to help each other heal and take a chance on love, or will their fears and insecurities cost them more than their future together?</description>

  <description>Officer Red Markham knows about the ugly side of life after a car accident left him scarred and his parents dead. His job policing the streets of Carlisle, PA, only adds to the ugliness, and lately, drug overdoses have been on the rise. One afternoon, Red is dispatched to the local Y for a drowning accident involving a child. Arriving on site, he finds the boy rescued by lifeguard Terry Baumgartner. Of course, Red isn’t surprised when gorgeous Terry won’t give him and his ugly mug the time of day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overhearing one of the officer’s comment about him being shallow opens Terry’s eyes. Maybe he isn’t as kindhearted as he always thought. His friend Julie suggests he help those less fortunate by delivering food to the elderly. On his route he meets outspoken Margie, a woman who says what’s on her mind. Turns out, she’s Officer Red’s aunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red and Terry’s worlds collide as Red tries to track the source of the drugs and protect Terry from an ex-boyfriend who won’t take no for an answer. Together they might discover a chance for more than they expected—if they can see beyond what’s on the surface. </description>

  <description>Can cats and dogs get along? Maybe. What about werelions and werewolves? If it’s Tilly and Mitchell, definitely. Or rather, maybe. If he’d just get his head out of his…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-werelion Tilly McBride owns Bless Your Tart, the South’s latest and greatest bakery. Or at least the best one in Georgia. Fine. It’s the best in Wilder, Georgia, mainly because it’s the only one. She manages to balance running the shop, keeping her middle sister in college, and making sure she doesn’t kill her youngest sister before she graduates high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s a proprietor, an older sister and… a mate? At least that’s what local werewolf alpha Mitchell Blake seems to think. He also assumes she’ll hop on the Bang Town Express the second they meet. Sure, he’s hot. Hotter than hot with his muscles and that smile and the way he growls… Should. Be. Illegal. But is he better than a chocolate cupcake with buttercream icing? That is the question. She’s afraid the answer might be yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Werewolf Mitchell Blake thinks the answer to every question should be yes. Yes, he wants Tilly. Yes, he craves Tilly. Yes, he’d like to bend Tilly over the pack’s claiming altar and mate her so everyone will know she’s his. She. Belongs. To. Him. He just has to convince her first. That shouldn’t be a problem. He’s the Wilder alpha. Every woman wants to be with him. Except one curvy, annoying, delicious package named Tilly McBride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchell will have her. Just as soon as he gets rid of the one trying to end their mating before it has a chance to start. Permanently.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A night-blind vampire. A werewolf with lousy self-confidence. And a whole hell of a lot of danger...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellis O’Neill is an art dealer with too many problems: his eyesight has deteriorated to the point of night-blindness; he’s estranged from his family, to whom he owes a considerable sum of money; and his guide dog went right off him the night Ellis died. Without his dog, Ellis is trapped in a life bouncing between home and work, dependent on his personal assistant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Werewolf Randall Carter has problems of his own. He loves his pack, he really does, but as their Omega he’s always the one to bear the brunt of their rage. It’s a role he can’t avoid, and Randall isn't sure he can take it for much longer, so he buries himself in his day job. Randall’s the best dog trainer in the city, and when he’s offered a client who needs him to work evenings he’d be a fool to turn it down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Randall is falling for someone he should despise. Everything about the undead is anathema to his kind, but Ellis is exactly the kind of guy Randall would want to ask out on a date – if he were still breathing. Worse, they may not have too long to figure their feelings out. Someone or something is gunning for Ellis and anyone else who gets in the way; they won’t rest until the vampire is destroyed.</description>

  <description>Update: Now professionally edited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rohlin, the rabbit shifter is on the run from his former warren after being drugged and attacked by the alpha and his son. Afraid for his life he seeks the relative safety of human civilization. His strong suspicion that he was now pregnant from the attack only adds to his desperate situation. His only hope was to hide where no shifters could find him. That was his plan anyway!&lt;p&gt;When his failing eyesight causes wolf shifter Kai and his brother Connor to flee their home pack they find themselves part of an unlikely family of humans brought together by a human named Pops. Pop’s crew are motorcycle loving mechanics who become the family and support system that Kai and his brother needed to survive. When there is a shooting in Pop’s Shop that lands Connor in the human hospital, Kai must struggle to hold together his crew while hiding the truth about shifters from the humans around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rohlin never expected to find his true mates scent in the aftermath of a bloody crime scene. While trying to track the scent of his mate he is found by members of the Dry Lake Pack and is taken to their pack lands. Meanwhile Kai, Connor, and the rest of the crew struggle with the aftermath of the shooting. They soon join the Dry Lake Pack and when their two paths cross, they both know they have found their true mate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can they overcome their own pasts and their current challenges to make a future for themselves with the Dry Lake Pack? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: This is a M/M book that contains erotic scenes between two males, male pregnancy, and may be triggering to more sensitive readers.

  <description>Three hundred year old Mitchell Faerigan has been chasing Clover Brady for two years, determined to make the gorgeous red head his mate. The man is skittish, but Mitchell is one determined fae. When Mitchell’s family threatens and then tries to kill Clover, all bets are off, and Mitchell claims what belongs to him. Now, he just has to convince Clover that loving him is worth the risk. And this fae is up to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clover Brady has a simple life running his simple antique shop and ogling the not-so-simple owner of Faerigan Cycles. Mitchell Faerigan is Clover’s dream man with his manly muscles, dark hair, and gorgeous blue eyes. He’d like nothing more than to throw himself into Mitchell’s arms and beg him to do naughty things to his body. Unfortunately, Clover is unwilling to risk his heart. He’s still recovering from the loss of his parents, and there is no way he could ever survive loving and possibly losing Mitchell. So he’ll keep his heart to himself, no matter how tempting the other man may be.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What’s an omega to do when denied custody of his late sister’s baby? Take the job offered to be his manny!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dusty Williams has the worst day of his life when he wakes up in a hospital bed after yet another miscarriage, only to receive divorce papers and a call saying that his custody bid has been denied for his newly orphaned five-month-old nephew because his father has been located. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zeke MacIntosh is a flirty, fun-loving, and happily-single bisexual attorney with zero plans to change the status quo. Commitment? Not this alpha! He never looks back or goes for seconds. Hit it and quit it—that’s his motto. Zeke gets the shock of a lifetime when he’s contacted by social services to let him know that a former one-night stand gave birth to his son… and never told him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He can’t be angry with her though, because she passed away unexpectedly and left his son behind. When he goes to meet his baby, he’s also introduced to a down-on-his-luck omega—who’s not only in the market for a job, but is also the baby’s maternal uncle, and a perfect manny candidate. Never one to think before he speaks, Zeke spontaneously hires Dusty and invites him to live in their home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The more time that Zeke and Dusty spend together—the more they learn that they simply can’t stand each other. Dusty’s Mr. Perfect ways drive the alpha crazy while Zeke is an uncouth manwhore with no filter who irritates the omega to no end. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both men stick it out for one very important reason—the sweet baby boy who needs them both. This is a book about making a family and finding joy after loss. Zeke's large, supportive clan is there to give these two a nudge and remind them about what's truly important... family. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Return to MacIntosh Meadows one final time and spend a little time with the MacIntosh clan. Filled with pushy grannies, multiple pregnancies, cute babies, and kids being kids—this book will hit you in the feels and leave you smiling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the final book in the MacIntosh Meadows trilogy and is about 54k. This book contains mpreg, adults adulting in fun &amp;amp; sexy ways, and probably a lot more pottymouth language than should be used in a book with kids underfoot. 18+ readers only please. Trigger warning for miscarriage and loss of a sibling.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Given his well-earned bad boy reputation, Eric is having a tough time scoring.. When single Jean moves to town, she seems heaven sent by the sex gods. Only problem is, she not only wants nothing to do with him, but it turns out that she's pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over in a small town, Jean is determined to turn her wild lifestyle around and be the kind of mother she always wished she'd had. Since local bar owner and all round hottie, Eric Collins, is now determined to steer clear of her pregnant self, it should be easy. When she goes into labour during a snow storm and her car slides on some ice, it's Eric who comes to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a bond between them now, but is it enough? And can Eric give up his manwhore ways to be the man Jean needs?</description>

  <description>Bethany Johnson grew up one of the only humans in a pack of werewolves. She didn’t have an easy time and her self-confidence was almost non-existent. Finally, after some serious psychotherapy and the help of weight-loss surgery, she is feeling like the Bethany she has always wanted to be. But now she has to say goodbye to the werewolves in her life. Out with the old and in with the new this year…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Denarius is the new Alpha of the Delta pack. He’s never met Bethany but the second he scents her he knows she is his. No way is she going off to Italy for adventure and hot sex with other men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of Madame Eve these two will find that a mating is in the works for Christmas.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;One Alpha shape-shifting bear.&lt;br /&gt;Plus one geeky computer girl.&lt;br /&gt;Equals an explosive mated pairing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living her life as a reclusive computer programmer, Sorscha never expected much out of life. That was until the man who had not only ignored her for her whole life—but was hired as her bodyguard—suddenly shifts into a huge, hulking—bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching over Sorscha has been a pain, right in Tethur’s big, fat—well , you get the point. Suddenly Sorscha’s life is threatened, their deep mutual sexual attraction is exposed, and Tethur reveals he’s a shape-shifting hunk from a world right out of one of Sorscha’s favorite movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unlikely pair are thrust into a world of fantasy, sexual hunger, and mysterious powers. Join Sorscha as she discovers that she is not quite the no body she thought she was, and after years of trying to get in the Grumpy ole’ bear’s pants—she is going to have to start &lt;i&gt;‘trying’&lt;/i&gt; to keep him out of hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: Rated MA-17 for excessive use of the "C" word and other mature content. Maybe inappropriate for light-hearted readers.*</description>

  <description>Rein Dear is a prestigious title, accompanied by admiration, devotion, and celebrity status, all of which one saucy Vixen thrives on. Alas, Vixen’s only concerned with having fun, unlike his stuffy and sensible best friend, Rudy Rein Dear, who Vixen has always been jealous of. Aside from being chosen by Mayor Kringle to be Captain the Rein Dear Squadron, Rudy’s managed to snag himself a prince, even if that prince is the dangerous and imposing Jack Frost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All’s not lost for Vixen though. He discovers Jack’s cousin Vale has a soft spot for him. Vale Frost might not be a dashing prince, but he’s the next best thing: a decorated Lieutenant for the Toy Soldier Army, and a member of the Frost monarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to get what Vixen feels he deserves, he sets off on a mission to ensnare the kind-hearted lieutenant. But Vixen’s selfish ways are sure to lead to disaster, and it’ll take more than a little courage to set things right.</description>

  <description>Oliver Lyon loves his town, his job, and his house. He's got a nice car and a nice routine and a nice life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What he doesn't have is someone to share it with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then Anna walks into his life. The human is sexy, sleek, and seductive. She's everything a tiger could hope for in a mate, but there's more to Anna than meets the eye. She's in trouble because of an ancient clause that's rarely used in contracts anymore, but one that could potentially change her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Oliver be able to help her before it's too late?</description>

  <description>Discover a brand new race of Alpha males ready to find their mates in a dangerous warrior planet. Sassy women traveling with Gerri Wilder are in for the journey of a lifetime and a mate that will love them through the galaxy. Are you ready? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grab the next Galaxan romance between a sexy warrior and his fiery mate. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Attention is something Riley Parks usually shies away from, but when she finds herself on a shifter planet in a distant galaxy, attention is exactly what she's getting. Especially from one smokin' hot hunk of a man. Jag. The man sends her body into heat and her mind to a scramble whenever he's near, but she's not having it. No way. A little taste might not hurt, though, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Royal prince, warrior, and womanizer, Jag Kasaval has his sights set on Riley. She turns his world upside down and his inner lion is clawing to claim her. Not used to rejection, he's willing to do anything to get his mate. What he didn't expect was a feisty hellcat waiting to be unleashed beneath her quiet exterior. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Riley and Jag are thrown together to help plan a royal wedding and coronation. She refuses to admit Jag is exactly the man she wants, even if matchmaker Gerri Wilder says it's in the cards. In the midst of palace intrigue, Riley's swept up in scandal and danger that drags her beyond the Galaxa she's come to know. With her life in the balance, Jag will have to find her before it's too late or lose her forever.</description>

  <description>Paranormal Dating Agency Book 1 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Talia Barca needs a date. Badly. She uses the services of the Paranormal Dating Agency hoping for a decent guy to take to a family wedding. A wedding her ex-husband has wormed his way into as a guest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Connor and Theron want Tally to complete their Alpha triad. She's sexy, curvy and funny. But she's human. And they're not sure she'll go for a relationship with two men at the same time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As if deciding to give two men a shot wasn’t difficult enough, Tally will also need to deal with a threat from the pack. She'll either prove she's strong enough to be an Alpha mate or find herself at the mercy of a vicious opponent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reader Warning: This book contains lots of scorching sex (including a threesome so hot it will make your ereader sizzle), adult language (hanky panky with no dirty talk is no fun), and violence. If this is not the kind of stuff you like to read, skip this book. However, if you like dirty, raunchy sex with some sarcasm and two hot men on one curvy girl, then this is right up your alley. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>The Montgomery Ink series continues with a spin-off in Colorado Springs, where a familiar Montgomery finds her place in a new tattoo shop, and in the arms of her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrienne Montgomery is finally living her dreams. She’s opened a tattoo shop with her brother, Shep, and two of her cousins from Denver and she’s ready to take the city by storm with her art—as long as she can handle the pressure. When her new neighbors decide her shop isn’t a great fit for the community, however, she’ll have to lean on the one person she didn’t expect to fall for along the way…her best friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mace Knight takes pride in two things: his art and his daughter. He knows he’s taking a risk by starting over in a new shop with the Montgomerys, but the stakes are even higher when he finds himself wanting Adrienne more than he thought possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two fall fast and hard but they know the rules; they can’t risk their friendship, no matter how hot it is between the sheets and how many people try to stand in their way.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What do you do when your one-night stand shows up in your regular life?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alec Santiago is a single dad with a busy job; the last thing he’s looking for is a relationship. In the years since he lost his husband, he’s stayed faithful to his memory—aside from the occasional hook-up when he gets lonely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kade MacIntosh is a flirty, fun-loving, and happily-single omega. The only commitment he’s interested in is the one he’s made to teach dance to the kids of MacIntosh Meadows. Alphas? Please. Who needs them? Not Kade. Especially after the way he watched his parent’s marriage implode when he was a child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After a one-night stand in a neighboring town leaves Kade pregnant by an alpha he has no way of contacting, he’s ready to be a single dad. But what the heck is he supposed to do when Mr. Hot Stuff shows up in his studio? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The more that Kade and Alec try to pull away from each other, the more that fate keeps shoving them together—through busted water pipes, awful parents, pregnancy woes, and dance classes with cute kids who are way too smart for their own good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is over 55k and contains mpreg, adults adulting in fun &amp;amp; sexy ways, and probably more pottymouth language than should be used in a book with kids underfoot. 18+ readers only please.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What’s a guy to do when his straight best friend proposes a fake marriage? Just say — Yes!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Laurie Adams looked like he had it all, but his marriage was a sham, a Mr. Wrong chosen for all the wrong reasons. When his husband dies, Laurie has no time to mourn the cheating bastard—his in-laws have decided that Laurie isn’t fit to raise his children and they’ll do anything to take them from him. He’s lost his husband and lost his faith in people, but he won’t lose his children too. So he runs back home to the small farm town he’d left behind a decade ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dean MacIntosh should be the perfect alpha for anyone, but all around town he’s known as Mr. Not-Quite-Right, the last man a woman dates before she finds her real Prince Charming. It should bother him, but it doesn’t. So when his childhood best friend comes running home for protection, Dean has no problem stepping in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except when Dean offered to fake-marry Laurie, he never expected the wedding kiss to feel so sweet, and he begins to question the sexuality he once took for granted. From an awkward wedding night to an even more awkward honeymoon, Dean and Laurie find their affection runs deeper than either of them ever guessed. And maybe now is Dean's chance to be somebody's Mr. Right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is over 64k and contains mpreg, adults adulting in fun &amp;amp; sexy ways, and probably more pottymouth language than should be used in a book with kids underfoot. 18+ readers only please.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Mpreg Romance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brock Pilot always wanted to be a school psychologist, and he worked hard to make that happen. His first assignment is at his old high school and reality isn’t quite living up to fantasy. But he’s passionate about his career and even though the alpha/omega society he lives in expects him to settle down and have a bunch of babies, he isn’t interested. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Trevor Campbell pulls Brock over one afternoon and immediately recognizes Brock as the kindhearted boy who’d shown him around on his first day of school years ago. He’d always had a tiny crush on Brock, but they didn’t run in the same crowd, so they never really got close. But he’s always remembered how warm Brock was to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the two run into each other yet again at a club, their mutual attraction sparks. Neither man is interested in anything serious, but they both enjoy each other’s company. They decide a friends with benefits type of relationship is just about perfect. Everything is hot, and fun and drama free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until Brock gets pregnant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cop and His Omega is a 42, 000 word Mpreg Romance with lots of hot scenes and a HEA guaranteed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>
