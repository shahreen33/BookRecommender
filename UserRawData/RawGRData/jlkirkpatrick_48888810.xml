  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the marketing strategist who helped Steve Jobs launch the original Apple Macintosh comes a groundbreaking guide to positioning any company for industry dominance &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Cunningham has been at the forefront of tech and innovation since day one, and she's been helping companies create new product categories ever since. Now she reveals the winning framework she uses to transform markets and industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get to Aha!&lt;/i&gt; shows how to establish the kind of foundation world-class brands are built on. Too many business leaders fail to ask the most basic questions about their company--&lt;i&gt;Who are we? And why do we matter?&lt;/i&gt;--before they leap right into branding. Big mistake. A company must first know itself (establish its position) before it can express its identity (execute its branding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three types of companies in the world, each with its own DNA: Mothers are customer-oriented, Mechanics are product-oriented, and Missionaries are concept-oriented―and it's absolutely critical for business leaders to know which type their company is to create an authentic and ultimately "sticky" position in the market. A company's DNA is the key to achieving this and with it, a competitive advantage. Why? Because if a Mechanic creates a marketing campaign based on its belief that it is a Missionary, the underlying positioning will not ring true and the company won't gain a foothold in the market. But if a company positions itself in alignment with its DNA, it will resonate authentically and establish its role and relevance even in the face of a major competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get to Aha!&lt;/i&gt; presents a clear step-by-step framework that will help you determine your company's precise position in the marketing landscape, using Andy's DNA-based methodology. It takes you through the process of performing "genetic testing" on your company, examining the market through the six Cs of positioning, and developing your positioning statement--a rational, factual statement about your company's role and relevance. Then and only then can you create a branding and marketing strategy that will build market momentum and crush the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust Andy. Steve Jobs did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Lilith Chambers’ quiet life as a parish midwife shatters when the brother thought responsible for her death discovers she's alive and well. Having been raised in an orphanage, she has few memories of her real parentage or the circumstances of her disappearance from the life she ought to have. As she reorients herself in a new life, she meets the one man she can’t have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walter Hobbs, Baron Collingwood, is struggling to assume the mantle of his untimely inheritance. Then he meets Lilith Chambers, the long-lost daughter of the 15th Earl of Roddam. He is struck by love at first sight. She is everything he could ever want in a woman, except for two inconveniences: she is illegitimate, and she wants nothing to do with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the love story of Walter and Lilith as they discover themselves through each other.</description>

She's the last of the Arobol, a group of magic-wielders. After her parents were murdered by a dark entity when she was young, she has been trying to discover who has killed them. However, it wasn't just anyone; it was the Dark Sorcerer, a being who is believed to exist only in a fairytale. When an unexpected tragedy hits, Wren is forced to flee to town in hopes of finding the leader of the Gavreel Society, said to have information on her parents' killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zayne has been working for months to uncover the reason behind the dead bodies showing up in multiple towns and the mysterious symbol that is etched into their skin. As Trading Day approaches, he goes to meet with his Gavreel Society to formulate a new plan for uncovering the person behind these killings. Little does he know that he'll find the solution in a girl, one who's holding as many secrets as he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn is an assassin, killing anyone his Master orders him to kill. Tasked with finding the Enchanters' Child and bringing her back alive in exchange for his freedom, Quinn won't let anything get in his way. Yet, when he finally discovers the Enchanters' Child, he finds himself questioning his ability to fulfill his mission. Weaving a story of deception, he befriends the Enchanters' Child, but wonders if she is worth his freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they race to find the Sorcerer, each for their own reasons, secrets come out, powerful enough to tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Enchanters' Child is a great story with a strong premise. Navya has come up with a nice tone of mystery and introspection, and a totally new fantasy side of the world. It's an edgy and somewhat dark ride compelling readers to find out what is going to happen next... It wrenched many emotions out of me, including disbelief, sadness, tension, worry, hope and too many others to list."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; -- Ann Howard Creel, author of The Magic of Ordinary Days and The Whiskey Sea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;" A wonderful account of a magnificient adventure, filled with suspense and seasoned with plenty of twists and turns .."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; --The Priaries Book Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Enchanters' Child is an engaging read.

  <description>Time is running out! Prince Dustin and Clara only have three days to save the kingdoms deep in the Black Forest. They must journey even deeper into the woods, a mystical and perilous realm of magic, enchantment and monstrous creatures. Clara soon discovers why those that travel to this faraway land seldom return to tell their tales. They never suspect that Clara’s uncle, Herr Drosselmeyer, a powerful wizard, has a dark secret that becomes their biggest challenge.&lt;br /&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;The thrilling adventure continues for 12-year old Clara and Prince Dustin, as Clara returns to the Land of Legends, a magical place of creatures and animals; a brave prince, fairy tale princesses, and a Snow Queen. &lt;br /&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;Prince Dustin and Clara ... a classic tale of fantasy and adventure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW by:&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Joenile S. Albert-Reese &lt;br /&gt;Principal at a Performing, Fine Arts &amp;amp; Regional Gifted Elementary School &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I found this novel to be full of adventure, unexpected twists, magic, loyalty, and deception. Nicholson has held to his masterful ability to keep the readers on the edge of their seats as he awakens that mischievous curiosity that sleeps within each of us, no matter our age.”</description>

  <description>Why don't the adults in the story of "The Emperor's New Clothes" support the boy who commented on the emperor's decidedly missing wardrobe? Why don't more people practice the independent judgment of that boy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is fear, real or imagined, of what might happen to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More often than not, our fears of expressing independent judgment stem from what others might think of us. Disapproval, maybe rejection, is the worst that might happen, yet the anxiety caused by self-doubt can be so strong as to blur our perception of the facts, thus preventing any expression of an independent judgment. When choices based on self-doubt build up over time, habits of perceiving reality through clouded lenses become established patterns of behavior. Seeing the world through the eyes of others, whomever those significant others may be, becomes the norm. Conventionality is the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent judgment is a fundamental requirement of the free society. Unless each adult citizen possesses a significant amount of self-esteem expressed as independent judgment, such a society cannot last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This raises an additional question: What kind of psychology is required for the survival of free societies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author answers: one that correctly identifies reality--the world external to our minds, as well as our minds' internal contents and processes--to guide our choices and actions to live happy, healthy lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free, unhampered market societies require citizens who possess an unhampered consciousness, that is, citizens who possess and practice a strong commitment to facts, expressed as independent judgment and independent action. To ensure that we develop and maintain an independent personality, and therefore will support a free society, we must learn the skill of introspection to identify and correct, or preferably prevent, mistaken thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flawed conclusions about life's events cause anxiety, thwarting and constricting our lives, often leading to dependence and unhappiness, which also often means a diminished likelihood of valuing or accepting individual freedom. The virtues of psychological independence are integrity, courage, and a refusal blindly to obey authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book concludes that psychological independence and its monitoring skill, introspection, are indispensable prerequisites of the free society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Independent Judgment and Introspection &lt;/em&gt;is based on the philosophy of Ayn Rand, the psychology of Nathaniel Branden, and especially the psychology of Edith Packer. Packer's concepts of core evaluation and introspection heavily influence this work.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;From USA Today and #1 Amazon bestselling author Jeremy Bates comes the second book in the all-new WORLD'S SCARIEST LEGENDS series.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;In 1954, at the start of the Cold War, the Soviet military offered four political prisoners their freedom if they participated in an experiment requiring them to remain awake for fourteen days while under the influence of a powerful stimulant gas. The prisoners ultimately reverted to murder, self-mutilation, and madness. None survived.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In 2018, Dr. Roy Wallis, an esteemed psychology professor at UC Berkeley, is attempting to recreate the same experiment during the summer break in a soon-to-be demolished building on campus. He and two student assistants share an eight-hour rotational schedule to observe their young Australian test subjects around the clock.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;What begins innocently enough, however, morphs into a nightmare beyond description that no one could have imagined--with, perhaps, the exception of Dr. Roy Wallis himself.&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Praise for Jeremy Bates:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A master storyteller!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Best book I've read to date" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Old-school horror story reminiscent of &lt;strong&gt;Stephen King&lt;/strong&gt;" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perfect for &lt;strong&gt;Laymon&lt;/strong&gt; fans!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Definitely recommend to all fans of modern horror" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any &lt;strong&gt;Stephen King&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Dean Koontz&lt;/strong&gt; fan will love it" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I sort of fell into Jeremy Bates by accident, and I'm so glad I did. He's one of my new favorite writers, and I urge everyone to check him out" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most chilling book I’ve ever read!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Definitely gave me chills reading this late at night which hasn't happened since I was a 13-year-old teenager reading &lt;strong&gt;Stephen King's &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt; for the first time" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely loved this book" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Non-stop adrenaline rush from beginning to end" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was hooked from the first page!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Binge-worthy!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to stop reading at certain points because he was freaking me out. That only happens to me with one other writer - &lt;strong&gt;Stephen King&lt;/strong&gt;" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the best books I have ever read!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A very juicy, scary ride" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Suicide Forest is up there with &lt;strong&gt;Joe Hill's &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt;" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Scariest book I've ever read" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Huge fan of Mr Bates! You won't be disappointed" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Edge-of-my-seat experience! I felt I was indeed living the horror" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Page-turner with a twist! I was hanging on to every word!" ★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I found it rivaling some of &lt;strong&gt;Stephen King's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For many teens, adolescence is an uncertain time filled with angst, peer pressure, and personal identity crises. In the halls of a suburban high school, the lives of four teens intertwine as they search to discover who they are and overcome their fears. The social media-obsessed world, which they find themselves in, reveals that support is an illusion and truth languishes behind pretenses. Emma, a poor teen with an abusive stepfather, has just lost her older sister in a horrific accident. Shaun, a shy and appearance-obsessed boy, is drawn to her. Sophia is a sophisticated rich girl whose life isn't as perfect as it seems. Jackson is a star athlete grappling with a secret he fears will undermine his carefully cultivated image. While Emma struggles to resolve her parental conflicts, Shaun strives to overcome his awkwardness. As Sophia fights to change the labels the world has placed upon her, Jackson battles to protect his secret. This rewarding and unpredictable journey highlights the difficult choices the teens face as they fight for independence, attempt to define themselves, and protect their social facades.</description>

  <description>Wilshire, Maryland, a quaint shore town on the Chesapeake, promises Darrell Henshaw a new start in life and a second chance at love. That is, until he learns the town hides an ugly secret. A thirty-year-old murder in the high school. And a frightening ghost stalking his new office. Burned by an earlier encounter with the spirit world, Darrell doesn't want to get involved, but when the desperate ghost hounds him, he concedes. Assisted by his new love, he follows a trail that leads to the civil rights movement, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and even the Klu Klux Klan. Then, when two locals who try to help are murdered, Darrell is forced to decide if he's willing to risk his life--and the life of the woman he loves--to expose the killers of a young man he never knew.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Shirley F'N Lyle: VIVA the REVOLUTION&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Shirley Lyle hooks for a living. She's a big girl who keeps her profile low. But when a drug lord and his son toss her trailer, she adds a couple letters to her name. Now she's killed the drug lord's son and two meth zombies. Fed up, ready to set fire to her past, her job-and her trailer-she's dragged back into the role she's forsworn by a man who presses her buttons with a hammer. Shirley realizes she'll never be more than a four hundred pound hooker. But when her partner-in-revolution, Ulyana the Ukrainian stripper disappears, her car empty and bullet holes in the glass, Shirley reaches deep, finds her sass, puts flame to fuse. Who took Ulyana?The Russian mob?The man who beat Shirley down?The 83 year old drug lord who refuses to die?When all your life you've been one thing, but your survival-and your friend's-demand you be the hero...You put on the F'N cape. Prepare yourself for a battle of good and evil unlike any you've seen. With rave reviews from Publishers Weekly (starred review and best of the week), IndieNext List, Kirkus, BlueInk Review, Foreword Reviews, San Francisco Book Review, Seattle Book Review, Manhattan Book Review, Indie Reader and more, if you haven't read Clayton Lindemuth's unique brand of literary noir, what are you waiting for?&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Public flirtation is a crime in Iran, with predictable consequences. Jamileh Delkash has a teen crush, and she’s only fifteen (almost fifteen). She can only dodge the Basij (Moral Police) for so long, and she’s already floundering in Islamic propriety.&lt;br /&gt; Her budding independence stems from visits to the Monkey Bar, where local teens gamble on monkey bicycle races. Here, she attempts to fan the flames of love with Armand Ducasse, the son of Iran’s Ambassador to France.&lt;br /&gt; Being good and being happy proves difficult to reconcile. The ever-watchful Basij and Armand’s call to war, triggers their flight to Paris. But so-called friends, caprice, and Afghan slavers threatens their midnight escapade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PERSIANALITY was written to be a fun read, but given today’s dark and explosive political atmosphere, every father should buy this bildungsroman for his daughter, to explore life’s perilous questions before confronting them.</description>

  <description>Resurrection Lily shares a story of inheritance and intuition, of what can surface in the body and the spirit when linked by DNA. As Amy Byer Shainman discovers she has inherited a BRCA gene mutation that puts her at high risk of developing certain cancers, she struggles to come to terms with preventively removing her breasts when she does not have a breast cancer diagnosis. Through her experience making decisions about her health, Amy becomes invigorated with purpose and establishes herself as a leading advocate for those with BRCA and other hereditary cancer syndromes, tirelessly working to educate others facing the same daunting reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painting a timely and moving portrait of what it feels like to carry a BRCA gene mutation, Resurrection Lily provides firsthand insight into the patient experience. Weaved throughout Amy's open and vulnerable story is the expertise of her doctors, education from top medical experts in cancer genetics, and whispered lifesaving guidance from her grandmother Lillian.</description>

  <description>Dan "Tito" Davis comes from a town in South Dakota that's so small everyone knows their neighbor's cat's name. But once he got out, he made some noise. While at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, he started manufacturing White Crosses, aka speed, and soon had the Banditos Motorcycle Club distributing ten million pills a week. After serving a nickel, he got into the weed game, but just when he got going, he was set up by a childhood friend. Facing thirty years, Davis slipped into Mexico, not knowing a word of Spanish, which began a thirteen-year odyssey that led him to an underground hideout for a MedellIn cartel, through the jungles of the Darien Gap, the middle of Mumbai's madness, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We've known for quite a while that Peter Conti is able to capture the essence of American culture, especially the streets, dead on. With Gringo, we see that Conti writes equally as well about such diverse locals as a post-Escobar MedellIn, the jungles of the Darien Gap, and the swarm of humanity in Mumbai. He introduces us to a wide range of characters including a Bandito named Fonzie, a hit woman who moonlights as a tutor, a chemistry nerd, and the heads of some of the most powerful cartels in Latin America. But the most impressive is Conti's portrayal of Dan Davis, the South Dakotan pot trafficker who we follow through these dangerous terrains as he tries to stay one step ahead of the feds and federales."&lt;br /&gt; -Michael Corrente, "Federal Hill" and "Brooklyn Rules"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Peter Conti's writing is crisp, sharp, and has a sting. There's an underlying sense of danger throughout this book. He writes as if his fingers are bullets."&lt;br /&gt; -Buddy Giovinazzo, "Life is Always Hot in Cracktown"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "From millions of dollars lost, just as quickly as gained, to repeating the third grade. . .at age forty, Dan 'Tito' Davis has lived three or four lifetimes. Peter Conti does a masterful job of weaving Davis's colorful life into a provocative page turner."&lt;br /&gt; -Christopher Grant, "Teenie" and "False Start"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Peter Conti has written a compelling page-turner about a man on the run and out of time that takes the reader inside the dark demimonde of drug trafficking. You won't be able to put it down."&lt;br /&gt; -Frank Owen, "Clubland" and "No Speed Limit"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Peter Conti has created a gripping tale of larceny like no other. Gringo is an enthralling look inside the drug trade and life on the run against all odds. You can literally smell the inherent sense of fear and danger jumping of the pages. A must read."&lt;br /&gt; -Dante Ross, Grammy-winning producer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "When it's done well, story-telling is an art that can shift our perspective allow us to walk through another man's reality. In this case we experience the highs and lows of a cunning marijuana trafficker and international fugitive. As a story, Gringo has it all. The fascinating life of Dan 'Tito' Davis is masterfully detailed by Peter Conti in a book that you will not be able to put down."&lt;br /&gt; -Slaine, "La Coka Nostra" and "The Town"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Sharp and insightful, Conti takes us inside the ultimate fugitive story. You know characters like these exist in the world, but rarely do you get to travel the globe with them."&lt;br /&gt; -Rob Weiss, "Entourage" and "Ballers"</description>

  <description>Welcome to my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story is written in diary format. I wrote it from June 16, 2013, to June 15, 2014. What I didn't know, as I was writing, was that I was capturing the last year of my son's life. Pat died, unexpectedly, on July 23, 2014, in a hospital psych ward. Suddenly, my diary morphed into a more poignant record than I'd anticipated, and after he died, I discovered Pat had been making regular posts on Facebook. I decided to add his comments to my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like stories where I can extrapolate from the singular to the universal--that is where I can identify with a common denominator in another person's experience. One early reader of my diary said, "Your story is so relatable." That's what I hope other readers will say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may relate to my story if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a child (chilldren) you love more than your own life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a child who suffers from serious mental illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've lost a child--no matter what age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're a member of the sandwich generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You treasure conversations with children--especially when they're your grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your cat or your dog is in charge of your household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your bones are beginning to creak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wake up each morning with a huge hole in your heart but you know, somehow, some way, you have to get up and put one foot in front of the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You enjoy reading the other side of history--about ordinary people and their daily lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've been thinking of leaving something for your descendants--a letter, story, diary, song, painting, or poem--but you haven't gotten around to it. Maybe my diary will spur you on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More notes about the format:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've added a Before section (Scenes from the Trenches). Going in, I want the reader to know "Yes, Houston, we really do have a problem." I've divided my diary into quarters--Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. I introduce each with a poem--three of them are Pat's. I end with an After section I didn't see coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was writing, I had no idea, from day to day, what stories were unfolding. I learn, right along with the reader, what will happen next. We're all on a journey. Thank you for going on this journey with me. Dede&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dede posted her story in two-week increments at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.soonerthantomorrow.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.soonerthantomorrow.com&lt;/a&gt;. The following are readers' responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful words with an undertone that has caught me . . . carrying me up and down. Such a good writer that I am grateful to be with you. I can borrow some courage here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Janet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy for the readers who will discover you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Liz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dede, every one of your blog posts has a portion that I love so much that I take a screenshot and read it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Stacey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dede, I anxiously await each posting from your blog/book. You write with such skill, and not easy when it's so personal, but your passion sprinkled with humor are the reasons that this is successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Joan L.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've done this, the primal scream and the mother animal instinct. There can't be anything more painful, not even death. My son was a normal little boy and a normal young man until schizophrenia came calling. Now I feel so shattered. I love your diary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--J.H.D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only this was a contrived drama. It's so visceral. You're an artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Heidi F.</description>

  <description>I love writing poetry where just a few lines could take you on a journey, enticing new feelings and emotions. I call it "Interactive Poetry!" &lt;br /&gt;The meaning that you derive from each poem will feel different from another person reading the same lines. Try it and see for yourself! Promise to take you on many sublime paths full of wonder and enchantment. &lt;br /&gt;Read my poems and enjoy trying to decipher which meaning suits you the best. Let it stay in your mind a while longer because the next time you read it, you might feel differently!&lt;br /&gt;Discover more than 100 poems that I wrote with varied emotions and at contrasting points in my life. My sentiments will show through each and every one of them. &lt;br /&gt;First mine and now yours...Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARTZFRIEND&lt;br /&gt;Barretto has incredible talent. she gives her poems that professionalism that great poets and writers possess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grymm&lt;br /&gt;The author is passionate, creative, and full of emotion and it's all proven as she bleeds ink on the page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V.E.&lt;br /&gt;These poems exhibit an awareness of oneself, an immersion into the author's psyche, and a bit of the macabre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grady Harp&lt;br /&gt;This book sparks the imagination and supports the growth of the visual and the emotional spirit. Another fine book by Chriselda to stimulate thoughts and perceptions and to encourage each of our emotions.</description>

Or his promiscuous sometime lover, Janet Weissel?In Unrelenting Peril, the leadership team of Multima Corporation desperately defends against clandestine attempts by The Organization to seize control of the company. Unexpected twists and turns rapidly emerge across four continents as a ruthless and determined plotter relentlessly strives to steal a successful, multinational company worth billions.

  <description>From a remote corner of Nepal's countryside, fourteen-year-old Avhi Tharu says a prayer for Mr. Singh. She has been promised to him in marriage. Instead, she clubs him in the head and flees with his ox and cart from the village. Days later, she slips through a mountain pass and into the lives of fellow travelers en route to Pokhara, and Kathmandu. On the run, uncertain who to trust, and how to reconcile the past, Avhi's encounter with girls and young women at the Thank Kot Center, stirs her to discover a purpose beyond herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avhi's Flight is a beautiful and bittersweet adventure. Its story weaves together the complex threads of one girl's search for wholeness, the reckoning of lives left behind, and a culture's disregard for its women. Like the nonfiction bestseller Half The Sky, this important piece of fiction aligns with a central moral challenge of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If you're interested in women standing up for women, then this is a must-read."&lt;br /&gt; ---Bonnie Roberts &lt;br /&gt; Contributing Writer, The Huffington Post; Fellow in Verse, Dublin; &lt;br /&gt; Nat'l Endowment for the Humanities Scholar, Paris; Fulbright Scholar, Turkey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This book highlights the sad realities that accompany women and their children in Nepal on a daily basis. It is an eye-opening story about how profound gender-based injustices are common practices in Nepal. The purpose of the Women's Foundation of Nepal is to tackle these issues by raising awareness of them, and empowering women with their rights."&lt;br /&gt; ---Renu Sharma &lt;br /&gt; President, The Women's Foundation of Nepal</description>

  <description>When attorney Cullen Molloy attends his fortieth high school reunion, he doesn’t expect to be defending childhood friends against charges of murder…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a small town on the high plains of Eastern New Mexico, life and culture are shaped by the farm roads defining the 640-acre sections of land homesteaders claimed at the turn of the Twentieth Century. Cullen and Shelby Blaine explore first love along these section roads during the 1960’s, forging a life-long emotional bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As junior high school band nerds, Cullen and Shelby fall under the protection of football player and loner, Buddy Boyd. During their sophomore year of high school, Buddy is charged with killing a classmate and is confined to a youth correctional facility. When he returns to town facing the prospect of imprisonment as an adult, Cullen becomes Buddy’s protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case haunts the three friends into adulthood, and it isn’t until their fortieth reunion, that they’re forced to revisit that horrible night. When a new killing takes place, Cullen, Shelby and Buddy find themselves reliving the nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murder is an easy thing to hide along old country section roads.</description>

  <description>Set 80 years into the future, Nelson Jones, a young military cadet full of optimism, is enlisted into the New Era: a fascist regime that arises to rule the world after an attack from an alien species. Under the leadership of Earth's dictator with his ruthless enforcer, Nelson witnesses horrible abuses of power and is forced to confront his values and his world view to make difficult choices. When he happens across a small faction of resistance against this tyranny, Nelson must risk his life to do what he feels is right. Author Jason F. Boggs introduces a universe full of complex characters where the line that separates right from wrong is blurred. &lt;em&gt;The Devil's Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is the first of a rich trilogy that explores what it means to be human, from a multiple of perspectives.</description>

  <description>Andrea Francis has loved Max Roarke and Robby Trask most of her life. As young men they pursued her like stags in heat contesting for a prized doe. Ultimately, she marries one, then files for divorce to marry the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During their pursuit, Max and Robby prove to be best friends yet worst enemies. From Long Island’s Hamptons, to Paris, to Cap Ferret, to Baden Baden, Malibu and an island off the Tuscan coast the two men narrow their world to a population of two. In it they vie with each other via contrived competitions and bizarre games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their limited world there can only be one winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be the loser is intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrea, once their trophy, finds herself consigned to the role of reluctant spectator and, in time, reduced to their unintended victim. Knowledge of this crushing fact and the pain the two men’s mano a mano games has left her determined to exact retribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, three days before her murder, the revenge she has planned will demonstrate she can play their bizarre game better than they could ever have imagined.</description>

  <description>Can Multima Corporation withstand another attack from organized crime? While billionaire John George Mortimer copes with treatment for cancer, the accomplished CEO must also ward off challenges for control of his sprawling fictional American empire both from within the company and from nefarious powers operating outside the law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Multima Scheme is a fast-paced account of the lengths to which organized crime can infiltrate large global corporations and seize control of respected businesses to conceal activities that are both illegal and immoral but generate billions. It's also a story of survival - how individuals and organizations might react under intense pressures and the ease with which people can cross lines between what's legal and what's not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using his knowledge of how large multinationals operate - accumulated over 40 years working with major corporations around the world - author Gary D. McGugan weaves a tale of intrigue using a writing style that readers will find hard to put down once started.</description>

  <description>John George Mortimer is at the top of his game. The company he built from the ground up is now one of the largest in the world, and exciting developments promise to broaden its reach into even bigger markets. He prides himself on making good decisions and surrounding himself with strong, capable people, but after learning he has developed breast cancer, he realizes he must quickly find a worthy successor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He challenges his top executives to develop radical game-changer business strategies that should make it easy for his board of directors to choose one of them. Despite careful preparation, his plan begins to unravel almost immediately. Organized crime, sexual misadventures, and personal tragedy combine to complicate his efforts to select a new CEO. Even as he lies in recovery from cancer treatments, he is forced to battle against shadowy interests who seek to take away the fruit of his life's work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Weeks Less a Day is a fast-paced international business thriller that takes us inside the lives of high-powered executives and the lengths they will go to achieve results. It is a story of how quickly things can change at the highest levels of corporate leadership, and how easily lives can crumble in pursuit of power and control.</description>

  <description>Veteran political journalist Michael McCord's wicked and wild 2013 political satire The Execution Channel: A Political Fable foreshadowed the rise of Trumpsanity. It was only the beginning. The second act of the Real America saga continues with the recently released End Times: More Great Adventures in Real America. In an alternative yet eerily familiar American political universe, Lawrence C. 'Demon Seed' Bowie survived an attempt coup in 2018 but has rebounded with his customary good karma. Bowie is Chairman, CEO, President, and toga-wearing Emperor Supreme for Life of Real America, Inc. the Confederate-admiring, whites-preferred, and corporate-run nation that seceded from Old USA in 2020.Bowie has implemented The Galtian Imperatives (inspired by Ayn Rand, the goddess of Real America, and her greatest creation, the capitalist icon John Galt), the faith-based economic religion of super-duper profit capitalism, slavery revival and maximum plunder. Bowie and his fellow Real American founding fathers (Guardians of Galt) aim to eradicate the "moocher-taker-liberal-feminist-elitist hordes" and nurture a new country with the best aspects of a national crime syndicate and a death cult.Bowie's personality cult knows no bounds. As he prepares a 2021 Coronation Night of glory to celebrate his magnificence and dazzle the world, it appears nothing will stop him or Real America from a rendezvous with destiny. Alas, many foes conspire against him and threaten Real America: * Legendary secret agent Penelope the Psychic runs the intelligence forces of the Moocher Resistance Front. Bowie has put a $20 million bounty on her head but Penelope and her team of young digital warriors formulate a daring plan to take Bowie down.*His beloved Mama Bowie defects to Old USA and denounces her son "as an ignorant and dangerous fool." She also humiliates her son by writing a scandalous book (The Real Bloody Story of The Execution Channel) that shows him to be a cold-blooded killer and pathological liar.* The mysterious and elusive R-Gurr leads the Moocher Resistance Front in a guerrilla war against Real America and annoys Bowie to no end. R-Gurr also ruins Bowie's coronation night of glory.* The Pious Pauli is the former Congressional leader who defected from Old USA and became Bowie's closest adviser. As the Great Galtian Mystic, he enforces economic etiquette in Real America by deciphering the gospel of Ayn Rand and John Galt. The Pious Pauli also leads a conspiratorial plot to overthrow Bowie.* Mr. Jones, the Real America, Inc. Grand Security &amp;amp; Secret Police Czar, is the second-most feared man in Real America. But Penelope the Psychic has forced him to be a double agent which complicates his attempts to thwart the "End Times" business plan of The Pious Pauli.End Times: More Great Adventures in Real America invites reader to believe (a la Lewis Carroll) six impossible things if not by breakfast than certainly by supper.</description>

  <description>(Recommended reading for ages 18+ and includes discussion questions at the end for reading groups and book clubs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the center of a fierce, fiery, and invisible battle is Dr. Garnet Gibbs, a history professor, who is considered to be both a guidepost for and a mystery to many on the job. After hours, she often finds herself caught in a vortex of drama surrounding her family, associates, and friends. Although she tries to offer support as best she can, the shenanigans of all involved may prove to be too much for her, especially given the potpourri of players in her world, including: Jamay, her adopted daughter; R.J., her grandson, whose father is facing challenges as he serves overseas; Kemal and Manuela, a kinky church couple; Tario, a Que Dog, whose frivolity and wry wit lead to his nail-biting confrontation with death, igniting a spirited rally in the city; Nieko, a gay gentleman, who is rethinking his sexuality but whose ex-boyfriend is making it tough; Rusty, an avowed redneck, who makes a shocking decision since he believes President Trump is taking too long to do something about the current state of affairs; and Celeste, her what-comes-up-comes-out co-worker, who has a knack for catching people off guard with her uncanny sense of humor. Critical interactions reveal key life lessons, but not all interchanges end on an upswing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in modern times, &lt;em&gt;Two 'Til Midnight&lt;/em&gt; is a soap-operatic dramedy that presents two distinct and separate worlds that thrive together, both influencing the other in their own unique way. Ultimately, their coexistence produces a jaw-dropping ending that no one sees coming. Something's brewing. Someone's watching. And time is running out! Midnight is fast approaching. What will go down when the clock strikes twelve?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Email: bringbernard@gmail.com &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://Facebook.com/thedillardbrand" rel="nofollow"&gt;Facebook.com/thedillardbrand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://Twitter.com/bl_dillard" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twitter.com/bl_dillard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://Instagram.com/bl_dillard" rel="nofollow"&gt;Instagram.com/bl_dillard&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>GOD WANTED HIM TO RESCUE HER IF IT WAS THE LAST THING HE DID . . . AND IT LIKELY WOULD BE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A murder occurs in a prominent northern Arizona family . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derrick Walton is on a mission to atone for his sins, putting his own life at risk to save a woman in distress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larissa Baxter is a gorgeous Arizona socialite who has always relied on her striking beauty to get what she wants. After being falsely arrested for murder and posting bail, however, she faces life in prison. On the run, she must do what, to her, is the unthinkable--de-emphasize her looks to appear as average as possible and avoid undue attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After their paths cross, their lives take an unlikely turn when, together, they live in isolation in Alabama, and Derrick realizes that the most important rescue of all still lies ahead--saving Larissa's soul.</description>

  <description>Kit Markham’s world turns upside down when Jack, the boy she always believed she would marry, turns out to be her half-brother. At sixteen, feisty and headstrong, she leaves her home in Melbourne and flees to England. The year is 1855.&lt;br /&gt;Though unsure of where life will lead, she is determined to stay away long enough to regain control over her future and leave her feelings for Jack behind.&lt;br /&gt;The Crimean War is drawing to a close in Europe and nurses are needed on the hospital ships bringing the wounded back to Britain. Kit volunteers and meets a young Canadian who was severely wounded outside Sebastopol. After caring for him she realises a calling to train as a doctor and travels to America.&lt;br /&gt;As a young woman seeking a place in a man’s world, she encounters both opposition and setbacks to her plan and must draw on her strength and resilience to survive. Ultimately she must decide what it is that will grant her the fulfilment she seeks and make her truly happy.</description>

  <description>Tookie has a unique outlook and zest for life, and her adventures will keep readers enchanted from the first page to the very last sentence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tired of a marriage that has been dead for years, Tookie branches out into the dating world. Trying to find a man that can keep up with her lascivious needs is not easy. Tookie is on fire and the men in her life just cannot meet her needs for the long term. When Tookie finds out that her job is going to be axed, she is dismayed because it will be hard for her to find another one. She is in her sixties and feels she will be in low demand. Her interest is piqued however, when she is offered the chance to be a spy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Tookie Goes Undercover” by George Q. Kaplan is an entertaining novel that starts with a bang and keeps the momentum going until the very end. She is a strong woman who only has one motive in life and that is to move forward….I could see this novel becoming an action movie or a TV series and enjoying great success.

  <description>WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT, BIRNAM WOOD COMES TO DUNSINANE HILL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Risk Theatre Model of Tragedy presents a profoundly original theory of drama that speaks to modern audiences living in an increasingly volatile world driven by artificial intelligence, gene editing, globalization, and mutual assured destruction ideologies. Tragedy, according to risk theatre, puts us face to face with the unexpected implications of our actions by simulating the profound impact of highly improbable events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, classicist Edwin Wong shows how tragedy imitates reality: heroes, by taking inordinate risks, trigger devastating low-probability, high-consequence outcomes. Such a theatre forces audiences to ask themselves a most timely question---what happens when the perfect bet goes wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does Wong reinterpret classic tragedies from Aeschylus to O'Neill through the risk theatre lens, he also invites dramatists to create tomorrow's theatre. As the world becomes increasingly unpredictable, the most compelling dramas will be high-stakes tragedies that dramatize the unintended consequences of today's risk takers who are taking us past the point of no return....</description>

  <description>Imogene, a country girl by birth, has always longed for the bright lights of New York City. After graduating from a small-town college, she moves to the big city with her husband Steve and supports him through law school by working low-level publishing jobs. An aspiring writer herself, Imogene struggles with both marriage and career. Then her former college roommate, Sara, arrives in town with plans to establish a film production company. Sara takes over an outfit previously run by her brother, a semi-retired rock star, and Imogene jumps at the chance to join this exciting new venture. She becomes Sara’s confidante and assistant in an ambitious movie project about a youth revolution that threatens to engulf the nation’s capital. As the cast expands and the script evolves, the story line flirts dangerously with reality. The filmmakers can’t predict whether the project will make their fortunes or shatter their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What if ... you were told you won't be accepted because you don't sound like everyone else... you want more choices than your world offers... you love a man you can never have ... you need to reconnect with the land you left behind? That is Margaret's story. Becoming Herself is the tale of a woman's road to self-discovery in the first half of the 20th century. It is as current as today's headlines. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On her first day in America, seven-year old Maggie Clancy is placed in an orphanage by her grieving widowed father. She is told that from now on she will be called Margaret. Maggie will no longer exist. She will have to forge her own path in this new world of upstate New York. Her lovely singing voice provides her the needed entry. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an era when she loses the corset and gains the right to vote, Margaret struggles with balancing the roles of wife and mother with her longing to do even more with her life. She's a witness to the prejudices experienced by Irish immigrants and to Americans questioning the patriotism of their German-Americans neighbors during WWI. Despite that, she hopes and believes that man's inhumanity to man will lessen when women make their voices heard. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margaret embraces the changes and challenges of a world that's experiencing airplanes in the skies, radios in the parlor and women beginning to assert their independence inside and outside the home. Margaret yearns to find the Maggie who's been lost by returning to Ireland, the land of her birth. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Becoming Herself, Margaret shares her dreams, conflicts, and never- to- be-told secrets. It is the story of a woman searching to become all she is capable of being. &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>After immersing themselves in mantras in I AM Manifesto, young siblings Hao Finley and Sabine Yi Lee are on their journey of seeking knowledge from around the world. In Humongous (&amp;amp; Cool) Words For Kids, these philomaths not only learn about words from their own and other cultures and countries, they absorb new facts about stuff they thought they knew. Name the subject, they're sharing: science and math (big, uncomplicated check!), different languages ("oui, sí, shì" check!), environmental awareness (layered-atmosphere check!), etiquette (thank you, check!), music (treble clef check!), international cuisine (lots of yummy checks!), and many more. All shared with wit.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;2019 Readers' Favorite International Book Awards gold medal winner for epic fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;Winner of the 2019 CIPA EVVY award, fairytale/folklore/mythology&lt;br /&gt;National Indie Excellence Awards finalist&lt;br /&gt;2018 Foreward Indies finalist for fantasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His duty is to die young, but fate has something far more lethal in mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Kaell breaks, the kingdom breaks with him. And prophecy says the 19th Bladesman &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; break ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bonded Warrior ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kill. Die young. That's what a swordsman bonded to the ancient gods does. Without expecting praise from the man who trained him to survive this centuries-old, malignant war against the inhuman followers of an invincible lord. But Kaell wants more. More of Val Arques' attention, his approval. Just more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fire dancer ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ice lord, spy, Heath never loses a fire dance. Yet he longs to know that thrill of danger down his spine as he kills for his god, to fight a warrior who might, just might be better than him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The broken ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Val Arques is a bladesman of formidable power entrusted not only with Kaell's life but with the truth that will destroy him. Banished to a grim outpost of this doomed kingdom of sorcery, poetry and treachery, he cannot afford to care about the young warrior. For love means loss. And Val Arques has a shameful secret ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A kingdom on the edge of chaos ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a vengeful god escapes his ancient prison and Kaell is drawn into his web of deception, even Val Arques can't protect him from the dark prophecy awaiting him. Because you can't flee fate unless you're willing to do the unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duty and love collide in this powerful epic fantasy about shattering loss, betrayal and the price of power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Editorial Review&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Little Michael, Christopher Fox and Isaac Burns don't know that their paths will cross and their lives changed in a cruel manner that sees them through the intricate web of Africa's political heartache, manifested in a well-orchestrated coup attempt in the African country of Sivals. Little witnesses an overnight success of his business only to see the building burnt down in a calculated sabotage. Chris sees his life changed from prominence to near pauperism. &lt;br /&gt;Isaac Burns thinks, with blunt self-righteousness, that his philanthropic work is enough an effort to win the hearts of his fellow countrymen in Panda, and the whole of the African continent. He'd soon learn the bitter reality of his capitalist life. &lt;br /&gt;The problem though is the three men don't know that someone is watching every single step they take in their lives. Will they learn the bitter truth? &lt;br /&gt;The truth will first taste bitter before the end of their nightmares. &lt;br /&gt;The Pipers, a politically-charged group that infiltrates governments and multinational corporations and forces them to help the poor, has marked the three men for a real life's experimental cruelty. &lt;br /&gt;Isaac Burns is shown the bitter reality of corruption, greed and political blackmail, which is aided by his investments. Innocent civilians are being ruthlessly displaced from their villages in South Sudan around oil fields without compensation. It's Isaac's investment in play. Only The Pipers will show Mr. Burns that wealth acquisition shouldn't be a poor people's livelihood antithesis. &lt;br /&gt;Little Michael's teenage drugs involvement lands him in jail only to meet big black men with radical, infectious Pan-Africanism. His leaving jail, he doesn't know, is only the beginning of his African adventure that will see him hate his African brothers before he realizes the truth of his Africanism. &lt;br /&gt;Christopher Fox sees his life soar only to crumble in a flash. He's brought back to the company of his high school buddy, Little, and Isaac, the CEO of the company in which he mysteriously lost his job. Chris is thrown into an orchestrated poverty meant to make him experience how it feels to be a poor, taken-for-granted African man. &lt;br /&gt;The three men involuntarily descend on Africa in a political roller coaster. It'll be a test of power-players' humanity, emotive elasticity, and the extent of human greed and political and economic opportunism.</description>

  <description>In this collection of personal essays, Pamela Capone writes with both heart and humor. Using historical and contemporary examples--as well as stories from her own life--she writes for the soul and for the sole intention of pointing to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is about teensy-weensy firecracker love, love that, when ignited, lights up someone's dark night. It's about feet-on-the-ground, sky's-the-limit, life-changing, world-engaging, mustard-seed love that grows from a hunch, an idea, a nudging from above--and then blossoms in the willingness of a heart to act on its sometimes-wobbly faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such audacious, underestimated love--like the little engine that could from the children’s book--just keeps chugging along over "impossible" hills, shrugging off the naysayers, imagining the view from the top. The difference is, this tenacity in the human heart is what turns seeming underdogs and ragamuffins into influencers and game-changers, right in our own communities, workplaces, homes . . . or wherever we go in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Pamela Capone's often-hilarious observations and always-engaging experiences put a little fuel in your tank to help you get up and over, so you can see that all things are indeed possible . . . if you believe that Love can.</description>

One week before her father was murdered &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though baffled by her circumstances, Skylar soon arrives at a single certainty: Before her lies a remarkable chance to change her family's destiny drastically for the better -- or possibly even worse -- depending on the choices she makes, before her window of opportunity closes.</description>

  <description>“It held my interest from cover to cover.” – Qat Wanders, editor and bestselling author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poignant and wry, Standing Out is, at heart, a profoundly human story that explores the nature of belonging and finding one’s place in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angela was born in New York City to Chinese parents. The loss of a brother when only seven, and her parents going on to adopt two more, made for an ever-changing family dynamic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decisions her parents made played out across three continents. At the age of three, the family relocated to Kenya in East Africa for her father’s UN job, where she grew up surrounded by international expats’ children and traveled with her parents on home leave to China every two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a quiet, authoritarian father and a distant mother, she learned early to find affirmation outside the home. She flourished academically, graduating with a biology degree from Yale and a doctorate in acupuncture and Chinese medicine. The sudden death of her father caused a major shift in her life as she inherited the care of her mother’s Alzheimer’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through life's inevitable turns, Angela's resilience and love of people show through.</description>

  <description>At the dawn of the Blitz, American Ambassador Joseph Kennedy rushes his family from England back home to Bronxville - but his beautiful rebellious daughter Kathleen ("Kick") has bigger plans. Ignoring air raids and family banishment Kick returns to her forbidden sweetheart in London. Everybody adored fun-loving Kick Kennedy except her cold mother Rose who loved being very-rich and very-Catholic and the Ambassador's wife. Kick Kennedy's Secret Diary is an intimate peek behind the spurious facade of America's royal family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This historical fiction diary is the whirlwind story of JFK's little sister and favorite person - she's a bobby dazzler with an awesome trail of swooning British suitors. Ambitious and daring and the star of every party, Kick earns the nickname la petite questionneuse for asking many many questions, such as "Will God desert me if I marry a good Anglican?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever pushing boundaries Kick struggles to balance her strong faith and family loyalty with a marriage proposal from the Anglican and king William Cavendish, heir to the most powerful duchy in England. As his wife, Kick would be one day be second only to the Queen herself. Kick and her beloved Billy-o marry knowing she may alienate her family forever. But when her loyal husband of two weeks disappears on the battlefield, Kick attempts to make a life for herself alone in London where sexual awakening lurks.</description>

  <description>They say some loves travel through time and are fated to meet over and over again. For Maddie, an art therapist, who wrestles with the “peculiar feeling” she has lived previous lives and is being called to Italy by voices that have left imprints on her soul, this idea is intriguing. Despite her best efforts, however, proof of this has always eluded her. That is, until one illuminating summer in Italy when Maddie’s previous existences start to bleed through into her current reality. When she is introduced to the Crociani family—a noble clan with ties to the seventeenth-century Medici court that boasts of ancestors with colorful pasts—she finally meets the loves of her life. One is a romantic love, and another is a special kind of passion that only women share, strong amongst those who have suffered greatly yet have triumphed despite it. As Maddie's relationship develops with Artemisia Gentileschi—an artist who in a time when it was unheard of to denounce a man for the crime of rape, did just that—Maddie discovers a kindred spirit and a role model, and just what women are capable of when united together. In a journey that arcs back to biblical days and moves forward in time, Maddie encounters artists, dukes, designers, and movie stars as well as baser and ignoble men. With Artemisia never far from her side, she proves that when we dare to take control of our lives and find the “thing” we are most passionate about, we are limitless and can touch the stars.</description>

  <description>Do you avoid talking about politics with family and friends? Are you concerned that political polarization is blocking discussion of realistic solutions for America's problems?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Talking Sense about Politics&lt;/i&gt; cuts through the noise of false and misleading contrasts of left vs. right, liberal vs. conservative, or identity politics, and explains how American politics is better understood from four perspectives. Readers discover--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How we talk about issues in American society, not changing our political institutions, is the remedy for political polarization.&lt;br /&gt;Four fundamental, impartial perspectives--Loyal, Tactful, Detached, and Caring--underlie how we respond to political issues.&lt;br /&gt;Immigration, inequality, foreign policy, climate change, gun control, religious freedom and other controversial issues are better understood from the four perspectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Talking Sense about Politics&lt;/i&gt; encourages thoughtful Americans to engage in productive conversations, argue openly and convincingly for what they believe, and speak creatively and constructively about the challenges of America's future.</description>

  <description>In the Midi of France in 1244, political intrigue is as rife in the boudoir as on the battlefield. Four friends -- cousins Odon and Rainier, the beautiful Miranda, and Robin, son of the famous English outlaw - escape from a mountain refuge captured by the French and set sail for Provence. Odon carries ancient scrolls indicating that Miranda is the descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. If that relationship were revealed, the lives of all four would be in jeopardy.&lt;br /&gt; Fate, in the form of corsairs, puts them ashore in Moorish territory in Spain, hundreds of leagues southwest of their destination. While Miranda falls under the spell of the local wazir, called Al Azraq--the blue-eyed one -- her friends become embroiled in the political ambitions of King Jacme I of Aragon and end up taking sides in a conflict between his men and the Moors. The ancient curse placed on the scrolls seems to come alive as all four fight for survival against foes old and new. 169 The Magdalene Malediction, the last book in the trilogy Ordeal by Fire, spins a riveting tale of bravery, passion, and brutality set against the backdrop of the political ambitions and religious fervor the thirteenth century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning Author &lt;br /&gt; F. Scott Kimmich's first novel, The Apostles of Satan, won the 2016 New Book Awards, and his second, The Fiery Furnace, also won the 2016 New Book Awards and won the 2015- 2016 Reviewers Choice Award for the Northeast Region.</description>

  <description>This is not Donald Trump's anti-science. Science itself is fine, and has rightfully earned the highest status in our culture. But the high status of science has created a problem: Scientists are believed and taken seriously, whatever they say, whether it was determined by the scientific method or not.In particular, they are trying to tell us that there is no reality beyond the physical. This has not been proved scientifically, so it is defended and forced upon the academic community with unscientific methods such as authoritarian pronouncements, ridicule, and power politics, and accepted universally as absolute truth at American colleges and universities. Academic people who express an interest in precognition, telepathy, clairvoyance, remote viewing, psychokinesis, energy medicine, spirit entities, the power of prayer, reincarnation, or intelligent design are treated as if they were mentally incompetent, shunned by their colleagues, and denied publication, funding, and employment. Even psychologists have been steered away from the study of the mind by the insistence on physical evidence. Our accredited institutions are being blocked from whole dimensions of knowledge, the mental and the spiritual.At the same time, there is a growing body of evidence supporting all the subjects in the list above. Gallup polls over the years have shown that more than 90% of Americans believe in God or a spiritual reality. Recent surveys have found that up to 91% of people in advanced Western countries have had psychic experiences. And yet a majority of elite scientists do not believe in these things. They claim that the general public has the bias. They say that we are uninformed, unintelligent, superstitious, and/or delusional. This is simply gross class prejudice.DIRTY SCIENCE exposes the unscientific, illegitimate, and irrational arguments that are used in the name of "science" by people with high scientific credentials, corrupting our cultural knowledge. This is not "science bashing," but is an accurate and responsible book, written with compassion for the people who are caught up in the system. It is not seeking the approval of establishment scientists as "authority" figures, but is appealing to the intelligent reading public (which includes all academic people) to recognize the unscientific methods and cause the people who use those methods to lose credibility. As a start, every undergraduate student of critical thinking needs to read this book.</description>

  <description>Geza's poems confront our human ultimate concerns of Mother Earth, life, love, death, and the meaning of existence. There are the doomsday poems, an unmistakable wake-up call, if not already too late, and poems on the beauty of our cosmos along with the fleeting joys of love open to being husband, father, and grandfather. This book makes it clear where Geza is coming from, where he is going, why, and his wonderful, compact poems demonstrate what poetry is and ought to be.</description>

  <description>Ellen sat in the cold waiting room looking at the clock on the wall. She was stressed which wasn’t normal for her. She had been through quite a few near death situations before, where she always maintained her calm. So why today? Why was she feeling so shaky, so raw? – An Excerpt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the life of Ellen Sanders, a senior flight attendant. Experience her joys, her pain, her sorrow! Relive the chilling, eye-opening truth Ellen discovers about her illness! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first in a series of aviation stories. Based on a true story, the author wants to help expose the taboo and often unglamorous, but real side of aviation. She has started the SHIFT movement – ‘Sharing Helpful Information For Tomorrow', through various social media channels to help gather information for this series. She strives to voice the aviation community's concerns and experiences. Look out for the next aviation story soon!</description>

  <description>In the mid 90s, Elizabeth Booth is a young British college student studying Arabic at Durham University. With some travel and work already under her belt, she excels at her studies and is sent to Damascus to immerse herself in the language. Taken aback by the generosity and kindness of the people there, she easy slips into a life in the ancient city. She has friends, her studies, and even a handsome boyfriend. But things aren't always what they seem. Soon, in a world where mistrust and disloyalty are commonplace, Elizabeth finds herself navigating a web of lies, betrayals, and even murder involving MI6, deadly terrorist factions, and the shadowy Syrian secret police.</description>

  <description>If personal memory is false, what happens when you try to construct a memory of something that you don’t remember but should—that you desperately want to remember? What Some Would Call Lies is a collection of two literary novellas meditating on life, art, and the vicissitudes of memory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Shoplifting” is the story of Monica Evans, an aspiring author, a young mother struggling to raise a toddler, a neglected wife juggling a long-distance marriage, and a woman grieving her sister’s death. In an attempt to come to terms with this most recent loss—and to jump-start her stalled artistic life—Monica decides to write her late sister’s autobiography in the first person. This decision angers and confuses some readers (including her mother), but it pushes Monica toward healing. Reminiscent of the work of Alice Munro and Lorrie Moore, “Shoplifting” is by turns witty and wistful. Employing a touch of metafiction, the story raises real questions about memory, authorship, the ownership of stories, and the many ways we steal from others—and ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “Infidels,” an unorthodox substitute teacher awakens sixth-grader Jackie Rose’s floundering sense of focus and ambition. At the same time, an alluring older girl initiates him into the world of desire and longing. Meanwhile, Jackie’s parents are moving toward an inevitable separation, and Jackie will face hard choices. Set against the backdrop of an upper Midwestern childhood in the 1970s, steeped in the lingering anxiety of the Cold War and the comforting nostalgia of pop radio, “Infidels” is a classic coming-of-age story with an unforgettable, heart-breaking ending. Told in a reflective, lyrical voice similar to Richard Ford (Rock Springs, Wildlife) and Alistair MacLeod (Island), this is a story with timeless appeal written in polished and enduring prose.</description>

  <description>Black Christian women are sisters: We are connected through our identity in Christ and a common history forged by the African Diaspora. These cultural and spiritual legacies not only strengthen us, but also present us with unique challenges to our health and wholeness. As daughters of the Diaspora, we encounter negative stereotypes and denigrating images imposed upon us by others. As Christians, we can be tempted to overspiritualize our lives to the detriment of our wholeness. These realities can leave us merely surviving our fragmented lives, when in reality, we want to blossom! Well, Blossoming Hope: The Black Christian Woman's Guide to Mental Health and Wellness was written to help do just that. As a licensed psychologist, minister, and seminary administrator, Dr. Tonya Armstrong attends in Blossoming Hope to the need to transcend everyday stressors, difficulties of the past, and even mental health challenges to reach the highest purpose for which God created us. By taking seriously the cultural and spiritual identities of Black Christian women, Dr. Armstrong addresses the unique challenges of Black women and provides practical resources that promote wholeness. Using the transformative tools of psychoeducation, vignettes of Black Christian women living with mental illness, inspirational music, spoken word exercises, and a wealth of spiritual, mental health, and wellness resources, Dr. Armstrong guides us toward optimal functioning in mind, spirit, body, and soul. In short, Blossoming Hope equips you for full blossoming, firmly planted in the God of our hope.</description>

As Cordelia's sisters and the oppressive lords maneuver to depose her father, Cordelia and her childhood friend Garred ally themselves with the farmers, servants and other working people. In this coming-of-age, alternate-history, medieval tale, Cordelia must find a way to bring about the new Britain her comrades are prepared to fight and die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cordelia Lionheart won an honorable mention in the historical fiction category of the Reader Views 2018-2019 literary awards and a finalist medal in the fiction category of the 2019 Book Excellence awards.</description>

  <description>When Archie goes in search of his missing son, Arden, in the Spanish Canary Islands, he stumbles upon a higher mission: to save his ailing fourteen-year-old granddaughter, Ella. Using a portal-jumping device called the Tillastrion, Archie and a strange creature, a Bangol named Zeno, are transported—along with a cruise ship full of people, including Ella and her mother, Tessa—to a magnificent yet terrifying island in another realm, a place called Jarr-Wya, where Archie hopes to locate Ella’s cure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Jarr-Wya, the Bangols battle the Olearons—creatures made of fire—and the evil Millia sands for control of Jarr-Wya. When Ella is captured by the Bangols, her wit and resourcefulness emerge as she fights against all odds, and against all manner of creatures, to survive. Meanwhile, Tessa, must confront her long-buried secrets, broken marriage, and a confusing new love triangle, all while navigating the mysterious island in search of her daughter. And unbeknownst to everyone, there is an even greater foe to contend with: a wicked star anchored in the sea beneath them that is poisoning the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An epic adventure of three unlikely heroes, &lt;em&gt;Above the Star&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that no matter how young, or how old, our bravery transforms not only our lives but the world around us.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WINNER Best "How-To" Book: 2018 Los Angeles and San Francisco Book Festivals!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are never too young or too old to make your dreams come true. Lessons From My Grandfather shows how you can achieve success and fulfillment in life by following 15 timeless principles handed down by the Marc Demetriou's grandfather, Haralambos Georgiou Pistis, --or just "Charlie."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Ellis Island immigrant, Charlie came to a new country at age 16 with nothing but a bag full of dreams, courage, wit, and the desire to succeed -- and he transformed his world. Through his steadfast willingness to work hard, and a determination to control life rather than allowing it to control him, Charlie succeeded on his own terms, finding happiness and financial security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these pages, Demetriou tells Charlie's inspirational story, then applies his lessons to today. The result provides both clarity and vision for helping you recognize your unique talents, along with lifelong principles that will allow you to identify and reach your goals in life and business. This book is an essential blueprint that you can use for today and tomorrow. As Demetriou likes to call it, "success made simple."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc Demetriou is a top-rated speaker who has appeared at the Mastermind Summit along with world-renowned motivational speaker Tony Robbins and Barbara Corcoran from ABC Television's Shark Tank. As an authority on real estate and finance, Demetriou has been quoted in articles in The New York Times, The Huffington Post, Reuters, the Associated Press, and many other local and national publications and media outlets. Additionally, he was co-host on WVNJ's popular The Real Estate and Money Show. Demetriou also is the proud father of three daughters.</description>

The journey for Sam and Will ensues with a blending of cultures, while enduring all the harsh Montana terrain can throw at them. Can Sam and Will track down the killer and bring justice to the Native American tribes?

  <description>“The Yin &amp;amp; Yang of an Electrical Conductor” by Jose Scaramanga weaves scientific theories into an absorbing speculative sci-fi novella alive with characters and a story line that will both engross readers and stimulate contemplation long after the book is finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In each interaction, lively discussions revolving around science, especially physics, ensue. Each “teacher” that the narrator encounters has something to share from their perspectives, which makes for some lively discussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Yin &amp;amp; Yang of an Electrical Conductor” truly made my mind whirl. In spite of being novella-sized, it is not a fast read because there are many layers to this story. So many forgotten scientific terms reemerged into my existence. Not having had a science class in twenty-five years had me Googling some terms and names to refresh my memory, including wave particle duality; Newtonian Law; velocity-spatial distribution of time; the speed of light; Minkowski space time; Michelson-Morley experiment; Max Planck and Andre Ampere who features heavily in the story. Fresh out of Physics in college would have been an advantage for reading this, but I must admit, I enjoyed refreshing my brain. I feel much smarter now and less intimidated about sitting at lunch with my colleagues who are physics professors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jose Scaramanga has a gift for being able to create scenes in his story that will enable the reader to feel like they are seeing the story rather than reading it. In fact, I will remember “The Yin &amp;amp; Yang of an Electrical Conductor” as a movie, rather than a book. In spite of the heavy scientific jargon, the scenes are well described and the characters incredibly unique and enjoyable. The author does a great job of blending science into a science fiction story. I also am really intrigued how the author manages to tie physics in with the philosophy of Yin and Yang. Readers who are fans of both science and science fiction, especially stories with humor, will really appreciate this creative work of fiction.</description>

  <description>Christy had eclipsed all of his famous brethren with his ''Christy Girl,'' and idealized woman who redefined beauty influenced fashion, and inspired a new generation of woman. Illustrated in popular magazines, best-selling novels, and top-ranked newspapers, the ''Christy Girl'' transformed the artist into a household name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Romantic Illusions, the second book in Head's An Affair with Beauty trilogy, Christy once again comes to life through the eyes of Nancy Palmer Christy, his wife and former model, as she recounts her first Christmas with Howard and his family at his Ohio mansion, the Barracks, in 1912.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howard tells of his early years studying art in near-poverty in New York City and his sudden ascent to stardom as the top pupil of William Merritt Chase, the premier portrait painter in America. During "The Great Flood of 1913" - the worst tragedy the Midwest had ever experienced--Howard describes his daring experiences with Teddy Roosevelt during the Spanish-American War in Cuba and his brush with near-certain death, no less than three times. The effects of the war profoundly transform Howard, inspiring him to create his vision of beauty, the "Christy Girl," which catapults him to stardom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When romance blossoms between artist and model, Howard is slow to seek a divorce from his estranged wife, Maebelle, jeopardizing Nancy's desires and compelling her to uncover his scandalous past. As World War I break out, Howard returns to New York City, forcing Nancy to risk everything as she reveals her true feelings for him.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;If the riddle of existence had an answer, would humans understand it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World powers compete to control the genetics of intellect, and a man's DNA holds a key piece of the puzzle. When research suggests how to harness brain evolution, a hunt ensues for a missing link―one that allows to design humans with skills that prodigies of old would have envied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reader is thrown into the thick of unfolding events as the world's last monarchy crumbles and a baby is torn from its mother and forced into hiding. For the next twenty years he will grow up unaware of the pivotal role he shall play in the global pursuit for the unique traits he possesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Germline engineering and biological enhancement have become routine, and ancient doubts have emerged under new guises: Who are we? Is there a purpose to life? Why is there so much suffering? When faith and science fail to answer these questions, personal greed and national interest quickly fill the void. But gene selection is expensive, and many are excluded from its benefits. The stage is set for tribalism and social discontent on a scale without precedent, and those caught in the fray, whether by choice or by chance, must play roles not always to their liking in the struggle of all creatures against the arbitrariness of existence.</description>

  <description>"There once was a man named Bluff who thought himself great at all stuff..." &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Kind uses lyrical rhyme coupled with the marvelous graphic imagery of Zacc Pollitt to weave the tale of the once pompous Bluff who steals fun only to be brought down by the virtuous message delivered via a contest with a cryptic stranger and the light words of an earth angel, thus allowing the children to play and laugh again. These are the stories that last for generations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Kind Stories are a YouthWide jubilation produced in association with Prove Nothing.</description>

  <description>In southern Vermont, the annual freezing and thawing of the earth forces stones to the surface, breaking asphalt, disrupting civilized life. This is the setting for the stories in &lt;i&gt;Frost Heaves, &lt;/i&gt; a physically harsh and rural place within a few hours' drive of Boston and New York. It is a landscape where retreat, even escape, to a quaint and bucolic lifestyle is regularly upset by reminders that a human is, in the end, another part of the natural world and a part of a larger social organism. In this collection, an eclectic mix of characters interact, negotiate community, and encounter the natural world--bears, otters, moose, insects--in confrontations with the reality of their own individual strengths and weaknesses, the welling up of hard truths in the seasons of each life. T Stores is a storyteller, probably because she grew up in a huge extended American Southern family and spent much of her childhood hiding under the kitchen table listening to her elders' gossip and fables of the past. &lt;strong&gt;Teresa Stores writes with compassion and insight, finding the inescapable truths hiding in plain sight layered over an ordinary life. &lt;/strong&gt;Though these stories are individually complete, in the book collection they are also connected by theme, character, and setting, and with an understanding that individual experience is a shared human story sometimes only barely perceived as overlapping, cohesive, and common. The book's structure is both seasonal and cyclical, with each section of stories (each close third person point of view, focused on the experience of a protagonist) introduced by a story that shifts point of view in rapid succession, connecting the community of voices to place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the collection, was selected winner of the Kore Press Fiction Prize, published as a chapbook and nominated for a Pushcart Prize. "Big Night" placed 13th in the &lt;i&gt;Writers' Digest&lt;/i&gt; Annual Competition and was recently published in &lt;i&gt;BlueLine.&lt;/i&gt; "Fisher" was short-listed for the Fish Story Prize and published in &lt;i&gt;Literary Mama.&lt;/i&gt; "Fresh Air" was featured as the "story of the month" at Unmanned Press. "Labyrinth," placed 9th in the &lt;i&gt;Writer's Digest&lt;/i&gt; "Short-Short" competition and was long-listed for the Fish Story Prize&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; "Love/Theory #7" was published in &lt;i&gt;Sinister Wisdom.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Earth is on the brink of self-destruction. The fate of an entire planet rests on the shoulders of 212 people chosen to establish a colony on a recently discovered Goldilocks planet. Tests revealed the planet could sustain life...but they didn't show that life already existed there. The crew from Earth is met by many hostile creatures, but it's way too late to turn back. They must find a way to establish a colony...without making the same mistakes that destroyed Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing from thirty-five years as an engineer, J. G. Possum has written a believable science-fiction novel steeped in fact that is also a thrilling page-turner. &lt;em&gt;Tara: The Goldilocks Planet&lt;/em&gt; will enthrall casual and lifelong sci-fi readers alike.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>“According to legend, when the world was young, Crocotta, Queen of the Gods, discovered her mate’s faithlessness. She vowed to prevent future threats to all matrimonial pacts henceforward, but for her it was too late. The child born from the illicit coupling was a warrior goddess—one whom Crocotta would seek to destroy throughout eternity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Now that the Raiders’ elite army is threatening the kingdom of Elysia’s northern borders, seventeen-year-old Lluava must leave the familiarity and safety of her native land to venture into the wilderness. Her mission is to discover others like her who will come to Elysia’s aid; her hope is to unravel the secrets behind what it means to be Incarn. But what she finds could destroy everything.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lluava’s story continues in Crocotta’s Hackles, the third book in The Incarn Saga's award-winning new-adult series: Issaura's Claws, Ullr's Fangs, Crocotta's Hackles, and Giahem's Talons (2019).</description>

  <description>The Terror and Triumph of WWI in a Soldier's Own Words... The Foster family of Wisconsin were vibrant and happy in the early years of the 20th century. Like many families in the area, they were descended from German immigrants and had a healthy appetite for hard work and beer. Barbara Foster, widowed early in life, created a loving home for her children Leo, Ottilia, Mary, and Kunigunda. They were all musicians, forming their own orchestra and playing in regional and local venues. But despite Woodrow Wilson's promises, America found itself drawn into the Great War overseas, and Leo Foster, bugler for the Wisconsin National Guard, was sent to the front lines. Nearly a century later, this book reconstructs Leo's World War I experience from letters, newspaper clippings, and photographs from Leo's footlocker. Nothing compares to the immediacy of the war experience in a soldier's own words. Notes from the Trenches follows Leo from stateside training to the horror of the Meuse-Argonne offensive and his battle-weary return home in May of 1919. Full of wit, good humor, and honesty, these letters provide a fascinating window into the War to End All Wars, with insightful organization and context from Leo's grandson, Gary Foster.</description>

  <description>WINNER - 2019 Rubery Book Award BOOK OF THE YEAR and 16 other literary awards... An Engaging and Extraordinary Multigenerational Saga&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high position bestowed by China's empress dowager grants power and wealth to the Sun family. For Isabel, growing up in glamorous 1930s and '40s Shanghai, it is a life of utmost privilege. But while her scholar father and fashionable mother shelter her from civil war and Japanese occupation, they cannot shield the family forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mao comes to power, eighteen-year-old Isabel journeys to Hong Kong, not realizing that she will make it her home--and that she will never see her father again. Meanwhile, the family she has left behind struggles to survive, only to have their world shattered by the Cultural Revolution. Isabel returns to Shanghai fifty years later with her daughter, Claire, to confront their family's past--one they discover is filled with love and betrayal, kidnappers and concubines, glittering pleasure palaces and underworld crime bosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavishly illustrated and meticulously researched, Remembering Shanghai follows five generations from a hardscrabble village to vibrant Shanghai to the bright lights of Hong Kong. By turns harrowing and heartwarming, this vivid memoir explores identity, loss and the unpredictable nature of life against the epic backdrop of a nation and a people in turmoil.</description>

  <description>There are many who feel that Leviticus is a dry, dull, and boring book. That is not so. The gospel is the life, the teachings, and the cross of Jesus, the Son of God. The only way that a person in this present age can have the forgiveness of sin and peace with God is through the gospel of Jesus the Son of God. The gospel is not dull and boring. It is the most read, the most cherished, the most translated, and the most published literature in the entire world. However, the Law of Moses, and the Levitical sacrifices that were part of that law, was the gospel of the Israelites. It was through the Law of Moses and the Levitical sacrifices that a person who lived before Christ could have the forgiveness of sin and peace with God, and therefore it cannot be dull and boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is intended to make the book of Leviticus a living book and a very interesting Bible study. It will open up the Levitical letter and make it interesting by making it easy to understand. The book itself is easy to read and understand. It is written in a way that is quite reasonable-in other words, it just makes sense. The purpose of this book is to give a portrayal of the Levitical sacrificial system, what the sacrifices meant to the worshipper who offered them, their purpose, what they accomplished, how God viewed them, and how they were fulfilled in Christ. That is all accomplished by very careful scriptural references that establish the points that are made in the book. When a person understands why there were so many different sacrifices such as the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the guilt offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, and others-and then he sees that each one of those sacrifices served a different purpose and they were all fulfilled in Christ is different ways, Leviticus becomes a book that you just cannot put down.</description>

  <description>Jesus said, "And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ" (John 17:3). But the question is, how is it possible to know God? How can we know someone who is infinite and eternal when we cannot see him, feel him, hear him, or sense his presence? We see clearly from the creation that there is a God, or else this world could not exist (Romans 1:20). We know from the Bible that God is a loving Father who is the Creator of all things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a way we can know God more intimately and more perfectly. We can know God by knowing his Son, the very one whom God sent to us as the Savior and redeemer of this lost world--his name is Jesus, and he is the Almighty Jehovah God himself. We can know Jesus intimately as our best friend (John 15:15), and our brother (Hebrews 2:11-14), and our Father (Isaiah 9:6-7; John 10:30, 14:6-11), because even though he is God, he became one of us exactly, a man, just like all other men (Hebrews 2:14-18). He lived in this present world exactly as we live in it. So whatever we learn by studying Jesus, his teachings, and his life, we are learning about our loving Father, our God, and our Creator.</description>

  <description>God created trials, so He could test you with your truth. You are born free, but you must learn to be pain-free. 37 Lessons on How to Gain from Loss: A Believer’s Journey from Trial to Triumph is my own true story of remembering, realizing and reaffirming this basic human truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drenched in pain, I had limped so far on the Road of Loss that I had lost my way back home. With bleak hope left on my trail, I finally approached the point of no return, awaiting to be consumed by my lingering darkness. However, upon setting my last step on the fall’s edge, I was thundered by yet another torment—my biggest trial to date, of losing my mother, the center of my universe. Finding myself trapped in the most turbulent flight for the next twenty-four hours, I was taxed by a tremendous choice, not between action and non-action, or belief and unbelief, but rather between choice and none at all. Would I resist or submit to my tribulation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To replace loss, God birthed gain. The expedition from loss to gain is the journey of every human, a chosen one, to be free. The path that exists in between needs to be traversed, not by choice but by surrendering choice to it. Can trauma change to bliss? Can trial turn into triumph? There is only one way to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book I, Huma Zuellah Ahmed, retrace my own path attempting to traverse the road from the wilderness of loss back to the safe haven of home. Alternatively put, this is a personal transformation book about a girl's journey of losing her mother to cancer and how to not just cope but gain from loss. My story—a tribute—will resonate with every human being reaching for that Universal Shade that is waiting to wrap them in its transformational truth and turn their tragedy into treasure.</description>

  <description>More than 80 5-STAR reviews on Amazon. When Rick Lamplugh arrives at the historic Lamar Buffalo Ranch on New Year’s Eve, he has one goal: to learn as much as possible about the ecology of the Lamar Valley. All winter he will work and live in this remote corner of Yellowstone National Park, home to some of the best wildlife watching in the world. Winter-hungry elk and bison migrate there to graze. Wolves, coyotes, and mountain lions stalk the grazers while eagles, ravens, and magpies wait to scavenge. The snowy backdrop makes the saga of death and life easy to spot. He has three frigid months to explore on skis and snowshoes, observe with all his senses, listen to and talk with experts. A literary blend of facts and feelings, In the Temple of Wolves celebrates nature’s stark beauty and treacherous cruelty, while revealing Lamplugh’s inner battles with his own human nature.</description>

  <description>Is it possible that the entirety of one's life has been steered by the hand of fate towards a single moment? For Brooklyn French program teacher - and single parent of two- Tess Shapiro, it would certainly seem so. After discovering that her life and her marriage were artificial constructs based on lies and deceit, Tess must undergo the ultimate reality check. She delves deep into her subconscious, venting her frustrations by indulging in a lifelong habit of drawing graphic novels starring her glamorous alter ego, an international spy by the name of Andrea Chambers. Meanwhile, in the real world, anti-French terrorism is taking the world by storm. What, and who, is behind the vile attacks against French-speaking people everywhere from Brooklyn to Burundi? As she suspects that her new lover may not be who she thought he was, Tess's ability to perceive truth through a distorted collage of deception, brings comic book fantasy and real world tragedy crashing together in a whirlwind of romance and political intrigue. When, in a single moment, Tess realizes the totality of the lie she has been fed and believed, and the impossibility of the truth, she makes a staunch decision that will change her life, and how she perceives the world, forever.</description>

  <description>The "Discovery" of America... Long before Ferdinand and Isabella financed Columbus' voyage across the sea, and tens of thousands of years before greedy Europe fought over the immense potential and wealth of a seemingly untouched continent, millions of indigenous people lived in diverse tribes and regions, with languages, customs, and vibrant cultures all their own. The towering edifice of American exceptionalism is built on a foundation of genocide, of native people killed by disease and war, forced from their homelands. Cries at Sundown immerses you in five interwoven tales across time and place, with a shining centerpiece telling the story of one woman who refuses to conveniently step aside for the conquerors. Epic, poetic, richly researched and deeply felt, Cries at Sundown asks each of us to examine the price of Western civilization, and calls for us to witness the injustices that have defined the growth of our country.</description>

  <description>A hot cowboy, a twisted killer, and one very resilient woman. &lt;br /&gt;"Keeps you captivated from the first page to the last!" Reader Views &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodeo champ Carter Bass vows to steer clear of women, especially Barbie cowgirls with their bright lipstick and artificial smiles. The Mustang River Ranch’s wilderness chase offers the perfect opportunity to escape his fans and match wits with quarry that is tough, smart and athletic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allie McIvor found a place to call home when she fled the city for a job at the luxury ranch. She barely knows the front of a horse from the back, but she can dress enough like a cowgirl to keep the guests happy. And she’s not about to let the disdain of one swaggering cowboy dim her day, no matter that he’s too sexy for his own boots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she finds herself competing in the rugged outdoors contest, she’s forced to dig up reserves of strength and determination she never realized she had. While that might be enough to win the heart of one hot broody cowboy, the Montana wilderness conceals many dangerous predators… And not all of them are four-footed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reader Views Literary Award Winner Best Romance, 2019&lt;br /&gt;New England Readers' Choice Award Finalist, Romantic Suspense 2019</description>

  <description>Lenny Oliver's secrets ended his life--lies he dressed up in detailed and occasionally elaborate finery. But only the secret holder is fooled in the long run, as Lenny discovered in a dark alley in the Wall Street neighborhood. Michael McKaybees is a private investigator working in New York's five boroughs. He specializes in money crimes like insurance fraud, with the occasional cheating spouse (his partner's favorite since she thinks all cheaters should be flogged in public). Now, however, he has been forced to expand his investigative work to include homicide. Implicated in his best friend Lenny's death, Michael finds himself entangled in a web carefully woven by someone who wants to destroy him--and there's no doubt he's up to his neck in shit. Then there's his father, Marlowe Black, who has decided now is the right time to show up after an absence of more than three decades. Hell, Michael didn't even know he was still alive. Marlowe's reputation as a combat-hardened PI is well-known among the City's criminal element, making him a hated man. And he, too, is a suspect in Lenny's murder. When McKaybees discovers the body of Lenny's wife, Jill--Michael's childhood sweetheart--hidden in his apartment, murder becomes seriously personal and the need for vengeance demanding.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Pick Your Poison builds on the first two novels of the series, Drunk on Peace and Quiet and Hung Over with Grandma, but all the reader really needs to know is Stella and Jonas are middle aged newlyweds who are plagued by Stella’s troubled brother Timmy Lee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this sequel, Stella and Jonas face a new obstacle, a huge unwanted natural gas pipeline crossing their mountain farm. At the same time, her brother, a suspected murderer, is pretending to be a preacher at a sunny beach town in South Carolina and is targeting a wealthy woman who lives in a nursing home there. The two plots intersect in a conclusion that features Stella’s usual pragmatic decision-making. She ‘picks her poison’ in a way that may the reader may not expect.</description>

  <description>The FBI with the help of the CIA is trying to stop a Chinese family operation out of Beijing and Washington, D.C. that is smuggling rosewood and ebony timber out of Madagascar. The illegal consignments of endangered timber is being shipped to the U.S. from China. The illicit trade of these rare trees has resurfaced in Madagascar, a country already reeling from corrupt military rule. Rosewood is prized for its ruby color and, because the Chinese have helped to make this a poverty-stricken country, is being smuggled out of the island at a rate that, some say, could put the country's survival under threat.This same family operation is also smuggling teenage girls into the U.S. and Europe as victims of human trafficking. Most of these girls are 13-17 years old. They have been lured with false promises of well-paying jobs but will be sold as barmaids, waitresses, casino girls, salon workers, you name it, all titles masquerading under the umbrella of sex slaves heading to Canada and the U.S. They have been manipulated by people they trusted, and most of their parents have no idea where they are. They will be forced into prostitution, domestic servitude, farm or factory labor, or other types of forced labor.Supervisory Special Agent Howard Watson and his team must stop these atrocities.</description>

  <description>"From Behind: A Peculiar Perspective of People and Places," is an award-winning photo book featuring an eclectic cast of characters all photographed "From Behind" in various locations around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"From Behind" is a fun, and sometimes freaky, book of inference. Filled with hidden-face folks sporting back tats, t-shirt sayings, interesting hair-don'ts, and questionable fashion choices... "From Behind" is arm-chair people watching at it’s finest!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;After growing up heartbroken with an endless series of struggles, Maria Michaels creates a picture-perfect family of her own.&lt;/strong&gt; But life changes too quickly, and she loses her grip on herself and her two troubled sons. In spite of her desire to give them a better life, they spiral downward on the paths they choose. They must fight through sadness, mistakes and tragedy to find redemption and the love that only a mother can give. Told from a dual perspective of mother and son, we follow the family's battles with divorce, drugs and depression. You will laugh and cry, and probably want to call your mom to tell her you love her.</description>

  <description>Satan and His Thugs are a Clue as To Why Humanity Was Created... Satan Fully Exposed is a book, which defines Satan and his agents, and their demonic schemes. More importantly it details why God really created mankind and why we are truly here. Sadly, most Christians are not truly aware of who Satan really is or exactly what his evil tactics are. This book reveals in scriptural detail how Satan deceives mankind and how he works through his arsenal of demonic agents. I provide you with in-depth detail about the four demonic entities (Ephesians 6:12) and how they work to accomplish Satan's deceitful schemes. This book gives you true biblical discloser as to why man was created in the first place, and what our exact purpose is, according to the infallible word of God. Again, most Christians think that we were created because God loved us. Well that is a very small part of the equation. This book teaches you the full truth, which incorporates the godly purpose of why God has mankind living in unison with Satan and his demonic angels. You see, earth was created after the heavens - Genesis 1:1. And Satan along with his thugs were cast down to earth - Revelation 12:7-9. And the lake of fire was first prepared for Satan and his angels, not for mankind - Matthew 25:41. So no, we are not the primary purpose in God's creation. We're secondary and for a divine function and reason. We are to be His spiritual witnesses.</description>

  <description>Kamiri, a dirt-poor migrant raised in tribal culture, is drawn to the city, where he joins his brother in the illegal drugs trade. Disillusioned, Kamiri enters professional football, but his jealous brother shoots Kamiri in the knee, forcing him to begin work as a forest ranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hassan, of doubtful parentage, is the youngest child in a rich and powerful Muslim family. Lonely and insecure at university, he joins Dorothy at a political protest that goes wrong, and finds himself in a terrorist organisation. Appalled by their activities, he escapes and enters the Army's officer candidate school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy, a college graduate from a middle-class Christian family, is an idealist who is unsure whether to enter politics or medicine. Set back in both careers, she makes a decision, and faces a further romantic choice between Kamiri or Hassan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three East African young people are intertwined in friendship, as each seeks a fully satisfying and challenging life and career identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two voices are heard throughout. One, seemingly the voice of God, and the Other, possibly Satan's voice, offer conflicting guidance on achieving superpersonhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Appealing characters and an intriguing portrait of modern Africa." - Susan Waggoner, Foreword Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Its multiple characters rising and falling in a chaotic society, the tale has notes of Dickens while finding an energy all its own." Kirkus Reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Author: William Peace grew up in suburban Philadelphia and now resides in London. A retired business executive who has traveled extensively, he provides pro bono consulting to London charities. This is his eighth novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THUNK!&lt;/em&gt; It's the sweet sound an ad-packed magazine makes when it's dropped on a table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;At glitzy Carlyle Nash Media, it's the sound of success. And star publisher Mitch Blake has been happily hearing it for a decade. But when the heavily hyped debut issue of &lt;em&gt;World &lt;/em&gt;Magazine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gets panned in the press and advertisers start to flee, Mitch must control the damage. Can he right the ship and protect his reputation? Or will both be sunk by Paul Cavanaugh, a hard-drinking, paranoid, stress-prone staffer who has stolen an item Mitch needs back to avert disaster: a miniature beach ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One part pre-recession satire, one part diary of a marketing man coming undone, &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Last Thunk&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; is a story of betrayal and friendship, love and survival in the crazy, gritty, glamorous world of magazine advertising...as told by the beach-ball thief himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A BOOZY, BREEZY FREE FALL THROUGH THE MAGAZINE INDUSTRY'S FADING DAYS OF GLORY. &lt;em&gt;THE LAST THUNK&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;depicts all the ambition, paranoia, and ethical ambiguity of middle management, and the toll that culture takes on its inhabitants. Take 'Mad Men, ' add 40 years, and you'd get these Mag Men who are captured so vividly by Farrell's four-color glossy writing. &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;THUNK&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; reverberates."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Tom Rock, &lt;em&gt;Newsday&lt;/em&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Game Seven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"THIS IS A TERRIFIC BOOK--FAST-PACED, HILARIOUS&lt;/strong&gt;, and so jam-packed with genuine insider dish your eyes will pop. I couldn't put it down!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Gwen Cooper, author of &lt;em&gt;Homer's Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;A fast-paced, wickedly funny romp&lt;/strong&gt; from a writer who has been through the wringer of the magazine world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Charles Salzberg, author of &lt;em&gt;Second Story Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;****&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gerard Farrell has worked in the magazine industry &lt;/strong&gt;since the late '90s for brands including &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Allure&lt;/em&gt;, and the ill-fated business magazine &lt;em&gt;Cond� Nast Portfolio&lt;/em&gt;. His short humor has appeared in the literary anthology &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Ate His Book&lt;/em&gt;, and he is a frequent contributor to the literary webzine &lt;em&gt;Ducts&lt;/em&gt;. He lives in Farmingdale, NY with his wife, Maricel, and their three children.</description>

  <description>A Monstrous, Mystical Thriller. In the fog enshrouded, mysterious Grey Canyon, loggers Jason Ibsen and Sam Kloss fall the wrong tree and unleash a primordial violence into the Oregon wilderness. Amongst the floored redwood tangle an object about five feet long and three across lay entwined. It was fresh fir branches, but somehow crisscrossed and tightly interwoven. Jason reached to touch it and both men jumped back when it moved slightly. He picked up a stick and lifted one edge. "Oh hell," Sam said, "it's a baby bear. I told you something was up there." It was small, black furred, face down and barely breathing. Jason put the stick under one side and lifted it toward him. "Oh God, Jason! Not a bear!" They looked down at a face. A dark face with open eyes and blood seeping from its nose and mouth... Join with Michael, a man seeking to spark his restless spirit by camping the woods and visiting old friends, and ride with Nicole and Ian, college sweethearts on a mission to save the trees in their beloved forest. They will encounter the mythic, giant man-beast of the deep woods, finding themselves in a primitive, terrifying battle for survival.</description>

  <description>Glen Kinsella has just finished opening all his high school graduation cards proclaiming him to be on the doorstep of an exciting life. But as the summer of 1970 begins, Glen is living with his deluded grandfather and an array of desperate residents in a Midwestern prairie town that has withered to near-extinction - a town populated primarily by the sagging shells of long-abandoned houses. Hope is not one of Glen's traits. In high school, he was known as the retard's brother. He never had a date, nor even tried to be on speaking terms with someone as sophisticated as Suzanne. But as his grandfather always said, anything is possible in Corcoran. And in the summer of 1970, that prediction appears to be finally coming true. After decades of planning the revival of his beloved town, Glen's grandfather convinces a group of women whose husbands have been sent to Vietnam to live in Corcoran. Soon they begin renovating an old ballroom, where Suzanne will perform for the grand opening. But all this new life is threatened when a disgraced war vet arrives, harboring a secret about one of the husbands that will thrust the town into the center of political controversy.</description>

  <description>After the unexplainable death of her mother on the eve of Natalie’s fourteenth birthday, she is suddenly forced to grow up. Compelled to leave her dismal and deceptive life behind by a mysterious woman who claims to be an old relative, Natalie carries with her the highly coveted, scarlet stoned ring she reluctantly retrieved from her mother upon her death. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Following Natalie’s irreversible decision, she unexpectedly finds herself alone and thrust into a peculiar all female orphanage where her arrival was strangely anticipated by the inhabitants, and greeted by some with ire. Ultimately, young Natalie must quickly learn to fend for herself against bullies, unexplained forces, a male suitor, and something lurking for revenge. Does she have both the strength and resolve, and can she set the past aside, to uncover the secrets necessary in order to fulfill her destiny?</description>

  <description>Siblings Mitch, Tony, and Jovi discover that mysterious creatures called Grezniks are close to achieving their mission: blowing up Earth and shattering Life to bits. Over the centuries, Grezniks have nearly succeeded many times. But each time, their efforts have been foiled by Tukors and their allies. Now, Grezniks are closer than ever before, and no one knows if any Tukors are left in the world to stop them. The Tukor's Journey is an epic action adventure. Chock-full of faraway lands. Volcanoes. Mountains. Tundra. Tropical forests. Raging rivers. Steamy geysers. Farms. Big cities. Tractors flying at the speed of sound. Blue stones that defy the laws of physics. And lots of real life creatures. And Grezniks. Vicious. Deadly. Unfathomable strength and speed. Seeping through the world unseen--slippery, crawly, swift. Soon they'll be ready to blow up Earth into tiny pieces. Three kids are unexpectedly invited to help defeat the Grezniks, but will they have the courage to join the battle?</description>

  <description>“Gentle, affectionate, and genuinely touching stories about the street musicians, immigrants, artists, entrepreneurs, con artists and lovers who live on or near Martin Luther King Boulevard . . . . people who celebrate ‘every bit of brightness’ in their lives, and Patty Somlo makes their stories shine.” – Molly Giles, author of the story collections All the Wrong Places, Creek Walk, and Rough Translations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Reading Patty Somlo’s stories is like sitting at the feet of a wise and ancient storyteller who both entertains and speaks words of wisdom. This is fiction written in the best possible way--writing that finds something noble even among the most down-trodden. Read her!” – E.C. Osondu, Winner of The Caine Prize. Associate Professor of English Providence College. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving together the real and the fantastic, the 15 linked stories in Hairway to Heaven Stories introduce a diverse cast of characters living in a once predominantly African American neighborhood, now in the midst of gentrification. In these 15 stories, faith plays a key role, either through traditional religion, spirituality linked to nature or belief in the promise of a better life. The stories also present a microcosm of many neighborhoods in cities throughout the country, in which people of different races, ethnicities, class and sexual orientation are living in close proximity to one another, with neighbors being both strangers and friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collection was published by Cherry Castle Publishing, a black-owned press “that honors the vibrant multicultural voice of American literature” and embraces work “informed by the social, political and cultural vigor of our times.” &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cherrycastlepublishing.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.cherrycastlepublishing.com/&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>Weaving together the real and the fantastic, the 15 linked stories in Hairway to Heaven Stories introduce a diverse cast of characters living in an urban neighborhood surrounding Martin Luther King, Junior Boulevard. A once middle-class, predominantly African American area, the neighborhood became riddled with poverty but is now in the midst of gentrification. In the all of the stories, faith plays a key role, either through traditional religion, spirituality linked to nature or belief in the promise of a better life. The stories also present a microcosm of many neighborhoods in cities throughout the country, in which people of different races, ethnicities, class and sexual orientation are living in close proximity to one another, with neighbors being both strangers and friends.</description>

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A No-nonsense real estate investment book for the employee side hustler tired of the 9-5 looking for a practical step-by-step process to build wealth while they work.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the financial crisis erupted in 2008, thousands of people lost jobs they thought they'd always have to sustain their standard of living.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For H. J. Chammas, it was a wake-up call to escape the financial uncertainty of a paycheck to paycheck struggle of being an employee. It was time to take charge of his life by investing in rental properties while he was still working. He soon became financially free and went from employee to millionaire real estate investor. In this workbook he brings you the step-by-step processes he used to build his investment property fortune, while working!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Can This Book Help Me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this detailed guidebook to buying, owning, and managing rental properties, you'll work through step-by-step processes to plan your real estate investing strategy. Instead of promoting foolish risks, he helps you leverage your position as an employee to achieve financial freedom.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn how to:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  evaluate the current state of your finances;  overcome limiting beliefs about money and investing;  set personal objectives to achieve financial freedom; and  think and operate like a seasoned real estate investor.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Is This Book Different?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you plan on buying, owning, and managing rental properties, you'll get a practical step-by-step plan that you won't find in other books. From identifying and closing deals, getting approved for loans, renting out properties, dealing with tenants, and capitalizing on opportunities, this book will challenge how you've always looked at life, finances, investments, and real estate.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every other book out there is for those already with experience in real estate investing. This book is different because it will give you all the steps you need, regardless, if this is the first time you've considered buying an investment property, or you have just considered rental property investing as a way to build wealth. It shares real-life examples that will help you build a personalized investment blueprint to build your rental property portfolio and become wealthy. &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>At the start of Bob Holt's debut novel, Cowboy, it seems easy to know right from wrong. But in the throes of the 1960's counterculture, as Jim Davis prepares to return to his rural Southwestern home after serving in the army, everything is about to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life in his home town had been simple--chores, school, Wednesday night prayer meetings, Friday night football games, and Sunday morning church services--with clear guidance from pastors, parents, teachers, and coaches. But when young veteran Jim chooses to attend a liberal New England university in 1969, he meets a Woodstock flowerchild, a free spirit who introduces him to the new world of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of all ages, particularly those who lived through that unique, exciting time, will appreciate watching Jim navigate that journey without losing his soul. At the same time, the nation also travels this era of change. How does Jim and the country keep from falling into the abyss?</description>

  <description>Honorable Mention 2018 Reader Views Literary Awards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The storyline is simple in that it is easy to follow, yet intricate as layers unwind with a seamless, melodic flow. And, while the author excels at getting inside the heart and soul of her readers, the connection &lt;br /&gt;garnered by what remains unsaid is remarkable. The writing is descriptive and artistic, without being flowery or overdone, and leaving just enough room to incorporate snippets of one’s own imagination. Some things are just not taught and Koerber’s writing is one of those things–she has a gift. " Reader Views&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy thought of flying. She imagined the air under her arms, her hair lifting and floating. She felt her heartbeat separate from the faraway beat and form its own rhythm: light, quick, a dancing thrum. When she opened her eyes, her yard was dusky and her mood had lightened. Andy let her gaze drift across the darkening landscape and her heart filled with exultation. She raised her arms, fanned out her fingers, and arched her feet until she was on her toes. The light exploded into a ring of fire in a black sky: total eclipse. She gently rose up into the warm, dark air and began to dance.</description>

  <description>A book of 366 mantras or affirmations to raise and encourage the self-esteem and self-belief of children (plus adults), told through the eyes of young siblings Hao Finley Lee and Sabine Yi Lee. Written in the form of a journal and calendar, there is a mantra for each day of the month. For each mantra that Hao and Sabine want to focus on for their own personal growth, they share that with other fellow "philomaths" or knowledge-seekers through an illustration that describes for them that mantra. For them it's to: SAY it. BELIEVE it. BECOME it. MANIFEST it.</description>

  <description>Everything Happens for a Reason... Seventeen-year-old Alyson Butler is living a dream life in Los Angeles, California, and she's hoping for the perfect summer before her senior year. The daughter of two successful Hollywood professionals, she enjoys a life of privilege, wealth, parties, and independence-as she rarely sees her parents. But when an unfortunate decision lands Alyson in rural Minnesota as punishment to spend the summer with her grandparents at Davis Lake, she quickly realizes that living in this small town will be a far cry from the glitz and glam she is accustomed to. &lt;br /&gt;A slow start at the lake has Alyson believing she won't survive beyond the first week, but things begin to change when the seemingly perfect Marc Maylore and his friends arrive a few doors down. &lt;br /&gt;As Alyson tries hard to keep her own secrets from those she meets, she soon realizes there may be more to this little town than she initially thought-and that anyone can be hiding something. "Ride" is a story of love, loss, friendship, lies, and self-discovery. As Alyson soon learns, moments in life define us, but it is our choice as to who we become.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Quoin Ataraxis&lt;/em&gt;, the compelling second installment of the young adult Quest of the Staff and the Sword saga, John's quest continues as he searches for understanding of his purpose. With control of the world's media, Luke is able to convince the world that they are in danger from "the hooded man." Luke will attempt to use his power not only to destroy the hooded man but also to immobilize the people of the world. If Luke goes to extremes, a terrible change will overtake the world--a change that could return the world to the Dark Ages. John must protect the Jedidiah family, along with their friends--and he must inspire them to join him on his quest. In T. K. Kohl's exciting &lt;em&gt;Quoin Ataraxis&lt;/em&gt;, Luke's darkness grows in him, and the fate of the world trembles in the balance, but John is ready to establish the foundation of peace, save those who wish to be saved, and assure those around him that all will be well.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE 2019 READERVIEWS AWARD FOR FANTASY!&lt;br /&gt;WINNER OF THE 2019 IPPY AWARD FOR FANTASY!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Life is transformation. You change or you die.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ashamed of his past and overwhelmed by his future, Ronoah Genoveffa Elizzi-denna Pilanovani feels too small for his own name. After a graceless exit from his homeland in the Acharrioni desert, his anxiety has sabotaged every attempt at redemption. Asides from a fiery devotion to his godling, the one piece of home he brought with him, he has nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is, until he meets Reilin. Beguiling, bewildering Reilin, who whisks Ronoah up into a cross-continental pilgrimage to the most sacred place on the planet. The people they encounter on the way—children of the sea, a priestess and her band of storytellers, the lonely ghosts of monsters—are grim and whimsical in equal measure. Each has their part to play in rewriting Ronoah’s personal narrative. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One part fantasy travelogue, one part emotional underworld journey, &lt;i&gt;The Heretic’s Guide to Homecoming&lt;/i&gt; is a sumptuous, slow-burning story about stories and the way they shape our lives.</description>

  <description>What if dreams were portals to other worlds and you got trapped there? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The doctor’s diagnosis was grim. Cillian Rysgaard was dying. As an eighty-six-year-old man, this news was terrifying, but not surprising. The true shock came when he walked out of the doctor’s office and was suddenly in a city unlike any on Earth. Just as startling, he had the body of his early thirties. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Assuming it’s all a dream, he agrees to steal a powerful sword to kill a dragon, but the quest goes awry when he’s tricked into releasing an imprisoned man. Once freed, the man claims to be the god Loki and vows to unleash a war between the other gods that could destroy the universe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To find and recapture Loki, Cillian must navigate a world of cowboys and dragons, of robots and mythical beings. Where magic and advanced technology coexist, and demigods wage war for control. Where time travel and wormholes are real, and the line between dreams, simulation, and reality blurs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Should he fail, he will never see Earth, or his family, again. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Neighbors: Persons living in proximity to other persons. Everyone has neighbors. Neighbors-From-Hell: Neighbors who are not nice. Have you ever had Neighbors-From-Hell? Neighbors are an obvious arrangement in cities or towns. Good or bad, tidy or messy, quiet or noisy, nice or mean; there are all types. City slickers moving to the country invoke the image of space and solitude, but there will still be neighbors. The space between domiciles might be larger, but a bad, messy, or noisome neighbor can still exist. Even with a country home's space and larger area, there can still be neighbors that won't contain themselves to their own area. Once upon a time there was a young family who had a dream of owning land and operating a farm. They became land owners and cattle ranchers, building their very own dream house on their very own patch of paradise. They worked hard to assimilate to this new lifestyle in a new neighborhood. It was everything they'd hoped for, and they were so happy. Then they got neighbors. They got Neighbors-From-Hell. These bad neighbors were pushy, arrogant, and mean. Their bad attitudes, slovenly habits, and meanness aside, the neighbors would not contain themselves to their own area. They encroached. They took what was not theirs. They forced themselves into the space and lives of our heroes. These neighbors meant to build their house on their property next door to our little family. The neighbors' property had some unfortunate attributes, however, and it became clear that their property wasn't very conducive to building a home. Astonishingly, these neighbors insisted on utilizing portions of property they didn't own to construct their project. There were other solutions to the construction dilemmas these neighbors faced, but these answers would have been costly. They wanted to use our little family's land for free. They wanted to steal the property and property rights of our little family. These Neighbors-From-Hell came on over b</description>

  <description>Can stuffed elephants go to kindergarten, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie takes Ellie, her stuffed elephant lovey, everywhere. But stuffed animals can’t come to Sammie’s kindergarten. Sammie and Ellie are afraid to spend their first day apart until they learn that Ellie gets to go to her very own kindergarten in Mama’s car. In car kindergarten, Ellie works on counting, writing her letters and sounding out words. Ellie has lunch in the cafeteria, and enjoys art, P.E., music and recess. And, just like in Sammie’s kindergarten at school, Ellie even makes some new friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the power of imagination, Ellie’s Car Kindergarten gives children a positive way to feel comfortable spending their school day apart from a lovey or special stuffed animal. Ellie’s Car Kindergarten is also a creative tool parents and educators can use to help children look forward to learning and having fun in kindergarten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellie's Car Kindergarten is the proud recipient of a 2018-2019 Reviewer's Choice Literary Award from Readers Views.</description>

  <description>Marathon and Half Marathon Training, One-Day-a-Week (It Can Be Done) describes a two-year running challenge completed by the author. The challenge was to determine if someone could successfully complete multiple marathons and half marathons during a two-year timeframe while training only one day per week. Learn if this training method might right for you and how the author came up with this idea and why. This book reveals how the author determined that marathon and half marathon training one-day-a-week is probably viable for many runners by going out and doing it over a two-year timeframe. It describes the author's varying experiments throughout with weekly mileage amounts and what the effects were physically, and during actual races. There are descriptions of the author's experiences during the races completed during this timeframe and impressions of previous races he has completed. There is practical advice from an experienced marathon and half marathon runner for those who have never completed one or either race distances. If you are not a marathon of half marathon runner, or are new to this type of running, there is also advice for how to strategize training for, and completing a race. If you enjoy running non-competitively, are otherwise fit, and have limited time to train extensively for a marathon or half marathon, this book might be for you. Even if you are not a runner in any way and are simply curious about what a marathon runner's life is like, you also might enjoy this book.</description>

  <description>**Note: This is the COLOR edition of this book.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must understand the problem in order to visualize and actualize the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did the US voluntarily arrive at the doorstep of its own demise? is homemade manmade Handmaid's Tale, where falsehoods and transparently mean-spirited claptrap trump facts and common decency--subverting na�ve yet positive innocence into a malignant supremacist and myopic nationalistic agenda that is now in aming the planet's already rising temperature of self-harm? All this to cloak the true aspirations of the identi ed malevolent Oligarchs, who no longer lie quietly waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book in this trilogy (Math v. Myth) exposed the blatant myths that now overshadow reality. The second book (Who is Jeb!!!) uncovered the horrible histories of the Bush dynasty--revealing how America, beginning with the JFK assassination, began its descent from being a force for good, to now having zero moral authority. Allies hold us in contempt; enemies nurture us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must understand the problem in order to visualize and actualize the solution. Since I fear the solution is unlikely to be enacted organically, we must prepare to seek a ballot-box-inspired intervention from a higher power--we must seek deliverance from our own collective folly, not from the heavens but from our own homegrown saviors, whom we created in the image of own inescapable delusions.</description>

  <description>What would you do if you find out less than 30% of your organs functioned normally whilst the overwhelming majority of them were in appalling conditions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After long term suffering from dozens of serious disorders, Gang Luo managed to surprise everyone with his healthy glow and decades-younger appearance on the way to his eighties and became the envy of his, and the younger, generation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inspirational story of struggle and recovery, friendship and loyalty, this is one man’s true account of battling to a victory over liver diseases and numerous serious conditions, and survival in a chaotic period of human history. With the help of Traditional Chinese Medicine masters, and furthered by the healing power of natural herbal medicine combined with food therapy, he finally triumphed over menacing illnesses and came to radiance at an advanced age approaching to eighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an ignorant novice to a self-care expert, the author reiterates personal success on eliminating diseases, restoring health and his hard lessons learned along the way to the climax of well-being. He emphasizes the importance of taking charge of our own health, and explicates why we should adopt a proactive attitude to medical treatment and hospital care in order to speed up the healing process and minimize delay and mishaps; he also highlighted the issue of knowing how to self-care properly and wisely with the help of health science. A strong believer in herbalism, a loyal follower of Traditional Chinese Medicine and a beneficiary of integrative medicine, the author advocates the holistic approach to health and practise the oriental art of health maintenance — utilizing every day food, spices and herbs in ailment healing and illness prevention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside this book, there are also personally used and proven herbal remedies, workable food recipes, a private prescription collection from an outstanding Traditional Chinese Medicine master, little-known cancer preventing natural remedy and practical tips to offset common complaints and ailments in the comfort of your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Chance is a nonfiction health and wellness memoir. Gang Luo had actually prepared a burial place for himself in his home village when he was still a middle-aged man. Now, thirty years later, his family loves to tease him about that plot. Second Chance is a fascinating look at the political and historical events of the 20th century in China and the impact they had on the population, especially those who, like the author, were part of the educated class. He eloquently describes the excessive mandatory work loads and the inevitable associated stress, and he precisely catalogues the strains they put on his health and well-being -- strains that led doctors to warn him of an early death from illness. Gang Luo's glowing health at the age of 79 is testament indeed to the efficacy of his take-charge attitude about health and wellness. His descriptions of traditional Chinese medicine and the use of both herbs and foods as medicines make for some compelling reading. Gang Luo's decision to use the best of both Western and traditional Chinese medicines seems to have worked quite well for him. His discussions of his fitness protocols are also well worth considering for anyone interested in enhancing the quality of their life. Second Chance is most highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt; - Jack Magnus for Readers'Favorite</description>

  <description>Did you know our brain is plastic?!That's right: because "plastic" means it can change.This is the story of Barbara Arrowsmith-Young. As a child she was told she would never overcome the learning disabilities that made school so difficult and frustrating for her. But Barbara refused to believe that was true.With her courage, inventiveness, and resilience, she found ways to actually change her brain and improve her ability to learn. A dedicated researcher and innovator who came to be know as "the brain pioneer" for her groundbreaking research using what's now known as "brain plasticity" to help children with learning problems. Barbara has transformed how people with learning disabilities are perceived and educated. Barbara created her own brain improvement program, and opened the Arrowsmith School in 1980 to bring the program to other students. Today there are over 100 schools offering the program around the world. The program can also help adults who have brain injuries from stroke or accidents.Through Barbara's passion and achievements, she has taught the world that children with learning disabilities and people who have suffered brain injuries can change their brains, and dreams of a brighter future!</description>

  <description>There is a way that seems right unto a person, but the way thereof is the way of death. It is the 1960's. Above the rich Native American city of NuSprings, Missouri, the sky is turning dark with a deadly storm brewing on the horizon. Suicide Affair is a multi-book story of how lives crisscross and intertwine. Some affairs, no matter how exciting or appealing, are suicidal when pursued. Dark, intriguing, and sometimes chilling, Dark Skies pulls you down a path you would never wish to go: Rita, a child lost on the path, wanders a dark stormy world of loneliness and survival. Her worst fear is not being raised by the monster who murdered her mother, but the shadows that threaten to eat her soul. Garth, a boy with a good soul, is pushed onto the path and pulled into its darkness through revenge and murder. RiverDawg, an aging witch doctor, plays on the path and toys with those who venture down it. People are his entertainment. Quillpen Jack, a Native American boy hoping one day to become a great warrior, discovers the path is not only dark, but deadly. Will he survive? Will any of them survive the coming storm?</description>

  <description>An Unexpected Story of Hope and Perseverance... As a young child, it was obvious something was wrong with Michael. He lacked basic motor skills and was unable to follow simple instructions or answer questions. Testing revealed a diagnosis of autism with a low IQ. Experts insisted that leading an independent life would be impossible for him...and school was not an option. Supported by documentation and interviews, Michael's heartfelt memoir traces the sustained challenges and turbulent journey he faced. His life was plagued by failures, negative results, rejections from schools, an inability to complete simple karate moves or participate in activities-all of which confirmed the hopeless situation. But Michael was surrounded by support, and he was encouraged to keep trying no matter how many times he failed. Developmental progress was not always obvious, but Michael was finding his own unique path. What Autism Gave Me is a powerful reminder that the human drive to succeed is stronger than any diagnosis.</description>

  <description>Snowden, North Dakota is a dying reservation town in a dying state, surrounded by hundreds of miles of prairie littered with the ruins of eight decades of economic decline. To half-Chippewa, half-white seventeen-year-old Dylan Erickson, this land is a little slice of heaven—the woods and fields, the endless skies that burn at night, and the Missouri River running through it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is threatened by an oil boom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As tens of thousands of workers pour into the state, the rural communities struggle to cope with the chaos. Housing prices skyrocket, the roads turn deadly from the explosion in traffic, and the cops are overwhelmed fighting the surge in drugs and crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it’s a fatal accident caused by Dylan’s own self-destructive behavior that rocks the close-knit community and turns his whole world upside-down. In his search for a meaning in the accident and a way to atone for what he’s done, he will discover the haunting meaning of the tragedy of beauty.</description>

  <description>2019 Independent Publisher Book Award Winner (Gold) in U.S. History&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you’ve ever seen an episode of &lt;i&gt;Law and Order,&lt;/i&gt; you can probably recite your Miranda rights by heart. But you likely don’t know that these rights had their roots in the case of a young Chinese man accused of murdering three diplomats in Washington DC in 1919. A frantic search for clues and dogged interrogations by gumshoes erupted in sensational news and editorial coverage and intensified international pressure on the police to crack the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Part murder mystery, part courtroom drama, and part landmark legal case, &lt;i&gt;The Third Degree &lt;/i&gt;is the true story of a young man’s abuse by the Washington police and an arduous, seven-year journey through the legal system that drew in Warren G. Harding, William Howard Taft, Oliver Wendell Holmes, John W. Davis, and J. Edgar Hoover. The ordeal culminated in a sweeping Supreme Court ruling penned by Justice Louis Brandeis that set the stage for the Miranda warning many years later. Scott D. Seligman argues that the importance of the case hinges not on the defendant’s guilt or innocence but on the imperative that a system that presumes one is innocent until proven guilty provides protections against coerced confessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Today, when the treatment of suspects between arrest and trial remains controversial, when bias against immigrants and minorities in law enforcement continues to deny them their rights, and when protecting individuals from compulsory self-incrimination is still an uphill battle, this century-old legal spellbinder is a cautionary tale that reminds us how we got where we are today and makes us wonder how far we have yet to go.&lt;br /&gt;  </description>

  <description>No one gets out of here alive. Death is certain. What isn't certain is your reaction to it: Do you feel prepared to cope with the death of a loved one or your own impending death?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a trauma-trained ER nurse, certified clinical hypnotherapist (handling grief and PTSD), memorial portrait artist, and firefighter, Jan Briddell Stevens has faced death multiple times, and she draws upon these varied experiences here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossing the Caring Bridge: What Death Taught Me About Life, Love, Gratitude, and Grace&lt;/em&gt; brings you face-to-face with Mr. Reaper and encourages you to recognize that old Death is not the monster you've come to expect. Through sincere and even humorous conversations with Death (whose mother calls him Morty), as well as journal accounts of her own family's appointments with him, Stevens clears up "mythconceptions," offering readers hope for Heavenly love.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A near-death experience in a car with her Mother; running from tear gas at a Vietnam War rally hand-in-hand with her Pop; a year in India learning side-by-side the country's 'untouchables;' the highs and lows of living on a rural Pennsylvania commune…and all before Fiona Sprechelbach's thirteenth birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set during one of the most politically divisive eras in American history, Thread for Pearls is a coming of age tale that takes us on a young heroine's journey to faith and freedom amidst a turbulent family dynamic. It's a story of resilient hope that questions whether it's the events of our lives that define us, or the thread on which we choose to string them.</description>

  <description>It was September 18, 2001, just seven days after al-Qaeda hijackers destroyed the Twin Towers. In the early morning darkness, a lone figure dropped several letters into a mailbox. Seventeen days later a Florida journalist died of inhalational anthrax. The death from the rare disease made world news. These anthrax attacks marked the first time a sophisticated biological weapon was released in the United States. It killed five people, disfigured at least 18 more, and launched the largest investigation in the FBI's history. Recounting the Anthrax Attacks explores the origins of the innovative forensics used in this case, while also explaining their historical context. R. Scott Decker's team pursued its first suspect with dogged determination before realizing that the evidence did not add up. With renewed energy, they turned to non-traditional forensics--scientific initiatives never before applied to an investigation--as they continued to hunt for clues. These advances formed the new science of microbial forensics, a novel discipline that produced critical leads when traditional methods failed. The new technologies helped identify a second suspect--one who possessed the knowledge and skills to unleash a living weapon of mass destruction. Decker provides the first inside look at how the investigation was conducted, highlighting dramatic turning points as the case progressed until its final solution. Join FBI agents as they race against terror and the ultimate insider threat--a decorated government scientist releasing powders of deadly anthrax. Walk in the steps of these dedicated officers while they pursue numerous forensic leads before more letters can be sent until finally they confront a psychotic killer.</description>

To survive, the different faerie races--led by the Fae--escaped to the Human Realm where they've lived ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Fae Patriarch of Boston's criminal underworld, Aohdan Collins enjoys his playboy lifestyle while he works from the shadows to expand his growing empire, until one night when he shares a shot of whiskey with the lovely Seireadan Moore...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Fae Seer, Seireadan is haunted by a vision of the Fae responsible for destroying Faerie and murdering her family.

And while her heart is bound to Aohdan, she cannot let go of her lifelong quest to hunt down the Fae who haunts her visions... especially when she realizes Aohdan might be the key to helping her find him.But is revenge worth betraying the one she loves?</description>

  <description>After an upheaval, you must face what seems impossible: continuing your life. Artie Van Why found himself in that situation after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and he recalls his experiences as a survivor and witness of that day in this memoir. Van Why also looks back at what brought him to New York, including his struggle with his sexuality and spirituality. He shares these personal details because as you read about him standing in front of the burning towers, it�s important to understand the person he was on that day, what he�d been through, what he�d endured, and what he�d overcome. Finally, in what were originally Huffington Post blogs, Van Why shares what his life has been like since 9/11, including how he�s coped with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and all the other manifestations of grief, mourning, and sadness that can be applied to any life-altering experience.</description>

  <description>The Saga Begins. An earthquake opened a crack in the earth, in the middle of the jungles of Peru, exposing a building inside the earth. Dr. Henry Jedidiah, who is a world-renowned archaeologist, and well trusted throughout the world, is asked to take his team into Peru. They discover ancient scrolls and tablets, which propel the Jedidiah family onto a path towards an artifact, which had been taken from someone, thousands of years ago, to protect the world. Throwing all caution to the wind, they ignore all the warnings written within the scrolls and tablets. Believing the warnings are nothing but superstitions, the Jedidiah family are compelled to find this artifact. Upon finding the artifact, one man is propelled to great power over the earth, while all life on earth, plant, animal, and mankind is being destroyed. The Jedidiah family must race against time, searching the scrolls and tablets to find the answer, to find the one who can save this world, before it's too late. What they find is not what is expected. With nothing left, the Jedidiah family must trust 'The Staff and The Sword.'</description>

  <description>There are serious dangers lurking behind the government's $30 billion electronic health record (EHR) experiment. This omnipresent technology turns doctors into data clerks and shifts attention from patients to paperwork-while health plans, government agencies, and the health data industry profit. Patients who think the HIPAA ''privacy'' rule protects the confidentiality of their medical information will be shocked to discover it makes their medical records an open book. Inside this book, discover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- how Congress forced doctors to install surveillance in the exam room&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- hard facts from over 125 studies and reports about the impact of EHRs on medical care, costs, patient safety, and more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- how patient treatment decisions are controlled (and tracked) by the EHR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- what specific steps back to freedom, privacy, and patient safety are available, and why we must act now.</description>

  <description>Has someone that you love died unexpectedly? Is the pain hard to bear? It was for Debra Hester, so she makes no apologies for the emotions that are expressed in her memoir, My Backyard Garden. If the emotions seem too much, they are more and maybe even more than you can feel right now or imagine that you or someone you know is going through. Debra Hester was standing at the base of a huge mountain that seemed to emerge out of nowhere after her mother's death. If you're at this place, or know of someone who is, her hope is that My Backyard Garden will give you and them hope and insights into the journey ahead. This memoir of how love conquers grief chronicles the days leading up to her mother's death, the wisdom her mother left behind, the insights she gained at the very end of her mother's life on this side and the journey of memories that surface for a fight against her deep seated fears, anger and grief. Come to her backyard garden with its natural beauty, its captivating yet calming and healing properties. Come sit with her and share a garden view of a journey we all will take. In My Backyard Garden, a memoir of how love conquers grief her heart goes out to you. She wants everyone who is grieving to not take their feelings lightly or the feelings of others who are going through this season of grief. She shows how real feelings of grief run deep, regardless of what you show or see on the outside. Grief is real and she hopes reading about her journey with her loved ones allows us all to mourn, to reflect and to recover at our own pace and recognize when we have arrived at a better place.</description>

  <description>A wrenching true tale of horrific loss, Surviving Heartbreak Valley is the story of a woman whose four young children were murdered on the day she graduated college. She somehow finds the strength and courage to go on with life. She became an outspoken advocate, conducting seminars, speaking to organizations and groups, appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and in a Diane Sawyer documentary. Less A wrenching true tale of horrific loss, Surviving Heartbreak Valley is the story of a woman who suffers the worst tragedy imaginable but somehow finds the strength and courage to go on with life. In 1989 Linda Walls had put an abusive relationship behind her, graduated college, and was ready to start the next chapter in life. But in one hellish night everything changed. She came home to find her house on fire with her four young children trapped inside. The children's father, Bernon Howery, a violent man who stalked Linda following their break-up, had ignited the blaze. In 1991 he was sentenced to death for murdering his children. Linda meanwhile began the difficult process of putting her life back together. Rather than simply drowning in a sea of despair, she began speaking out against stalking and domestic violence to help prevent what happened to her from befalling others. She became an outspoken advocate, conducting seminars, speaking to organizations and groups, appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and in a Diane Sawyer documentary. But Linda's battle for justice and to establish a new life for herself was far from over. Bernon Howery continued to wreak havoc in her life, fighting to have his death sentence overturned which was eventually commuted to four life sentences. Writing Surviving Heartbreak Valley is "my next chapter," Linda said. "I want the telling of my story to add a real sense of urgency in building greater awareness of the domestic horror taking place in America, and our nation's need to galvanize a crusade to prevent it."</description>

  <description>This book begins the saga of a man whose world will come to know him as Nagaro – “Nameless Man.” He is not quite eighteen when he flees from something “better not remembered,” and his memories are hidden from him, leaving him to try to find a way to live in the world as he relearns its ways. But disturbing dreams soon prompt him to try to unlock his memory and discover what was done to him. He learns he was a foundling, raised in obscurity by a noble lady until his idyllic life was shattered by powerful men bent on controlling him for reasons he can only guess at. But by the time the veil is fully lifted from his mind, he has been captured by sea raiders and chained to the oar of a war galley. There he must find a way to regain his freedom while keeping his past a secret, for his ordeal has left him scarred. He knows that the powerful men who hurt him must think him dead – and he intends to keep it that way.</description>

  <description>Pat McGrath's historical fiction "And The Darkness Fell," tells the nearly forgotten story of Hypatia of Alexandria, the last of the great pagan intellectuals/teachers in the last years of the Roman Empire. Basing her novel in factual dates, events and characters, McGrath uses fiction to give her heroine a real life, a love affair with the historic Roman Prefect, Orestes, and an enemy in the real life, Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria. Retired now, but politically active for many years, McGrath felt called to remind the world of this great woman, a force to be reckoned with in her own time. It is said that 'with her death, the dark ages began.'</description>

  <description>Yes, (Part I &amp;amp; Part II) is an inspiring account of a husband and wife exploring the world by sailboat. Part I, England to Fiji: Walking the narrow, brick laid streets of Europe, the couple explore historic cities and centuries old fishing villages. At Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, they view the only 16th century warship in the world. At Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, a gold crucifix, dated 874, is believed to contain a piece of the True Cross. Alhambra, intricately sculpted with molded plaster, stone, and patterned tiles, is the only intact medieval Muslim palace in existence. Seeking adventure, caves, subterranean catacombs, and dark, mysterious lava tunnels are explored. Hiking the Marquesas Islands, they stumble upon ritual platforms, cavernous prisoner pits and stone execution sites once used by tribes known for cannibalism and sacrifice. Scuba diving, they explore the underwater world of the Gal�pagos Islands, Bora Bora and the Tuamotus, the shark capital of the world. Leaving England with a new boat, the learning curve is steep and not without injury. The new lifestyle presents problems never before experienced: transmission fluid and hydraulic leaks, radio malfunctions and autopilot breakdowns. Squalls, hull devouring reefs and colossal waves are part of offshore sailing. A Coastguard helicopter lowers a rescue officer to their aft deck, an unidentified armed vessel circles their boat while sailing at night through waters known for drug trafficking. Protected anchorages become dangerous when nearby boats drag their anchors and crash into them. Crossing the Atlantic, sails tear apart, rigging lets go. St. Martin to Rhode Island, Panama Canal to French Polynesia, Fiji to New Zealand; each passage had its challenges. Mustique, Cook Islands, Tahiti, Tonga; each island held intrigue. Immersed in adventure, enlivened by fascinating stories, the author writes with compassion, wit and humour. Yes, the World is Round, is a story of incredible challenge and perseverance. Author's recommendations: accommodations, restaurants and Caribbean beach bars. Back packer dormitories and resorts. Adventure diving, hiking, and not-to-be missed attractions.</description>

  <description>It has been proven that one of the most effective ways to learn and retain information is to do so while being entertained. Thus, the goal of this book...to improve the reader's grasp and usage of the English language while evoking smiles, smirks, even raised and furrowed brows. It is quite simply a fun, informative read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's call this written exercise a 'Flexicon'...a flexing of our American English lexicon. Lexicon: American Style II is a further examination and celebration of our Americanized version of the Kings English. The first half of the book is a breakdown of how we commonly use our words, phrases and names to communicate in these United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Lexicon II is also a collection of humorous American lifestyle observations. The second half of the book labeled, 'Observations From the Carpool Lane' features a wide-ranging group of essays regarding the common, sometimes mystifying, experiences most of us share as modern day American citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These examinations and observations are brought to page by author Patrick Ragains, a middle-aged 'word nerd' advertising veteran from the Midwest, who's wry wit and literal interpretation of our language makes for humorous, insightful reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to pure entertainment, Ragains' goal in this book is to expand and enrich his reader's vocabulary and understanding of our language. He flies in the face of current communication trends which, because of technology and linguistic laziness, are reducing our written and verbal interchanges to a number of acronyms, emojis and drab, over-used one syllable words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The introduction of Lexicon II also pays high tribute to Noah Webster, Jr., the foremost lexicographer in our history. A man who, although he never gained true notoriety as one of our nation's 'founding fathers', is every bit deserving of that distinction. A man whose nationalistic accomplishments and visionary concepts effect almost each and every American on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be over looked, is the adult, profane section towards the end of book that is heavily marked with a warning for sensitive, highly religious and under age readers. This section entitled, 'Down to Nitty Gritty and Shitty' is also featured in the writer's first book as part of his tribute to the late legendary comic George Carlin. Although quite bawdy and even disgusting at points, this section is possibly the most creative and thought provoking in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final section of the book, Ragains attempts in impart some of his accrued wisdom on aging, being at peace with one's self, becoming an author, the afterlife bottom lines and finally, some important words to live by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the first Lexicon: American Style leaves off, Lexicon II picks up and blazes new articulated investigations into our American way of communicating. Sophomore author Ragains hits all the areas of our English language missed in his first book, and more...literally, from A to Z... from Acronyms to Zombies. Lexicon: American Style II features 81 provocative, mind-tweaking chapters to jump start the reader's imagination and titillate their Yankee Doodle fancy!</description>

  <description>Yes, you can live stress free!&lt;br /&gt;Whether you want to (1) remove stress from your life, (2) handle difficult circumstances with ease, or (3) learn to think fearlessly, this book will get you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you tired of being bogged down with emotional pain?&lt;br /&gt;Learn to live freely and lightly. Untie those internal knots and discover a way of living that will nourish body, mind, and spirit. Grow to understand your fears and worries, your desires and needs, from a totally new perspective, one that can have you facing life boldly, with inner peace and calm confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stress-free living is within your grasp!&lt;br /&gt;I'll show you how to address the root of your stress - your thinking. No, stress isn't caused by your circumstances or the actions of others; it's caused by how you think about them! Most of our problems in life stem from simple errors of thinking that lead to mistaken actions that, in turn, cause us problems. You can prevent these problems, however, by changing how you think. Really! It's that easy...and that hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because we've been conditioned from infancy to think in ways that are totally different from what I will show you, you may find this change a bit difficult to grasp at first. That's the hard part, but I have made the process as painless as possible by providing incredibly simple exercises that will assist you in shifting your thinking. Each new concept is accompanied by easy-to-follow instructions for mental exercises you can practice in your own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discover energy you never knew you had!&lt;br /&gt;Nobody understands energy, not even the greatest scientists, but we have learned a little about working with it over the centuries. With my help you'll discover untapped reservoirs of internal and external energy and learn how they can be used to benefit yourself and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will you learn about fearless thinking?&lt;br /&gt;How breathing can help you&lt;br /&gt;How to practice healthy detachment, attachment, surrender, and self-awareness in day to day small situations.&lt;br /&gt;Four elements of your mind.&lt;br /&gt;The dual nature of life to turn around every conceivable situation in your favor.&lt;br /&gt;Mental conditioning and its effect on our lives.&lt;br /&gt;You will also discover:&lt;br /&gt;Positive, negative, and neutral energy; how it affects your life.&lt;br /&gt;The infinite nature of your mind.&lt;br /&gt;What's behind the belief in reincarnation?&lt;br /&gt;What you can do with your ego?&lt;br /&gt;Lay your fears to rest for good.&lt;br /&gt;Discover a fresh way to look at the things that cause you anxiety, fear, or downright panic. Gain fresh insight into the source of future fears, past fears, imaginative fears, relational fears, in short - any fear you can imagine. Even more valuable, learn a simple strategy that can destroy them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know the joy of finding balance in your life&lt;br /&gt;The concept of equanimity will help you deal with life's seeming dichotomies. Ever wonder how good and evil can coexist in the world? I'll explain a way to view these contradictions that can help bring together the opposite sides of your personality - and the world around you -into an integrated whole.</description>

  <description>Murder Comes To The Vineyard&lt;br /&gt; Georgann Prochaska&lt;br /&gt; What is Alice Tricklebank Willing to Risk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did a request for a simple bloodhound search of a vineyard leapfrog into a murder investigation? Alice Tricklebank and her bloodhound Audrey awaken to gunshots only to find the body of Guthrie Huff in the main house and another body among the tendrilled grapevines. Like it or not, Alice is again entangled in a stiff-necked investigation with suspects holding secrets and scars close to their chests. But this time her dear friends, Lena and Julian, are not immediately available to cobble a story together. Alice is on her own in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police begin their investigation by questioning Alice's presence. Did Guthrie believe Alice's dog could find her son's grave? Detective Joshua Galati follows with more questions: is there a link between Cade's seven-month disappearance and his mother's death. Galati is uneasy with Alice's amateur conclusion that Guthrie was the first to shoot. The police identify the second body as Xavier Nettle, a bartender at a biker bar called The Hungry Fool. But what was he doing at the vineyard in the middle of the night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleanora, the grandmother, with her oversize hope that her grandson Cade is still alive, wants him to come home. The lawyer Roddy Merritt has the paperwork prepared for Cade to be named Eleanora's heir. But Guthrie's sister Rayne is shocked to read in an online newspaper of Guthrie's death and dredges up their history as she confronts Eleanora. Elka, the house manager adds perspective by spilling dark secrets of Cade's brutal father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Alice's daughter Jess is pulled into the investigation because she is a yoga friend of Guthrie, Alice worries. If the investigation becomes too intense, her protective daughter might not allow Henry to spend the summer with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice finds she's not alone in the investigation afterall. A policeman back home calls to explain the significance of wadcutters, and her granddaughter works to hack into Cade's secret file on his tablet. Witt, a young private eye, contacts Alice because he carries too much information about a revenge site and a bad guy named Noose. Then her friends Lena and Julian cut short their California vacation to reunite the snooping posse from Limekiln. But Lena's plot to sing bawdy songs at The Hungry Fool causes Alice's knees to jump with fear. Is it a bad idea or just plain loopy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many questions to answer. Was Cade murdered or did he leave seven months ago? If he left, why didn't he take his identification, money, and Jeep? Who killed Guthrie? Why did Noose threaten the Huff family before Cade disappeared and then again two weeks before Alice arrived at the vineyard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rib-poking time hustles Alice to butt into lives if she plans to attend her grandson's graduation. Skyping for the past year with family is no replacement for hugs. And Audrey becomes a prankster, miffed that her favorite toy was left behind in Limekiln. Alice promised her grandson that she'd have her keister planted on the bleachers for the ceremony. Can she keep her promise? Tick-tock. Better hurry, Alice!</description>

  <description>A psychic medium once said that if you find a random dime, it is a sign that someone that you have loved and lost is thinking of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Dime is a Sign Through Time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find a dime,&lt;br /&gt;You will know that I’m&lt;br /&gt;Sending thoughts of love&lt;br /&gt;Through the veil of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten cents with a silver shine,&lt;br /&gt;A sense sent you to help remind&lt;br /&gt;That someone who left you behind&lt;br /&gt;Is always living in your mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending love and vibes,&lt;br /&gt;Felt as psychic sighs …&lt;br /&gt;The ones that you miss,&lt;br /&gt;Send you a kiss …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherrill S. Cannon’s second book of poetry contains messages written through the years in poetic form that put feelings into words. As a teacher, many of her poems helped counsel troubled teens and friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three sections in the book: Heads, Spinning, and Tails … (Love &amp;amp; Loss: Coin Toss?). The variety of lyrical poetry forms include free verse, blank verse, haiku, and sonnets, while some are just playing with words! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, this is also a book of healing.</description>

  <description>Mary Carlson didn't start out to become a veterinarian, let alone the owner and caretaker of cats (many), dogs (two, both huskies), and horses (some with manners, some without) in Colorado. She was a suburban Chicago girl; all she knew of the American West came from the stories her uncle, who had settled in northern Colorado, told her during his annual visits. But thanks to him, she ended up moving to Fort Collins, Colorado for college—and after falling in love with a man she'd become friends with in her final year of college, when he was a student at the CSU School of Veterinary Medicine, she remained there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the work Earl did as a veterinarian inspired Mary to eventually leave her tenured teaching position and enter vet school, after which she opened her own, feline-exclusive clinic. Along the way, there were numerous pets, grueling years of vet school, a shattered hip, an enduring love, illness, and death—and the rediscovery that life, especially a life full of delightful animals, is worth living.</description>

  <description>Aging is universally dreaded by men and women alike, but it is the very subject author and humorist Ruth Yunker tackles in &lt;i&gt;Baby, I'm The Boss Of Me&lt;/i&gt;. Filled with elegant and humorous essays taken from her own life, it is an exuberant appeal to fearlessly embrace the grace of growing older using the powerful forces of humor and optimism. Yunker's vignettes provide enlightening and quixotic examples as to how to tackle what promises to be a rich, wonderful and indeed amazing experience, if allowed.</description>

  <description>For thousands of years, the Breaker of the Dawn has been locked away in the ethereal plane of the Otherworld. Now, a young blacksmith’s apprentice finds himself trapped in a war between the noble Athrani, a subset of humanity gifted with the ability to transmute matter, and the malevolent and powerful Khyth, who seek to free the ancient god from his prison. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his father, Olson, is kidnapped, Thornton Woods and his childhood friend, Miera, must leave their small village of Highglade to find him. On their way, they are joined by Ynara and Kethras, cat-like humanoids called Kienari, who use their skills as hunter/trackers to follow Olson’s trail. When it comes to light that one among them possesses the key to the Breaker’s release, Thornton and his friends must defy the might of the Khyth as armies on both sides collide in pursuit of the ultimate prize. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gift of the Shaper chronicles the epic struggle between the existing forces of good and evil, with both sides vying for control of the key that unlocks the Otherworld. The very powers of creation and destruction hang in the balance, and only a heroic effort by Thornton and Miera, backed by the power of the Athrani, can possibly stop the Khyth from unleashing ruin — and the Breaker — upon their world.</description>
