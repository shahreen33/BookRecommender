  <description>When she was thirteen, Zoë Frixos fell in love with Simon, her best friend and the boy next door. Though they’ve been friends for over twenty years, she’s never found a way to tell him how she feels. Now Simon is returning to London, newly divorced and as devastatingly charming as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the music magazine that Zoë edits is facing closure unless she can secure the coup of the century and get an interview from notoriously elusive musician Marcie Tyler. But Marcie’s arrogant publicist Nick seems intent on hindering Zoë at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her brother’s upcoming wedding meaning Zoë is also called upon to attend family gatherings, hen parties and dress fittings, will she ever manage to tell Simon how she really feels while securing the future of the magazine she loves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;With a smart, relatable central character and razor-sharp wit, &lt;i&gt;Love Songs For Sceptics&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for fans of Mhairi McFarlane and Lucy Vine, with a dose of &lt;i&gt;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&lt;/i&gt; thrown in for good measure!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The woman’s golden hair is spread out beneath her on the bed of leaves where she’s fallen, her beautiful blue eyes open wide. The police are calling it a random attack, but Jessie Tucker isn’t so sure – she’s seen this crime scene before… she was the victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve years ago, Jessie Tucker was attacked as she made her way home from an outdoor concert. She still walks with a limp from that night, and every day since has been a struggle to rebuild her life. The police told her she was unlucky – that she was safe after they charged a local man for the crime. But Jessie has never managed to shake the feeling that there was someone else in the park that night… someone she knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Margaret Kincaid’s murder file lands across her desk, and Jessie knows she can’t keep silent any longer. Margaret’s wounds so exactly match her own it's spooky – but Jessie’s attacker is in prison, and Jessie has never met the victim. What links her to Margaret Kincaid, and why did the attacker let one woman live, and the other die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail-biting, gripping and absolutely unputdownable! Perfect for fans of Lisa Regan, Kendra Elliot and Gregg Olsen.</description>

  <description>Cosy up with the new novel in the Pudding Pantry series, full of love, laughter, kisses under the mistletoe, and plenty of delicious pudding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first snow is falling over Primrose Farm, the mince pies are warming, and Rachel can’t wait to share a kiss under the mistletoe with her gorgeous new flame, Tom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only it was all comfort and joy . . . The arrival of Tom’s ex brings an unwelcome chill to the farm. And despite Master Baker Mum Jill’s valiant efforts, the new pudding pantry business is feeling the pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a spoonful of festive spirit, a cupful of goodwill with friends, and her messy, wonderful family by her side, can Rachel make this a Christmas to remember?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Buckle up for a wild ride as Dixie Whiskey finds forever love in TAMING MY WHISKEY, a funny, sexy, and emotionally riveting standalone romance by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;The perfect love story for those who enjoy fiercely loyal and insanely sexy alpha heroes, smart, sassy heroines, strong family bonds, bikers, babies, and more! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In USA Today Bestseller TAMING MY WHISKEY...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the princess of the Dark Knights motorcycle club doesn’t come with a white knight or a fairy-tale castle, and that’s okay, because Dixie Whiskey has never needed a man to slay her dragons or make her whole. Even so, after watching each of her brothers fall in love, she’d sure like a shot at her own happily ever after. But with the Dark Knights watching over her and the only man she’s ever wanted out of reach, she’s not holding her breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the launch of Silver-Stone Cycles’ biggest line approaches, Jace Stone is left needing a favor from the one woman who holds the power to take him to his knees. He knows when it comes to sinfully gorgeous and sharp-tongued Dixie Whiskey, he must stay on his toes and keep his walls firmly in place. But Jace needs her for his business—and Jace Stone always gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tall, gruff, and darkly handsome biker presents an opportunity that any other woman might see as the chance of a lifetime, Dixie turns him down flat. But Jace is determined, and he pulls out all the stops—sending Dixie’s overprotective brothers up in arms. Rebellious Dixie takes a stand—going after the freedom, and the man, she’s always wanted. One scorching kiss leads to an undeniable connection, but Jace isn't looking to be tied down, and Dixie refuses to play second fiddle. Can two untamable hearts find forever love in each other’s arms?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;I can see my mother is calling me. I answer the phone, knowing I’ll have to tell her about Oliver and me breaking up. But before I can, she announces, ‘I don’t exactly know how to tell you this… But I’m leaving your dad.’&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single together for the first time, 34-year-old Meg and her warm-hearted, long-suffering mother Sally are cancelling Christmas, and running away to a tiny cottage on the Cornish coast. For Meg, it is the perfect place to heal, away from all the mistletoe, while for her mother it has a special, and secret, place in her heart – from a love story that seems a lifetime ago… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meg and Sally find they’re getting to know themselves, and each other, better than ever before. But as they are unable to resist getting involved in the village Christmas celebrations, they encounter two handsome local strangers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, it’s being away from home that helps you realise where your heart is. What neither woman knows is that, by the time the new year rolls around, one woman will have fallen in love with her husband all over again, and one marriage will be over for good… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An escapist, romantic and heart-warming novel for fans of &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;No One Cancels Christmas.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Katie focuses her mind, trying to keep another anxiety attack at bay. The victim’s long brown hair is slick and wet, her body rigid in the grass. She looks more like a mannequin than the woman Katie had spoken with only yesterday, the woman she had promised to protect… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a cold, naked body is discovered by a couple on a jog through the lush woodlands of &lt;b&gt;Pine Valley, California&lt;/b&gt;, new recruit &lt;b&gt;Detective Katie Scott&lt;/b&gt; is stunned to discover the victim is Amanda Payton – a much-loved local nurse and the woman at the heart of an unsolved case she’s been investigating whilst getting a grip on her crippling PTSD. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Weeks earlier, Amanda had run, battered and bruised, out into the headlights of a passing patrol car. She claimed to have just escaped a kidnapping, but with no strong evidence, the case went cold. &lt;b&gt;The Pine Valley police made a fatal mistake… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Katie is certain the marks on Amanda’s wrists complete a pattern of women being taken, held captive and then showing up dead in remote locations around Pine Valley – and she won’t let someone die on her watch again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But then a beautiful office worker with a link to the hospital where Amanda worked goes missing. With only days before the next body is due to show up, &lt;b&gt;can Katie make amends for her past by saving this innocent life?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Totally gripping crime fiction for fans of Lisa Regan, Rachel Caine and Melinda Leigh. Nothing will prepare you for this nail-biting roller-coaster ride…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Your husband’s car crash wasn’t an accident… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddy Shaw&lt;/b&gt; learns the life-shattering news in the most horrific way: live on air. As the shaky phone recording pans over the terrible crash, she recognises her husband Simon’s car in the wreckage… He is critically injured, and she rushes to his side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Rachel Hart&lt;/b&gt; knows how it feels to have a loved one’s life hanging in the balance, and hurries to support her friend. Maddy is distraught about her husband’s accident, and Rachel decides to investigate. It’s not her case, but if she can give her friend answers, she will. But she soon realises Simon didn’t crash because he was distracted, or because a tyre blew. Someone made this happen. Someone who wants Simon dead… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After the discovery of a threatening letter buried in Simon’s diary, Maddy has to ask how well she knew her husband. Then a new victim is found – an old friend of Simon’s, a man he hasn’t seen in years. It seems a dark secret from their past has finally come to light… The killer has a list of targets, and they are dying one by one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rachel must race against time to protect her friend and find the murderer, before another life is taken. But however fast she runs, it seems the killer is always one step ahead. And Maddy must decide if she wants the truth – even if it puts her in the killer’s path… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A twisty and breath-taking thriller for fans of Rachel Abbott, Cara Hunter and Angela Marsons.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Curl up with this completely enchanting winter romance! A stunning festive read about the joy of Christmas with family, second chances, and finding love under the falling snow. Get cozy and keep some tissues on hand. You’re in for a truly magical story…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;White Oaks Inn&lt;/b&gt; has always been at the heart of Christmas celebrations for &lt;b&gt;Scarlett Bailey&lt;/b&gt; and her family. Her adored gran has owned the rambling, old-fashioned hotel, filled with the scent of cinnamon and chocolate, since Scarlett was a little girl. But now her gran’s home is under threat. &lt;b&gt;And it looks like it could be the Baileys’ last Christmas together there…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Over the holiday season, amidst much-loved festive traditions of baking cookies and decorating the tree, Scarlett throws herself into saving the hotel. When she hears that &lt;b&gt;Charlie Bryant&lt;/b&gt;, a handsome, successful property developer, is spending December in Silver Falls, Scarlett is hopeful he might be the answer to their problems. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When they meet, sparks fly between impulsive Scarlett and business-like Charlie – as they both have very different ideas for the future of White Oaks. Scarlett is determined to show him how much White Oaks Inn means to her family and the guests who return there every year and, as they spend more time together, she begins to realize there is more to Charlie than his serious appearance… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Charlie is struggling with a secret from his own past. Will he be able to face it, or will it stop him from truly opening up and getting close to anyone? And can Scarlett share the true meaning of Christmas with him and save her gran’s beloved hotel along the way? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embrace the wonder of Christmas in this gorgeous novel about living for the moment and finding love when you least expect it. &lt;i&gt;Christmas at Silver Falls&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect festive indulgence for fans of Debbie Macomber, Susan Mallery and Sheila Roberts.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

  <description>Discover the bloody end of Mia Corvere's story as internationally best-selling author Jay Kristoff brings The Nevernight Chronicle to its epic conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest games in Godsgrave's history have ended with the most audacious murders in the history of the Itreyan Republic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia Corvere, gladiatii, escaped slave, and infamous assassin, is on the run. Pursued by Blades of the Red Church and soldiers of the Luminatii legion, she may never escape the City of Bridges and Bones alive. Her mentor Mercurio is now in the clutches of her enemies. Her own family wishes her dead. And her nemesis, Consul Julius Scaeva, stands but a breath from total dominance over the Republic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beneath the city, a dark secret awaits. Together with her lover Ashlinn, brother Jonnen, and a mysterious benefactor returned from beyond the veil of death, she must undertake a perilous journey across the Republic, seeking the final answer to the riddle of her life. Truedark approaches. Night is falling on the Republic for perhaps the final time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Mia survive in a world where even daylight must die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York Times and internationally best-selling author Jay Kristoff's writing has been praised by critics and fans alike, and has won many awards, including four Aurealis Awards, an ABIA, and David Gemmell Morningstar and Legend awards.</description>

  <description>Last Christmas, Nina gave away her heart – only to have it broken. But this year, at her family’s cosy café, could she find a second chance at love with someone special under the mistletoe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina Bailey loves Christmas. Except this year she doesn’t. Because it turns out that her husband-to-be has been cheating on her – and her beautiful wedding ceremony in the snow is cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s not really in the mood to be jolly, sing carols, or go anywhere near gingerbread men – in fact, what Nina wants is to avoid the whole thing. So she’s come to stay at her Aunt Dolly’s cosy café to nurse her broken heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina is determined to get through Christmas with no tinsel, no fuss – and definitely no flirting. So when she arrives and meets infuriatingly handsome Ryan Sadler, with his gorgeous forest-green eyes, she is not best pleased. And when Nina overhears him making fun of her, she is furious. (There might have been an incident with a koala onesie and a spilled bottle of milk, but that really wasn’t her fault!) So despite the spark between them, and the fact that he can whip up a fabulous dinner faster than she can say Michelin star, romance and Christmas are off the menu this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Aunt Dolly hasn’t quite got the message, going to great lengths to provide a proper British Christmas for her beloved niece: a true home away from home. With sparkling lights adorning every wall and a tree to equal the Rockefeller Center’s and, yes, mistletoe above every doorway, can Nina resist the magic of Christmas – and stick to her no-romance rule?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heartwarming romantic comedy will have you reaching for eggnog, roasted chestnuts and gingerbread cookies! The perfect festive book to read curled up in front of the fire, for fans of Sue Moorcroft, Holly Martin and Debbie Johnson.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As the cold winter nights draw in, escape to the sleepy town of Wrenwick, where the streets sparkle with snow and a lonely young widow is about to find that true love really can strike twice… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Christmas cheer fills Sparrow Street with excitement, grieving widow Nina is having a hard time. December is always a difficult month to face without her beloved husband Gray, the days feel long and bleak, and to cap it all, she’s just lost her job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when Nina hears that Sparrow Street’s Community Garden, one of Gray’s favourite places, is to be put up for sale she knows she must do something. Filled with purpose, she gathers the residents of Sparrow Street around her to turn the neglected patch of land into a Garden of Memories. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Working with her neighbours, single mum Kelly and eighty-year-old Ada, Nina soon finds that she’s not the only lonely soul on Sparrow Street. And as the community comes together and the garden flourishes, Nina can’t help but be drawn to Irish gardener Colm with his sparkling blue eyes and kind heart, finding herself confiding in him about all her recent troubles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But just as Colm and Nina grow closer and he opens up to her about his own secret loss, Colm’s estranged wife returns from Scotland, wanting to try again. Nina knows she should let the man she’s falling for go – it’s the right thing to do. But what if fate has other plans in store? Will the beautiful garden on Sparrow Street have brought two people together only for Nina’s cautious heart to push them apart? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you love an uplifting, moving love story, then &lt;i&gt;The Garden on Sparrow Street &lt;/i&gt;is the perfect romantic read to curl up with on a winter’s afternoon. Fans of Josie Silver and Carole Matthews will love this book! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers are falling in love with &lt;i&gt;The Garden On Sparrow Street:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A lovely, lovely, book. I picked it up cuddled into my chair and started reading I did not get up for hours. I left my world, entered the town, met the characters, &lt;b&gt;loved every page and was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;sorry to reach the end of this story, say goodbye to all the characters&lt;/b&gt;.’ Netgalley Reviewer, &lt;b&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘This book is a custom-made necessity for those precious afternoons curled up on the sofa with a cup of tea&lt;/b&gt; and that proverbial 'good book'.

  <description>Christmas has arrived in the little village of Happiness, promising snowflakes, hot chocolate and plenty of seasonal romance. So snuggle up and fall in love with the gorgeously cosy new story from the bestselling author of Christmas at Lilac Cottage…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas has always been such an important part of Ruby Marlowe’s life and at a time of year that always holds so many memories, Ruby likes to throw herself into the magic of the season head first. So when she is offered the opportunity to open a year-round Christmas shop in the little village of Happiness it seems like a dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accepting the offer has absolutely nothing to do with sexy Jacob Harrington, the sculptor she had a fling with in the village during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, Jacob is known to love the ladies and has never had a commitment. Ruby, on the other hand, made the ultimate vow of love and suffered heart-wrenching loss in return. She vows she will never be committed to a man again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when fate throws Ruby and Jacob together in this town in the most magical of seasons, will more than snowflakes fall? As the Christmas celebrations get underway and Ruby tries to spread her own Christmas magic over the little village, can love sparkle and come back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A glorious, feel-good romance that’s like a warm hug on a cold winter’s day. An unputdownable festive treat for lovers of Sarah Morgan, Miranda Dickinson and Lucy Diamond.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. &lt;/b&gt;Bayside Summers is a series of standalone steamy romance novels featuring alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, deeply emotional, always passionate, and easy to relate to. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Gavin is about to find out that Harper really does exist⁠—and she's going to knock his socks off! Find out for yourself in USA Today bestseller Bayside Romance! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When screenwriter Harper Garner got a shot at the big-time in LA, she celebrated her brave cross-country move with her first and only one-night stand—connecting so deeply with the sexy, brilliant man, she broke the number-one rule of one-night stands and left her phone number. Not hearing from him was only the first in a long line of hope-shattering, confidence-busting blows. Ten months later, Harper is done with men and done with LA. She pulls up her big-girl panties and heads home to Cape Cod to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the surface, interior designer Gavin Wheeler has it all: a successful business, a loving family, and a close-knit group of friends. But Gavin once endured a heartbreak so painful, he was sure he’d never feel anything for a woman again. A chance encounter at a music festival with a gorgeous, down-to-earth blonde proved him wrong, but when morning came, the woman who made him crave more was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serendipitous evening reunites Harper with her devastatingly delicious one-night stand, and the connection is just as intense as she remembered. Harper’s life is too unsettled for a relationship, but Gavin is determined to help her find her way, especially if it leads straight to his heart. Moonlight conversations lead to steamy kisses, and as romance blooms, it stirs a love too real to deny. But when Gavin’s past collides with the life they’re building, it has the power to ruin everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BAYSIDE SUMMERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Desires&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Passions&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Heat&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Escape&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Romance&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Fantasies&lt;br /&gt;More Bayside books coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"With her wonderful characters and resonating emotions, Melissa Foster is a must-read author!" -NYT Bestseller Julie Kenner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Melissa Foster is synonymous with sexy, swoony, heartfelt romance!" -NYT Bestseller Lauren Blakely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;While each book may be read as a standalone, you might enjoy reading the entire Love in Bloom series.

  <description>When a girl’s body is discovered in a park in the sleepy Massachusetts town of Oakhurst, local detective Jo is shocked to the core. Because the girl is the second innocent victim to turn up dead in three days. And just like the first, a tarot card has been left by the body. The meaning of the card: betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After uncovering a series of threatening messages targeting the girl, a student at the university, and the first victim, her teacher, Jo thinks she’s locked the killer in her crosshairs. The primary suspect is a volatile ex-military student with an axe to grind for failing grades, and the frightened town is out for his blood. But the next day, a much-loved member of the community is found dead in her home, a tarot card in her mail. There’s no clear motive to link her death to the others, and the message on the card this time is even stranger: domestic bliss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a fourth body and card appearing the following day, Jo knows she’s running out of time to crack the code and bring the killer to justice. And the pressure only gets worse with heart-breaking news about Jo’s father forcing her to choose between helping her family heal or the victims’ families get justice. Can Jo find the twisted murderer sending the town into a panic before another life is lost? Or this time, will the dangerous killer find her first?</description>

  <description>She lays her baby in his cot – the sound of his quiet breath filling the nursery as she leaves the room. Soon Claire will be fast asleep herself. She won’t hear the back door opening or the footsteps on the stairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Claire Lucas is woken by her husband asking where their baby son is, she is dazed and confused. When she follows Darren into their child’s bedroom, she hears nothing but silence. No baby cries, no cute gurgles. The only thing left in Finlay’s cot is his beloved teddy bear. Finlay has gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Jessie Blake rushes to the family’s modern home in the rugged Scottish Highlands. She notices that Darren avoids eye contact, and Claire seems disconnected – unable to account for the last few hours of her afternoon. Jessie knows there’s no normal response to losing a child, but something doesn’t feel right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends rally round the young family, as a search of the narrow lanes and green hills of Moncrieffe begins in earnest. And as helpers battle the wild Scottish weather, Jessie is sure that someone in the search party must know more than they’re letting on. Someone must have seen something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a ghost from her own past comes back to haunt her, Jessie must put aside her own personal tragedy to save baby Finlay. Can she get the people of the small town to talk before it’s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love Cara Hunter, LJ Ross and Robert Bryndza, you’ll love this addictive new crime thriller from Kerry Watts. Her Missing Child will have you hooked from the start!</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;No matter how far you go, home is where the heart is...&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beth Williams&lt;/b&gt; hasn’t been home for ten years. After falling pregnant at sixteen, she ran away from the imposing Scottish estate where she grew up rather than risk her family’s disapproval, working hard to build a life for herself and daughter &lt;b&gt;Isabelle &lt;/b&gt;- but now she’s finally returning to Glendale Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Beth tries to mend her broken family ties, and fights to bring the community of Glendale back together, she realises that the story she has told herself for a decade might well be a very different one from the truth. Even though she ran from Glendale it has never left her heart. And, she soon realises, neither has &lt;b&gt;Drew &lt;/b&gt;– Beth’s first love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Beth be able to forgive her mother and grandmother (and herself) for what happened ten years ago? What will Drew say when he discovers the secret she’s been keeping from him for so long? Can a festive trail bring the village back together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Christmas work its magic on Glendale - or will Beth be forced to run away from it all over again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;charming, uplifting novel that will warm your heart – the perfect read to curl&lt;br /&gt;up with this autumn. Fans of Trisha Ashley, Debbie Johnson and Cathy Bramley&lt;br /&gt;will love this gorgeously romantic read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two besties and a baby make for an instafamily and a surprising romance in a delightful series by Melissa Foster, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Sugar Lake novels.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Dalton has always been honest, except where his heart is concerned. He’s been in love with his best friend—saucy, smart-mouthed Aurelia Stark—forever. But Ben’s a planner, and timing has never been on his side. When he finally decides to make his move, Aurelia beats him to the punch with a move of her own—to a different town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurelia loves her new life in the charming town of Harmony Pointe. She has a great apartment and her very own bookstore, and best of all, the sinfully hot, commitment-phobic friend she’s crushed on for years is no longer just around the corner. Maybe she’ll finally be able to leave her unrequited love behind and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a baby is left on Ben’s front porch—a baby that is presumably his—Aurelia is there for him. Neither one knows the first thing about babies, but how hard can it be? Ben and Aurelia are catapulted into a world of love, laughter, and tracking down the baby mama, and it might even add up to a very happily ever after… just not one either of them expects.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One bubbly seasonal decorator. One fiery hockey captain. And a wagon full of gnomes who play matchmaker better than Cupid…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When seasonal stylist Whitney Green heads to a Denver flea market to find gnomes for a client’s upcoming party, she thinks she has hit the jackpot when she discovers a slew of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little does she know that gnomes aren’t going to be the only thing she picks up that Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fate throws Whitney and hockey superstar Gavin Tremblay together, she finds herself questioning her policy of staying on the bench when it comes to romance. She came to the Rockies to escape the pain of a broken heart. Not to date. Especially when she knows she is due to return to Seattle in four months and she can’t figure out what went wrong in her last relationship…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The captain isn’t looking for love, either. Battered and bruised by not only a broken romance but a devastating leg injury, he’s focused on getting his game back. The last time he trusted his heart it gutted him. He refuses to go down that path again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the chemistry between Gavin and Whitney is too hot to deny and falling in love is the only option. However, when personal fears come to the surface and cause problems between them, can a relationship prevail? Or will defense outscore offense in this game of love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Outscored&lt;/i&gt; is a laugh out loud, swoony romance with a good-boy hero and a hilarious heroine. Flamingos, gnomes, and a happily ever after are guaranteed in this book.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>‘She reached into the pram and placed her hands on the cotton blanket. It was still warm. But her smiling, new baby sister, with her wide blue-grey eyes, was gone...’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty five years later, three bodies are found at a ramshackle cottage in the Irish countryside, and Detective Iris Locke is sick to her stomach. The victims are Anna Crowe and her two young children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris has only recently joined the Limerick Murder Squad. Against her father’s advice, she’s working the narrow lanes and green hills of her childhood. Iris still remembers Anna, who was just a small girl when her baby sister was snatched, never to be seen again. It was the one case Iris’ own father never solved, and Iris can’t help but wonder if the two crimes are connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’ll stop at nothing to find Anna justice, but a fire has destroyed almost all the physical evidence, and Limerick is the same small town she remembers: everybody protects their neighbours, and Iris has been away for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Iris unpick the lies beneath the surface of her pretty hometown, and catch the most twisted individual of her career, when reopening the old case means reopening old wounds for her team, the rest of the community, and her own father?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Patricia Gibney, Angela Marsons and L.J. Ross won’t want to miss this – the first book in a gripping and unputdownable new crime series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published as ‘Silent Night’.</description>

  <description>Detective Carrie Flynn has spent twenty years searching for her little sister, who was kidnapped and never found. The worst part for Carrie is that she was with Hattie on that hot summer day. Carrie saw her sister’s abductor, but she was just a little girl herself, and remembers nothing. She will never forgive herself for letting Hattie down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the chance came to join the police force, Carrie didn’t hesitate. She would solve missing person cases and fight for justice – no more families stuck in limbo, no more grieving mothers, no more sisters growing up alone... But now a serial killer is stalking Carrie’s hometown of Manchester: late at night, people are going missing down at the canal. Six years, a dozen disappearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When another victim is taken, Carrie is sure the family is hiding something and she’s determined to find out the secret behind their silence. Why does the mother not want to answer Carrie’s questions? Who is the mysterious girl next door? Carrie knows that to track down the killer, she must find out everything she possibly can about the innocents they have chosen to hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie holds on to one fact: last year, standing by the water, she caught a glimpse of the killer, and the distinctive tattoo on his arm. He slipped through her fingers, but she won’t let it happen again. She’ll never stop searching, for the grieving families, for her belief in justice, and her hope that, one day, something she finds will lead her back to her lost little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can she finally solve the case that has cast a long shadow over her career and will the demons in her own past help her to catch this deadly killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love Val McDermid, Robert Dugoni or Angela Marsons you won’t be able to put down this dark and twisty thriller. J.M. Hewitt will keep you guessing until the very last page.</description>

  <description>Round and round she goes, blonde pigtails flying, her high-pitched giggle catching on the wind. But as the ride slows to a stop, her seat is suddenly empty. Little Lucy is gone…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When seven-year-old Lucy Ross is snatched from the carousel in Denton city park, Detective Josie Quinn joins the frantic search. She’s the one who finds Lucy’s sparkly butterfly backpack abandoned by the ticket booth, a note with a devastating message stuffed inside: answer your phone, or your sweet little darling will die…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, Lucy’s parents are filled with hope when they pick up a call which they think is from their babysitter – but instead it’s a chilling male voice on the line. Josie races to the babysitter’s small apartment only to find her lifeless body in a tangle of sheets on her bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie is faced with the most high-stakes case of her career as each new phone call from someone connected to the family ends with the shocking discovery of another body. This twisted killer wants revenge, and he won’t stop until the Ross family are in pieces…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is telling Josie that Lucy’s parents aren’t giving her the whole truth, but digging deeper into their lives will force her to confront a life-changing secret of her own. Does Josie have what it takes to crack this case? She has no choice if she’s going to bring Lucy home alive…</description>

This morning she’s missing, her unicorn bedcovers are empty, and her parents are frantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DCI Rachel Hart knows that the first few hours after a child goes missing are the most crucial, and that the Baileys are living every parent’s worst nightmare.

But are the holes in their stories because they’re out of their minds with panic – or because they’re lying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel’s convinced that Cassie knew the person who took her, but can she find the little girl before she’s lost forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gripping and unputdownable thriller for fans of Close to Home, The Couple Next Door and Behind Closed Doors.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;The beautiful new story from the bestselling author of The Summer of Chasing Dreams. &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Escape to a little seaside village, where the sea sparkles, the sunshine is guaranteed, and change is in the air. The perfect place to fall in love this summer…&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Willow McKay needs a fresh start. Her recent break-up may not have left her heartbroken, but it’s certainly wounded her pride. Desperate for a change, an advert offering free homes in a picturesque village on the Cornish coast sounds like just what she needs. Without thinking twice Willow packs up her life and heads to the village of Happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Willow arrives, she finds ramshackle cottages, shops lying empty and villagers that seem in need of cheer themselves. It's nothing like the pretty picture the advert had boasted. It seems Happiness was too good to be true. That is until she meets the handsome estate manager Andrew Harrington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His passion for restoring the village to its former glory is contagious and soon they are working together, forming a secret society to bring happiness back to Happiness. And as sparks fly between them Willow can feel herself falling. But Andrew is holding something back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will they succeed in transforming the old village to its original beauty before it’s too late? Can the gift of happiness really save a village, and can it save Willow herself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Get swept away to the sun-kissed Cornish coast with this gorgeous love story, perfect for fans of Jill Mansell, Sophie Kinsella and Katie Fforde.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>A case with no leads.&lt;br /&gt;A victim with no enemies.&lt;br /&gt;A killer with no conscience…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Detective Beth Young is called to investigate a victim with multiple broken bones, nothing prepares her for what she finds. James Sinclair is fighting for his life, and Beth can’t shake the idea that the nature of his injuries suggest someone with a personal grudge against him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But James’s devastated wife Laura insists that her kind, softly-spoken husband is a man with no enemies. She was the one with the fiery temper, but James was so calm, she’d never once managed to provoke even a cross word from him in their eight year marriage. And he was the same with everyone – she can’t name one person who might want to hurt him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she knows virtually no details about her husband’s childhood or his life before he moved to the Lake District as a young man, and Beth feels sure that the key to finding James’s attacker is hidden in the secrets of his past. Who was he really? And what is the significance of the coded messages that Beth finds hidden on his laptop?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then two more bodies are found in one of the deep, picturesque lakes that the area is so famous for, exhibiting similar injuries to the ones James Sinclair suffered. How are they connected? And how many more people are at risk?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beth knows she is in a race against time to hunt a vicious killer who is both elusive and incredibly dangerous. A killer who knows what James did in the past. Who likes to be one step ahead. But who – if they realise they’re being hunted – might come for Beth next…</description>

  <description>In the beautiful village of Chamillon lies the Café Belle Vie, where you’ll always find croissants and friends when you need them the most – and where Elle is hoping to uncover the truth about her past…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty-year-old Elle Matheson has decided it’s finally time to find the mother who gave her up as a baby. With a faded postcard from the Café Belle Vie in hand – one of the very few things she has from her mother – she heads straight to the Île de Ré to begin her search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only the postcard and the ivory shawl she was wrapped in as clues, finding her mum is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, even with the help of friendly – and gorgeous – café-owner Charlie. And since Elle hasn’t exactly told her younger sister what she’s up to, the little white lies about where she is are starting to add up…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Elle is really starting to feel at home on the beautiful island. The locals are welcoming, the café is homely, and Charlie is always there with a helping hand, a listening ear, and a pain au chocolat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Elle about to discover not just where she came from – but where she belongs?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Samantha stumbled out of the party and on to a busy street only ten minutes away from her home. But she never made it home… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seven years after Samantha’s disappearance, on what would have been her thirty-fifth birthday, her best friend Diane is shocked to find a letter addressed to Samantha on her doorstep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Opening the envelope, Diane pulls out a birthday card and a finger nail painted in dusky pink nail polish. The same shade Samantha always wore. The same shade she was wearing the night she went missing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When police analyse the nail, they don’t get the result they expected. Instead of linking them to Samantha, the nail belongs to another woman, Jade Ashmore. And Jade was murdered the night before the envelope was delivered…. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE NEW CRIME THRILLER FROM BEST SELLING AUTHOR CARLA KOVACH – if you love Lisa Gardner, Robert Bryndza or Clare Mackintosh, you’ll love &lt;i&gt;The Liar’s House&lt;/i&gt;.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From Southport to the South of France – this is going to be a summer to remember!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life just got a whole lot more complicated for thirty-eight-year-old single mum Liv. Her son Jake is practically perfect in every way, but he’s started asking some difficult questions, and the answers lie in a holiday romance twenty years ago. Back when Liv was staying with her aunt on the French Riviera… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Returning to the Cote d’Azur, with its white sandy beaches, her supportive aunt, and exquisite wine and cheese is harder than it sounds though. Because – if she’s going to give Jake the answers he needs – Liv knows she has to hunt down her first love Andre. And since she’s a professional baker rather than a professional investigator, she doesn’t even have a clue where to start. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At first, finding the one that got away proves even trickier than she thought. And if she succeeds, how will he take the bombshell secret Liv has been keeping? Liv has to do the best thing for her family, but does that mean closing the door on this very French affair? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A joyful, laugh-out-loud story about second chances, secrets and sunshine! The perfect summer read for fans of Carole Matthews, Jenny Colgan and Sophie Kinsella. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Readers adore Sue Roberts’ escapist reads:  &lt;br /&gt;‘I &lt;b&gt;absolutely LOVED, no make that ADORED reading it&lt;/b&gt;… I was &lt;b&gt;hooked&lt;/b&gt;… I &lt;b&gt;stayed up reading the book until the early hours of the morning&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Ginger Book Geek,&lt;/i&gt; 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A &lt;b&gt;fantastic&lt;/b&gt; story… &lt;b&gt;laugh-out-loud&lt;/b&gt;…&lt;b&gt; I literally flew through the pages&lt;/b&gt;… I loved every minute.’ &lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Fantastic!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stayed up late to finish it&lt;/b&gt;. Great summer read.’ Netgalley reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Absolutely delightful&lt;/b&gt;… so atmospheric &lt;b&gt;I could feel the warmth of the sun and the smell of the fresh pastries baking&lt;/b&gt;… this book will bring a smile to your face.’ &lt;i&gt;It’s All About the Thrill&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;So delightfully funny &lt;/b&gt;that I &lt;b&gt;found myself laughing out loud&lt;/b&gt;… A lovely&lt;b&gt; heart-warming romantic comedy&lt;/b&gt;… Would definitely recommend.’ &lt;i&gt;Stardust Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A &lt;b&gt;laugh-out-loud, feel-good, amazing &lt;/b&gt;book… &lt;b&gt;One of my top reads of the year&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Odyssey Across the Shelves &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Fun, friendship and a Mediterranean setting… &lt;b&gt;I read this in a couple of days &lt;/b&gt;as I found&lt;b&gt; I couldn’t put it down&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads Reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I was enraptured every step of the way…&lt;b&gt; The perfect pick-me-up to bring on those summer vibes&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Stacy Is Reading&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Will warm your heart&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;b&gt;Perfect &lt;/b&gt;for getting you in a&lt;b&gt; summery mood&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;All Things Bookie, &lt;/i&gt;5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I &lt;b&gt;absolutely loved&lt;/b&gt; the story… &lt;b&gt;captivating&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads Reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy &lt;/b&gt;inside… &lt;b&gt;Had all of Sue Roberts’ usual banter and warmth&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;b&gt;A perfect summer read&lt;/b&gt;.</description>

  <description>A totally emotional, gripping page-turner from the bestselling author of The Summer House about the importance of family, re-discovering who you are, and the magic of finding true love under the summer sun. Perfect for fans of Mary Alice Monroe, Nancy Thayer and Susan Mallery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hallie Flynn’s favorite place in the world is her great Aunt Clara’s beautiful beachside house, with its inviting wraparound porch and enchanting views across the sparkling turquoise ocean. For Hallie, going to Firefly Beach, filled with magical memories, feels like coming home, but in one moment Hallie is left broken-hearted when her adored Aunt Clara passes away…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, Aunt Clara has thought of everything. In her last letter she included a bucket list Hallie wrote as a child, for Hallie to complete. Leaving her dead-end job and predictable schedule, Hallie returns to Firefly beach and embraces Aunt Clara’s words. All the time her childhood best friend Ben Murray, with his golden charm and infuriating ability to be right all the time, is by her side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spending the summer with Ben, as they enjoy drinks on the pier and endless talks stretched out in the soft sand, Hallie begins to remember the things that matter most to her. But following the bucket list isn’t an easy journey. It forces her to face the pain of her past as she starts to fall for the person who has been there for her all along...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as her heart is healing, an encounter with a newcomer to the beach town, wealthy and talented photographer Gavin Wilson, leaves her questioning her future and shows her she has to make a difficult decision that could mean losing everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Hallie be able to fulfill Aunt Clara’s last wish and change her life? Or will a secret she’s been keeping destroy her new beginning—and the chance to experience true love?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She began to sing, the girl. Her voice was soft, so soft it was almost of the wind. It was a lullaby. She cradled her arms, rocking them gently back and forth. As if she was holding a baby. But she was not. Her arms were empty.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a cold morning a cyclist finds the brutally-slaughtered body of a woman in her car, on a remote lane leading to the long-abandoned Irish village of Kelly’s Forge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when &lt;b&gt;Detective Finnegan Beck&lt;/b&gt; arrives from the nearby town of Cross Beg to investigate he notices there’s a baby’s seat in the back of the car. A bottle of baby’s milk lying in the footwell. And no child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Little Róisín isn’t the first child to go missing&lt;/b&gt; from that same remote location though. &lt;b&gt;There was another baby girl, taken more than fifty years before, who was never found.&lt;/b&gt; Has too much time passed for there to be a connection, or does something – or someone – link these two crimes? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beck claims he does not want to stay in Cross Beg. His heart is back in Dublin, with the woman he loves. But, knowing that a child’s life depends on him changes things. He knows he has to find the missing baby girl. Because if he doesn’t, he fears there’s a chance everyone will give up the baby for dead, just like they did before… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This dark, twisted page turner will keep you up all night. Perfect for fans of LJ Ross, Patricia Gibney, and Rachel Caine.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Readers are loving Michael Scanlon:  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Gripping&lt;/b&gt;... Keeps you guessing till the end... &lt;b&gt;Unrelenting pace... excellent writing...&lt;/b&gt; The needle of suspicion keeps moving from one suspect to another... &lt;b&gt;If you loved the detective series of Harry Bosch or Cormoran Strike, you will enjoy this one&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;A page-turning, don't-put-it-down, yes-you-will-be-up-all-night kind of read&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;b&gt;amazing!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;SPW Writes&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Cracking&lt;/b&gt;... &lt;b&gt;made me tear through the pages&lt;/b&gt;...

What an amazing and thrilling story!!!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Started with a bang and just kept going!&lt;/b&gt; The twists kept coming... &lt;b&gt;I couldn't put it down&lt;/b&gt;. I cannot wait to read more from this author!’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Tense, powerful and emotional... &lt;b&gt;gripped my attention from the very first page&lt;/b&gt; and I couldn’t tear my eyes away... &lt;b&gt;fantastic&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Stardust Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Crikey, I wasn't expecting the bad guy to be HIM!&lt;/b&gt; ... I was pulled into the story from the very beginning and every time I had to put the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again... &lt;b&gt;All the stars from me &lt;/b&gt;and looking forward to the rest of the series.’ Rona Halsall, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I have never, ever read a whole book in one day… until now&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Booked Up Girl&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Bloody brilliant&lt;/b&gt;... Oh my goodness me... &lt;b&gt;One seriously, fantastically and brilliantly written book&lt;/b&gt; with cracking characters and cracking storylines. &lt;b&gt;I was hooked&lt;/b&gt; on this book from the first moment &lt;b&gt;Simply unputdownable&lt;/b&gt;...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Escape to the daisy-strewn windswept Dorset cliffs, to the donkey sanctuary at Sweet Briar Farm, where Hattie Rose is about to find, that in this world, the most unlikely opposites can sometimes attract …&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hattie was once thrilled to call the beautiful city of Paris her home. But when her heart is broken by her boyfriend and she loses her dream job, she bids farewell to the city of love and hurries home to Gillypuddle, a sleepy village on the Dorset coast. But as she returns home she finds her parents struggling to cope with a terrible family tragedy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a desperate search for a new start, Hattie takes a job at the donkey sanctuary nearby on Sweet Briar Farm where Jo, the taciturn owner, certainly loves her animals far more than humans. Hattie can’t help but fall in love with the donkeys (and the opportunity to get close to dreamy Canadian vet Seth) but Jo is harder to get to know and when she finds her boss sobbing in her sleep one stormy night, she knows that her new friend is hiding a dark secret. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And when handsome newspaper reporter Owen does some digging into Jo’s past he finds something that connects her to Hattie on a whole new level. Can Hattie trust what Owen says, especially when he seems intent on standing in the way of her blossoming romance with Seth? And can Hattie help Jo to start healing and the donkeys of Sweet Briar Farm? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A beautiful story that will melt the hardest of hearts. If you love Jenny Colgan, Lucy Diamond and Josie Silver you will be enchanted by this life-affirming read that reminds you that home is wherever the people you love are. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers can’t resist Tilly Tennant’s writing: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;An absolute gem&lt;/b&gt;! … Spellbinding! … totally addictive reading … an enchanting tale that will &lt;b&gt;fill you full of emotions and set your pulse racing … truly amazing’&lt;/b&gt; Goodreads Reviewer, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Absolutely stunning … you instantly get drawn into the story … &lt;b&gt;I couldn't put it down.&lt;/b&gt; It's heart-warming and will &lt;b&gt;leave you with that warm fuzzy feeling&lt;/b&gt;. A beautiful novel!’ &lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, 5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I was hooked … I just love it …&lt;/b&gt; Gave me a warm feeling inside and it’s full of heart, passion and love, just perfect!’ &lt;i&gt;Simona’s Corner of Dreams&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Bloody brilliant &lt;/b&gt;… I loved being back with the characters … Oh I just enjoyed everything about it!’ &lt;b&gt;5 Stars&lt;/b&gt; – &lt;i&gt;I Love Reading&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I loved every minute of it …&lt;b&gt; I was glued to my Kindle for a few days that's for sure! &lt;/b&gt;... A really brilliant read that will leave you hooked even after a few pages’ &lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I absolutely loved it.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I live for the dream that my children will be born free," she says. "That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I live for you," I say sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eo kisses my cheek. "Then you must live for more."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.</description>

Can Millie prove to Bell that life online isn’t always what it appears to be?

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I’ve been chased my whole life. As a fugitive refugee in the territory controlled by the tyrannical Mercer corporation, I’ve always had to hide who I am. Until I found Excalibur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I’m done hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is Ari Helix. I have a magic sword, a cranky wizard, and a revolution to start.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ari crash-lands on Old Earth and pulls a magic sword from its ancient resting place, she is revealed to be the newest reincarnation of King Arthur. Then she meets Merlin, who has aged backward over the centuries into a teenager, and together they must break the curse that keeps Arthur coming back. Their quest? Defeat the cruel, oppressive government and bring peace and equality to all humankind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pressure.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;He looked down at the little girl, sleeping peacefully, her arms wrapped around a teddy bear. He knew he was the only one who could save her. He could let her sleep forever. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eight-year-old girl, Chelsea Compton, is missing in Pine Valley, California and for Detective Katie Scott it’s a cruel reminder of the friend who disappeared from summer camp twenty years ago. Unable to shake the memories, Katie vows she won’t rest until she discovers what happened to Chelsea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Katie starts to investigate, the case reveals itself to be much bigger and more shocking than she feared. Hidden deep in the forest she unearths a makeshift cemetery: a row of graves, each with a brightly coloured teddy bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie links the graves to a stack of missing-persons cases involving young girls—finding a pattern no one else has managed to see. Someone in Pine Valley has been taking the town’s daughters for years, and Katie is the only one who can stop them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then another little girl goes missing, snatched from the park near her home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie’s still haunted by the friend she failed to protect, and she’ll do anything to stop the killer striking again—but can she find the little girl before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Join Angela and Jenny in the series finale of the bestselling I Heart books, on the balmy beaches of Hawaii.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Angela Clark’s best friend Jenny invites her to join a press trip to Hawaii, three days of sun, sea and sleep sounds like the perfect antidote to her crazed life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At work in New York, she’s supposed to be the face of Having It All. But the only thing Angela feels she excels at is hiding in the printer cupboard, eating Mini Cheddars and watching Netflix on her phone and if this is living the dream, she's more than ready to wake up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A few days away with Jenny sounds like exactly what she needs but Angela’s talent for getting into a scrape guarantees nothing goes to plan – and not even the most beautiful beaches, blue skies and daiquiris will get her off the hook…</description>

  <description>When Jeanine Hammond is found dead in a hotel in the picture-perfect town of Oakhust, newly-promoted Detective Jo Fournier is thrown into a disturbing case. Who would murder this shy, loving wife and leave her body posed like a ballerina?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo wants to know why Jeanine’s husband is so controlling about money, and where Jeanine’s wedding ring is, but before she and her team can get close to the truth, another woman is found strangled in a hotel, arms placed gracefully above her head like a dancer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While digging through old case files, Jo makes a terrifying link to a series of cold cases: each victim bears the same strangulation marks. But the FBI won’t take Jo seriously, and if she disobeys direct orders by investigating the killings outside of her jurisdiction, it will mean the end of the career she’s already sacrificed so much for, even her relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Jo is beginning to lose hope, she finds messages on the victims’ computers that make her question whether these small-town women were hiding big lies. Jo thinks this is the missing link between the victims, but she knows the killer is moments away from selecting his next victim. Will it lead her to the most twisted killer of her career in time, or will another innocent life be lost? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolutely unputdownable and brilliant new crime thriller series that fans of Robert Dugoni, Lisa Regan and Melinda Leigh will devour in one sitting.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modern princess. A charming commoner. Can they hurdle tradition to find true love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Elizabeth “Liz” of York isn’t interested in a fairy tale life. Determined to use her elite platform to champion children’s causes, she’d much rather raise awareness than find her prince. If only she could stop picturing one certain gardener with vivid hazel eyes…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the relentless paparazzi invade her space, Liz’s crush comes to her rescue and steals her heart. Tossing aside centuries of tradition for something real, she takes Roman’s calloused hand and braces for the backlash. But after her progressive approach ruffles, more than a few feathers, one member of the monarchy vows to keep the princess locked in her stylish but decidedly ivory tower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Liz break through her birthright to find a powerful kind of love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Princess Pose&lt;/em&gt; is the second standalone book in the charming Modern Royals romantic comedy series. If you like strong heroines, determined love, and lots of laughs, then you’ll adore Aven Ellis’s sweet tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description> Step inside Rachel's Pudding Pantry, a place where love, laughter and scrumptious bakes bring everyone together.  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Pre-order the gorgeous new novel from Caroline Roberts, the Kindle bestselling author of the ‘Cosy Teashop’ series.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primrose Farm is Rachel’s very own slice of heaven. Come rain or shine there’s always a pot of tea brewing by the Aga, the delicious aroma of freshly baked puddings, and a chorus of happy memories drifting through the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the farm is in a spot of trouble. As the daffodils spring, Rachel must plant the seeds of change if she wants to keep the farm afloat, and it’s all resting on a crazy plan. She’ll need one family cook book, her Mum Jill’s baking magic – and a reason to avoid her distractingly gorgeous neighbour, Tom . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Swapping their wellies for aprons, can Rachel and Jill bake their way into a brighter future? The proof will be in the pudding!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In Katy’s opinion, weddings should follow some basic rules:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) No-one should ever have sex. Of course. The married couple has the rest of their lives for that, and the guests should be too busy partying. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) If you are heavily pregnant (as Katy is) you should obviously &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; be invited to three weddings in the space of one summer. Your husband’s accident-prone best friend, your attention-seeking colleague, your 73-year-old mother’s marriage to her Spanish toy boy – all without even an alcoholic drink to make them bearable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3) During the speeches, it should &lt;b&gt;not &lt;/b&gt;be revealed that you had a secret one-night-stand with one of the other guests. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4) Instead of laying bets on the length of the best man’s speech, guests should &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; be laying bets on whether a marriage will be in ruins before the end of the meal… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But this summer, Katy is lucky enough to be the special guest at the weddings that break ALL of the rules. What could possibly go wrong? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the no. 1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;No-one Ever Has Sex on a Tuesday&lt;/i&gt;, this book will make you laugh until you cry. Perfect for fans of Nick Spalding, Marian Keyes and Gill Sims.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Readers love Tracy Bloom!  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I absolutely loved it, I laughed my head off at so many parts it is soooo hilarious!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Jessica's Book Biz&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Laugh-out-loud moments throughout&lt;/b&gt;... worth the read just for the giggles.’ &lt;i&gt;Carrie's Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Hilarious, I constantly laughed out loud&lt;/b&gt;… Great fun and highly recommended.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A great book full of lots of &lt;b&gt;hilarious&lt;/b&gt; moments.’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A fun, crazy holiday read.’ &lt;i&gt;Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I loved it!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘There are so many &lt;b&gt;laugh-out-loud&lt;/b&gt; moments right the way throughout the book that keep you hooked and make the book so easy to read.’ &lt;i&gt;Jessica's Book Biz&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I've had a goofy grin on my face for the whole of this book.

  <description>Things haven’t always been straightforward in Poppy’s life but her dreams are finally within her reach.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She's moving into a cottage in beautiful Nightingale Square, close to the local community garden, where she can indulge her passion for making preserves and pickles. She may not have the best relationship with her family but she is surrounded by loving friends, and feels sure that even her grumpy new neighbour, Jacob, has more to him than his steely exterior belies.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the unexpected arrival of Poppy's troubled younger brother soon threatens her new-found happiness and as the garden team works together to win community space of the year, Poppy must decide where her priorities lie and what she is prepared to fight for …</description>

  <description>"Make sure you have all night, because once you start you won't want to stop reading. Every book's a winner!" New York Times Bestselling Author Brenda Novak &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contemporary romance boxed set includes 3 full length LOVE IN BLOOM: THE REMINGTONS novels: &lt;br /&gt;GAME OF LOVE, Bk 1 &lt;br /&gt;STROKE OF LOVE, Bk 2 &lt;br /&gt;FLAMES OF LOVE, Bk 3 &lt;br /&gt;Sneak Peek, SLOPE OF LOVE &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;GAME OF LOVE... &lt;br /&gt;Ellie Parker is a master at building walls around her heart. In the twenty-five years she's been alive, Dex Remington has been the only person who has always believed in her and been there for her. But four years earlier, she came to Dex seeking comfort and then disappeared like a thief in the night, leaving him a broken man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dex Remington is one of the top PC game developers in the United States. He's handsome, smart, and numb. So damn numb that he's not sure he'll ever find a reason to feel again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chance encounter sparks intense desires in Ellie and Dex. Desires that make her want to run--and make him want to feel. A combination of lust and fear leads these young lovers down a dangerous path. Is it possible to cross a burned bridge, or are they destined to be apart forever? &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;STROKE OF LOVE &lt;br /&gt;Kate Paletto runs a volunteer program in Belize for Artists for International Aid, where she deals with self-centered artists who use the program as a means to repair their marred reputations. She loves the country, the people, and what AIA stands for, but too many diva volunteers have turned her off to press-seeking celebrities altogether and left her questioning the value of the volunteer program. When she meets incredibly handsome and charming Sage, he stirs emotions she hasn't felt for ages, even though he represents the things she despises. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laid-back artist Sage Remington escapes his wealthy lifestyle in the Big Apple for a two-week journey of self-discovery to figure out how a guy who has so much can feel so empty. When he meets ultra-organized Kate, who lives her life the way he's always dreamed of living his, the attraction is too hot to ignore, but Sage is there to figure out what's missing in his life, not to find a woman. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every look, and every late-night chat in the romantic jungle brings them closer together, but Sage can barely think past stripping away Kate's misconceptions about him. Kate fights him every step of the way--even though she finds it hard to ignore the strikingly handsome, generous-to-a-fault artist who wants to do nothing more than right the wrongs of the world--and love her to the ends of the earth. &lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;IN FLAMES OF LOVE... &lt;br /&gt;As one of New York's Finest, firefighter Cash Ryder is always prepared. When a woman's car skids off the side of a mountain during a snowstorm, he's there to rescue her. Cash is totally focused on the woman's well-being, but within minutes of getting her to safety, he realizes that he's nowhere near prepared for the heat that rolls off of sensual, smart-mouthed, and stubborn Siena Remington. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a model, Siena Remington has dated some of the wealthiest, most handsome men in the industry, and she's made peace with the idea that most men are just looking for eye candy and they wouldn't know how to romance a woman to save their lives. When she's rescued by a tall, handsome stranger, she thinks that maybe, just maybe, she's found her own real-life romantic fairy tale--until he opens his mouth and everything that comes out is gruff, ornery, and aggravatingly sexy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together during an annual firehouse calendar photo shoot, the passion between Cash and Siena sizzles, and neither one knows how to control the flames. After an evening of verbal sparring followed by a sinfully sensual night, their darkest secrets are revealed--and so is Cash's warm, romantic heart. But Siena's secret might be too much for big, strong, always-prepared Cash to handle--and Siena is forced to choose between a man who's everything she's ever dreamed of and an opportunity of a lifetime.</description>

  <description>Every year for the past fifty-four years, the residents of Pinsbury Port receive a mysterious letter inviting all eligible-aged boys to compete for an esteemed scholarship to the all-male Stemwick University. Every year, the poorer residents look to see that their names are on the list. The wealthier look to see how likely their sons are to survive. And Rhen Tellur opens it to see if she can derive which substances the ink and parchment are created from, using her father’s microscope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the province of Caldon, where women are trained in wifely duties and men are encouraged into collegiate education, sixteen-year-old Rhen Tellur wants nothing more than to become a scientist. As the poor of her seaside town fall prey to a deadly disease, she and her father work desperately to find a cure. But when her Mum succumbs to it as well? Rhen decides to take the future into her own hands—through the annual all-male scholarship competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her cousin, Seleni, by her side, the girls don disguises and enter Mr. Holm’s labyrinth, to best the boys and claim the scholarship prize. Except not everyone’s ready for a girl who doesn’t know her place. And not everyone survives the maze.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She’s taking her life back, one step at a time…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grace&lt;/b&gt; thought she had it all. Living in the beautiful village of Little Ollington, along with head teacher husband &lt;b&gt;Mark&lt;/b&gt; and gorgeous son, &lt;b&gt;Archie&lt;/b&gt;, she devoted herself to being the perfect mum and the perfect wife, her little family giving her everything she ever wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until that fateful day when she walked in on Mark kissing his secretary - and her perfect life fell apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now she's a single mum to Archie, trying to find her way in life and keep things together for his sake. Saturday nights consist of a Chinese takeaway eaten in front of the TV clad in greying pyjamas, and she can’t remember the last time she had a kiss from anyone aside from her dog, &lt;b&gt;Becks&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Grace’s life needs a shake up – fast. So when gorgeous gardener &lt;b&gt;Vinnie&lt;/b&gt; turns up on her doorstep, his twinkling eyes suggesting that he might be interested in more than just her conifers, she might just have found the answer to her prayers. But as Grace falls deeper for Vinnie, ten-year-old Archie fears that his mum finding love means she’ll never reconcile with the dad he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when ex-husband Mark begs her for another chance, telling her he’s changed from the man that broke her heart, Grace finds herself with an impossible dilemma. Should she take back Mark and reunite the family that Archie loves? Or risk it all for a new chance of happiness? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A funny, feel good romance about finding your own path and changing your life for the better – readers of Cathy Bramley, Jill Mansell and Josie Silver will love this uplifting read. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. Bayside Summers is a series of standalone steamy romance novels featuring alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, deeply emotional, always passionate, and easy to relate to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**BAYSIDE ESCAPE is a &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold on to your hat for Violet's wildly hot love story! Lizza is up to her old tricks again, and Violet is in for the surprise of a lifetime! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago Violet Vancroft was a nomadic artist who never wanted to put down roots and Andre Shaw was a prominent Boston physician whose roots ran too deep to unearth. Their love didn't stand a chance-or at least that's what Violet believed when she received a plea for help from the sister she'd never really known-so she snuck away like a thief in the night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Andre travels the world setting up new medical clinics, and Violet has finally found the family she'd always craved and the roots she'd never known she wanted. When their paths cross unexpectedly, it's not the reunion either one imagined. But they've never stopped loving each other, and after the dust of anger and hurt settles, passion ignites even hotter than before. As the end to Andre's time at the Cape nears, reality sets in, leaving them no closer to a future than they were before. Violet and Andre are forced to dig deep to discover if they're destined to live apart forever or if true love really can conquer all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAYSIDE SUMMERS&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Desires&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Passions&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Heat&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Escape&lt;br /&gt;More Bayside books coming soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"​With her wonderful characters and resonating emotions, Melissa Foster is a must-read author!" -NYT Bestseller Julie Kenner​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Melissa Foster is synonymous with sexy, swoony, heartfelt romance!" -NYT Bestseller Lauren Blakely​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster. While each book may be read as a standalone, you might enjoy reading the entire Love in Bloom series. Characters from each sub-series appear in future books. Visit Melissa's website for family trees, series checklists, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Binge read the rest of the Love in Bloom series. Filled with heat, humor, and heart--and always a happily ever after--these steamy romances are perfect beach reads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SNOW SISTERS&lt;br /&gt;Sisters in Love&lt;br /&gt;Sisters in Bloom&lt;br /&gt;Sisters in White&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS (Weston, CO)&lt;br /&gt;Lovers at Heart, Reimagined&lt;br /&gt;Destined for Love &lt;br /&gt;Friendship on Fire &lt;br /&gt;Sea of Love&lt;br /&gt;Bursting with Love &lt;br /&gt;Hearts at Play&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS (Trusty, CO)&lt;br /&gt;Taken by Love &lt;br /&gt;Fated for Love &lt;br /&gt;Romancing My Love &lt;br /&gt;Flirting with Love &lt;br /&gt;Dreaming of Love &lt;br /&gt;Crashing into Love &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS (Peaceful Harbor, MD)&lt;br /&gt;Healed by Love &lt;br /&gt;Surrender My Love &lt;br /&gt;River of Love &lt;br /&gt;Crushing on Love &lt;br /&gt;Whisper of Love &lt;br /&gt;Thrill of Love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADEN WORLD NOVELLAS&lt;br /&gt;Promise My Love&lt;br /&gt;Story of Love&lt;br /&gt;Our New Love&lt;br /&gt;Daring Her Love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE REMINGTONS&lt;br /&gt;Game of Love &lt;br /&gt;Stroke of Love &lt;br /&gt;Flames of Love &lt;br /&gt;Slope of Love &lt;br /&gt;Read, Write, Love &lt;br /&gt;Touched by Love&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEASIDE SUMMERS&lt;br /&gt;Seaside Dreams &lt;br /&gt;Seaside Hearts &lt;br /&gt;Seaside Sunsets&lt;br /&gt;Seaside Secrets &lt;br /&gt;Seaside Nights&lt;br /&gt;Seaside Embrace &lt;br /&gt;Seaside Lovers &lt;br /&gt;Seaside Whispers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RYDERS&lt;br /&gt;Seized by Love&lt;br /&gt;Claimed by Love&lt;br /&gt;Chased by Love&lt;br /&gt;Rescued by Love&lt;br /&gt;Swept Into Love</description>

  <description>The year is 2380, and the graduating cadets of Aurora Academy are being assigned their first missions. Star pupil Tyler Jones is ready to recruit the squad of his dreams, but his own boneheaded heroism sees him stuck with the dregs nobody else in the Academy would touch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cocky diplomat with a black belt in sarcasm&lt;br /&gt;A sociopath scientist with a fondness for shooting her bunkmates&lt;br /&gt;A smart-ass tech-whiz with the galaxy’s biggest chip on his shoulder&lt;br /&gt;An alien warrior with anger management issues&lt;br /&gt;A tomboy pilot who’s totally not into her squad leader, in case you were wondering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Ty’s squad isn’t even his biggest problem—that’d be Aurora Jie-Lin O’Malley, the girl he’s just rescued from interdimensional space. Trapped in cryo-sleep for two centuries, Auri is a girl out of time and out of her depth. But she could be the catalyst that starts a war millions of years in the making, and Tyler’s squad of losers, discipline-cases and misfits might just be the last hope for the entire galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody panic.</description>

  <description>What if you were the missing piece in one of the world’s most epic legends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being an art history student, Summer isn’t thrilled to be stuck with her archeologist family all summer in Greece. While the rest of her college friends are posting a million selfies by the pool together, Summer is stuck alone, trying to entertain herself alone in a place where she doesn’t even speak the language. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon her arrival to Greece, strange dreams and even stranger shadows seem to haunt Summer, leaving her to ponder the meaning of pomegranate seeds and twisted, darkened faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, her stay abroad leads to tragic twists, leaving Summer in the arms of a dark stranger, who claims to be the god, Hades, whom she feels like she knows from another life. In a whirlwind through the busy streets of Athens, Summer is seduced to the lowest point of Greece where Hades’ lair awaits…the Underworld. Determined to find out who she is and where she belongs in an age-old myth, Summer joins Hades to discover that the secrets about her past life are beyond anything she could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A joyously romantic, feel-good summer read that will make you laugh, cry and fall in love. Eva Blue is about to go on a trip of a lifetime, but one adventure she didn't count on was falling in love...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva is quite content with her life in London. In her job as a cover designer, she works at home, and often in her cosy pyjamas. She's happy to stay in her safe little world and not explore much outside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is the opposite of her mum, a free spirit who craved finding adventure and thrills in all corners of the world. But on the day her mum’s will is finalised, Eva finds a list of all the dreams her mum wanted to achieve in her life. Things she never did because she fell pregnant with Eva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva decides these dreams will not go unfulfilled — she is going to be brave and complete them for her mum. As Eva has no experience travelling the world, she hires a guide to go with her on this holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous but rude Thor Anderson is not the person she would choose to accompany her on this journey, but somehow she gets stuck with him. As they discover the world together Eva starts to think he might not be as bad as she first thought. She is swept away by Thor's kindness and mischievous sense of humour. But will it be a simple holiday romance or could this wonderful adventure lead to so much more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stunning new story from the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Cottage on Sunshine Beach&lt;/i&gt;. Discover an unforgettable romance this summer. If you enjoy reading Sarah Morgan, Miranda Dickinson and Jill Mansell, this book is for you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The sky is cornflower blue, the air is scented with the smell of fresh apple blossom and Lizzie Lovell can’t wait to start her new life in the mill on Magnolia Lane. But is she just about to fall in love with someone she shouldn’t? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Lizzie loses her larger-than-life Dad she doesn’t know how to move forward. Encouraged by a childhood dream she shared with her beloved father, she is determined to continue his legacy and moves to the old Mill on Magnolia lane, a place he had always longed to own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Restoring the old windmill is a much bigger job than Lizzie bargained for, especially when she is distracted by her new next door neighbour Jude, who has temptingly twinkly eyes and a body to die for. But when Jude’s ex- girlfriend Harriet arrives back on the scene, Lizzie begins to wonder if life wasn’t far simpler before she moved to the mill. Especially when it emerges that Harriet knows something about Jude’s past, something that could shatter her new start and her heart into smithereens … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If your heart is warmed by Jenny Colgan, Lucy Diamond and Josie Silver’s &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt;, you’ll fall in love with this beautiful feel-good story about finding love when you least expect it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about Tilly Tennant’s books: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;An absolute gem&lt;/b&gt;! … Spellbinding! … totally addictive reading … an enchanting tale that will &lt;b&gt;fill you full of emotions and set your pulse racing … truly amazing’&lt;/b&gt; Goodreads Reviewer, &lt;b&gt;5 stars&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Absolutely stunning … you instantly get drawn into the story … &lt;b&gt;I couldn't put it down.&lt;/b&gt; It's heart-warming and will &lt;b&gt;leave you with that warm fuzzy feeling&lt;/b&gt;.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;On the beautiful French coast lies the Café Belle Vie, a peaceful haven offering a warm welcome and delicious pains au chocolat – and where Natalie’s quiet life is about to be turned upside down…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When thirty-one-year-old &lt;b&gt;Natalie Bright&lt;/b&gt;’s boyfriend dumps her and immediately gets engaged to his ex-girlfriend, she escapes her heartbreak and moves to the charming village of Chamillon on the Île de Ré. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s determined to build a new life there: writing about farmer’s markets for a local magazine, exploring the local vineyards on her bike, and taking advantage of the sunshine. And in the &lt;b&gt;Café Belle Vie&lt;/b&gt; she finds a bustling community – including new best friend Charlie – and a near-constant supply of cakes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, things are looking pretty good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when a blast from the past – her teenage crush &lt;b&gt;Jay Merino&lt;/b&gt; – suddenly turns up in Chamillon, Natalie’s thrown. She’s sworn off men ever since she moved to France, but she and Jay have a connection that stretches back years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But could taking a chance on an old flame complete her new life – or ruin everything she’s worked so hard for? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gorgeous rom com full of sunshine, croissants and sparkling romance!

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The woman’s limbs were so thin; the skin on her arms as translucent as tracing paper. Around her neck lay a faint string of purple bruises. In one so frail, darker, angrier marks might be expected but Beth knew the bruising would have stopped the moment her heart stopped beating.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a walker finds &lt;b&gt;the body of a woman by the shores of Ullswater Lake&lt;/b&gt;, the police are put on high alert. Felicia Evans was known to be a tough character, but who would have strangled her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Beth Young quickly spots the links to three cold cases&lt;/b&gt;. Three women strangled and discarded in the stunning, wild hills of the Lake District. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;As Beth begins tracking down witnesses, the team receives an anonymous letter claiming the charming mayor of Carlisle is behind the murders. &lt;/b&gt;There’s pressure from the top to clear his name. But Beth is determined to find the truth no matter whose feathers she ruffles in the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beth knows the clock is ticking. The killer is hunting again. And &lt;b&gt;it’s down to&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;her to find who’s responsible before another woman becomes his prey…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gripping edge-of-your-seat thriller from bestselling author Graham Smith, perfect for fans of Joy Ellis, LJ Ross, and J.R. Ellis. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What readers are saying about Graham Smith:  &lt;br /&gt;‘I devoured this book, &lt;b&gt;such a page-turner!&lt;/b&gt; If a crime has me still debating 'whodunnit' right up to the very end then I'm a happy reader!... &lt;b&gt;I can't recommend this highly enough – fast-paced and gripping&lt;/b&gt; and literally kept me wanting more.’ Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I was absolutely gripped&lt;/b&gt;… A sophisticated and gripping read that &lt;b&gt;will send your heart racing&lt;/b&gt;. This is an author who knows exactly what a crime fan expects from a book and he delivers every time. &lt;b&gt;A thrilling and twisted read&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;By the Letter Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Packed a punch of thrills and chills&lt;/b&gt;… [A] remarkable read that &lt;b&gt;captures the mind in a vice grip&lt;/b&gt; and refuses to let it go.’ Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Twisted and gruesome. &lt;/b&gt;And brilliant… Hugely atmospheric… The action is full on, and the story is full of tension&lt;b&gt; – my nerves were shredded!&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Suze Reviews&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Wow is all I can say. &lt;/b&gt;I read this on the train and nearly missed my station… &lt;b&gt;A twisty, turny, fast-paced thriller&lt;/b&gt; which has a lot going for it. More please.’ Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Chillingly disturbing&lt;/b&gt;… Just when you think you may have it figured out… You don’t… &lt;b&gt;If you like a good police procedural serial killer mystery…. this is the one for you.&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads reviewer &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Compulsive, atmospheric and &lt;b&gt;relentlessly gripping!&lt;/b&gt;’ Craig Russell &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Ohh I really enjoyed this book so much, &lt;b&gt;the plot was exceptionally good&lt;/b&gt;, very gruesome and &lt;b&gt;totally addictive&lt;/b&gt;.’ Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Original, and compelling… A great book, &lt;b&gt;just stunning&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Nigel Adams Bookworm&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars</description>

  <description>Fall in love with Graham Braden and Morgyn Montgomery in TRAILS OF LOVE. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Graham Braden travels to Oak Falls, Virginia to attend the wedding of his buddy Reed Cross to Grace Montgomery, he sticks around to help with renovations to Reed’s new theater. The last thing he expects is to be asked to assess and possibly invest in Grace’s sister Morgan’s business endeavor. Graham is a careful, keen businessman, and Morgyn is impulsive, disorganized, and more interested in the energy flow in her eclectic retail shop than in the accuracy of her records. While Graham isn’t ready to open his pockets to the sassy, sexy business owner, he may be ready to open his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bradens &amp;amp; Montgomerys are part of Melissa's Love in Bloom big-family romance collection. All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone and may also be enjoyed as part of the larger series, so dive right into this fun, sexy romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls). Order of future books is subject to change. &lt;br /&gt;Embracing Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;Anything For Love&lt;br /&gt;Trails of Love&lt;br /&gt;Our Wicked Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Searching for Love&lt;br /&gt;Wild Crazy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Summer of Love&lt;br /&gt;Hot For Love&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Sexy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Winter of Love&lt;br /&gt;Claiming Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note that future books in the original Montgomery series are crossing over to the Bradens at Pleasant Hill, and for this reason I have combined the series into THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls).</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A laugh out loud, feel good romantic comedy about surviving love, life and parenting one gin at a time!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5am. It’s still dark outside.&lt;br /&gt;Hit snooze, hit snooze again.&lt;br /&gt;But it’s not the alarm, it’s the kids.&lt;br /&gt;They’re dressing the cat up in a purple tutu.&lt;br /&gt;And I’m hiding in the bathroom, messaging HELP to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may be more slummy mummys than yummy mummys, but we’re in it together, taking on motherhood one day at a time. But with hot single dads, PTA pressure and kids who are determined to drive us round the twist, can we really survive the new school year?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hilarious, feel-good story for every parent who has ever struggled bleary-eyed through toddler tantrums, school fancy dress fails and found friendship over wine and cake. Perfect for fans of The UnMumsy Mum, Why Mummy Drinks and Fiona Gibson.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One sunny August afternoon, the residents of Cedar Close throw their annual summer barbecue. Children play in the cherry-tree lined street, tables are laden with food, and the wine is flowing. For Laurie Mills, it’s her first time meeting the neighbours. And it’s the first time she discovers her husband Robert is having an affair.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cedar Close has always been a nice place to live – a quiet suburban street where everyone looks out for one another and bad things don’t happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until late one evening, when Robert Mills is found dead in his bedroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Downstairs, in their beautiful kitchen, his wife Laurie sits alone in the dark with her head in her hands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She can’t remember the last few hours, but she knows she didn’t kill Robert. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trouble is, no-one believes her… &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Nikolai Lantsov has always had a gift for the impossible. No one knows what he endured in his country’s bloody civil war—and he intends to keep it that way. Now, as enemies gather at his weakened borders, the young king must find a way to refill Ravka’s coffers, forge new alliances, and stop a rising threat to the once-great Grisha Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet with every day a dark magic within him grows stronger, threatening to destroy all he has built. With the help of a young monk and a legendary Grisha Squaller, Nikolai will journey to the places in Ravka where the deepest magic survives to vanquish the terrible legacy inside him. He will risk everything to save his country and himself. But some secrets aren’t meant to stay buried—and some wounds aren’t meant to heal.</description>

  <description>In a town full of liars, who can you trust?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Detective Finnegan Beck is demoted from his high-powered job in Dublin and relocated in disgrace to the small Irish town of Cross Beg, he predicts boredom will be his biggest threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then a beautiful, local teenage girl is found strangled in the cold, dark woods a mile from town. The prime suspect is the seemingly-gentle drifter who found Tanya’s body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beck seems to be the only person who can’t escape the feeling that Tanya wasn’t killed at random. As he digs deeper into the shadows of Cross Beg, he begins to realise it isn’t the sleepy backwater he’d first believed. Everyone here has something to hide. Tanya had a boyfriend, whose name no one knew. A best friend with a loose relationship with the truth. And a habit she thought she’d kept hidden from everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, just as Beck believes he is making progress, the body of one of the suspects is found drowned in the river. Is the killer just getting started?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Previously Titled: The Quiet Hours ** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the town seems to have something they would die to protect. But who has a secret they’d kill for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This debut novel from a powerful new Irish voice is the first in a gripping series that will feature the brilliant, haunted Detective Finnegan Beck who won’t rest until justice is found. Perfect for fans of LJ Ross, Joy Ellis and Patricia Gibney.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around—&lt;/b&gt;and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old he’s been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries—including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo’s dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome to Weep.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Prepare to be captivated by one of the most poignant and uplifting books you will read this year, perfect for readers who loved &lt;i&gt;One Day in December&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Keeper of Lost Things.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) Exercise more &lt;br /&gt;2) Eat healthily &lt;br /&gt;3) Learn how to live again… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forty-year-old Alison Lund&lt;/b&gt; has always carefully planned everything in her well-ordered life, from colour co-ordinating her beautiful house to persuading her excitable son Alexander that sticker charts are more fun than misbehaving. But Alison’s perfect world has just fallen apart… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her head is left spinning when her beloved larger than life mother-in-law, &lt;b&gt;Maggie&lt;/b&gt;, passes away and Alison is left heartbroken. Every afternoon they’d talk and laugh over a pot of tea, she was the glue that kept Alison together through the first few tough years of motherhood. And now Alison is trying to figure out a future without her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With a little help from her two best friends, Alison resolves to be more Maggie. After an emotional New Year’s Eve get together, the three women create a happiness project, challenging themselves to step outside their comfort zones and make the most of every single day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Daring to do things differently, can Alison learn to live more spontaneously and find happiness along the way? Or will letting go be harder than she ever imagined? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about Pippa James:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Brilliantly funny, entertaining and damn amazing&lt;/b&gt;… boy can she write a novel!...

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE UNPUTDOWNABLE NEW THRILLER FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF &lt;i&gt;THE NEXT GIRL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She’s just the girl he’s looking for…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A young woman falls from a van speeding down a quiet road. Battered and bruised, she turns her head to the person who comes to her aid. ‘Help her’, she whispers before her eyes close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Days later, the body of another young girl is found in a shallow grave just a few miles away. The similarities between the two girls are startling – same age, same frail body, same shocking red hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the town fears there’s a serial killer living amongst them, Detective Gina Harte must put aside her own struggles at home, and catch the killer before he finds another perfect girl. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AN ABSOLUTELY HEART-STOPPING CRIME THRILLER FROM CARLA KOVACH – if you like Lisa Gardner, Robert Bryndza or Clare Mackintosh, &lt;i&gt;Her Pretty Bones &lt;/i&gt;will have you hooked.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;On a bright January morning in the London suburbs, a family moves into the house they’ve just bought in Trinity Avenue.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Nothing strange about that. Except it is your house. And you didn’t sell it.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona Lawson comes home to find strangers moving into her house, she's sure there's been a mistake. She and her estranged husband, Bram, have a modern co-parenting arrangement: bird's nest custody, where each parent spends a few nights a week with their two sons at the prized family home to maintain stability for their children. But the system built to protect their family ends up putting them in terrible jeopardy. In a domino effect of crimes and misdemeanors, the nest comes tumbling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bram has disappeared and so have Fiona's children. As events spiral well beyond her control, Fiona will discover just how many lies her husband was weaving and how little they truly knew each other. But Bram's not the only one with things to hide, and some secrets are best kept to oneself, safe as houses.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Escape to Wildflower Park with Part One of a brand new four-part serial from bestselling author Bella Osborne.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Life’s not always a walk in the park…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;Anna&lt;/strong&gt; is dumped by her fiancé, she moves in to her own place on the edge of the gorgeous Wildflower Park and pledges to stay off men and focus on her career, but a handsome new colleague seems to thwart her attempts at every turn. And when she receives an accidental text from a mystery man, could it be the new start she needs? Or someone she really shouldn't be falling for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna’s neighbour &lt;strong&gt;Sophie&lt;/strong&gt; is a stressed-out mum-of-two with a third on the way. Her husband is a constant frustration, and their children are a regular source of newly-invented swear words and unidentifiable sticky surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Anna and Sophie have each other – and Wildflower Park proves to be a sanctuary as they map out a path to find the happiness they both deserve…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Fantastically funny, this irresistibly heart-warming novel will charm fans of &lt;strong&gt;Milly Johnson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jill Mansell&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;MAD ABOUT MOON is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fall in love with Jed and Josie in this emotionally captivating, sexy standalone romance by New York Times bestselling author Melissa Foster. &lt;/b&gt;The perfect love story for those who enjoy fiercely loyal and insanely sexy alpha heroes, smart, sassy heroines, strong family bonds, bikers, babies, and more! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can true love strike twice in one lifetime? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Josie Beckley refuses to believe there is a limit on happiness. A decade after she escaped her abusive parents and lost touch with her siblings, the death of her husband leaves her and her son homeless. But Josie has never been one to wallow in sadness, and when she takes a chance on reconnecting with her siblings, a sinfully handsome bright light from her past shows up and offers to help her find a way out of the darkness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most people wouldn't see Jed Moon as someone to look up to. He's been in and out of jail and has lived a less-than-stellar lifestyle. But years ago one woman saw through his nonsense, and he's never forgotten her. Now she's back in his life, and as a prospect for the Dark Knights motorcycle club, Jed promises to keep an eye on the sassy, sexy single mother who has never stopped lighting his fantasies on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jed and Josie's combustible connection is stronger than ever. Having Josie and her son in his life brings out all of Jed's protective instincts-and visions of a future he never imagined having. But when a shocking revelation knocks the insatiable lovers to their knees, it forces them to make choices that could change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>For Katie McKenna, passing out and landing in the arms of Washington DC Soaring Eagles baseball player AJ Williamson is one of those moments she’d rather forget. Embarrassed beyond belief, she tries to pretend the incident never happened. She puts the escapade behind her, choosing to spend the summer preparing for law school—and admiring AJ safely from afar. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;AJ, however, can’t forget the brunette with the green eyes who he caught that night on the concourse. She was funny. Quick. Not afraid to be herself. Intrigued, AJ wants to know more—and makes his move. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Katie and AJ meet a second time, she finds herself no longer seeing him as AJ, the baseball player, but as Andrew Joseph, the man she is falling for. As her feelings grow, so do her doubts. AJ is known for his wanderlust, and his contract is up this year—will he even be in DC next season? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Katie has her own worries. Law school is going to consume her and is notoriously hard on relationships. The last thing she wants is for AJ to be a casualty of that. With the start of school looming closer, and her heart falling faster, Katie worries if she will be able to give AJ everything he deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Can these two people find a way to realize they are worth the risk for the other to take? Or will their chance at love result in a swing and a miss?</description>

  <description>A tenacious young detective with scars both physical and emotional, Beth Young will stop at nothing in her fight for justice for the innocent. Death in the Lakes is the first book in the series. Set in the Lake District, it is perfect for fans of Joy Ellis, LJ Ross, and Peter James. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Beth Young has just joined the Cumbrian major crimes team when a body is found posed in a ritualistic manner – arms spread and graceful wings attached – at a crumbling castle in the hills of the Lake District. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire police force is on red alert. But Beth begins to feel she’s the only one who can follow the disturbing clues left by the twisted killer. Because she doesn’t think like everyone else. To Beth, crimes are puzzles she can solve. Even if real life is a little harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more bodies are discovered in derelict stately homes across the Lake District, Beth knows she’s in a race against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the killer is looking for another victim to add to his collection… Will Beth be able to save her? Or will he get there first?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Watching her friend dragged away in handcuffs, Josie couldn't believe for one second that Gretchen had killed that poor boy. Confession or not, someone else was involved. She would find out who…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the body of a young student is found on the driveway of a local Denton home, a photograph pinned to his collar, &lt;b&gt;Detective Josie Quinn&lt;/b&gt; is first on the scene. The house belongs to &lt;b&gt;Gretchen Palmer, &lt;/b&gt;a dedicated member of Josie’s team, missing for the last twenty-four hours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Working around the clock, Josie is stopped in her tracks when Gretchen hands herself in to the police.&lt;b&gt; She knows that there’s no way Gretchen could ever be a killer, so why would she confess to a murder she didn’t commit? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Digging deep into Gretchen’s secretive life, Josie uncovers a link between the boy, the photograph and a devastating case in Gretchen’s past. But just when Josie thinks she has it all figured out, the bodies of a young couple surface on the other side of town. &lt;b&gt;Can Josie get to the truth in time to save her friend from a life in prison or certain death? &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a city of 8.8 million people, you’d be surprised. Surprised at how many times your path crosses with that stranger you spotted on the other side of the street. Surprised at how lonely living in a busy city can feel. Surprised that falling in love – against all the odds – is just about possible.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;One day in London…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daisy&lt;/b&gt; is rushing to work when a stranger on a bicycle almost knocks her over – and then asks for her number. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;JoJo&lt;/b&gt;, a wife in her sixties, is trying desperately to win her beloved husband back from his mistress. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adam&lt;/b&gt; has recently lost his job and lies to his housemate about where he goes every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dylan&lt;/b&gt;, a teenage boy, lives with an illness which means he can’t leave his bedroom – but which hasn’t stopped him falling in love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These four total strangers – whose paths cross in the charming and crazy city of London – have one thing in common. They’re all looking for love and they’re totally hopeless at it. But that’s about to change. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hilarious, uplifting and heartfelt novel about love, life and finding happiness. If you’ve ever made a mistake, suffered a break-up, waited by your phone for it to ring or loved someone from afar, then &lt;i&gt;The Shape of Us&lt;/i&gt; is for you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Release Date: September 21st, 2018&lt;br /&gt;Genre: YA / Standalone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say high school will be the best years of your life.&lt;br /&gt;It's a lie.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lexie and Dylan used to be the best of friends. That all changed the summer before freshman year when their mothers skipped town together without explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the scandal broke and fueled the school rumor mill, it branded Lexie as an outcast. For three excruciatingly long years, she faced endless torment by heartless bullies in her class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't long after his mother left that Dylan ran headlong into a slippery slope of self-destruction. As he rose to the top of the social ladder, he turned his back on Lexie and used bitter resentment to hide his pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the two are forced to spend the summer together, tensions run high, but emotions run higher as the former best friends struggle to navigate the uneasy months ahead. But even if Lexie and Dylan can find their way back to each other, can either learn to forgive their mothers when the truth behind their leaving comes out?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WICKED WICKED LOVE is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After escaping abusive parents and, later, an abusive relationship, Sarah Beckley has spent a lifetime watching snakes shed their skin. With two small children to care for and another on the way, she's finally found a home in Peaceful Harbor with the brother she hasn't seen in more than a decade. She's still searching for her sister, but life is good. If only she could stop thinking about the sinfully sexy doctor/biker who has taken to her children like a loving uncle-and to her like a hungry man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust doesn't come easily for Sarah, but Bones Whiskey is patient and protective, amazing with her children, and he looks at her like she is the only woman he could ever want-and more. With two little ones underfoot, Sarah expects him to move on quickly, yet with every tender kiss and each trying moment with the children, Bones surprises her. But will the fiercely loyal biker stick around when Sarah's worst secret is revealed, or will he shed his skin, too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more hot Whiskey love, check out Melissa's other Whiskey novels.&lt;br /&gt;TRU BLUE&lt;br /&gt;TRULY MADLY WHISKEY&lt;br /&gt;DRIVING WHISKEY WILD&lt;br /&gt;And don't miss RIVER OF LOVE, the first story in which the Whiskeys were introduced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whiskeys are perfect beach reads with depth of story, strong family ties, and a wealth of emotions. Small town love stories with happily ever afters guaranteed.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Snowy rooftops, mulled wine, and a hot single dad. Not the Christmas Saffy wished for… but maybe the one she needs?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Saffron Baxter&lt;/b&gt; knew her fun holiday plans didn’t stand a chance the moment her sister called to say she was stuck abroad with no hope of being home before Christmas. Saffy would just have to abandon thoughts of wild festive parties in the city and head down to remote Cornwall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because every year her sister hosts a huge Christmas meal for all the single parents in her village. And Saffy knows it’d break her heart to let them down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Arriving as snow starts to fall over the thatched cottages of the little harbour town of Port Breok, she meets &lt;b&gt;Logan&lt;/b&gt; – the tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed, devoted single dad who lives over the road, with his adorable daughter &lt;b&gt;Chloe&lt;/b&gt;. At first she thinks he might help her make Christmas Day extra-memorable, but he just seems convinced she’ll never manage – that she’s just a party girl who doesn’t care about family, or anyone’s feelings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe he’s right. After all – she doesn’t want to settle down, she’s only there for a few days… But she’s still determined to do her sister proud with gorgeous decorations, the most beautiful real tree – complete with extra twinkly lights, and delicious mince pies. To make it a Christmas everyone will remember, especially little Chloe. Even if, when the mistletoe comes down, she knows she’ll probably never see Logan again… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The perfect festive romance novel, ideal for fans of Nora Roberts, Jenny Hale and Debbie Macomber.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When I was a kid and I’d lost something, my dad always said ‘Go back to the place you last had it’. The problem is that what I’ve lost is… me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate loves her family more than anything, but recently she has started to feel invisible. Lying awake at three a.m. as her husband snores, panicking about shopping lists, birthday parties, and the school bake sale… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She finds herself in the kitchen, gulping water, staring at a postcard of the Eiffel Tower from Shannon, her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris, with its red wine, slippery cobbles and curly lampposts. Where the scent of freshly-baked croissants hangs in the air, and Kate last remembers feeling like herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The postcard is a year old. It has just one line on it: When are you coming?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inspiring, feel-good tale of friendship, love, and what happens when running away is the only way you can find your way home. Perfect for fans of Sophie Kinsella, Jane Green and Marian Keyes.</description>

  <description>Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It’s the highest honour they could hope for…and the most demeaning.&lt;br /&gt;This year, there’s a ninth.&lt;br /&gt;And instead of paper, she’s made of fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lei is a member of the Paper caste, the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. Ten years ago, her mother was snatched by the royal guards, and her fate remains unknown. Now, the guards are back and this time it’s Lei they’re after – the girl with the golden eyes, whose rumoured beauty has piqued the king’s interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace, Lei and eight other girls learn the skills and charm that befit a king’s consort. There, Lei does the unthinkable – she falls in love. Her forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world’s entire way of life. Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl at heart, must decide how far she’s willing to go for justice and revenge.</description>

But this year one man threatens to ruin Christmas for Sarah’s customers – Mr Grinch, Will Armstrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shooting Star Mountain resort is a magical place, and Sarah has fond memories of Christmas here as a little girl – visits to Father Christmas, husky rides in the snow and hot chocolate by a roaring fire. But as the resorts new owner, Will refuses to play snowball or to deck the halls with anything remotely resembling tinsel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With customers complaining their Christmas is ruined, Sarah decides it’s up to her to convince Scroogey Will just how magical Christmas can be….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But getting Will into the Christmas spirit is hopeless – he is Bah Humbug personified! But as Sarah gets to know him better, she realises that underneath all the gloom is a man struggling with a pain of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the big day approaching, Sarah realises that the magic and sparkle can wait.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas at the café at Seashell Cove, where there’s hot chocolate to keep you warm – and the man of your dreams could be waiting…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Interior designer &lt;b&gt;Tilly Campbell&lt;/b&gt; loves being carefree and single. But her latest job is redecorating the cosy local café for a Christmas party, and when her friends confess their plans for the big night – including a proposal, a declaration of love and a pregnancy announcement – Tilly starts to wonder if she might be missing out… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Transforming the café into a winter wonderland is more of a challenge than she thought, so when she bumps into gorgeous newcomer &lt;b&gt;Seth&lt;/b&gt;, Tilly welcomes the distraction. Seth is a single father, struggling to settle his son Jack into their new cottage, and Tilly is determined to help them make their house into a home in time for Christmas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But with the café still in chaos just days before the party it looks like it’s going to be a Christmas to remember for all the wrong reasons… With friends old and new relying on her, can Tilly save the Christmas party? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And could she finally find love waiting for her under the mistletoe? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heart-warming, hilarious read about friendship, family and the meaning of Christmas. Perfect for fans of Sue Moorcroft, Holly Martin and Debbie Johnson! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What readers are saying about Karen Clarke:  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I absolutely loved it…&lt;/b&gt; Touched my heart … &lt;b&gt;Absolutely wonderful…&lt;/b&gt; If I could give this book &lt;b&gt;more than five stars&lt;/b&gt; I really, really would… &lt;b&gt;Uplifting&lt;/b&gt;, feel good and &lt;b&gt;absolutely beautiful.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One wrong move, and she meets a guy with all the right ones…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talia Dalton lives her life on cruise control. Despite her successful career as a professor, she prefers protecting her broken heart to taking chances. She’s calm, cool, collected, and steady. Until the morning she takes her eyes off that familiar road and almost runs over the sexiest man she’s ever seen. It may not be the best way to start the day, but it might be the type of shake-up she needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Male dancer Derek Grant has goals, and nothing is going to get in the way of achieving them. As a graduate student and the sole caretaker of his ailing father, he hasn’t much time for relationships. Then Talia crashes into his life. Sweet, pretty — and so buttoned-up that he can’t wait to help her cut loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Derek, falling in love was a beautiful accident waiting to happen. And it might be exactly what Talia needs — if she’s willing to let go of the past and embrace every surprise Derek has to offer.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This utterly addictive new novel from bestselling author Holly Martin will make you smile until your cheeks hurt, sob tears of pure joy and fall head over heels in love with a totally unforgettable romance…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isla Rosewood&lt;/b&gt; is creating a new life for herself and her sweet nephew &lt;b&gt;Elliot&lt;/b&gt; in their cosy, yellow-brick family cottage, brimming with special memories. Living in Sandcastle Bay was never part of Isla’s plan but, after her brother Matthew’s tragic accident, her whole world changed as she unexpectedly became a mother to the little boy she adores so much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leo Jackson&lt;/b&gt; was always known as Matthew’s fun-loving and wild best friend. But now Matthew is gone, it’s time to put his colourful past behind him. His role as Elliot’s godfather is the most important thing to him. And even though Leo and Isla are two very different people, they both want to give Elliot the childhood he deserves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the three of them enjoy time together watching fireworks, baking cakes and collecting conkers, Isla begins to see a softer side to charming Leo, with his twinkling eyes and mischievous sense of humour. And, despite herself, she begins to fall for him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But does Leo feel the same way? Isla knows their situation is complicated but is it too complicated for true love… or will the year end with a happy new beginning for them all? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A glorious, feel-good romance that will make you want to snuggle up under a warm blanket with a hot chocolate and the one you love. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you enjoy reading Sarah Morgan, Jenny Oliver and Lucy Diamond this book is for you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

Romance is in the air and Lily King is hoping some winter magic will help to make her dreams come true…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Lily King&lt;/b&gt; is wondering when her life is going to start. She adores working at the much-loved Castle Teashop, surrounded by familiar faces and delicious cakes. But she’s stuck in a rut. She’s just been dumped by her boyfriend and her dream job seems to be slipping through her fingers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When her best friend &lt;b&gt;Emily Campbell&lt;/b&gt; needs urgent help to organise her enchanting Christmas wedding, Lily realises it’s finally her moment to shine and reach for the opportunities she’s been wishing for. Can she pull off the biggest celebration Castle Cove has ever seen or will something - or someone - make things more complicated than she imagined? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rebellious and handsome photographer &lt;b&gt;Josh Havellin-Scott&lt;/b&gt; has always felt like an outsider, especially next to his perfect older brother, who is about to get married. At the last minute, Josh finds himself roped into plans for the Big Day, the very last thing he wants to do, until he is meets creative and quirky Lily King… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Lily and Josh are thrown together, it’s clear they couldn’t be more different. But they begin to realise that opposites can attract – and sometimes when you’re not looking for love, it comes and finds you when you least expect it. With some festive magic, will they manage to work together and save the day? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And could they discover a winter romance of their very own along the way? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>After landing her dream job as an assistant buyer for a luxury fashion retailer in Minneapolis, Taylor Hartigan’s life becomes a nightmare. Performing mundane tasks and catering to the ridiculous whims of the boss from hell, she sees no opportunity for advancement. Though she’s never quit anything in her life, Taylor walks out and heads home to Chicago, the city that holds her heart. With her confidence shaken and no job on the horizon, she knows she has to find herself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she arrives, she’s shocked to learn hockey player Hunter Riley has been traded to the Chicago Buffaloes. Taylor met Hunter the previous season when his hard-hitting play broke the glass in front of her. Meeting him after the game, something passed between them—and has stayed with her ever since. Since she’s followed his career, she knows he’s coming off a disastrous season in Houston and must rediscover his game in Chicago—or face losing his hockey dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timing couldn’t be worse for the pair to become involved since they’re both at a crossroads but the chemistry between them can’t be denied. Taylor worries that their budding relationship won’t survive the challenges of rebuilding two broken careers. Can the new versions of themselves fit together? Or tear them apart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or will love be the bottom line, after all?</description>

  <description>In the wake of tragedy, neither Lazlo nor Sarai are who they were before. One a god, the other a ghost, they struggle to grasp the new boundaries of their selves as dark-minded Minya holds them hostage, intent on vengeance against Weep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lazlo faces an unthinkable choice--save the woman he loves, or &lt;i&gt;everyone else?&lt;/i&gt;--while Sarai feels more helpless than ever. But is she? Sometimes, only the direst need can teach us our own depths, and Sarai, the muse of nightmares, has not yet discovered what she's capable of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As humans and godspawn reel in the aftermath of the citadel's near fall, a new foe shatters their fragile hopes, and the mysteries of the Mesarthim are resurrected: Where did the gods come from, and why? What was done with thousands of children born in the citadel nursery? And most important of all, as forgotten doors are opened and new worlds revealed: Must heroes always slay monsters, or is it possible to save them instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love and hate, revenge and redemption, destruction and salvation all clash in this gorgeous sequel to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Strange the Dreamer&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fall in love, break the curse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It once seemed so easy to Prince Rhen, the heir to Emberfall. Cursed by a powerful enchantress to repeat the autumn of his eighteenth year over and over, he knew he could be saved if a girl fell for him. But that was before he learned that at the end of each autumn, he would turn into a vicious beast hell-bent on destruction. That was before he destroyed his castle, his family, and every last shred of hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has ever been easy for Harper Lacy. With her father long gone, her mother dying, and her brother barely holding their family together while constantly underestimating her because of her cerebral palsy, she learned to be tough enough to survive. But when she tries to save someone else on the streets of Washington, DC, she’s instead somehow sucked into Rhen’s cursed world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Break the curse, save the kingdom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prince? A monster? A curse? Harper doesn’t know where she is or what to believe. But as she spends time with Rhen in this enchanted land, she begins to understand what’s at stake. And as Rhen realizes Harper is not just another girl to charm, his hope comes flooding back. But powerful forces are standing against Emberfall . . . and it will take more than a broken curse to save Harper, Rhen, and his people from utter ruin.</description>

  <description>After calling off her engagement, Hayley, the Wynthorpe Hall housekeeper, wants nothing more than to return to her no-strings fun-loving self, avoiding any chance of future heartbreak. Little does she know, Wynbridge’s latest arrival is about to throw her plan entirely off course . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Moving into Wynthorpe Hall to escape the town’s gossip, Hayley finds herself immersed in the eccentric Connelly family’s festive activities as they plan to host their first ever Winter Wonderland. But Hayley isn’t the only new resident at the hall. Gabe, a friend of the Connelly’s son Jamie, has also taken up residence, moving into Gatekeeper’s Cottage, and he quickly makes an impression on Wynbridge’s reformed good-girl.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As preparations commence for the biggest event of the season, the pair find themselves drawn ever closer to one another, but unbeknownst to Hayley, Gabe, too, has a reason for turning his back on love, one that seems intent on keeping them apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Under the starry winter skies, will Gabe convince Hayley to open her heart again once more? And in doing so, will he convince himself?</description>

While the women do their best to console him, their husbands feel the need to mark their territory. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And as Simon becomes more involved with the group, his presence changes everything these three couples thought they knew about each other, leading to a final dinner party that no-one will ever forget. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Amazon chart bestseller Tracy Bloom, &lt;i&gt;Dinner Party&lt;/i&gt; is a funny and moving read that will make you see your marriage and friendships in a whole new light… and make you think twice about inviting your best mates round for dinner.

Fans of Bella Forrest, Divergent and &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt; will be enthralled by this explosive and addictive dystopian novel.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The silhouettes of the watchers stood stark against the glinting metal fence. No one could get in. And no one could get out.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the storms rage around her, &lt;b&gt;15-year-old Alice Davenport&lt;/b&gt; is trained by the rulers of the new world, &lt;b&gt;Paradigm Industries&lt;/b&gt;, to reach the highest levels of command. Life within the Community is supposed to be perfect, with &lt;b&gt;the Barricades&lt;/b&gt; keeping the population safe from the toxic wasteland and savage people outside. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rebellious Alice has never felt easy with Paradigm Industries’ plans for the future. Determined to investigate their secrets, she makes a shocking discovery: disturbing experiments on how to create life itself are taking place in underground laboratories, establishing a new order for society that will impact generations to come… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The First Generation Scouts will rule.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Second Gen will obey.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And the Lab Made will serve.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Knowing she can’t live in this brutal regime, Alice has nowhere to turn. Until she encounters a boy from beyond the Barricades, who seems to have the answers for a better life. If what he says about the outside world is true, Alice realises it’s up to her to take on the power of Paradigm Industries alone… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In her journey to find freedom, Alice’s courage will be tested to the limit, but she’ll stop at nothing to do what’s right.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Bayside Heat is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod. Bayside Summers is a series of standalone steamy romance novels featuring alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, deeply emotional, always passionate, and easy to relate to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In BAYSIDE HEAT...&lt;br /&gt;Drake Savage has always done the right thing, especially where beautiful and fiercely determined Serena Mallery is concerned-even when it means keeping his feelings for her to himself. Serena has always wanted more than what their small town of Wellfleet, Massachusetts has to offer, and Drake's roots are so deeply entrenched in the Cape, it's all he can do to watch her pack up her life and move away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serena has always had big dreams. As a teenager she dreamed of becoming an interior designer and marrying smart, musically inclined, sexy-as-sin Drake Savage. Now she's finally landed a killer job with a top interior design firm, but though she has spent the last four years working side by side with Drake, he's never made a move. Four years is long enough for her to accept reality, and her new job in Boston is the perfect way to move on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A weak moment leads to sizzling, sensual kisses, opening a door through which they've both been aching to walk. But Serena's determined not to give up her shot at the career she's always dreamed of, and Drake has loved her for too many years to stand in her way. With true love at their fingertips and a world of unstoppable passion igniting between them, can the two star-crossed lovers find their way to their happily ever after? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All BAYSIDE SUMMERS books can be read as standalone novels or as part of the series:&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Desires &lt;br /&gt;Bayside Passions&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Heat&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Escape&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Summers is part of the Love in Bloom romance collection by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling and award-winning author Melissa Foster. While each book may be read as a standalone, you might enjoy reading the entire Love in Bloom series. Characters from each sub-series appear in future books.

  <description> Forgiveness can be hard to come by… An unputdownable new novel from bestseller Samantha Tonge &lt;p&gt; How far would you go to make amends?&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Emma fled her home at Foxglove Farm, she’d let down and hurt those who cared for her most. But now, two years later, she’s ready to face up to her past; she’s ready to go back.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Emma’s unannounced return causes more problems than she could have foreseen. The people she knew and loved aren’t ready to forget, let alone forgive. And the one person she wants to reconnect with the most, her mother, can’t remember who she is.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as Emma starts to rebuild trust, an uncovered family secret and a shocking past crime threaten her newly forged future...&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes simply saying sorry isn’t enough.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Perfect for readers of Ruth Hogan or Amanda Prowse, this is an extraordinary and unforgettable novel about running away from yourself – and finding a way back.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>A beautiful princess must escape one treacherous vow…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she must do so alone…without a prince to save her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Aurelia is bound to the wicked king of Tranen by her mother’s single, dying wish: He must remarry a woman who possesses her same golden hair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Aurelia has magic on her side. Disguised by a cloak made of one-thousand furs, she escapes into the night with only memories of her sordid past and her own will for freedom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after finding safe haven in the beautiful kingdom of Saarland der Licht, will the secret of her identity be compromised when she captures the attention of the captivating Prince Klaus? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allerleirauh is a retelling of the classic Grimm fairy tale that takes hold from the first page until the end! If you’re a fan of retellings by Marissa Meyer, you’ll love Allerleirauh! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read it today!</description>

  <description>When two young boys discover human bones buried beneath a tree in a trailer park, Detective Josie Quinn races to join her team at the scene. She used to play in those woods as a child, happier outside and away from her abusive mother, Belinda Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie’s past crashes into her present when a rare dental condition confirms the bones belong to a teenage foster-child who was murdered thirty years ago. A girl named Belinda Rose…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josie hasn’t seen her mother in years but, with an undeniable connection between her mother and the dead girl, does she dare try to track her down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Josie gets closer to uncovering a secret that will shatter her world forever, another body is uncovered. It’s suddenly clear that someone very close to Josie will stop at nothing to keep the truth buried forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she battles the demons from her past, can Josie stop this killer before another precious life is taken?</description>

  <description> ‘I will never forget the night I drowned…’  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A village with something to hide.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seventeen-year-old Eleanor Parker&lt;/b&gt; wakes up cold and alone in the river that twists through her quiet village. She has no memory of how she got there. But she does know that another girl was drowned in the same river the summer before, held under the water by an unknown killer… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A community torn apart.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eleanor is a normal, every day teenager. She argues with her mum, spends her days with her best friend, and is looking forward to a carefree summer of sunshine and music. Who would want to hurt her? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A shocking secret.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Determined to unlock the mystery of what really happened to her, Eleanor can't escape the feeling that something awful links her to the previous summer's murder. But will she find out the truth before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gripping and extraordinary coming of age novel that will make you question everything and keep you guessing until the very end. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Looking for Alaska&lt;/i&gt; by John Green and hit TV show &lt;i&gt;Riverdale&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about Kerry Wilkinson:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Wow this had me captivated!

  <description>Moving to a space station at the edge of the galaxy was always going to be the death of Hanna’s social life. Nobody said it might actually get her killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sci-fi saga that began with the breakout bestseller &lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; continues on board the Jump Station &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, where two new characters will confront the next wave of the BeiTech assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna is the station captain’s pampered daughter; Nik the reluctant member of a notorious crime family. But while the pair are struggling with the realities of life aboard the galaxy’s most boring space station, little do they know that Kady Grant and the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt; are headed right toward &lt;i&gt;Heimdall&lt;/i&gt;, carrying news of the Kerenza invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station residents one by one, and a malfunction in the station’s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon Hanna and Nik aren’t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the &lt;i&gt;Hypatia&lt;/i&gt;—and possibly the known universe—is in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But relax. They’ve totally got this. They hope.</description>

  <description>Princess Winter is admired by the Lunar people for her grace and kindness, and despite the scars that mark her face, her beauty is said to be even more breathtaking than that of her stepmother, Queen Levana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter despises her stepmother, and knows Levana won't approve of her feelings for her childhood friend--the handsome palace guard, Jacin. But Winter isn't as weak as Levana believes her to be and she's been undermining her stepmother's wishes for years. Together with the cyborg mechanic, Cinder, and her allies, Winter might even have the power to launch a revolution and win a war that's been raging for far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Cinder, Scarlet, Cress, and Winter defeat Levana and find their happily ever afters? Fans will not want to miss this thrilling conclusion to Marissa Meyer's national bestselling Lunar Chronicles series.</description>

  <description>In this third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, now with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, they're plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their best hope lies with Cress, a girl imprisoned on a satellite since childhood who's only ever had her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, she's just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a higher price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only hope the world has.</description>

  <description>Anything For Love is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Charlotte Sterling loses her last family member, she moves to Sterling House, her family’s Colorado mountain inn, to live a solitary life. As an erotic romance writer, her days and nights are filled with passion and intrigue—even if only fictional. She loves her busy, quiet lifestyle, and she learned early on that real men can’t live up to the fictional heroes she creates—until ruggedly handsome Beau Braden arrives to do some work at the inn and, for the first time in forever, she’s intrigued by a real man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beau lost his first love years ago, and he’s never let go of his guilt over her death. As he nears the anniversary of his loss, he is on the cusp of becoming the star of a home-renovation reality show. Escaping the painful memories of his past to work at the defunct old inn is just the promise of solitude he needs to clear his head before diving in to the all-too-public career. But he didn’t count on being attracted to the whimsical, adorably sexy innkeeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither Charlotte nor Beau is looking for an attachment or a fling. But the more they learn about each other, the closer they become. Romantic evenings lead to intimate conversations, and neither can deny their deep connection or the passion it sparks. They’ve never fully healed on their own, but together maybe anything is possible.</description>

  <description>Rory closed her eyes. Think with your head. Your heart can’t be trusted. Life is not a fairytale… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rory doesn’t believe in love. She’s got far too many real problems to deal with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She’s just bought a tumbledown house. Her mother is generally behaving like a wicked witch, insisting on calling her Aurora, and generally interfering in her (admittedly pitiful lack of) love life. And her 16-year-old daughter has finally grown out of Disney princesses and discovered dating… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But &lt;b&gt;Rory’s adamant that she doesn’t need saving. In fact, the only thing she’s wishing on a star for is a bit of practical help&lt;/b&gt;. However, when she meets a builder whose name is John Prince and who seems to be in the habit of rescuing her (right down to finding her lost shoe one evening) she might have to face a truth as uncomfortable as hobbling home barefoot – that &lt;b&gt;maybe there’s something enchanted in the air&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her mother, daughter and friends are convinced her prince has come, but Rory just wishes everyone could let it go. Especially when she hears a story that makes her question whether he is really the hero everyone thinks he is…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ashley Moon is all set for a dream holiday with her daughter in the glittering French Riviera. But nothing can prepare her for the shock of discovering who’s staying in the villa next door… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ashley Moon&lt;/b&gt; got much more than a suntan on her first ever foreign holiday; one whirlwind romance and nine months later she had a daughter,&lt;b&gt;Molly.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Too heart-broken and proud to ever contact the father, Ashley made a decision to go it alone and raise her daughter herself. Fifteen hard and lonely years later, she finally has the chance to take Molly on her first ever holiday; a gorgeous, all-expenses paid trip to the charming French resort of St Raphael. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect setting for a week of quality time together; they plan to cycle through the sun-drenched vineyards, lounge by the glistening pool and practice their French on friendly locals. And just when Ashley thought things couldn’t get any better, comes the news of a handsome new occupant to the villa next door. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But fate has other plans for Ashley. One look in to her neighbour’s dark hazel eyes is all it takes to give her the shock of her life. Standing in front of her is &lt;b&gt;Haydon,&lt;/b&gt; Molly’s long lost father and the holiday fling she thought she’d never see again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the temperature on the Cote D’Azure steadily rises and Ashley and Haydon begin spend more and more time together, will Ashley find the courage to tell him who she is – and more importantly, who Molly is? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wonderfully heart-warming story of first love and second chances for fans of Jenny Oliver and Lucy Diamond. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What readers are saying about Tilly Tennant: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘‘I just want to say how fantastic this book is&lt;/b&gt; … If you’ve not read any books by this author, why the heck not?! Do it now… you won’t regret it! &lt;b&gt;I just love love loved it.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;StefLoz Book Reviews,&lt;/i&gt; 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I &lt;b&gt;loved every minute&lt;/b&gt; of it... I was glued to my Kindle for a few days that's for sure!... really &lt;b&gt;brilliant&lt;/b&gt;... will leave you &lt;b&gt;hooked even after a few pages.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;The Cosiest Corner&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘An &lt;b&gt;absolute pleasure&lt;/b&gt; to read! ... &lt;b&gt;Had me hooked right through to the last page!&lt;/b&gt; … A delightful story full of love, laughter and tears… Highly recommended!!’ &lt;i&gt;Stardust Book Reviews,&lt;/i&gt; 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Wow absolutely wow&lt;/b&gt;... truly wonderful... you just fall into and lose yourself right from the very first page. &lt;b&gt;Could not put it down. I loved everything about it.‘&lt;/b&gt; Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I adored this wonderful heart-warming story that &lt;b&gt;captured my soul and left me glued to my ereader&lt;/b&gt; and I didn't want the story to end. Alas, I'm now bereft and missing my dose of feel-good from Harper and her friends at Silver Hill Farm.’ &lt;i&gt;Kraftireader,&lt;/i&gt; 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘You immediately feel right at home ... The descriptions of where Harper lives sound &lt;b&gt;absolutely beautiful&lt;/b&gt; and immediately make you want to leave everything and go live there! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;'... just keeps you guessing ... I’m looking forward to her next already.’ &lt;i&gt;Broadbean’s Books&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the best-selling Lunar Chronicles. She's trying to break out of prison — even though if she succeeds, she'll be the Commonwealth's most wanted fugitive. Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit's grandmother is missing. It turns out there are many things Scarlet doesn't know about her grandmother or the grave danger she has lived in her whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother's whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her prisoner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unabridged recording (11 hours, 22 minutes).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

From space, a ruthless lunar people watch, waiting to make their move. No one knows that Earth's fate hinges on one girl....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinder, a gifted mechanic, is a cyborg. She's a second-class citizen with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her stepsister's illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai's, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world's future.</description>

With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza—but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys—an old flame from Asha's past—reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heros will fall, and hearts will be broken.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An absolutely hilarious, uplifting summer read about living life to the full!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meg Larson&lt;/b&gt; thought she had everything she wanted: she works in the local bakery, she’s months away from marrying her high-school sweetheart, and home is beautiful, sunny &lt;b&gt;Seashell Cove&lt;/b&gt;, where the sky is blue, the sea is turquoise and the sand is golden. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except that the bakery is up for sale and her fiancé &lt;b&gt;Sam&lt;/b&gt;’s more interested in bikes than their relationship. When Meg receives shocking news about her family, he’s on a cycling tour and ignoring her calls – and posting selfies on Facebook with a female cyclist he looks far too cosy with... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Luckily the bakery’s estate agent, &lt;b&gt;Nathan&lt;/b&gt;, is understanding and funny, and as the summer goes on an unexpected friendship blossoms. When the bakery is given a second lease of life under a mysterious new owner, Meg realises a change might be exactly what she needs too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Will Meg find the happy-ever-after she dreams of in Seashell Cove? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An uplifting, laugh-out-loud rom com that will make you dream of romantic days at the beach. Perfect for fans of Debbie Johnson, Holly Martin and Jenny Oliver. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;The Bakery at Seashell Cove&lt;/i&gt;:  &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Hilarious.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;Being Unique Being a Reader&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I couldn’t put it down…&lt;/b&gt; Highly recommended, &lt;b&gt;I loved it!&lt;/b&gt;’ Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;Laugh out loud… I couldn’t put it down…&lt;/b&gt; I highly recommend this book!’ Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I loved this story&lt;/b&gt;, it swept me away to a quaint English seaside village where anything could happen and where &lt;b&gt;a happy ending is guaranteed&lt;/b&gt;… If you love Jenny Colgan, then &lt;b&gt;Karen Clarke should be on your to-be-read list&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;For the Love of Books&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘Now Nathan the love interest &lt;b&gt;sent my pulse racing&lt;/b&gt;… &lt;b&gt;I fell head over heels in love&lt;/b&gt; with him myself… The blossoming friendship between the two will certainly have your heart melting… A &lt;b&gt;heart-warming and very much lighthearted&lt;/b&gt; read.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tell her all your secrets and she’ll tell you all her lies…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything in &lt;b&gt;Lorna’s&lt;/b&gt; life runs like clockwork, from her 6 a.m. morning run to the strict 60-minute counselling sessions she gives. It’s the only way she can deal with the terrible secret she carries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a new client arrives for his first appointment, Lorna feels her perfect life unravel in a matter of seconds. It’s &lt;b&gt;Andrew&lt;/b&gt;, the man she’s spent the last year desperately trying to forget. &lt;b&gt;It seems he can’t forget her either…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Against her better judgement she anonymously contacts him on a dating site. Messaging him could mean the end of her marriage and her career, but she needs to know if his motives are genuine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Andrew is found dead in his home, grief quickly turns to fear when messages from him continue to arrive on Lorna’s phone. &lt;b&gt;Somebody knows her secret and wants to use it to destroy everything she has.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will she risk her family and her sanity to keep her secret? Will she risk her life…?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She took a mouthful of the sweet liquid and started to feel a pounding in her head. Arms went around her waist and she was half lifted and half pulled. The last thing she was aware of was her head hitting a step…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixteen-year-old Emily&lt;/b&gt; had everything to live for. A bright, beautiful teenager with a promising future ahead of her. But in one night her life is cut short. &lt;b&gt;The police say it’s an accident. But her parents think she was murdered.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When &lt;b&gt;Detective Rachel Prince&lt;/b&gt; is called in to investigate the shocking death at the height of the Edinburgh festival, her instincts tell her that things are not as they first appear. &lt;b&gt;Something is very wrong.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the case takes an unexpected turn, Rachel discovers a chilling link with the suspicious death of another international student, who stayed in the same house as Emily two years before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just as Rachel finds herself on the hunt for a serial killer, a painful relationship from her own past catches up with her. And Rachel must decide what is more important – catching the killer or keeping her own secrets? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A breath-taking, tense roller-coaster crime thriller featuring unforgettable series detective Rachel Prince. &lt;i&gt;Now She’s Gone&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for fans of Angela Marsons, Peter James and Karin Slaughter.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about the Detective Rachel Prince series:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘I was &lt;b&gt;hooked from page one and couldn’t put it down&lt;/b&gt; until I’d reached the end. &lt;b&gt;The twists and turns just keep coming…&lt;/b&gt; will have you gasping in surprise.’ &lt;i&gt;Goodreads Reviewer&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;I held my breath all the way through, wanting, yet not wanting to know the outcome.

  <description>One moment can change everything…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice Emerson and best friend Sasha Miller have made a pact. They’ve decided to swap city living for the beautiful white beaches of the Outer Banks and pour everything they have into launching an ice cream shop in the little house by the sea where Alice spent blissful childhood holidays with her grandfather. As Alice and Sasha add colour to the walls of the beach house and tempt the locals with their delicious recipes, their fresh new life begins to take shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swept away by her plans, love is the last thing on Alice’s mind. But she keeps running into mysterious doctor Jack Barnes, and finds herself falling for his golden charm and warm smile. As they laugh through sunshine-filled days and long romantic evenings, Alice tries hard not to think he could be the one for her – Jack is only here for the season, and Alice has had her fair share of heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Alice’s summer couldn’t be more perfect, she discovers an old letter tucked away in the beach house. It contains a family secret that turns Alice’s world upside down and threatens the future of the ice cream shop. And then Jack reveals a secret of his own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Alice have her dreams shattered and her heart broken, or can she find true happiness this summer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of The Summer House, an utterly stunning, uplifting summer romance, about the power of friendship, discovering family secrets, and the beauty of falling in love by the sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Previously published as One Summer *</description>

  <description>You’re young. You’re in love. You’re in terrible danger…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A completely unputdownable thriller from Amazon chart bestseller Arlene Hunt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘The woman’s body lay on the bed, hair fanned out in a golden halo, blue eyes open. On the table stood an unmistakable sign: a bouquet of bright yellow roses...’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a freezing January morning, a young couple is found dead in their cottage in the quiet Dublin suburbs. When Detective Eli Quinn arrives at the scene his stomach drops. It’s the second double homicide in as many months where the killer has left a bunch of yellow roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucked between the thorns is a little card, with an image of a broken heart. There’s no doubt the killer is trying to send a message, but what do the flowers mean? And can Eli figure out the killer’s motive, before they strike again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utterly gripping, fast-paced and nail-bitingly tense, this serial killer thriller will keep you up reading all night. If you love Angela Marsons, Rachel Abbott and Patricia Gibney, you won’t be able to put this down.</description>

  <description>Love at Last is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowboy Cal Hayden has loved Rachel Gray practically since the first time he set eyes on her. But Cal’s a careful, responsible man who knows better than to start a relationship before he can give it his all. He bided his time while caring for his family through his father’s terminal illness. Now his father is gone and his mother is settled, but has Cal waited too long to make his move? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Find out more about these friends of the Bradens in LOVE AT LAST, and catch up with many of your favorite Love in Bloom characters, including much-anticipated news about babies for the Bradens in Trusty, Colorado! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If this is your first introduction to the Bradens, please note that this is a flirt not a full-length novel. Like all Love in Bloom books, flirts are written to stand alone, so jump right in and enjoy the fun, sexy, and emotional ride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What is a Flirt? &lt;br /&gt;The Love in Bloom big-family romance world has become so widely enjoyed, I have been asked by thousands of readers to write the stories of our beloved side characters. While I couldn’t possibly fit in writing full-length novels for each of them while maintaining my normal publication schedule, I’ve created flirts. Flirts cover twenty-four to forty-eight hours of two side characters’ lives on their path to their happily ever after, while also updating readers about their favorite main characters. Flirts vary in length and heat levels. I hope you love these quick, fun, sexy stories as much as I enjoy writing them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If this is your first Love in Bloom story, then you have a whole series of loyal, sexy, and wickedly naughty heroes and smart, sassy heroines to catch up with. The characters from each family series within the Love in Bloom world cross into other family series and make appearances in future books so you never miss an engagement, wedding, or birth. Visit Melissa’s website for free Love in Bloom reader goodies such as series checklists, publication schedules, and family trees. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Read the Rest of the Love In Bloom Series: &lt;br /&gt;Snow Sisters &lt;br /&gt;The Bradens at Weston &lt;br /&gt;The Bradens at Trusty &lt;br /&gt;The Bradens at Peaceful Harbor &lt;br /&gt;The Bradens at Pleasant Hill &lt;br /&gt;The Remingtons &lt;br /&gt;The Ryders &lt;br /&gt;Seaside Summers &lt;br /&gt;Bayside Summers &lt;br /&gt;Wild Billionaires After Dark &lt;br /&gt;Bad Billionaires After Dark &lt;br /&gt;Harborside Nights &lt;br /&gt;The Montgomerys &lt;br /&gt;The Whiskeys &amp;amp; Tru Blue &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Fiona Steele has a great career, strong friendships, and a loving family. To an outsider, her life appears happy and fulfilling. But the one thing that’s missing is true love, and the only man Fiona wants is the one she can’t have, sinfully handsome and seductively intense Jake Braden—the man whose heart she broke, which she has regretted ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an LA stuntman, Jake Braden’s at the top of his game. He’s hired for all the best movies, hooks up with the hottest women, and lives an unencumbered lifestyle where his needs come first—and where he doesn’t have to examine his life too closely. Except when he visits his family in his close-knit hometown of Trusty, Colorado, where he spends his time avoiding Fiona—the only woman who knows who he really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona’s best friend is hired to act in Jake’s movie, Fiona jumps at the chance to try to win him back. There’s no denying the white-hot attraction burning between them. With every encounter, Fiona hopes Jake can’t resist falling back into the love they once shared. But her well-orchestrated rendezvous doesn’t go over well with the brooding heartthrob. Living in the fast lane is perfect for a guy who’s buried his emotions so damn deep he’s not sure he can remember how to feel—and he’s not sure he ever wants to.</description>

  <description>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her younger brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</description>

  <description> Have you ever wanted to press the escape button?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddy and Leanne are in need of a miracle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maddy&lt;/b&gt; can't bear to wash another pair of her husband's Y-fronts and if he continues to drone on about golf she might just scream. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leanne&lt;/b&gt; can't stand living with her overbearing mother for a second longer and she's one disapproving eye roll away from a nervous breakdown. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But their luck changes when they win the lottery.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Setting off from Dublin, Maddy and Leanne lease a red convertible, winding through Europe and heading for the sun-drenched French Riviera. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But the pair have their own reasons for their adventure. Maddy has never forgotten her summer romance of twenty years ago with a gorgeous Frenchman and Leanne plans to track down the father who abandoned her as a child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Amongst glorious sunsets and buckets of bubbly, Leanne and Maddy are searching for answers after years of wondering 'what if?'. But there might just be some surprises in store along the way… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hilarious and heartwarming story about friendship, living life to the full and making the most of every moment. Fans of Fiona Gibson, Carole Matthews and Lucy Diamond will adore this uplifting, fun-filled read.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Embracing Her Heart is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Oak Falls, Virginia, home to horse farms, midnight rodeos, bookstores, coffee shops, and quaint restaurants where you’re greeted like family and treated like treasured guests. Buckle up for a wild ride. Like any Southern girls worth their salt, the sweet-talking, sharp-tongued Montgomery sisters can take men to their knees with one seductive glance or a single sugarcoated sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In EMBRACING HER HEART…&lt;br /&gt;Leaving New York City and returning to her hometown to teach a screenplay writing class seems like just the break Grace Montgomery needs. Until her sisters wake her at four thirty in the morning to watch the hottest guys in town train wild horses and she realizes that escaping her sisters’ drama-filled lives was a lot easier from hundreds of miles away. To make matters worse, she spots the one man she never wanted to see again—ruggedly handsome Reed Cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reed was one of Michigan’s leading historical preservation experts, but on the heels of catching his girlfriend in bed with his business partner, his uncle suffers a heart attack. Reed cuts all ties and returns home to Oak Falls to run his uncle’s business. A chance encounter with Grace, his first love, brings back memories he’s spent years trying to escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace is bound and determined not to fall under Reed’s spell again—and Reed wants more than another taste of the woman he’s never forgotten. When a midnight party brings them together, passion ignites and old wounds are opened. Grace sets down the ground rules for the next three weeks. No touching, no kissing, and if she has it her way, no breathing, because every breath he takes steals her ability to think. But Reed has other ideas…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;The Bradens &amp;amp; Montgomerys are part of Melissa's Love in Bloom big-family romance collection. All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone and may also be enjoyed as part of the larger series, so dive right into this fun, sexy romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls). Order of future books is subject to change &lt;br /&gt;Embracing Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;Anything For Love&lt;br /&gt;Trails of Love&lt;br /&gt;Our Wicked Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Searching for Love&lt;br /&gt;Wild Crazy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Summer of Love&lt;br /&gt;Hot For Love&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Sexy Hearts&lt;br /&gt;Winter of Love&lt;br /&gt;Claiming Her Heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please note that future books in the original Montgomery series are crossing over to the Bradens at Pleasant Hill, and for this reason I have combined the series into THE BRADENS &amp;amp; MONTGOMERYS (Pleasant Hill - Oak Falls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love in Bloom features alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're flawed, funny, passionate, and relatable to readers who enjoy contemporary romance and women's fiction. Characters from each sub-series appear in future books. All Love in Bloom novels are written to stand alone without any unresolved issues or cliffhangers.</description>

  <description>This morning, Kady thought breaking up with Ezra was the hardest thing she’d have to do. This afternoon, her planet was invaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year is 2575, and two rival megacorporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than an ice-covered speck at the edge of the universe. Too bad nobody thought to warn the people living on it. With enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra—who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to fight their way onto an evacuating fleet, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their problems are just getting started. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating, with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a tangled web of data to find the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: the ex-boyfriend she &lt;i&gt;swore&lt;/i&gt; she'd never speak to again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BRIEFING NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents—including emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more—&lt;i&gt;Illuminae&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a heart-stopping, high-octane trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Blair had stopped crying. There was no window, the walls were smooth and it was quiet. She didn’t want to be alone. But she didn’t want him to come back.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When eleven-year-old Blair Smearton is abducted near a river bank on the hottest day of the year, no-one can trace the man spotted taking her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Anna Gwynne&lt;/b&gt; is back at work with her cold case unit following a brutal attack that nearly cost her her life. She’s investigating the death of young Rosie Dawson, whose bones were found hidden in a hole in the ground ten years ago. At least avenging Rosie’s murder, focussing on her past, can help Anna ignore her own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only lead Anna has is a photo of Rosie posted on a chat room hidden deep online. And then she finds one of Blair. Kidnapped. In the exact same dark room. The same concrete walls. The same stony floor. The killer is bragging. No-one can trace the photo. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Blair’s time is running out. But Anna has a contact who knows the dark web better than anyone. He’s the key to finding those girls. &lt;b&gt;Can Anna get his help to find Blair alive?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heart-pounding thriller that will get right under your skin.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One ex.&lt;br /&gt;One wedding.&lt;br /&gt;One little white lie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Samantha Jenkins is asked to be the maid of honour at her best friend’s wedding, she couldn’t be happier. There are just three problems…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Sam’s ex-boyfriend, Liam, will be the best man.&lt;br /&gt;2) His new girlfriend is pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;3) Sam might have told people she has a new man when she doesn’t (see points 1 and 2 above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Sam does the only sensible thing available to her… and hires a professional to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actor Jake Porter is perfect for the role: single, gorgeous and cheap! Sam is certain it’s the perfect solution: no strings, no heartbreak and hopefully no chance of being found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But spending a week in the Scottish Highlands with Jake is harder than she imagined. He is the perfect boyfriend, charming, sexy and the hottest thing in a kilt since Outlander! And his dog Harry is quite possibly the cutest things Sam has ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the wedding draws closer, Jake plays his part to perfection and everyone believes he is madly in love with Sam. The problem is, Sam’s not sure if Jake is acting anymore…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The capital has fallen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling rules Ravka from his shadow throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the nation's fate rests with a broken Sun Summoner, a disgraced tracker, and the shattered remnants of a once-great magical army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep in an ancient network of tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina must submit to the dubious protection of the Apparat and the zealots who worship her as a Saint. Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova's amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling's secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction—and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she’s fighting for.</description>

  <description>The highly anticipated sequel to the thrilling New York Times best-selling Six of Crows.&lt;br /&gt;Kaz Brekker and his crew have just pulled off a heist so daring even they didn't think they'd survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives. Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from around the world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals and new enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties. A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will decide the fate of the Grisha world.&lt;br /&gt;©2016 Leigh Bardugo (P)2016 Audible, Inc.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Length: 11 hrs and 52 mins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land. She finds starting new is not easy while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. She can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her--or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

  <description>Surrounded by enemies, the once-great nation of Ravka has been torn in two by the Shadow Fold, a swath of near impenetrable darkness crawling with monsters who feast on human flesh. Now its fate may rest on the shoulders of one lonely refugee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alina Starkov has never been good at anything. But when her regiment is attacked on the Fold and her best friend is brutally injured, Alina reveals a dormant power that saves his life—a power that could be the key to setting her war-ravaged country free. Wrenched from everything she knows, Alina is whisked away to the royal court to be trained as a member of the Grisha, the magical elite led by the mysterious Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet nothing in this lavish world is what it seems. With darkness looming and an entire kingdom depending on her untamed power, Alina will have to confront the secrets of the Grisha . . . and the secrets of her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shadow and Bone is the first installment in Leigh Bardugo's Grisha Trilogy.</description>

  <description>Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price - and no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker. Kaz is offered a chance at a deadly heist that could make him rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he can't pull it off alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A convict with a thirst for revenge. A sharpshooter who can't walk away from a wager. A runaway with a privileged past. A spy known as the Wraith. A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums. A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes. Six dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist. Kaz's crew is the only thing that might stand between the world and destruction - if they don't kill each other first.</description>

  <description>The problem with secrets is they don’t always remain secret, no matter how long they’ve been buried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark side of magic beckons to Kaelia. It whispers in her ear, seducing her with the promise of yet more power. Having discovered the truth behind the goddess Hel’s connection to Bran the necromancer, Kaelia is finding it increasingly difficult to tell who is on her side and who is against her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawn into an age-long battle, she must fight to protect not only those she loves, but also the humans that her enemies, The Salloki, would devour. Confronting an evil never seen before outside the realms of myth and magic, Kaelia is torn. Should she join with Bran? Is he really as trustworthy as he says?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But trust cuts both ways as Bran too discovers, unearthing both secrets and lies about his true identity. There is also someone he wants to protect above all, even if that price is unleashing upon Mortiswood the fearsome Vanagandr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets, lies, magic, and emotions weave their tangled web, who will lose their hearts and who will lose their lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the line between good and evil is so blurred it fails to exist…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The perfect place to fall in love this summer…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tori Graham&lt;/b&gt; is in need of a holiday. Trying to piece her heart back together after losing the love of her life, she escapes to &lt;b&gt;Blossom Cottage&lt;/b&gt;, with its picturesque views of the sea. And plans to spend the summer in gorgeous &lt;b&gt;Sandcastle Bay&lt;/b&gt;, where her best friend &lt;b&gt;Melody Rosewood&lt;/b&gt; lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tori’s not expecting her summer by the beach to be eventful, until she meets handsome and mysterious &lt;b&gt;Aidan Jackson…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aidan looks after the holiday cottage Tori is staying in. Healing from past hurts, he wants to avoid any further chance of heartache. But could this newcomer be the breath of fresh air he needs? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finding herself embracing life in the coastal community, Tori starts to fall in love with Sandcastle Bay and its welcoming cast of residents. But that’s not all she begins to fall for, as Tori is swept away by Aidan’s genuine heart and mischievous sense of humour. The attraction between them is undeniable, but will a simple holiday romance be enough? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Tori’s stay in Sandcastle Bay comes to an end she has a tough decision to make…. Has her heart found a new place to call home? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A joyously romantic summer read that will make you laugh, cry and fall in love. If you enjoy reading Sarah Morgan, Jenny Oliver and Lucy Diamond this book is for you.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>She’s a survivor. He has a royal secret. Will the truth help them find their fairy tale?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When art history student Clementine receives a social media message complimenting her latest project, her response leads to the mysterious CP Chadwick, a British man studying history at Cambridge. An online friendship quickly blooms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she confides her medical past to CP, he doesn’t treat her as fragile like her parents do, and their friendship turns to something more in Clementine’s heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clementine has no idea that CP is actually Prince Christian of Wales, who has never had a “normal” life. Christian is at a crossroad. His destiny is to be a working royal, but he is desperate to fill that role in his own way. Wary of others, he’s kept himself closed off from the world—until he lets Clementine in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A royal romance is never a fairy tale, but Clementine and Christian are determined to write their own version. Can they overcome their own fears—as well as the constraints of a royal life—to reach their own happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Royal Shade of Blue is the first standalone book in the feel-good Modern Royals romantic comedy series. If you like smart heroines, swoon-worthy princes, and laugh-out-loud humor, then you’ll love Aven Ellis’s heartwarming novel.</description>

  <description>A family secret&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One shocking argument and ten-year-old Alice Parker’s world was turned upside down.

  <description>Detective Josie Quinn is horrified when she’s called to the house of a mother who had her newborn baby snatched from her arms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman caught fleeing the scene is Josie’s only lead, but when questioned it seems this mysterious girl doesn’t know who she is, where she’s from or why she is so terrified…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is she a witness, a suspect, or the next victim? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Josie digs deeper, a letter about a mix-up at a fertility clinic links the nameless girl and the missing child to a spate of killings across the county. Josie is faced with an impossible decision: should she risk the life of one innocent child to save many others… or can she find another way?</description>

  <description>Bad Boys After Dark: Brett is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indulge your inner vixen with these sexy billionaires!&lt;br /&gt;Meet the Bad Boys... Four fiercely loyal, sinfully sexy, uber alpha brothers, about to fall head over heels for their leading ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything's naughtier after dark...&lt;br /&gt;Billionaire security expert Brett Bad has had his eye on his brother’s gorgeous legal assistant, Sophie Roberts, for years. He wants nothing more from her than a single night between the sheets to satisfy his desires. But Sophie is a white-picket-fence girl, and she’s turned him down more times than he cares to count. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie is all about forever kisses and happily ever afters. But she can’t deny her attraction to Brett, as enticed by his bad-boy behavior as she is by his devastating looks and his painful past, which she’d like to help heal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sophie’s friend urges her to throw caution to the wind, Sophie leaves the door to her heart ajar—and Brett charges in. But this Bad boy doesn’t know a thing about romance and has no interest in forever, forcing Sophie to make her toughest decision yet—follow her heart or protect it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Read the entire BAD BILLIONAIRES AFTER DARK series&lt;br /&gt;Bad Boys After Dark: Mick&lt;br /&gt;Bad Boys After Dark: Dylan&lt;br /&gt;Bad Boys After Dark: Carson &lt;br /&gt;Bad Boys After Dark: Brett&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Available: WILD BILLIONAIRES AFTER DARK&lt;br /&gt;Wild Boys After Dark: Logan&lt;br /&gt;Wild Boys After Dark: Heath&lt;br /&gt;Wild Boys After Dark: Jackson&lt;br /&gt;Wild Boys After Dark: Cooper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD BILLIONAIRES AFTER DARK series is part of the LOVE IN BLOOM big family romance collection.

  <description>A heart to protect. A debt to repay. A game to win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being swept up in the magical world of Caraval, Donatella Dragna has finally escaped her father and saved her sister, Scarlett, from a disastrous arranged marriage. The girls should be celebrating, but Tella isn't yet free. She made a desperate bargain with a mysterious criminal, and what Tella owes him no one has ever been able to deliver: Caraval Master Legend's true name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only chance of uncovering Legend's identity is to win Caraval, so Tella throws herself into the legendary competition once more - and into the path of the murderous heir to the throne, a doomed love story, and a web of secrets...including her sister's. Caraval has always demanded bravery, cunning, and sacrifice. But now the game is asking for more. If Tella can't fulfill her bargain and deliver Legend's name, she'll lose everything she cares about - maybe even her life. But if she wins, Legend and Caraval will be destroyed forever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome, welcome to Caraval...the games have only just begun.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A story of icing and flour…and how love doesn’t always go to plan!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Pippa Pattinson’s summers were spent in the idyllic Greek island fishing village of Taxos. There she spent many long hazy days determinedly ignoring thoughts of the life her parents had mapped out for her (a dreary-but-secure accounting job and obligatory sensible husband!) Instead she daydreamed of running her own tea shop – serving the perfect scones –with mocha-eyed childhood friend Niklaus by her side… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving back in Taxos for the first time in years, with suave boyfriend Henrik, Pippa barely recognises the tired little town – but is relieved to catch glimpses of the quaint, charming village she’s always loved. Together Niklaus and Pippa put together a proposal to save Taxos from tourist-tastic ruin, and at the heart of their plan is Pippa’s dream project - The Tastiest Little Tea Shop in Taxos. It’s time for Pippa to leave her London life behind and dust off her scone recipe that’s guaranteed to win over both locals and visitors. And amidst the rolling pins and raisins, it seems romance is blossoming where she’s least expecting it… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;If you’re a fan of Lindsay Kelk or Lucy Diamond then don’t hesitate to step into Samantha Tonge’s truly delightful tea shop.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>'A &lt;b&gt;phenomenal cast &lt;/b&gt;of characters and some real&lt;b&gt; laugh out loud&lt;/b&gt; moments. &lt;b&gt;Brilliant&lt;/b&gt;!' &lt;b&gt;Heidi Swain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romantic comedy as its finest from an author who is quickly gaining acclaim; perfect for fans of Mhairi Macfarlane and Lindsey Kelk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jess&lt;/b&gt;, a 29-year-old Londoner with a Kate Beckett fringe and a tendency for dramatics, gets taken on a surprise trip by her long-term boyfriend, &lt;b&gt;Pete&lt;/b&gt;, to attend her best friend’s last minute wedding in South Africa. Jess imagines sun, sand, wine and safaris. And returning to London with an ethically mined diamond on her left hand...&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But this holiday isn’t set to be quite the fairy tale Jess has planned... and suddenly she finds her world tilting on its axis. And things are only set to get worse when Jess returns home…&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Bennetto&lt;/b&gt; is back with her trademark wit and an equally hilarious cast of characters who will have you rooting for them from the first page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Praise for Catherine Bennetto: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘This &lt;b&gt;superb debut&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;b&gt;romcom at its very best &lt;/b&gt;and the perfect book to chase away the winter blues. &lt;b&gt;I haven’t fallen so in love with a bunch of characters in a long while. &lt;/b&gt;Loved it' &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sun&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ‘A &lt;b&gt;charming&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;feel-good gem&lt;/b&gt; of a debut novel that’s &lt;b&gt;guaranteed to leave you smiling&lt;/b&gt;… An &lt;b&gt;honest &lt;/b&gt;narrative and a &lt;b&gt;fresh&lt;/b&gt; voice to tell it… a great way to spend a lazy afternoon' &lt;b&gt;CultureFly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 'More &lt;b&gt;bubbly&lt;/b&gt; than a big glass of champers and just as&lt;b&gt; fun&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;i&gt;How Not To Fall In Love, Actually&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;b&gt;bright&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;breezy&lt;/b&gt;, and the &lt;b&gt;perfect way to beat back the winter blues&lt;/b&gt;' &lt;b&gt;Georgia Clark, &lt;/b&gt;author of &lt;b&gt;

  <description>It’s the early hours of the morning and Rose Denton wakes up behind the steering wheel of her car. She’s off the road, through a hedge and in a field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s blood on the windscreen and bonnet – but it’s not hers and there’s no sign of anything or anyone she might have hit. The last thing she remembers is being in a hotel on a business trip but now she’s miles away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back home and her daughter’s boyfriend is missing. The last thing he did was argue with Rose over money. He left no note, no text, no clue as to his whereabouts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police have questions – and so does Rose’s family. But those are little compared to the ones she has for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened last night? And, perhaps more importantly, does she really want to know the answer?</description>

She's been promised log fires, roasted chestnuts, her own weight in mince pies - all in a setting that looks like something out of a Christmas card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her winter wonderland is ruined when she finds herself snowed in with her current boyfriend, her old flame and a hunky stranger. Well, three (wise) men is traditional at this time of year...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing so, she becomes embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, discovering her own capacity for bloodshed. But as civil war threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

  <description> You made a promise to your sister. It could destroy your daughter.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Daughter&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;15-year-old Rosie lies in hospital fighting for her life. She’s trying to tell her mother what happened to her, and how she got there, but she can’t speak the words out loud. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mother&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rosie’s mother Toni has a secret. She had a traumatic childhood, and she and her sister Bridget made each other a promise thirty years ago: that they could never speak the truth about what happened to them as children, and that they would protect each other without asking for help from others, no matter what… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rosie was Toni’s second chance to get things right: a happy, talented girl with her whole life ahead of her. Having lost her husband in a tragic accident, Toni has dedicated her life to keeping Rosie safe from harm. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Rosie has plans that her mother doesn’t know about. She has dreams and ambitions – of love, of a career, of a life beyond the sheltered existence that her mother has created for her. But the secrets Rosie has been keeping have now put her life in danger. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Pact&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In order to save Rosie, Toni may have to break her lifelong promise to her sister… and open doors to her past she hoped would remain closed forever.</description>

  <description>‘A perfect summer read that leaves you with a smile!’ Rae Reads on Breakfast Under a Cornish Sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Rome…with love?&lt;br /&gt;Mary Smith is turning her very ordinary life upside-down! She’s bought herself a one-way ticket to Rome and is ready for a summer she’ll never forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men might be off the cards for waitress Mary, but within hours of arriving at the utterly charming family-run La Dolce Vita pizzeria, she’s already fallen in love with the bustling capital!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Dante Rossi, the mysterious (and drop-dead gorgeous) chef seems displeased with her arrival. And in the heat of the kitchen, it doesn’t take long for long-buried secrets to surface and sparks to fly…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deliciously heartwarming romance to have you dreaming of summer. Perfect for fans of Debbie Johnson and Caroline Roberts.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wondered what secrets other mothers are keeping? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jenny has too much on her plate:&lt;/b&gt; literally – she’s only pregnant with one child but she’s already eating for three. Not to mention trying to &lt;b&gt;juggle her future life with a baby, a nightmare boss, a know-it-all sister, and a bizarrely laid back husband. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She used to be famous for her ‘Single Girl About Town’ journalism. But not only is she bored of parties, she also hasn’t been single for years, and is now 8½ months pregnant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So when her boss hands her column to a younger colleague, &lt;b&gt;Jenny panics and proposes instead writing about being a clueless new mum.&lt;/b&gt; Surely people will find her new friendship group fascinating? Even if the only thing they have in common is that they all had sex around the same time 9 months ago... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like – what’s the deal with scary Gail’s mystery husband? How is posh mum Antonia already out drinking when Jenny can barely make a cup of tea? Why isn’t sweet-natured Ruth answering any phone calls? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if her readers aren’t quite hooked yet, &lt;b&gt;maybe Jenny will just have to be more liberal with the truth. After all, none of the other mums will read it… will they? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Undercover Mother&lt;/i&gt; is a feel-good parenting page turner that will make you laugh, cry and recognise every moment. Perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Why Mummy Drinks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Bad Mother’s Diary&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What if the end of the world was just the beginning?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;15-year-old Alice Davenport&lt;/b&gt; was a loner and an outcast before the Storms swept away everything she knew. Saved from the ravaged remains of London by the mysterious and all-powerful &lt;b&gt;Paradigm Industries&lt;/b&gt;, her fierce independence and unique skills soon gain her recognition from the highest levels of command. But their plans to rebuild civilisation from scratch mean destroying all remnants of the past – no matter what, or who, gets left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice must decide if she will fight for the old world, or the new…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decades later, 15-year-old Carter Warren&lt;/b&gt; is woken from the Catacombs after years of cryonic sleep. He’s determined to do whatever it takes to climb the ranks to Controller General - until he realises the Industry’s control methods have become harsher than ever. The Barricades make sure nothing from the Deadlands can get in to the Community – and no one can get out. And a shocking discovery about his own family causes Carter to question everything he’s ever known… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Alice becomes entangled in the Industry’s plan for the future, and Carter delves into the secrets of his past, they must make sacrifices which threaten to tear them apart. And both of them are forced to confront an impossible question… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Would you dare to risk it all for the perfect world?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An addictive and gripping dystopian series, perfect for fans of The Girl Who Dared to Think, The Hunger Games and The Gender Game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book was previously titled &lt;i&gt;Paradigm.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Don’t trust your friends. Don’t trust your family. Don’t trust yourself… &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The people of London fear for their lives when a twisted serial killer called &lt;b&gt;The Cartoonist&lt;/b&gt; starts targeting young mothers, leaving their bodies on display in their homes with speech bubbles drawn from their lips. He has a terrifying story to tell, but first, the right people need to be listening… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nathan Radley has a brilliant and dangerous talent.&lt;/b&gt; Formerly one of the best criminal psychologists on the police force he’s renowned for getting deep into the minds of the murderers he hunts.

What does he want, and how many more innocent lives will be taken before they can crack his disturbing riddle? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find a murderer, first you need to think like a murderer. The Cartoonist doesn’t just know this, he’s &lt;i&gt;counting&lt;/i&gt; on it…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absolutely nail-biting serial killer thriller perfect for anyone who loved the twisted mind games in &lt;i&gt;Hannibal&lt;/i&gt;. Fans of M.J. Arlidge, Helen Fields and Rachel Abbott will not want to miss this page-turning debut!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Everyone wants that special someone….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Higgins has given up on love: she’s too busy trying to get her tiny business off the ground. Infuriated by the advertising agency across the hall making fun of her job, Annie accepts their crazy challenge – to make a random stranger Instagram-famous in just thirty days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even when they choose Dr Samuel Page PhD, historian and hater of social media, as her target, Annie’s determined to win the bet – whether Sam likes it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But getting to know Sam means getting to know more about herself. And before the thirty days are out, Annie has to make a decision about what’s really important…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, real and heart-meltingly romantic, Annie and Sam’s story is My Fair Lady for the social media age – and the perfect feel-good read.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There’s blossom in the trees and daffodils as far as the eye can see. Maddie is looking forward to a fresh start in the countryside, but there’s just one little problem…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Following a scandal at her high-flying PR agency, twenty-six-year-old &lt;b&gt;Maddie&lt;/b&gt; flees London to help promote what she thinks is going to be a luxurious holiday retreat in the countryside. Everything is riding on her making a success of this new job… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yet when she arrives, Maddie is horrified to find a rundown old farm in a terrible state. The brooding and secretive owner, &lt;b&gt;Seth&lt;/b&gt;, spent all his money on leasing the land when he fell in love with the beautiful, dishevelled farm cottages and the very romantic story behind them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Maddie discovers an old painting by the original owner’s wife, she unlocks the secret of the farm’s history and quickly realises she must start getting her hands dirty if this very special place is going to have any chance of survival. As she and Seth begin working together, the stunning view from the top of the hill is not the only thing that’s leaving her breathless… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After weeks of hard work the dream looks like it might become a reality, until a secret from Maddie’s past threatens to snatch it all away again. &lt;b&gt;Can Maddie find a way to save the business and herself? Will she finally find a place to keep her heart within the crumbling walls of the little cottage on the hill?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perfect for fans of Jenny Colgan, Lucy Diamond and Debbie Johnson who are looking to escape to the countryside and fall in love watching the seasons change.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What readers are saying about Emma Davies:  &lt;br /&gt;‘One of the most &lt;b&gt;heartfelt and captivating&lt;/b&gt; books I have read this year. &lt;b&gt;Beautifully emotional, this book has it all&lt;/b&gt;. Such a joy to devour and &lt;b&gt;I recommend this book with all of my heart.&lt;/b&gt;’ &lt;i&gt;The Writing Garnet&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘This is the &lt;b&gt;perfect read for book lovers everywhere…&lt;/b&gt; Books, friendship and a sprinkling of romance, the &lt;b&gt;perfect feel good combo&lt;/b&gt;.’ Heidi Swain, author of &lt;i&gt;Sleigh Rides and Silver Bells at the Christmas Fair&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘What &lt;b&gt;delightful treat&lt;/b&gt; the book was… in fact it was &lt;b&gt;a warm hug of a story, a joy from beginning to end&lt;/b&gt;.’ Liz Fenwick, author of &lt;i&gt;The Cornish House&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;My favourite book of 2017&lt;/b&gt;. A must buy, must read for all. &lt;b&gt;I have so much love for this book…&lt;/b&gt; I wanted to stay up late into the night just to finish it. Something that I haven’t wanted to do for a loooonnnnggg time… This book is simply magical. I laughed, I smiled and I cried. I was &lt;b&gt;left with a massive smile on my face&lt;/b&gt;… I &lt;b&gt;absolutely adored this book&lt;/b&gt; and it will get a &lt;b&gt;massive 5 out of 5 from me&lt;/b&gt;.’ &lt;i&gt;Goodreads Reviewer&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘&lt;b&gt;A real page turner&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;I read it in one sitting!&lt;/b&gt; At one point the &lt;b&gt;tears were rolling down my face…&lt;/b&gt; This is the first book I've read from Emma and I can guarantee it won't be the last!’ &lt;i&gt;The Introverted Mum&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘A &lt;b&gt;thoroughly delightful&lt;/b&gt;, warm read with an engaging cast of characters. &lt;b&gt;You can't help but root for a happy ending!&lt;/b&gt;’ Talli Roland, author of &lt;i&gt;The Pollyanna Plan&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;‘This is a &lt;b&gt;heart-warming&lt;/b&gt; book</description>

  <description>He lied to her. Fed her the same lines as he did all the other girls. Instead of proposing, he dumped her on national TV. Would a romance with a hockey superstar prove just as disastrous—or could it be the greatest love story of her life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast as America’s reality show sweetheart after being jilted on a dating show, Skye Reeve is ready to stop being a brokenhearted woman by proving she’s more than what the camera portrayed her to be. She’s landed her dream job as a TV lifestyle reporter and promises to work hard to be a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skye also vows never to be swept up in a fairy tale romance ever again, as she obviously has no clue what real love is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in the same city as Denver Mountain Lions hockey star Maxime Laurent, however, might make this last goal impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with ghosts from his own past, the Belgian hockey star is known for keeping his life off the ice private. He’s not sure if outgoing Skye could be a match for him, but he can’t deny his attraction to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the two embark on a romance, will they be able to move forward from the past to let love into their hearts? With no reality blurred, will Skye find real-life love to be what she had been looking for all along?</description>

  <description>When Annie Trebarwith unexpectedly inherits Tregavara House, her much-loved family home atop the cliffs of Salt Bay, she begins to wonder: with all the good friends and warm memories she’s made in the village, could it be her forever home? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily her gorgeous Poldark-lookalike boyfriend, Josh Pasco, has exactly the same idea. High on the Cornish cliffs he gets down on one knee, and Annie has everything she’s ever dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a summer storm causes catastrophic damage to the beautiful but aging house, Annie and Josh are faced with tumbling tiles and a massive repair bill – and a roof that’s leaked straight onto her wedding gown…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the Salt Bay community save Annie’s house and her wedding – and give Annie the happy-ever-after she’s always wanted?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously published as &lt;em&gt;Learning to Fly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; It’s never too late to follow your dreams… &lt;p&gt;Forty-year-old air stewardess, Emily Forsyth, thought she had everything a woman could wish for: a glamorous, jet-set lifestyle, a designer wardrobe and a dishy pilot boyfriend. Until he breaks up with her…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catapulted into a mid-life crisis she &lt;em&gt;wishes&lt;/em&gt; she’d had earlier, she decides to turn her life upside-down, quitting her job and instead beginning to chase her long-held dreams of becoming an actress!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the skies behind her, Emily heads for the bright lights of London’s West End – but is it too late to reach for the stars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Don’t miss this heartwarming and uplifting debut, perfect for fans of Colleen Coleman and Cate Woods!&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;DRIVING WHISKEY WILD is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Forces veteran and Dark Knights Motorcycle Club member Bullet Whiskey lives to protect his family, their bar, and the residents of his small hometown. He’s rough, unapologetic, and haunted by a secret, painful past. He’s also a master at keeping people away, and when his sister hires gorgeous and sweet Finlay Wilson to help expand their biker bar, he knows just how to get rid of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing her boyfriend and her father, Finlay moves back to her hometown to be closer to the little family she has left. She needs her temporary job at Whiskey Bro’s to get her catering business off the ground, and she’s determined not to let the gruff, arrogant mountain of a man Bullet Whiskey scare her off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finlay is everything Bullet has never wanted. She’s afraid of his dog, afraid of motorcycles, and sweet enough to give him cavities, but as she weaves her way into the hearts of everyone around him, he’s powerless to resist her charms. Passion ignites, but trust doesn’t come easily, and when their pasts collide, Bullet finds out the true meaning of protecting those he loves.</description>

  <description>Can new love grow when you dig up old secrets?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper Woods wakes up every morning on Silver Hill Farm feeling like the luckiest woman in the world. She’s recently engaged to the tall, dark and handsome Shay, out of her window lie rolling golden cornfields, and just downstairs are the gorgeous tea rooms she’s always dreamed of owning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Harper is about to discover a secret that will change her luck forever. For better or worse? She has no idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distracted by her find, Harper doesn’t notice Shay getting rather close to his ex from the village. And as news of Harper’s discovery spreads through Silver Hill, there are people who are keen to stir up trouble, in particular, Will Frampton, handsome recluse and Lord of Silver Hill House, the crumbling stately home the other side of the hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Harper trust any man in Silver Hill? And as relationships are tested and tea cakes begin to fly, will anyone catch the romance blossoming in the most unexpected of places?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An utterly gorgeous, heart-warming romance, full of love and laughter. Perfect for fans of Debbie Johnson and Jenny Colgan.</description>

  <description>It has been a week since anyone last saw fifteen-year-old Daisy, after she left her best friend’s house and started her short walk home. Detective Kate Matthews and her team have been looking for her ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a tip-off leads Kate to a disused gymnasium at Daisy’s school, she is shocked to find evidence linking to the murder of a different girl. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working the two cases side by side, Kate’s blood runs cold when a gift-wrapped box containing a human heart is delivered to her at the station. The heart belongs to yet another unknown victim, but the message is clear: there will be more, and Daisy could be one of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When activity on Daisy’s Facebook account indicates she is still alive, the race is on for Kate and her team. Will Daisy be the killer’s next victim? Is Kate prepared to risk everything to stop another innocent life from being taken?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absolutely unputdownable crime thriller will have fans of Angela Marsons, Peter James and Rachel Abbott biting their nails long after the final twist has sunk in.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A MISSING CHILD. A DEAD WOMAN. WHO IS NEXT?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Six-year-old &lt;b&gt;Lola Jade Harper&lt;/b&gt; is taken from her bedroom. Her mother is distraught. She is convinced her estranged husband, &lt;b&gt;Gavin Harper&lt;/b&gt;, has abducted their daughter. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Rachel Prince&lt;/b&gt; is leading the investigation but is soon out of her depth as she searches for the &lt;b&gt;most high-profile missing child in the country&lt;/b&gt;. To uncover the truth about Lola’s disappearance, Rachel must untangle the Harper family’s complicated web of secrets and lies. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the case progresses, the body of a local woman is found. The death at first seems unrelated, until a trail of social media posts lead Rachel to a chilling discovery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And then another little girl is taken…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With growing pressure from the public and the appearance of someone from her past she’d rather forget, will Rachel be able to solve the connection between the two missing children and the murder - before it’s too late? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Truly addictive from start to finish, &lt;i&gt;Lola is Missing&lt;/i&gt; is a tense, enthralling crime thriller by one of the best new voices in crime fiction. Perfect for fans of Angela Marsons, Peter James and Karin Slaughter.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>An astonishingly incisive and suspenseful novel about a scandal amongst Britain's privileged elite and the women caught up in its wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophie's husband James is a loving father, a handsome man, a charismatic and successful public figure. And yet he stands accused of a terrible crime. Sophie is convinced he is innocent and desperate to protect her precious family from the lies that threaten to rip them apart. Kate is the lawyer hired to prosecute the case: an experienced professional who knows that the law is all about winning the argument. And yet Kate seeks the truth at all times. She is certain James is guilty and is determined he will pay for his crimes. Who is right about James? Sophie or Kate? And is either of them informed by anything more than instinct and personal experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her privileged upbringing, Sophie is well aware that her beautiful life is not inviolable. She has known it since she and James were first lovers, at Oxford, and she witnessed how easily pleasure could tip into tragedy. Most people would prefer not to try to understand what passes between a man and a woman when they are alone: alone in bed, alone in an embrace, alone in an elevator... Or alone in the moonlit courtyard of an Oxford college, where a girl once stood before a boy, heart pounding with excitement, then fear. Sophie never understood why her tutorial partner Holly left Oxford so abruptly. What would she think, if she knew the truth?</description>

  <description>Fall in love at Bayside, where sandy beaches, good friends, and true love come together in the sweet small towns of Cape Cod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayside Passions is a USA Today Bestseller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAYSIDE SUMMERS is a series of standalone steamy romance novels featuring alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're fun, flirty, flawed, deeply emotional, always passionate, and easy to relate to. And of course, you'll see cameos from the Seaside Summers characters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In BAYSIDE PASSIONS...&lt;br /&gt;When Emery Andrews's best friend, Desiree, moves away, falls in love, and opens an inn all in one summer, she feels her absence like a missing limb. Until she visits over the holidays and meets sinfully hot Dean Masters, who's as easy on the eyes as he is to talk to. After returning home, what starts as a flurry of late-night flirtations quickly turns into a deep connection and unexpected friendship. Now, months later, Desiree offers Emery a job teaching yoga at the inn. Adventurous Emery jumps at the chance and heads for Wellfleet, Massachusetts, to reunite with her BFF and her new close friend, Dean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of sharing their lives, and their secrets, over video chats and phone calls, Dean's ready to move things to the next level. The fact that Emery seems oblivious to the sparks between them and has recently put her foot down about dating friends just means he'll have to bide his time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Emery finds a naked man in her kitchen the first morning she's there, Dean doesn't hesitate to move her into his guest room. Maybe now Emery will see what's right before her eyes--although that guy she's got a date with might be a problem.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You lost your daughter. You will never forgive yourself. And now someone's determined to make you pay…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seventeen years ago, something happened to Jess’s daughter Beth. The memory of it still makes her blood run cold. Jess has tried everything to make peace with that day, and the part she played in what happened. It was only a brief moment of desire… but she’ll pay for it with a lifetime of guilt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To distance herself from the mistakes of the past, Jess has moved away and started over with her family. But when terrifying things begin happening in her new home, seemingly connected to what happened to Beth, Jess knows that her past has finally caught up with her. Somebody feels Jess hasn’t paid enough, and is determined to make her suffer for the secrets she’s kept all these years. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The first rule of &lt;i&gt;Sunday Lunch Club&lt;/i&gt; is … don't make any afternoon plans.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every few Sundays, Anna and her extended family and friends get together for lunch. They talk, they laugh, they bicker, they eat too much. Sometimes the important stuff is left unsaid, other times it's said in the wrong way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sitting between her ex-husband and her new lover, Anna is coming to terms with an unexpected pregnancy at the age of forty. Also at the table are her ageing grandmother, her promiscuous sister, her flamboyantly gay brother and a memory too terrible to contemplate.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Until, that is, a letter arrives from the person Anna scarred all those years ago. Can Anna reconcile her painful past with her uncertain future?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Juliet Ashton weaves a story of love, friendship and community that will move you to laughter and to tears. Think &lt;i&gt;Cold Feet&lt;/i&gt; meets David Nicholls, with a dash of the joy of Jill Mansell added for good measure.</description>

  <description>‘Ambulance and police. Something’s happened. I don’t know what. But my little girl–’ A sob choked off the sentence. ‘It’s my daughter...’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When beautiful young Nia Hopkins goes missing from her family’s farm on the icy outskirts of the Forest of Dean, her blood soaking the floor, the Gloucestershire police are convinced she’s been taken by the killer who stabbed to death Emily Risman eighteen years ago. They’re desperate to finally have the evidence to put him away. To save another girl before it’s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Detective Anna Gwynne thinks the press frenzy is making them obsess over the wrong man. He doesn’t fit the profile she’s been trained to see. This killer is sadistic. The suspect isn’t capable of that kind of crime.&lt;br /&gt;And when Anna finds a link to other cold cases, she realises the killer is manipulating the police to cover up other unspeakable crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no one listening, Anna knows she’s the only one who can hunt down this serial killer. But if she goes out alone, is she putting her own life in danger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolutely page-turning thriller that will have you hooked. If you love Val McDermid, Angela Marsons and Robert Dugoni, you won’t be able to put down The Silent Girls.</description>

The note says: ‘My beautiful darling, I’m sorry, please forgive me.’&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the body of a man is found with his wrists slashed in a London hotel room, it appears at first to be a tragic suicide. But Detective Dan Rileysuspects there is more to this case than meets the eye and the pathology report confirms his worst fears – the victim was poisoned and suddenly Dan is dealing with a murder inquiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he makes a disturbing discovery, uncovering links between the victim and a woman calling herself Goldilocks on an online dating site. Is she seeking revenge or something more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still grieving the devastating loss of his girlfriend and unborn child in a car accident two years ago, Dan throws everything he has into the investigation. Yet just as Dan begins to piece together the clues of this complex case, the body of a woman is found in her bed with identical wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan is on the trail of a twisted individual who is much closer than he realises. Can he overcome his own demons and stop the killer before it’s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An all-consuming and totally unputdownable read that will have you holding your breath to the very last page. Perfect for fans of Rachel Abbott, Robert Bryndza and Karin Slaughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published as Last Cry</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The perfect family... or the perfect lie?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a child’s scream pierces the night, &lt;b&gt;Mira&lt;/b&gt; does what any good neighbour would do: she calls the police. She wants to make sure that &lt;b&gt;Rosie&lt;/b&gt;, the little girl next door, is safe. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Opening her front door to the police the next morning, &lt;b&gt;Gemma’s&lt;/b&gt; picture-perfect family is forced under scrutiny of social services. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As her flawless life begins to crumble around her, Gemma must fight to defend the family she loves and protect her daughter from the terrible secret she’s been keeping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But who has Rosie been confiding in when Gemma’s back is turned? And why has she lied to the police?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Rosie disappears without a trace, Gemma thinks she only has herself to blame. &lt;b&gt;That is, until she finds a little pink diary containing a truth even more devastating than the lie…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you loved &lt;i&gt;The Couple Next Door&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Big Little Lies&lt;/i&gt;, you’ll adore this razor-sharp, tense and utterly engrossing page turner about the people we choose to trust and the secrets we keep behind closed doors.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>She was close enough to see that the girl had written a word on the wall in bright, warm red blood. Not a word, actually. A name…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the small American town of Denton is searching for Isabelle Coleman, a missing seventeen-year-old girl. All they’ve found so far is her phone and another girl they didn’t even know was missing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mute and completely unresponsive to the world around her, it’s clear this mysterious girl has been damaged beyond repair. All Detective Josie Quinn can get from her is a name: Ramona.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Currently suspended from the force for misconduct, Josie takes matters into her own hands as the name leads her to evidence linking the two girls. She knows the race is on to find Isabelle alive, and she fears there may be others… &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trail leads Josie to another victim, a girl who escaped but whose case was labelled a hoax by authorities. To catch this monster, Josie must confront her own nightmares and follow her instinct to the darkest of places. But can she make it out alive?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fans of Angela Marsons, Helen Fields and Robert Dugoni will be utterly gripped and sleeping with the lights on once they discover the first in this unputdownable new crime thriller series.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Includes bonus material!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; This winter it’s time to fall in love at Cedarwood Lodge…  &lt;p&gt;After years of dreaming, Clio Winters is finally fulfilling her childhood dream of renovating the gorgeous old Cedarwood Lodge in Evergreen and turning it into the perfect destination for celebrations, weddings and extravagant birthday parties. The huge property used to be a bustling holiday camp, now Clio wants to bring it back to its halcyon days – which will be a lot of hard work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning back to the small town of her youth she’s glad to have one of her best friends still around to lean on, Micah who is just as solid as he used to be. But with her own secrets pushing her to run from her glamorous life in New York, she’ll have to tread carefully, especially when the far-too-handsome-for-his-own-good contractor, Kai, shows up on her doorstep…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure she’s here in Evergreen to change her life, but there is no way she’s falling in love!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Previously published as &lt;em&gt;Celebrations &amp;amp; Confetti&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brides &amp;amp; Bouquets&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Midnight &amp;amp; Mistletoe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>River Alhers is damaged goods. On the surface she's a driven business woman, leading a new division of the marketing firm she works for. But she knows better than anyone that being driven also tends to drive people away. At twenty eight she's made some of the toughest decisions of her life by burying the reason she's damaged deep inside her. That is until she walks into a tattoo parlor and falls into the arms of someone else just as broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Brighton is bad news. He's a tattooed rebel with more money than he needs, and so many scars on his heart, he's sure there's no way to let someone in. Until River, but she's still stuck on her ex and his friend -- Adam Beckerson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Beckerson is a changed man. He's made a successful career for himself and his best friend, Tara, hasn't left his side. She gets him-- the real him that he's never shown anyone, but there's still something missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one of them is beautifully flawed and in one another they can find perfection, if only they are willing to reshape their shattered dreams into new, better ones.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five-year-old &lt;b&gt;Bea&lt;/b&gt; is a hopeless romantic – with a hopeless love life. She’s been single ever since her awful ex broke her heart, and the only thing she gets up to in bed is watching rom coms on her laptop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Bea meets &lt;b&gt;Dan&lt;/b&gt;, who is basically &lt;i&gt;the man of her dreams&lt;/i&gt;, she knows she can’t let him get away. They might not have fireworks, but not everyone can be fighting and (loudly) making up every night, like Bea’s housemates. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Bea can’t shift the feeling that something just isn’t &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;. As time goes on, Dan seems less like Mr Right, and more like Mr Couldn’t-Be-More-Wrong… Will Bea be brave enough to change her dreams – and dare to ask for more?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love only works when your heart is in the right place. Hers could be right next door…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single mom Bridgette Dalton doesn’t have time to stop and smell the roses—not even in her own flower shop. But that doesn’t mean she hasn’t noticed Bodhi Booker. Her ruggedly handsome next-door neighbor would be the perfect candidate for a no-strings fling. Having loved and lost, Bridgette’s not ready to hand over her heart…but she could use a distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bodhi has one rule: never leave anyone behind. As a special operative, he knows that each new mission is more dangerous than the last. He’s never made a promise of forever to a woman, not even to the beautiful widow who has him tied in knots. And if there were anyone who could tempt him into putting down roots, it would be Bridgette and her adorable son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as his next deployment nears, they make a startling discovery. Their passion, meant only for the here and now, might already be blossoming into something more…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time, a woman called Lucy ran a little library with a big heart. It only took one look at the members of her book club for Lucy to see how she could make all their dreams come true…&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full-time carer &lt;b&gt;Lia&lt;/b&gt; dreams of learning to dance, but as her mother becomes more reliant on her, that wish may never come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Widower &lt;b&gt;Oscar&lt;/b&gt; is longing to find the daughter he put up for adoption as a young man, but does she even want to be found? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Single mum &lt;b&gt;Hattie&lt;/b&gt; is overweight and unhappy since her cheating ex-fiancé humiliated her at their engagement party. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sensitive soul &lt;b&gt;Callum&lt;/b&gt; is a hopeless romantic and the black sheep of his family. Will he ever find the courage to fight for what he wants? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lucy has a plan to give these four strangers the happy endings they deserve, and in doing so, she might just find one for herself...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A life-affirming, emotional page-turner that will bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your face. Perfect for fans of Jenny Colgan and Milly Johnson.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A funny, romantic comedy Christmas novella, perfect for fans of Love Actually . . . from the award-winning author of Girl on a Plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love is like a fine perfume. The top note draws you in, an instant attraction, but the Heart Note is the true essence. Like true love – a great perfume should be a woman’s perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that’s what perfume counter manager, Lily Lucas, tells her customers in one of Australia’s largest department stores. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s almost Christmas, the store is bedecked with baubles and Lily has about eleventy billion gifts to wrap and sell. She and her team of spritzer chicks are glamorous, professional and hoping they don’t have to wear the hideous red onesies and reindeer antlers the store manager has in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high point of Lily’s work life is Christos Cyriakos, ex-cop, security guard, possible Greek god. He's a mystery box she’d love to unwrap. But can she trust him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Lily wants for Christmas is to kiss Christos (and more), catch a band of thieves running amok in the store, and live happily ever after. Is that too much to wish for?</description>

  <description>In the coastal city of Nome, under the northern lights, sets exactly the right location for a government-funded secret sector of Cole Enterprise. But that’s not all Alaska has to offer. Amongst the natives is an unsuspecting woman who has been hand selected to join the undercover operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his abrupt departure from Haiti, Eli Bennet never thought he’d see Nova again. The idea of recruiting her as a team medic excited him. There’s only one minor problem… he has no idea how to approach her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nova McCarty knew taking care of her grandmother wouldn’t be easy. Noni’s memory has fizzled to the point where it’s no longer safe for her to live alone. Bumping into Eli was the last thing Nova expected after returning home. But there he was as if she’d pulled him out of her dreams, offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can Nova figure out how to have what she wants without sacrificing a part of herself to get it? Furthermore, will Eli turn his back on the Six in order to stand by Nova when she needs him the most?</description>

  <description>Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic.</description>

  <description>Emma is the proud owner of The Chocolate Shop by the Sea, nestled in the heart of the cosy seaside village that’s become her home. With Christmas right around the corner, she and her assistant Holly are busy cooking up the locals’ festive favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From cinnamon hot chocolates to reindeer lollipops, Christmas wouldn’t taste the same without a little cocoa magic. And for Emma it’s the perfect distraction from her romantic pains of the past. So when the shop’s miserly landlord threatens to hike up the rent, Emma’s Christmas and New Year suddenly look a lot less cheerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the whole village rallying behind her – and loyal spaniel Alfie by her side – Emma’s determined to hold onto her chocolate-box dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chocolate calendar countdown is on. Can Emma rescue her business and her broken heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the little village of Whistling, with its butterscotch cottages and rolling green hills, snow is beginning to fall. Christmas is coming, and Emma Halloway is on her way home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When twenty-eight-year-old food writer &lt;b&gt;Emma Halloway&lt;/b&gt; gets dumped then knocked off her bike, she’s broken in more ways than one, and returns to her family’s cosy cottage in the Yorkshire Dales. Emma hasn’t been back in some time, running from her crazy relatives and her childhood sweetheart, &lt;b&gt;Jack Allen&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma’s grandmother is determined to bake her back to health and happiness, as the Halloways have done for generations. Surrounded by old friends and warm cinnamon buns, Emma starts to believe in her family’s special talents for healing again. But then in walks Jack with his sparkling hazel eyes, stirring up the family feud between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the twinkly lights are strung between the streetlamps, Emma remembers just why she fell for Jack in the first place... and why a Halloway should never date an Allen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infuriating new lodger, &lt;b&gt;Sandro&lt;/b&gt;, doesn’t believe anyone should have to choose between love and family. With a little bit of Christmas magic, can Emma and Jack find a way to be together, or will Emma find herself heartbroken once more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An utterly gorgeous Christmas romance about the importance of family, freshly baked biscuits, and learning to trust your heart. Perfect for fans of Phillipa Ashley, Debbie Johnson and Debbie Macomber.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome to the cosy Comfort Food Café, where there's kindness in every cup of hot chocolate and the menu is sprinkled with love and happiness…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zoe's best friend Kate dies of breast cancer, her whole world is turned upside down. Within hours, she goes from being the wacky neighbour who can barely keep a houseplant alive to a whole new world of responsibility when she realises she's guardian to Kate's 16-year-old daughter, Martha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving to the little village of Budbury in the West Country, Zoe hopes the fresh Dorset sea breeze and the gentle pace of life will help them heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for them both, the friendly community at the Comfort Food Cafe provide listening ears, sage advice, shoulders to cry on, and some truly excellent carrot cake. And when Martha's enigmatic, absent father suddenly turns up, confusing not only Martha but Zoe too, the love and support of their new-found friends is the best present they could ask for…</description>
