  <description>&lt;b&gt;"Sharp, snarky and slick, Visaggio gives us a clever rewind to an unfolding mystery set in the early 80s." –– CHUCK WENDIG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It's 1983, and when mysterious monsters start overtaking a small town in Ohio, it's up to a teenage girl gang to save the day in this new story for fans of &lt;i&gt;Paper Girls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Created by powerhouse team Magdalene Visaggio (&lt;i&gt;Eternity Girl&lt;/i&gt;) and Claudia Aguirre (&lt;i&gt;Kim &amp;amp; Kim&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Morning in America&lt;/i&gt; follows the Sick Sisters, a group of friends and small-time delinquents who may be the only people standing between their suffocatingly small town and complete apocalyptic destruction. The Sisters know there's something wrong in Tucker, Ohio—and they also know that the authorities aren't doing anything about it. When the girls take the investigation into their own hands, they run into wild conspiracy theories, abandoned homes... and something that screeches in the night. At the end of the world, four girls with bikes and baseball bats are there to stand in the way.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Adventures in Babysitting&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; meets &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; in this funny, action-packed novel about a coven of witchy babysitters who realize their calling to protect the innocent and save the world from an onslaught of evil. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seventeen-year-old Esme Pearl has a babysitters club. She knows it's kinda lame, but what else is she supposed to do? Get a job? Gross. Besides, Esme likes babysitting, and she's good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lately Esme needs all the cash she can get, because it seems like destruction follows her wherever she goes. Let's just say she owes some people a new tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Cassandra Heaven. She's Instagram-model hot, dresses like she found her clothes in a dumpster, and has a rebellious streak as gnarly as the cafeteria food. So why is Cassandra willing to do anything, even take on a potty-training two-year-old, to join Esme's babysitters club?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer lies in a mysterious note Cassandra's mother left her: "Find the babysitters. Love, Mom."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, Esme and Cassandra have more in common than they think, and they're about to discover what being a babysitter really means: a heroic lineage of superpowers, magic rituals, and saving the innocent from seriously terrifying evil. And all before the parents get home.</description>

  <description>After being left at the altar, Jade Roberts seeks solace at her best friend's ranch on the Colorado western slope. Her humiliation still ripe, she doesn't expect to be attracted to her friend's reticent brother, but when the gorgeous cowboy kisses her, all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talon Steel is broken. Having never fully healed from a horrific childhood trauma, he simply exists, taking from women what is offered and giving nothing in return...until Jade Roberts catapults into his life. She is beautiful, sweet, and giving, and his desire for her becomes a craving he fears he'll never be able to satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Passion sizzles between the two lovers...but long-buried secrets haunt them both and may eventually tear them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this masterful collection of short fiction, Joe Hill dissects timeless human struggles in thirteen relentless tales of supernatural suspense, including “In The Tall Grass,” one of two stories co-written with Stephen King, basis for the terrifying feature film from Netflix.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little door that opens to a world of fairy tale wonders becomes the blood-drenched stomping ground for a gang of hunters in “Faun.” A grief-stricken librarian climbs behind the wheel of an antique Bookmobile to deliver fresh reads to the dead in “Late Returns.” In “By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain,” two young friends stumble on the corpse of a plesiosaur at the water’s edge, a discovery that forces them to confront the inescapable truth of their own mortality . . . and other horrors that lurk in the water’s shivery depths. And tension shimmers in the sweltering heat of the Nevada desert as a faceless trucker finds himself caught in a sinister dance with a tribe of motorcycle outlaws in “Throttle,” co-written with Stephen King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring two previously unpublished stories, and a brace of shocking chillers, &lt;em&gt;Full Throttle&lt;/em&gt; is a darkly imagined odyssey through the complexities of the human psyche. Hypnotic and disquieting, it mines our tormented secrets, hidden vulnerabilities, and basest fears, and demonstrates this exceptional talent at his very best.</description>

  <description>From Claire C. Holland, a timely collection of poetry that follows the final girl of slasher cinema - the girl who survives until the end - on a journey of retribution and reclamation. From the white picket fences of 1970s Haddonfield to the apocalyptic end of the world, Holland confronts the role of women in relation to subjects including feminism, violence, motherhood, sexuality, and assault in the world of Trump and the MeToo movement. Each poem centers on a fictional character from horror cinema, and explores the many ways in which women find empowerment through their own perceived monstrousness.</description>

  <description>After escaping her kidnappers and destroying the black market where she was held captive, all Nita wants is to find a way to live her life without looking over her shoulder. But with a video of her ability to self-heal all over the dark web, Nita knows she’s still a prime target on the black market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s only one way to keep herself safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nita must make herself so feared that no one would ever dare come after her again. And the best way to start building her reputation? Take her revenge on Fabricio, the boy who sold Nita to her kidnappers. But killing Fabricio is harder than Nita thought it would be, even with Kovit by her side. Now caught in a game of kill or be killed, Nita will do whatever it takes to win.</description>

  <description>In this twisty psychological thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of The Girl Before, an actress plays both sides of a murder investigation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A struggling actor, a Brit in America without a green card, Claire needs work and money to survive. Then she gets both. But nothing like she expected.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Claire agrees to become a decoy for a firm of divorce lawyers. Hired to entrap straying husbands, she must catch them on tape with their seductive propositions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The rules? Never hit on the mark directly. Make it clear you’re available, but he has to proposition you, not the other way around. The firm is after evidence, not coercion. The innocent have nothing to hide.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then the game changes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When the wife of one of Claire’s targets is violently murdered, the cops are sure the husband is to blame. Desperate to catch him before he kills again, they enlist Claire to lure him into a confession.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Claire can do this. She’s brilliant at assuming a voice and an identity. For a woman who’s mastered the art of manipulation, how difficult could it be to tempt a killer into a trap?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But who is the decoy . . . and who is the prey?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Eight gleefully macabre vignettes by an award- winning comics artist, as delightful as they are deadly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the dark imagination of Edward Gorey, &lt;em&gt;Envious Siblings&lt;/em&gt; is a twisted and hauntingly funny debut. Comics artist Landis Blair interweaves absurdist horror and humor into brief, rhyming vignettes at once transgressive and hilarious. In Blair’s surreal universe, a lost child watches as bewhiskered monsters gobble up her fellow train passengers; a band of kids merrily plays a gut-churning game with playground toys; and two sisters, grinning madly, tear each other apart. These charmingly perverse creations take ordinary settings—a living room, a subway car, a playground— and spin them in a nightmarish direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Envious Siblings&lt;/em&gt; heralds a brilliant new cartooning talent, and will captivate readers who have thrilled to the lurid fantasies of Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake, Charles Addams, Shel Silverstein, and Tim Burton.</description>

  <description>A dark, romantic YA suspense novel with an SF edge and plenty of drama, layering the secrets we keep and how appearances can deceive, from the New York Times bestselling author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tiny, terrifying town, the lost are never found. When Araceli Flores Harper is sent to live with her great-aunt Ottilie in her ramshackle Victorian home, the plan is simple. She'll buckle down and get ready for college. Life won't be exciting, but she'll cope, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. From the start, things are very, very wrong. Her great-aunt still leaves food for the husband who went missing twenty years ago, and local businesses are plastered with MISSING posters. There are unexplained lights in the woods and a mysterious lab just beyond the city limits that the locals don't talk about. Ever. When she starts receiving mysterious letters that seem to be coming from the past, she suspects someone of pranking her or trying to drive her out of her mind. To solve these riddles and bring the lost home again, Araceli must delve into a truly diabolical conspiracy, but some secrets fight to stay buried...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A suspense novel from the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Haunting of Maddy Clare...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 1950. &lt;/b&gt;There's a place for the girls whom no one wants--the troublemakers, the illegitimate, the too smart for their own good. It's called Idlewild Hall. And in the small town where it's located, there are rumors that the boarding school is haunted. Four roommates bond over their whispered fears, their budding friendship blossoming--until one of them mysteriously disappears. . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermont, 2014.&lt;/b&gt; As much as she's tried, journalist Fiona Sheridan cannot stop revisiting the events surrounding her older sister's death. Twenty years ago, her body was found lying in the overgrown fields near the ruins of Idlewild Hall. And though her sister's boyfriend was tried and convicted of murder, Fiona can't shake the suspicion that something was never right about the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Fiona discovers that Idlewild Hall is being restored by an anonymous benefactor, she decides to write a story about it. But a shocking discovery during the renovations will link the loss of her sister to secrets that were meant to stay hidden in the past--and a voice that won't be silenced. . . .</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, college student Quincy Carpenter went on vacation with five friends and came back alone, the only survivor of a horror movie–scale massacre. In an instant, she became a member of a club no one wants to belong to—a group of similar survivors known in the press as the Final Girls. Lisa, who lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout's knife; Sam, who went up against the Sack Man during her shift at the Nightlight Inn; and now Quincy, who ran bleeding through the woods to escape Pine Cottage and the man she refers to only as Him. The three girls are all attempting to put their nightmares behind them, and, with that, one another. Despite the media's attempts, they never meet.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Now, Quincy is doing well—maybe even great, thanks to her Xanax prescription. She has a caring almost-fiancé, Jeff; a popular baking blog; a beautiful apartment; and a therapeutic presence in Coop, the police officer who saved her life all those years ago. Her memory won’t even allow her to recall the events of that night; the past is in the past. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; That is, until Lisa, the first Final Girl, is found dead in her bathtub, wrists slit, and Sam, the second, appears on Quincy's doorstep. Blowing through Quincy's life like a whirlwind, Sam seems intent on making Quincy relive the past, with increasingly dire consequences, all of which makes Quincy question why Sam is really seeking her out. And when new details about Lisa's death come to light, Quincy's life becomes a race against time as she tries to unravel Sam's truths from her lies, evade the police and hungry reporters, and, most crucially, remember what really happened at Pine Cottage, before what was started ten years ago is finished.</description>

  <description>Two Truths and a Lie. The girls played it all the time in their tiny cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. The games ended when Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin in the dead of night. The last she—or anyone—saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings—massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. The paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the socialite and wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale. When Francesca implores her to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor, Emma sees an opportunity to try to find out what really happened to her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it's immediately clear that all is not right at Camp Nightingale. Already haunted by memories from fifteen years ago, Emma discovers a security camera pointed directly at her cabin, mounting mistrust from Francesca and, most disturbing of all, cryptic clues Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing threats from both man and nature in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale, the more she realizes it may come at a deadly price.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You trust her with your family. Would you trust her with your life?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark and Melissa Cain are thrilled to have found Jade, a babysitter who is brilliant with their young children. Having seen her own house burn to the ground, Jade needs them as much as they need her. Moving Jade into the family home can only be a good thing, can’t it? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Mark works long hours as a police officer and Melissa struggles with running a business, the family become ever more reliant on their babysitter, who is only too happy to help. And as Melissa begins to slip into depression, it’s Jade who is left picking up the pieces. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But Mark soon notices things aren’t quite as they seem. Things at home feel wrong, and as Mark begins to investigate their seemingly perfect sitter, what he discovers shocks him to his core. He’s met Jade before. And now he suspects he might know what she wants … &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mark is in a race against time to protect his family. &lt;b&gt;But what will he find as he goes back to his family home?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casey McQuiston's Red, White &amp;amp; Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.</description>

  <description>Whenever another kid goes missing in October, the Pender kids know what is really behind it: a horrific monster out in the marshes they have named the Mumbler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s what Clara’s new crew tells her when she moves to town: Bree and Sage, who take her under their wing; spirited Trace, who has taken the lead on this year’s Halloween prank war; and magnetic Kincaid, whose devil-may-care attitude and air of mystery are impossible for Clara to resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clara doesn’t actually believe in the Mumbler. But as Halloween gets closer and tensions build in the town, it’s hard to shake the feeling that there really is something dark and dangerous in Pender, lurking in the shadows, waiting to bring the stories to life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Best-selling author and mortician Caitlin Doughty answers real questions from kids about death, dead bodies, and decomposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day, funeral director Caitlin Doughty receives dozens of questions about death. What would happen to an astronaut’s body if it were pushed out of a space shuttle? Do people poop when they die? Can Grandma have a Viking funeral?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?&lt;/em&gt;, Doughty blends her mortician’s knowledge of the body and the intriguing history behind common misconceptions about corpses to offer factual, hilarious, and candid answers to thirty-five distinctive questions posed by her youngest fans. In her inimitable voice, Doughty details lore and science of what happens to, and inside, our bodies after we die. Why do corpses groan? What causes bodies to turn colors during decomposition? And why do hair and nails appear longer after death? Readers will learn the best soil for mummifying your body, whether you can preserve your best friend’s skull as a keepsake, and what happens when you die on a plane. Beautifully illustrated by Dianné Ruz, &lt;em&gt;Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?&lt;/em&gt; shows us that death is science and art, and only by asking questions can we begin to embrace it.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Moxie girls fight back!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian Carter is fed up. Fed up with her small-town Texas high school that thinks the football team can do no wrong. Fed up with sexist dress codes and hallway harassment. But most of all, Viv Carter is fed up with always following the rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viv’s mom was a punk rock Riot Grrrl in the ’90s, so now Viv takes a page from her mother’s past and creates a feminist zine that she distributes anonymously to her classmates. She’s just blowing off steam, but other girls respond. Pretty soon Viv is forging friendships with other young women across the divides of cliques and popularity rankings, and she realizes that what she has started is nothing short of a girl revolution.</description>

  <description>Senior Rianne Hettrick-Wynne has had her share of hookups and parties in small-town Wereford, Minnesota. Now volleyball season is over and her once-solid friendships are unraveling, while an all-of-a-sudden relationship with Luke Pinsky is weirdly becoming serious. Add to that the possibility of getting kicked out of her house, and Rianne is desperate to make a plan that doesn’t include going to college or working at Planet Tan for the rest of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, her divorced parents have started cohabiting again without any explanation, making Rianne wonder why they’re so intent on pointing out every bad choice she makes when they can’t even act like adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s not the only question she can’t answer: How is it that Sergei, a broken-English-speaking Russian who makes his own vodka, is the only one who seems to understand her? And why, when she has Luke, the most unattainable boy in Wereford, all to herself, does she want anything but?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps most confounding is the “easy girl” reputation that Rianne has gotten stuck with by doing the same things that guys do without judgment or consequence. If they’re just being guys, then why can’t Rianne just be a girl?</description>

  &lt;b&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of Hekla's Children comes a dark and haunting tale of our world and the next.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fleeing from a traumatic break-in, Londoners Paul and Tricia Feenan sell up to escape to the isolated Holiwell village where Tricia has inherited a property. Scattered throughout the settlement are centuries-old stones used during the Great Plague as boundary markers. No plague-sufferer was permitted to pass them and enter the village. The plague diminished, and the village survived unscathed, but since then each year the village trustees have insisted on an ancient ceremony to renew the village boundaries, until a misguided act by the Feenans' son then reminds the village that there is a reason traditions have been rigidly stuck to, and that all acts of betrayal, even those committed centuries ago, have consequences...</description>

  <description>"A castle, a killer, and prey all bound and blurred by lust and blood."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many before her that have never come back, she's made it to the Countess' castle determined to snuff out the horror, but she could never be prepared for what hides within its turrets; what unfurls under its fluttering flags. Emily Carroll has fashioned a rich gothic horror charged with eroticism that doesn't just make your skin crawl, it crawls into it.</description>

  <description>For Xavier Pastrano, music and poetry have played a significant role throughout his life, but the roles they played were always separate. Noticing this divide, he set out to find a creative way to merge the two and create a product that would present a unique experience for readers. In Seeing Sounds, Pastrano attempts to create a chapbook that works as a mixed CD of sorts. The collection features 15 poems and illustrations that were inspired by songs, all carefully curated by Pastrano. To add to the experience, a Spotify playlist of the songs that inspired the poems and art was created, allowing readers to experience the book both aurally and visually and giving them the opportunity to create a personalized reading and listening experience.</description>

  <description>In her third collection of poetry, &lt;b&gt;Viper Rum&lt;/b&gt;, Mary Karr delves into autobiographical subject matter; various beloveds are birthed and buried in these touching lyrics, some of which, as the title suggests, deal with drink:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cast back to those last years&lt;br /&gt;I drank, alone nights at the kitchen sink, &lt;br /&gt;bathrobed, my head hatching snakes, &lt;br /&gt; while my baby slept in his upstairs cage&lt;br /&gt;and my marriage choked to death&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precise and surprising, Karr's poems "take on the bedevilments of fate and grief with a diabolical edge of their own" &lt;b&gt;(Poetry)&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included is Karr's controversial and prize-winning essay "Against Decoration," in which she took aim against the verbal ornaments that too often pass for poetry these days-the "new formalism" that elevates form to an end itself.</description>

  <description>The breakout star of this summer's blockbuster Avengers film, Clint Barton - aka the self-made hero Hawkeye - fights for justice! With ex-Young Avenger Kate Bishop by his side, he's out to prove himself as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes! SHIELD recruits Clint to intercept a packet of incriminating evidence - before he becomes the most wanted man in the world. You won't believe what is on The Tape! What is the Vagabond Code? Matt Fraction pens a Hawkeye thriller that spans the globe...and the darkest parts of Hawkeye's mind. Barton and Bishop mean double the Hawkeye and double the trouble...and stealing from the rich never looked so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Hawkeye&lt;i&gt; 1-5, &lt;i&gt;Young Avengers Presents&lt;/i&gt; 6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>First came &lt;i&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/i&gt;. Then came &lt;i&gt;Dry&lt;/i&gt;. Now, there's &lt;i&gt;Lust &amp;amp; Wonder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In chronicling the development and demise of the different relationships he's had while living in New York, Augusten Burroughs examines what it means to be in love, what it means to be in lust, and what it means to be figuring it all out. With Augusten's unique and singular observations and his own unabashed way of detailing both the horrific and the humorous, &lt;i&gt;Lust and Wonder &lt;/i&gt;is an intimate and honest memoir that his legions of fans have been waiting for.</description>

  <description>Anna Akhmatova lived through pre-revolution Russia, Bolshevism, and Stalinism. Throughout it all, she maintained an elegant, muscular style that could grab a reader by the throat at a moment’s notice. Defined by tragedy and beauty in equal measure, her poems take on romantic frustration and the pull of the sensory, and find power in the mundane. Above all, she believed that a Russian poet could only produce poetry in Russia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Will Hear Thunder&lt;/i&gt; spans Akhmatova’s very early career into the early 1960s. These poems were written through her bohemian prerevolution days, her many marriages, the terror and privation of life under Stalin, and her later years, during which she saw her work once again recognized by the Soviet state. Intricately observed and unwavering in their emotional immediacy, these strikingly modern poems represent one of the twentieth century’s most powerful voices.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the number one &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author comes another stunning memoir that is tender, touching...and just a little spooky. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Here’s a partial list of things I don’t believe in: God. The Devil. Heaven. Hell. Bigfoot. Ancient Aliens. Past lives. Life after death. Vampires. Zombies. Reiki. Homeopathy. Rolfing. Reflexology. Note that 'witches' and 'witchcraft' are absent from this list. The thing is, I wouldn’t believe in them, and I would privately ridicule any idiot who did, except for one thing: I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; a witch."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as Augusten Burroughs could remember, he knew things he shouldn't have known. He manifested things that shouldn't have come to pass. And he told exactly no one about this, save one person: his mother. His mother reassured him that it was all perfectly normal, that he was descended from a long line of witches, going back to the days of the early American colonies. And that this family tree was filled with witches. It was a bond that he and his mother shared--until the day she left him in the care of her psychiatrist to be raised in his family (but that's a whole other story). After that, Augusten was on his own. On his own to navigate the world of this tricky power; on his own to either use or misuse this gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the hilarious to the terrifying, &lt;i&gt;Toil &amp;amp; Trouble&lt;/i&gt; is a chronicle of one man's journey to understand himself, to reconcile the powers he can wield with things with which he is helpless. There are very few things that are coincidences, as you will learn in &lt;i&gt;Toil &amp;amp; Trouble.&lt;/i&gt; Ghosts are real, trees can want to kill you, beavers are the spawn of Satan, houses are alive, and in the end, love is the most powerful magic of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The next novel of psychological suspense and obsession from the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seeking women ages 18–32 to participate in a study on ethics and morality. Generous compensation. Anonymity guaranteed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jessica Farris signs up for a psychology study conducted by the mysterious Dr. Shields, she thinks all she’ll have to do is answer a few questions, collect her money, and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #1: Could you tell a lie without feeling guilt?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the questions grow more and more intense and invasive and the sessions become outings where Jess is told what to wear and how to act, she begins to feel as though Dr. Shields may know what she’s thinking… and what she’s hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #2: Have you ever deeply hurt someone you care about?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jess’s paranoia grows, it becomes clear that she can no longer trust what in her life is real, and what is one of Dr. Shields’ manipulative experiments. Caught in a web of deceit and jealousy, Jess quickly learns that some obsessions can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question #3: Should a punishment always fit the crime?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the authors of the blockbuster bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Wife Between Us&lt;/i&gt; comes an electrifying new novel about doubt, passion, and just how much you can trust someone.</description>

  <description>No visitors. No nights spent away from the apartment. No disturbing the other residents, all of whom are rich or famous or both. These are the only rules for Jules Larsen's new job as an apartment sitter at the Bartholomew, one of Manhattan's most high-profile and mysterious buildings. Recently heartbroken and just plain broke, Jules is taken in by the splendor of her surroundings and accepts the terms, ready to leave her past life behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she gets to know the residents and staff of the Bartholomew, Jules finds herself drawn to fellow apartment sitter Ingrid, who comfortingly, disturbingly reminds her of the sister she lost eight years ago. When Ingrid confides that the Bartholomew is not what it seems and the dark history hidden beneath its gleaming facade is starting to frighten her, Jules brushes it off as a harmless ghost story—until the next day, when Ingrid disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth about Ingrid's disappearance, Jules digs deeper into the Bartholomew's dark past and into the secrets kept within its walls. Her discovery that Ingrid is not the first apartment sitter to go missing at the Bartholomew pits Jules against the clock as she races to unmask a killer, expose the building's hidden past, and escape the Bartholomew before her temporary status becomes permanent.</description>

  <description>This best-selling debut by an award-winning writer is both an eerie contemporary ghost story and a dread-inducing psychological thriller. Maggie is a successful young artist who has had bad luck with men. Her last put her in the hospital and, after she’s healed physically, left her needing to get out of London to heal mentally and find a place of quiet that will restore her creative spirit. On the rugged west coast of Ireland, perched on a wild cliff side, she spies the shell of a cottage that dates back to Great Famine and decides to buy it. When work on the house is done, she invites her dealer to come for the weekend to celebrate along with a couple of women friends, one of whom will become his wife. On the boozy last night, the other friend pulls out an Ouija board. What sinister thing they summon, once invited, will never go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ireland is a country haunted by its past. In Billy O'Callaghan's hands, its terrible beauty becomes a force of inescapable horror that reaches far back in time, before the Famine, before Christianity, to a pagan place where nature and superstition are bound in an endless knot.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A horror story about friendship, growing up, and finding a place in the world: &lt;i&gt;Gremlins&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; by way of Stephen King and &lt;i&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1982, the summer before seventh grade. &lt;/b&gt;Five kids with nothing in common--Sep, Arkle, Hadley, Lamb, and Mack--become instant friends. On the last day of summer, they find a stone box buried in the forest, and each places an object inside to seal their friendship. And they make rules:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never come to the box alone. &lt;br /&gt;Never open it after dark. &lt;br /&gt;Never take back your sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1986, the summer before eleventh grade.&lt;/b&gt; The five haven't spoken since that day in 1982. Sep has gone through the past four years alone and plans to escape to boarding school. But strange things are happening--mirrors are breaking unexpectedly, electricity is flickering in and out, and people are coming down with inexplicable physical ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone has broken the rules. And it seems the five committed more than objects to the box's ancient stone--they gave it their deepest secrets and darkest fears, and now these are being returned in a flood of shambling corpses, murderous toys, and undead pets. The gang must reunite in an attempt to discover the secrets of the sacrifice box--and Sep might be the only one who can stem its tide of evil before it's too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even Death cares about his work-life balance...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death never takes a day off. Until he gets a letter from the HR department insisting he use up his accrued vacation time, that is. In this humorous and heartfelt book from beloved illustrator Brian Rea, readers take a peek at Death's journal entries as he documents his mandatory sabbatical in the world of the living. From sky diving to online dating, Death is determined to try it all! &lt;em&gt;Death Wins a Goldfish&lt;/em&gt; is an important reminder to the overstressed, overworked, and overwhelmed that everyone—even Death—deserves a break once in a while. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you enjoyed Brian Rea's work in Mary Karr's &lt;em&gt;The Liars' Club: A Memoir&lt;/em&gt; or in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;' popular &lt;em&gt;Modern Love&lt;/em&gt; column you'll love his delightful illustrations of Death in this funny, heartfelt collection of works.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is a great gift or self-purchase if you're looking for:&lt;br /&gt;Funny Books&lt;br /&gt;Funny Comics&lt;br /&gt;Humor Books</description>

  <description>In an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a freshman girl stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry her away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital. Then a second girl falls asleep, and then another, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled, and stores begin to run out of supplies. A quarantine is established. The National Guard is summoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mei, an outsider in the cliquish hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrust together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate. Two visiting professors try to protect their newborn baby as the once-quiet streets descend into chaos. A father succumbs to the illness, leaving his daughters to fend for themselves. And at the hospital, a new life grows within a college girl, unbeknownst to her—even as she sleeps. A psychiatrist, summoned from Los Angeles, attempts to make sense of the illness as it spreads through the town. Those infected are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, more than has ever been recorded. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?</description>

  <description>J is a student at a school deep in a forest far away from the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; J is one of only twenty-six students, all of whom think of the school’s enigmatic founder as their father. J’s peers are the only family he has ever had. The students are being trained to be prodigies of art, science, and athletics, and their life at the school is all they know—and all they are allowed to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But J suspects that there is something out there, beyond the pines, that the founder does not want him to see, and he’s beginning to ask questions. What is the real purpose of this place? Why can the students never leave? And what secrets is their father hiding from them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, on the other side of the forest, in a school very much like J’s, a girl named K is asking the same questions. J has never seen a girl, and K has never seen a boy. As K and J work to investigate the secrets of their two strange schools, they come to discover something even more mysterious: each other.</description>

  <description>Jedidiah Jenkins is a farmer--but his cash crop isn't corn or soy. Jed grows fast-healing, plug-and-play human organs. Lose a finger? Need a new liver? He's got you covered. Unfortunately, strange produce isn't the only thing Jed's got buried. Deep in the soil of the Jenkins Family Farm, something dark has taken root, and it's beginning to bloom. From ROB GUILLORY, Eisner-winning co-creator and artist of Image Comics' CHEW, comes a new dark comedy about science gone sinister and agriculture gone apocalyptic. Nature is a Mother...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects FARMHAND #1-5.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  &lt;b&gt;A chilling ghost story with a twist: the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Winter People&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; returns to the woods of Vermont to tell the story of a husband and wife who don't simply move into a haunted house, they start building one from scratch, without knowing it, until it's too late . . . &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate abandon the comforts of suburbia and their teaching jobs to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project: building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this charming property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. As Helen starts carefully sourcing decorative building materials for her home--wooden beams, mantles, historic bricks--she starts to unearth, and literally conjure, the tragic lives of Hattie's descendants, three generations of "Breckenridge women," each of whom died amidst suspicion, and who seem to still be seeking something precious and elusive in the present day.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the comedian, actor, and former host of &lt;i&gt;The Late Late Show&lt;/i&gt; comes an irreverent, lyrical memoir in essays featuring his signature wit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Craig Ferguson has defied the odds his entire life. He has failed when he should have succeeded and succeeded when he should have failed. The fact that he is neither dead nor in a locked facility (at the time of printing) is something of a miracle in itself. In Craig's candid and revealing memoir, readers will get a look into the mind and recollections of the unique and twisted Scottish American who became a national hero for pioneering the world's first TV robot skeleton sidekick and reviving two dudes in a horse suit dancing as a form of entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Riding the Elephant&lt;/i&gt;, there are some stories that are too graphic for television, too politically incorrect for social media, or too meditative for a stand-up comedy performance. Craig discusses his deep love for his native Scotland, examines his profound psychic change brought on by fatherhood, and looks at aging and mortality with a perspective that he was incapable of as a younger man. Each story is strung together in a colorful tapestry that ultimately reveals a complicated man who has learned to process--and even enjoy--the unusual trajectory of his life.</description>

  <description>Rumor has it that the abandoned house by the cemetery is haunted by the ghost of a witch. But rumors won’t stop carpenter Mike Kostner from rehabbing the place as a haunted house attraction. Soon he’ll learn that fresh wood and nails can’t keep decades of rumors down. There are noises in the walls, and fresh blood on the floor: secrets that would be better not to discover. And behind the rumors is a real ghost who will do whatever it takes to ensure the house reopens. She needs people to fill her house on Halloween. There’s a dark, horrible ritual to fulfill. Because while the witch may have been dead... she doesn’t intend to stay that way.</description>

  <description>A compulsively readable collection of short stories that explore the complex—and often darkly funny—connections between gender, sex, and power across genres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Know You Want This&lt;/i&gt; brilliantly explores the ways in which women are horrifying as much as it captures the horrors that are done to them. Among its pages are a couple who becomes obsessed with their friend &lt;i&gt;hearing&lt;/i&gt; them have sex, then &lt;i&gt;seeing&lt;/i&gt; them have sex…until they can’t have sex without him; a ten-year-old whose birthday party takes a sinister turn when she wishes for “something mean”; a woman who finds a book of spells half hidden at the library and summons her heart’s desire: a nameless, naked man; and a self-proclaimed “biter” who dreams of sneaking up behind and sinking her teeth into a green-eyed, long-haired, pink-cheeked coworker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spanning a range of genres and topics—from the mundane to the murderous and supernatural—these are stories about sex and punishment, guilt and anger, the pleasure and terror of inflicting and experiencing pain. These stories fascinate and repel, revolt and arouse, scare and delight in equal measure. And, as a collection, they point a finger at you, daring you to feel uncomfortable—or worse, understood—as if to say, “You want this, right? You know you want this.”</description>

  <description>Jack didn’t know what to call the nameless, skeletal creature that slunk into her house in the dead of night, stealing the very things she loved the most. So she named him The Toy Thief… There’s something in Jack’s past that she doesn’t want to face, an evil presence that forever changed the trajectory of her family. It all began when The Toy Thief appeared, a being drawn by goodness and innocence, eager to feed on everything Jack holds dear. What began as a mystery spirals out of control when her brother, Andy, is taken away in the night, and Jack must venture into the dark place where the toys go to get him back. But even if she finds him, will he ever be the same?</description>

  <description>Echo Ridge is small-town America. Ellery's never been there, but she's heard all about it. Her aunt went missing there at age seventeen. And only five years ago, a homecoming queen put the town on the map when she was killed. Now Ellery has to move there to live with a grandmother she barely knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The town is picture-perfect, but it's hiding secrets. And before school even begins for Ellery, someone's declared open season on homecoming, promising to make it as dangerous as it was five years ago. Then, almost as if to prove it, another girl goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellery knows all about secrets. Her mother has them; her grandmother does too. And the longer she's in Echo Ridge, the clearer it becomes that everyone there is hiding something. The thing is, secrets are dangerous--and most people aren't good at keeping them. Which is why in Echo Ridge, it's safest to keep your secrets to yourself.</description>

  <description>Marjorie Glatt feels like a ghost. A practical thirteen year old in charge of the family laundry business, her daily routine features unforgiving customers, unbearable P.E. classes, and the fastidious Mr. Saubertuck who is committed to destroying everything she’s worked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendell is a ghost. A boy who lost his life much too young, his daily routine features ineffective death therapy, a sheet-dependent identity, and a dangerous need to seek purpose in the forbidden human world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their worlds collide, Marjorie is confronted by unexplainable disasters as Wendell transforms Glatt’s Laundry into his midnight playground, appearing as a mere sheet during the day. While Wendell attempts to create a new afterlife for himself, he unknowingly sabotages the life that Marjorie is struggling to maintain.</description>

  <description>Mila is a solitary teenager ready to put another boring summer vacation behind her until she meets Agnes, an adventurous girl who turns out to be a ghost. And not just a regular ghost, but one carrying the essence of an ancient fallen king and a mouth full of teeth that used to be his guardian warriors.    Three-time Eisner Award–nominated writer/artist Tony Sandoval presents a wondrous world of secret places and dreamlike magic hidden in the everyday corners of our sleeping imagination.</description>

  <description>In small town Michigan, Penny, an aspiring journalist, teams up with the nerdy boy-next-door and the town’s star quarterback to find her conspiracy theorist father after he goes missing and several other townspeople turn up dead in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeper she digs, the weirder things start to get. Townspeople repeat the same phrases—verbatim. Men in black suits stroll around Main Street. Chunks of her memory go missing. Pretty soon, Penny’s research leads her to the long-ago meteorite crash in Bone Lake’s woods, and she’s going to have to reconsider her definition of “real” if she wants answers. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dexter&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;This Savage Song&lt;/i&gt; in this dark fantasy about a girl who sells magical body parts on the black market — until she’s betrayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nita doesn’t murder supernatural beings and sell their body parts on the internet—her mother does that. Nita just dissects the bodies after they’ve been “acquired.” But when her mom brings home a live specimen, Nita decides she wants out — dissecting living people is a step too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when she tries to save her mother’s victim, she ends up sold on the black market in his place — because Nita herself is a supernatural being. Now Nita is on the other side of the bars, and there is no line she won’t cross to escape and make sure no one can ever capture her again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nita did a good deed, and it cost her everything. Now she’s going to do a lot of bad deeds to get it all back.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Nothing is Okay&lt;/em&gt; is the second full-length poetry collection by Rachel Wiley, whose work simultaneously deconstructs the lies that we were taught about our bodies and our beings, and builds new ways of viewing ourselves. As she delves into queerness, feminism, fatness, dating, and race, Wiley molds these topics into a punching critique of culture and a celebration of self. A fat positive activist, Wiley's work soars and challenges the bounds of bodies and hearts, and the ways we carry them.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;He calls me into his office and closes the door . . . to promote me. He promotes me again and again. I am wild with ecstasy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Imagine a world where erotica was written by feminists: Their daydreams include equal pay, a gender-balanced Congress, and Tom Hardy arriving at their doorstep to deliver a fresh case of LaCroix every week.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Both light-hearted and empowering, &lt;i&gt;New Erotica for Feminists&lt;/i&gt; is a sly, satirical take on all the things that turn feminists on. From a retelling of Adam and Eve to tales of respectful Tinder dates,&lt;i&gt; New Erotica for Feminists &lt;/i&gt;answers the question of “What do women &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want?” with stories of power, equality, and an immortal Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this "bone-chillingly cool crime debut" (Paula Hawkins, author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;), a young biologist studying the remote Swedish wetlands stumbles upon a body--and finds that if the marsh's secrets can't stay buried, neither can hers...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the remote Swedish wetlands lies Mossmarken: the village on the edge of the mire where, once upon a time, people came to leave offerings to the gods.&lt;br /&gt;Biologist Nathalie came in order to study the peat bogs. But she has a secret: Mossmarken was once her home, a place where terrible things happened. She has returned at last, determined to confront her childhood trauma and find out the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after her arrival, she finds an unconscious man out on the marsh, his pockets filled with gold--just like the ancient human sacrifices. A grave is dug in the mire, which vanishes a day after. And as the police investigate, the bodies start to surface...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the mire calling out for sacrifices, as the superstitious locals claim? Or is it an all-too-human evil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richly atmospheric and haunting to the last page, Susanne Jansson's stunning debut is a gripping tale of the power of nature to shape our reality, the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the world, and the terrible consequences they may have. This international sensation will captivate fans of the celebrated suspense fiction of Jane Harper or Tana French.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Sometimes dead is better....When the Creeds move into a beautiful old house in rural Maine, it all seems too good to be true: physician father, beautiful wife, charming little daughter, adorable infant son -- and now an idyllic home. As a family, they've got it all...right down to the friendly cat. But the nearby woods hide a blood-chilling truth -- more terrifying than death itself...and hideously more powerful.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second book in the Ghost Roads series returns to the highways of America, where hitchhiking ghost Rose Marshall continues her battle with her killer--the immortal Bobby Cross.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Rose Marshall, life began when it ended. She has friends, a home, and a purpose in the strange twilight where she spends her afterlife. Sure, she's an urban legend who didn't live to see her eighteenth birthday, but she's had time to adapt, and while things could be better, she's pretty happy with her lot in death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least until Bobby Cross--the man who killed her in the first place--plays his ultimate card in the hole, resulting in her untimely, unwanted resurrection. Suddenly breathing and worse, suddenly mortal, Rose must find a way to solve the riddle she never wanted to contend with: how does a living dead girl make it back to the ghostroads without actually dying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her quest will make allies out of enemies and enemies out of allies as she runs from the lands of the living to the lands of the dead, trying to find a way safely home...and safely back to her grave.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now in a new redesigned edition, featuring an updated introduction from the author and songs!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose Marshall died in 1952 in Buckley Township, Michigan, run off the road by a man named Bobby Cross--a man who had sold his soul to live forever, and intended to use her death to pay the price of his immortality. Trouble was, he didn't ask Rose what she thought of the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been more than sixty years since that night, and she's still sixteen, and she's still running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have names for her all over the country: the Girl in the Diner. The Phantom Prom Date. The Girl in the Green Silk Gown. Mostly she just goes by "Rose," a hitchhiking ghost girl with her thumb out and her eyes fixed on the horizon, trying to outrace a man who never sleeps, never stops, and never gives up on the idea of claiming what's his. She's the angel of the overpass, she's the darling of the truck stops, and she's going to figure out a way to win her freedom. After all, it's not like it can kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't kill what's already dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Takes a slice of mid-twentieth-century Americana and exposes it as an utter and ongoing gender inequality nightmare. Electric, tense, horrifying, and a righteously angry yowl.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Paul Tremblay, author of &lt;i&gt;A Head Full of Ghosts&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Cabin at the End of the World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seventeen, June Hardie is everything a young woman in 1951 shouldn’t be—independent, rebellious, a dreamer. June longs to travel, to attend college and to write the dark science fiction stories that consume her waking hours. But her parents only care about making June a better young woman. Her mother grooms her to be a perfect little homemaker while her father pushes her to marry his business partner’s domineering son. When June resists, her whole world is shattered—suburbia isn’t the only prison for &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; women…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June’s parents commit her to Burrow Place Asylum, aka the Institution. With its sickening conditions, terrifying staff and brutal “medical treatments,” the Institution preys on June’s darkest secrets and deepest fears. And she’s not alone. The Institution terrorizes June’s fragile roommate, Eleanor, and the other women locked away within its crumbling walls. Those who dare speak up disappear…or worse. Trapped between a gruesome reality and increasingly sinister hallucinations, June isn’t sure where her nightmares end and real life begins. But she does know one thing: in order to survive, she must destroy the Institution before it finally claims them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Nightingale is a beautifully constructed novel featuring out-of-this-world suspense, a classic Stephen King vibe and an edge all its own. If that wasn't enough, its powerful portrayal of gender roles and feminism makes it all too timely and important.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—Courtney Summers, author of &lt;i&gt;Sadie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;This Is Not a Test&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A missing girl on a journey of revenge. A &lt;i&gt;Serial&lt;/i&gt;―like podcast following the clues she's left behind. And an ending you won't be able to stop talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadie hasn't had an easy life. Growing up on her own, she's been raising her sister Mattie in an isolated small town, trying her best to provide a normal life and keep their heads above water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Mattie is found dead, Sadie's entire world crumbles. After a somewhat botched police investigation, Sadie is determined to bring her sister's killer to justice and hits the road following a few meager clues to find him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When West McCray―a radio personality working on a segment about small, forgotten towns in America―overhears Sadie's story at a local gas station, he becomes obsessed with finding the missing girl. He starts his own podcast as he tracks Sadie's journey, trying to figure out what happened, hoping to find her before it's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courtney Summers has written the breakout book of her career. Sadie is propulsive and harrowing and will keep you riveted until the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;True Detective&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/i&gt; in this gripping YA mystery debut about one girl’s exorcism—and her desperate quest to reunite with her demon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clare has been miserable since her exorcism. The preacher that rid her of evil didn’t understand that her demon—simply known as Her—was like a sister to Clare. Now, Clare will do almost anything to get Her back. After a chance encounter with the son of the preacher who exorcised her, Clare goes on an adventure through the dark underbelly of her small Southern town, discovering its deep-seated occult roots. As she searches for Her, she must question the fine lines between good and evil, love and hate, and religion and free will. Vivid and sharp, &lt;i&gt;The Good Demon&lt;/i&gt; tells the unusual story of friendship amid dark Gothic horror.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>Bina has never forgotten the time she and her mother ran away from home. Her mother promised they would hitchhike to the city to escape Bina’s cruel father and start over. But before they could even leave town, Bina had a new stepfather and two new stepsisters, and a humming sense of betrayal pulling apart the bond with her mother—a bond Bina thought was unbreakable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eight years later, after too many lies and with trouble on her heels, Bina finds herself on the side of the road again, the city of her dreams calling for her. She has an old suitcase, a fresh black eye, and a room waiting for her at Catherine House, a young women’s residence in Greenwich Village with a tragic history, a vow of confidentiality, and dark, magical secrets. There, Bina is drawn to her enigmatic downstairs neighbor Monet, a girl who is equal parts intriguing and dangerous. As Bina’s lease begins to run out, and nightmare and memory get tangled, she will be forced to face the terrible truth of why she’s come to Catherine House and what it will take for her to leave...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poet, writer, and Instagram sensation Nikita Gill returns with a collection of fairytales poetically retold for a new generation of women. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Traditional fairytales are rife with cliches and gender stereotypes: beautiful, silent princesses; ugly, jealous, and bitter villainesses; girls who need rescuing; and men who take all the glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But in this rousing new prose and poetry collection, Nikita Gill gives Once Upon a Time a much-needed modern makeover. Through her gorgeous reimagining of fairytale classics and spellbinding original tales, she dismantles the old-fashioned tropes that have been ingrained in our minds. In this book, gone are the docile women and male saviors. Instead, lines blur between heroes and villains. You will meet fearless princesses, a new kind of wolf lurking in the concrete jungle, and an independent Gretel who can bring down monsters on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Complete with beautifully hand-drawn illustrations by Gill herself, &lt;i&gt;Fierce Fairytales&lt;/i&gt; is an empowering collection of poems and stories for a new generation.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old Molly and her ten-year-old brother, Michael, have never liked their seven-year-old stepsister, Heather. Ever since their parents got married, she's made Molly and Michael's life miserable. Now their parents have moved them all to the country to live in a house that used to be a church, with a cemetery in the backyard. If that's not bad enough, Heather starts talking to a ghost named Helen and warning Molly and Michael that Helen is coming for them. Molly feels certain Heather is in some kind of danger, but every time she tries to help, Heather twists things around to get her into trouble. It seems as if things can't get any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they do -- when Helen comes.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first and only comic book artist ever to win a National Book Award returns with a haunting tale of intimacy, guilt, and collective amnesia.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sun sets on the 1970s, the spirit of the Love Generation still lingers among the aging hippies of one "intentional community" high in the Ozarks. But what's missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under impossibly close scrutiny, two families wrestle with long-repressed secrets... while deep within those Arkansas hills, something monstrous stirs, ready to feast on village whispers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nate Powell, artist of the National Book Award-winning &lt;i&gt;March&lt;/i&gt; trilogy returns with a new creator-owned graphic novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Meddling Kids&lt;/i&gt; comes a brilliantly subversive and comic thriller celebrating noir detectives, &lt;i&gt;Die Hard&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/i&gt;, and the worst case of sibling rivalry.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a dingy office in Fisherman's Wharf, the glass panel in the door bears the names of A. Kimrean and Z. Kimrean. Private Eyes. Behind the door there is only one desk, one chair, one scrawny androgynous P.I. in a tank top and skimpy waistcoat. A.Z., as they are collectively known, are twin brother and sister. He's pure misanthropic logic, she's wild hedonistic creativity. A.Z. have been locked in mortal battle since they were in utero...which is tricky because they, very literally, share one single body. That's right. One body, two pilots. The mystery and absurdity of how Kimrean functions, and how they subvert every plotline, twist, explosion, and gunshot--and confuse every cop, neckless thug, cartel boss, ninja, and femme fatale--in the book is pure Cantero magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone is murdering the sons of the ruthless drug cartel boss known as the Lyon in the biggest baddest town in California--San Carnal. The notorious A.Z. Kimrean must go to the sin-soaked, palm-tree-lined streets of San Carnal, infiltrate the Lyon's inner circle, and find out who is targeting his heirs, and while they are at it, rescue an undercover cop in too deep, deal with a plucky young stowaway, and stop a major gang war from engulfing California. They'll face every plot device and break every rule Elmore Leonard wrote before they can crack the case, if they don't kill each other (themselves) first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Body's Not Big Enough for Both of Us&lt;/i&gt; is a mind-blowing, gender-bending, genre-smashing romp through the entire pantheon of action and noir. It is also a bold, tautly crafted novel about family, being weird, and claiming your place in your own crazy story, that can only come from the mind of Edgar Cantero.</description>

  <description>This spooky addition to Alvin Schwartz's popular books on American folklore is filled with tales of eerie horror and dark revenge that will make you jump with fright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a story here for everyone -- skeletons with torn and tangled flesh who roam the earth; a ghost who takes revenge on her murderer; and a haunted house where every night a bloody head falls down the chimney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Gammell's splendidly creepy drawings perfectly capture the mood of more than two dozen scary stories -- and even scary songs -- all just right for reading alone or for telling aloud in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If You Dare!</description>

  <description>In this darkly comic and surreal collection from celebrated author Alissa Nutting, misfit women scramble for agency in a series of uncanny circumstances: A space cargo deliverywoman enlists the help of her cybersex partner to release her mother from cryogenic prison.  Desperate for affection and a more lavish lifestyle, a young woman falls under the corrosive spell of the fashion model for whom she’s given up everything to assist. A woman submits to a procedure that will turn her body into a futuristic ant farm, only to discover the sinister plans of her doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the settings these women find themselves in are as shocking and unique as they come, the emotional battles they face are searing and real. Some are trying to fight their way out of the cycle of abuse, while others must cope with the anguish brought on by infertility or the aftershocks of an abortion. Still others confront and embrace their most depraved desires, carving out power for themselves in worlds that relentlessly ask for conformity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wickedly funny yet ringing with deep truths about gender, authority and the ways we inhabit and restrict the female body, &lt;i&gt;Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls &lt;/i&gt;is a brilliant commentary on the kaleidoscope of human behavior and a remarkably nuanced satire for our times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Dinner&lt;/i&gt; (2007)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Model's Assistant&lt;/i&gt; (2009)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Porn Star&lt;/i&gt; (2007)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/i&gt; (2006)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Bandleader's Girlfriend&lt;/i&gt; (2008)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Ant Colony&lt;/i&gt; (2010)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Knife Thrower&lt;/i&gt; (2010)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Deliverywoman&lt;/i&gt; (2008)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Corpse Smoker&lt;/i&gt; (2009)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Cat Owner&lt;/i&gt; (2010)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Cannibal Lover&lt;/i&gt; (2010)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Teenager&lt;/i&gt; (2008)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Hellion&lt;/i&gt; (2010)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Trainwreck&lt;/i&gt; (2007)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Gardener&lt;/i&gt; (2010)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Dancing Rat&lt;/i&gt; (2009)&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;i&gt;Magician&lt;/i&gt; (2009)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In&lt;i&gt; Her Body and Other Parties&lt;/i&gt;, Carmen Maria Machado blithely demolishes the arbitrary borders between psychological realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women's lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wife refuses her husband's entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store's prom dresses. One woman's surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella Especially Heinous, Machado reimagines every episode of &lt;i&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&lt;/i&gt;, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgangers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious, &lt;i&gt;Her Body and Other Parties&lt;/i&gt; swings from horrific violence to the most exquisite sentiment. In their explosive originality, these stories enlarge the possibilities of contemporary fiction.</description>

  <description>Love, like everything in the universe, cannot be destroyed. But over time it can change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot Texas nights were lonely for Ben before his heart began beating to the rhythm of two words; Tim Wyman. By all appearances, Tim had the perfect body and ideal life, but when a not-so-accidental collision brings them together, Ben discovers that the truth is rarely so simple. If winning Tim’s heart was an impossible quest, keeping it would prove even harder as family, society, and emotion threaten to tear them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something Like Summer&lt;/em&gt; is a love story spanning a decade and beyond as two boys discover what it means to be friends, lovers, and sometimes even enemies.</description>

  <description>Eisner Award-nominated writer Kelly Sue DeConnick (Pretty Deadly, Captain Marvel) and Valentine De Landro (X-Factor) team up to bring you the premiere volume of Bitch Planet, a deliciously vicious riff on women-in-prison sci-fi exploitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a future just a few years down the road in the wrong direction, a woman's failure to comply with her patriarchal overlords will result in exile to the meanest penal planet in the galaxy. When the newest crop of fresh femmes arrive, can they work together to stay alive or will hidden agendas, crooked guards, and the deadliest sport on (or off!) Earth take them to their maker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects BITCH PLANET #1-5.</description>

  <description>In the middle of a quiet, not-so-special clearing in the woods, a wee tiny whatsit wakes up without any memory at all. So he sets off in search of his maker, as well as some sense of purpose in Life. Along the way, he encounters a bizarre cast of silly, helpful, and oddly poignant characters who teach him how to survive this crazy game called Existence.The Big Empty Life of Alphonse Tabouret is an existential fairy tale about Life, Love, Loss, and the search for answers to questions we all ask nobody in particular. While cute and silly on the surface, almost every encounter is metaphorical (without being heavy-handedly so). This adorably engaging and heartwarming tale invites the reader to decipher the life lessons gleaned by Alphonse in personal terms that speak to today's social conditions. Through the innocent lens of simple, cute characterization, readers are presented with honest questions about parenting, materialism, addiction, codependency, narcissism, depression, and the search for meaning that we all undergo every day.</description>

  <description>Inspired by &lt;em&gt;Dulle Griet&lt;/em&gt; (aka “Mad Meg"), Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s 16th-century painting of a “strong, intense woman striding determinedly across a violent landscape," &lt;em&gt;Dull Margaret&lt;/em&gt; is the first graphic novel by Academy Award winning-actor Jim Broadbent (&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;) and artist Dix (perhaps best known for his &lt;em&gt;Roll Up! Roll Up!&lt;/em&gt; comics in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; newspaper). The &lt;em&gt;Dulle Griet&lt;/em&gt; painting shows a breastplated woman with a sword in one hand in front of the mouth of hell, and Broadbent uses that single, vivid image as a launching point to explore what the rest of Dull Margaret’s bleak existence may have been like.</description>

  <description>Though they have the vote and the Pill and haven't been burned as witches since 1727, life isn't exactly a stroll down the catwalk for modern women. They are beset by uncertainties and questions: Why are they supposed to get Brazilians? Why do bras hurt? Why the incessant talk about babies? And do men secretly hate them? Caitlin Moran interweaves provocative observations on women's lives with laugh-out-loud funny scenes from her own, from adolescence to her development as a writer, wife, and mother.</description>

  <description>A hilarious, heartfelt sequel to &lt;em&gt;How to Build a Girl&lt;/em&gt;, the breakout novel from feminist sensation Caitlin Moran who the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; called, "rowdy and fearless . . . sloppy, big-hearted and alive in all the right ways."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can’t have your best friend be famous if you’re not famous. It doesn’t work. You’re emotional pen-friends. You can send each other letters—but you’re not doing anything together. You live in different countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johanna Morrigan (AKA Dolly Wilde) has it all: at eighteen, she lives in her own flat in London and writes for the coolest music magazine in Britain. But Johanna is miserable. Her best friend and man of her dreams John Kite has just made it big in 1994’s hot new BritPop scene. Suddenly John exists on another plane of reality: that of the Famouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never one to sit on the sidelines, Johanna hatches a plan: she will Saint Paul his Corinthians, she will Jimmy his Pinocchio—she will write a monthly column, by way of a manual to the famous, analyzing fame, its power, its dangers, and its amusing aspects. In stories, girls never win the girl—they are won. Well, Johanna will re-write the stories, and win John, through her writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Johanna’s own star rises, an unpleasant one-night stand she had with a stand-up comedian, Jerry Sharp, comes back to haunt in her in a series of unfortunate consequences. How can a girl deal with public sexual shaming? Especially when her new friend, the up-and-coming feminist rock icon Suzanne Banks, is Jimmy Cricketing her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has been a girl or known one, who has admired fame or judged it, and above all anyone who loves to laugh till their sides ache, &lt;em&gt;How to Be Famous&lt;/em&gt; is a big-hearted, hilarious tale of fame and fortune-and all they entail.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl With All the Gifts &lt;/i&gt;Mike Carey presents the second book in his hip supernatural thriller series featuring freelance exorcist Felix Castor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felix Castor has reluctantly returned to exorcism after a successful case convinces him that he really can do some good with his abilities---"good," of course, being a relative term when dealing with the undead. His friend Rafi is still possessed, the succubus Ajulutsikael (Juliet to her friends) still technically has a contract on him, and he's still dirt poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing some consulting for the local cops helps pay the bills, but Castor needs a big private job to really fill the hole in his bank account. That's what he &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt;. What he &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt; is a seemingly insignificant "missing ghost" case that inexorably drags him and his loved ones into the middle of a horrific plot to raise one of hell's fiercest demons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When satanists, stolen spirits, sacrifice farms, and haunted churches all appear on the same police report, the name Felix Castor can't be too far behind...</description>

  <description>Chocolate, vanilla, existential horror, addiction, musical fantasy...there’s a flavor for everyone’s misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ICE CREAM MAN is a genre-defying comic book series, featuring disparate “one-shot” tales of sorrow, wonder, and redemption. Each installment features its own cast of strange characters, dealing with their own special sundae of suffering. And on the periphery of all of them, like the twinkly music of his colorful truck, is the Ice Cream Man—a weaver of stories, a purveyor of sweet treats. Friend. Foe. God. Demon. The man who with a snap of his fingers—lickety split!—can change the course of your life forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by W. MAXWELL PRINCE (ONE WEEK IN THE LIBRARY), with art by MARTíN MORAZZO (SNOWFALL, GREAT PACIFIC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects issues 1-4.</description>

  <description>When Chris joins the staff at her local record store, she’s surprised to find out that her co-workers share a secret: they’re all members of a secret fight club that take on the patriarchy and fight crime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starry-eyed Chris has just started the dream job every outcast kid in town wants: working at Vinyl Mayhem. It's as rad as she imagined; her boss is BOSS, her co-workers spend their time arguing over music, pushing against the patriarchy, and endlessly trying to form a band. When Rosie Riot, the staff's favorite singer, mysteriously vanishes the night before her band’s show, Chris discovers her co-workers are doing more than just sorting vinyl . . . Her local indie record store is also a front for a teen girl vigilante fight club! &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Follow writer Carly Usdin (director of &lt;i&gt;Suicide Kale&lt;/i&gt;) and artist Nina Vakueva (&lt;i&gt;Lilith’s World&lt;/i&gt;) into the &lt;i&gt;Hi-Fi Fight Club&lt;/i&gt;, where they deliver a rock and roll tale of intrigue and boundless friendship.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Folks say Old Auntie takes a girl and keeps her fifty years—then lets her go and takes another one.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Thirteen-year-old Daniel Anderson doesn’t believe Brody Mason’s crazy stories about the ghost witch who lives up on Brewster’s Hill with Bloody Bones, her man-eating razorback hog. He figures Brody’s probably just trying to scare him since he’s the new kid . . . a “stuck-up snot” from Connecticut. But Daniel’s seven-year-old sister Erica has become more and more withdrawn, talking to her lookalike doll. When she disappears into the woods one day, he knows something is terribly wrong. Did the witch strike? Has Erica been “took”?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl With All the Gifts &lt;/i&gt;Mike Carey presents the first book in his hip supernatural thriller series featuring freelance exorcist Felix Castor.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felix Castor is a freelance exorcist, and London is his stomping ground. It may seem like a good ghostbuster can charge what he likes and enjoy a hell of a lifestyle, but there's a risk: sooner or later he's going to take on a spirit that's too strong for him. &lt;br /&gt;When Castor accepts a seemingly simple ghost-hunting case at a museum in the shadowy heart of London, what should have been a perfectly straightforward exorcism is rapidly turning into the Who Can Kill Castor First Show, with demons and ghosts all keen to claim the big prize. &lt;br /&gt;But that's business as usual: Castor knows how to deal with the dead. It's the living who piss him off....</description>

  <description>A group of misfit kids become inseparable friends after a girl they love is murdered in the woods outside of town. When a boy they believe to be the killer begins to terrorize them, the group decides to stop him by any means, and the novel takes a grim turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story follows Doug Horolez, a talentless boy hopelessly in love with his only friend, E. Summerson. That’s the good news. When E.’s sister is murdered in the woods behind town, Doug joins a group of junior high pariahs—led by an ill and eerily charismatic boy—to solve the girl's mysterious death and to prove his devotion. But as bonds within the group deepen, their methods become cultish and vengeful. Doug must then find his voice and act according to his conscience before the price to be loved becomes unspeakable violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Into That Good Night&lt;/i&gt; is a coming-of-age novel and literary thriller that investigates recurrent mysteries—loss, loneliness, and the precarious desire to belong.</description>

  <description>In an effort to put her family back together, a teen struggles to discover what happened to her mother who disappeared during a ghost hunt in this haunting novel from the author of &lt;i&gt;Party&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sick&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Shackled&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years ago, Abby Booth’s mom, cohost of a ghost-hunting reality show, went missing while filming in a “haunted” cave in Arizona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, Abby’s life has all but fallen to pieces, most notably because of her dad’s deep depression and how they’ve drifted further and further apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, at sixteen, Abby has decided that things will change. She plans to go to the same cave where her mom and the crew went missing and to find out, once and for all, what happened there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of the cohost’s son Charlie, and two of his friends, Abby sets off on a quest for answers…but when the group ends up finding, what they stumble across in that dark, primordial cave in Arizona, is nothing they could have ever imaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby was investigating a possible haunting…she never expected that there could be something worse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;David Sedaris returns with his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious book. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with &lt;i&gt;Calypso.&lt;/i&gt; You'd be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Calypso, &lt;/i&gt; Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny-it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumor joke. &lt;i&gt;Calypso&lt;/i&gt; is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet-and it just might be his very best.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Jack Sparks died while writing this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was no secret that journalist Jack Sparks had been researching the occult for his new book. No stranger to controversy, he'd already triggered a furious Twitter storm by mocking an exorcism he witnessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; video: forty seconds of chilling footage that Jack repeatedly claimed was not of his making, yet was posted from his own YouTube account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody knew what happened to Jack in the days that followed - until now.</description>

  <description>From the creator of SCOTT PILGRIM! Lottie Person is a glamorous fashion blogger living her best life in L.A. — at least that’s what she wants you to think. CALIFORNIA SCREAMING finds Lottie putting the past behind her and trying to make the best of a bad situation — her life! Lottie’s new bestie is an emotional roller coaster: first she died, and then she killed someone. Who will Caroline hurt next, and what is her brother Virgil doing here? What secret is Detective John Cho seeking in the desert? Why did Cutegirl ghost her sister? Is Normgirl really going to marry Ashley? And what in god’s name did Sunny ever see in Charlene? These questions and many others may possibly be answered in SNOTGIRL, VOL. 2: CALIFORNIA SCREAMING! IGN calls SNOTGIRL “Fresh and different!” and says “its sheer weirdness, creativity and heart will appeal to fans of SCOTT PILGRIM and SECONDS!” Collects SNOTGIRL #6-10.</description>

  <description>In this darkly funny, striking debut, a highly unusual young woman must venture into the woods at the edge of her home to remove a curse that has plagued the women in her family for millennia—an utterly original novel with all the mesmerizing power of &lt;em&gt;The Tiger’s Wife&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Snow Child&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Swamplandia!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cursed. Maisie Cothay has never known the feel of human flesh: born with the power to kill or resurrect at her slightest touch, she has spent her childhood sequestered in her family’s manor at the edge of a mysterious forest. Maisie’s father, an anthropologist who sees her as more experiment than daughter, has warned Maisie not to venture into the wood. Locals talk of men disappearing within, emerging with addled minds and strange stories. What he does not tell Maisie is that for over a millennium her female ancestors have also vanished into the wood, never to emerge—for she is descended from a long line of cursed women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one day Maisie’s father disappears, and Maisie must venture beyond the walls of her carefully constructed life to find him. Away from her home and the wood for the very first time, she encounters a strange world filled with wonder and deception. Yet the farther she strays, the more the wood calls her home. For only there can Maisie finally reckon with her power and come to understand the wildest parts of herself.</description>

  <description>Originally released as an online serial where itreceivedmore than 70,000 downloads,John Dies at the End has been described as a"Horrortacular", an epic of "spectacular" horror that combines the laugh out loud humor of the best R-rated comedy, with the darkest terror of H.P. Lovecraft. The book went on to sell an additional60,000 copies in all formats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As thesequel opens, we find our heroes, David and John, again embroiled in a series of horrifying yet mind-bogglingly ridiculous events caused primarily by their own gross incompetence. The guys find that books and movies about zombies may have triggered a zombie apocalypse, despite a complete lack of zombies in the world. As they race against the clock to protect humanity from its own paranoia, they must ask themselves, who are the real monsters? Actually, that would be the shape-shifting horrors secretly taking over the world behind the scenes that, in the end, make John and Dave kind of wish it had been zombies after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious, terrifying, engaging and wrenching, This Book Is Full of Spiders, the next thrilling installment, takes us for a wild ride with two slackers from the midwest who really have better things to do with their time than prevent the apocalypse.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;STOP.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should not have touched this book with your bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO, don't put it down. It's too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're watching you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My name is David Wong. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not want to know about the things you'll read on these pages, about &lt;b&gt;the sauce&lt;/b&gt;, about &lt;b&gt;Korrok&lt;/b&gt;, about the invasion, and the future. But it's too late. You touched the book. You're in the game. You're under &lt;b&gt;the eye&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only defense is knowledge. You need to read &lt;i&gt;John Dies at the End&lt;/i&gt;, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The important thing is this:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drug is called &lt;b&gt;Soy Sauce&lt;/b&gt; and it gives users a window into another dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John and I never had the chance to say no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for us, if you make the right choice, we'll have a much harder time explaining how to &lt;b&gt;fight off the otherworldly invasion&lt;/b&gt; currently threatening to &lt;b&gt;enslave humanity&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very &lt;b&gt;dark epoch&lt;/b&gt; the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;None of this is was my fault.&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>Carol Evers is a woman with a dark secret. She has died many times . . . but her many deaths are not final: They are comas, a waking slumber indistinguishable from death, each lasting days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two people know of Carol’s eerie condition. One is her husband, Dwight, who married Carol for her fortune, and—when she lapses into another coma—plots to seize it by proclaiming her dead and quickly burying her . . . alive. The other is her lost love, the infamous outlaw James Moxie. When word of Carol’s dreadful fate reaches him, Moxie rides the Trail again to save his beloved from an early, unnatural grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all the while, awake and aware, Carol fights to free herself from the crippling darkness that binds her—summoning her own fierce will to survive. As the players in this drama of life and death fight to decide her fate, Carol must in the end battle to save herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The spellbinding tale of a lonely caregiver and a cranky hoarder with a house full of secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maud Drennan is a dedicated caregiver whose sunny disposition masks a deep sadness. A tragic childhood event left her haunted, in the company of a cast of prattling saints who pop in and out of her life like tourists. Other than visiting her agoraphobic neighbor, Maud keeps to herself, finding solace in her work and in her humble existence–until she meets Mr. Flood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathal Flood is a menace by all accounts. The lone occupant of a Gothic mansion crawling with feral cats, he has been waging war against his son’s attempts to put him into an old-age home and sent his last caretaker running for the madhouse. But Maud is this impossible man’s last chance: if she can help him get the house in order, he just might be able to stay. So the unlikely pair begins to cooperate, bonding over their shared love of Irish folktales and mutual dislike of Mr. Flood’s overbearing son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, shadows are growing in the cluttered corners of the mansion, hinting at buried family secrets, and reminding Maud that she doesn’t really know this man at all. When the forgotten case of a missing schoolgirl comes to light, she starts poking around, and a full-steam search for answers begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with eccentric charms, twisted comedy, and a whole lot of heart, Mr. Flood’s Last Resort is a mesmerizing tale that examines the space between sin and sainthood, reminding us that often the most meaningful forgiveness that we can offer is to ourselves.</description>

  <description>For Penny Lee high school was a total nonevent. Her friends were okay, her grades were fine, and while she somehow managed to land a boyfriend, he doesn’t actually know anything about her. When Penny heads to college in Austin, Texas, to learn how to become a writer, it’s seventy-nine miles and a zillion light years away from everything she can’t wait to leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam’s stuck. Literally, figuratively, emotionally, financially. He works at a café and sleeps there too, on a mattress on the floor of an empty storage room upstairs. He knows that this is the god-awful chapter of his life that will serve as inspiration for when he’s a famous movie director but right this second the seventeen bucks in his checking account and his dying laptop are really testing him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sam and Penny cross paths it’s less meet-cute and more a collision of unbearable awkwardness. Still, they swap numbers and stay in touch—via text—and soon become digitally inseparable, sharing their deepest anxieties and secret dreams without the humiliating weirdness of having to &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; each other.</description>

  <description>The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To her parents' despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie's descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts' plight. With John, Marjorie's father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie's younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface--and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.</description>

  <description>We all say there is no justice in this world. But what if there really was? What if the souls of murdered children were able to return briefly to this world, inhabit adult bodies and wreak ultimate revenge on the monsters who had killed them, stolen their lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is the unfathomable mystery confronting ex-NYPD detective Willow Wylde, fresh out of rehab and finally able to find a job running a Cold Case squad in suburban Detroit. When the two rookie cops assigned to him take an obsessive interest in a decades old disappearance of a brother and sister, Willow begins to suspect something out of the ordinary is afoot. And when he uncovers a series of church basement AA-type meetings made up of the slain innocents, a new way of looking at life, death, murder and missed opportunities is revealed to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystical, harrowing and ultimately tremendously moving, A Guide for Murdered Children is a genre-busting, mind-bending twist on the fine line between the ordinary and the extraordinary.</description>

  <description>After losing her hand in a tragic accident, Rachel is plagued by vivid nightmares of a hollow tree, and a hand reaching from it, begging her for help. Terrified that she is going mad, Rachel experiences phantom sensations of leaves, trees, and finally a hand that grasps hers and pulls a young woman into Rachel's world. She has no idea of who she is, but Rachel can't help but think of the local legend of Oak Mary, the corpse of a woman found hidden in a hollow tree, and who was never identified. Three myths have grown up around the body; was she a spy, a prostitute or a murdered gypsy? Rachel is desperate to learn the truth, but darker forces are at work. For a rule has been broken, and Mary is in a world where she doesn't belong...</description>

  <description>Magic awaits. . . at least that’s what Sean and Marcus’s dad always told them when they were children. Now adults, it seems that all of that magic is behind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcus fills his days with sex, drugs, and rock and roll, while Sean focuses on growing their family owned ice cream shop into a worldwide brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, just moments before finalizing a deal to sell their shares in the family company to a multinational corporation, Sean and Marcus are inexplicably whisked away to a world of fairytales. But these aren’t the friendly fairytale characters Sean and Marcus remember from classic bedtime stories . . . this is the world as it was originally imagined by the Brothers Grimm―rife with beheadings, bestiality, and brothels.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When newly widowed Elsie is sent to see out her pregnancy at her late husband's crumbling country estate, The Bridge, what greets her is far from the life of wealth and privilege she was expecting . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Elsie married handsome young heir Rupert Bainbridge, she believed she was destined for a life of luxury. But with her husband dead just weeks after their marriage, her new servants resentful, and the local villagers actively hostile, Elsie has only her husband's awkward cousin for company. Or so she thinks. Inside her new home lies a locked door, beyond which is a painted wooden figure--a silent companion--that bears a striking resemblance to Elsie herself. The residents of The Bridge are terrified of the figure, but Elsie tries to shrug this off as simple superstition--that is, until she notices the figure's eyes following her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Victorian ghost story that evokes a most unsettling kind of fear, &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;this is a tale that creeps its way through the consciousness in ways you least expect--much like the silent companions themselves.</description>

  <description>Greg Salinger was just your typical merc for hire - killing those he deemed "foolish" for money. But that life is behind him now. Today, he's a psychiatrist, trying to help others. But now S.H.I.E.L.D. wants him to try to rehabilitate super villains. The catch? If these "patients" don't make enough progress, they're dead! Sounds like a job for Foolkiller! But when he finds himself alone with an arsenal of weapons against an army of skinhead Red Skull sympathizers, he'll be asking questions about his own career choices! Who's the fool now, Salinger?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;COLLECTING&lt;b&gt;: FOOLKILLER 1-5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Mary Jekyll, alone and penniless following her parents’ death, is curious about the secrets of her father’s mysterious past. One clue in particular hints that Edward Hyde, her father’s former friend and a murderer, may be nearby, and there is a reward for information leading to his capture…a reward that would solve all of her immediate financial woes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her hunt leads her to Hyde’s daughter, Diana, a feral child left to be raised by nuns. With the assistance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, Mary continues her search for the elusive Hyde, and soon befriends more women, all of whom have been created through terrifying experimentation: Beatrice Rappaccini, Catherin Moreau, and Justine Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their investigations lead them to the discovery of a secret society of immoral and power-crazed scientists, the horrors of their past return. Now it is up to the monsters to finally triumph over the monstrous.</description>

  <description>Whoever is born here, is doomed to stay 'til death. Whoever settles, never leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Black Spring, the seemingly picturesque Hudson Valley town haunted by the Black Rock Witch, a 17th century woman whose eyes and mouth are sewn shut. Muzzled, she walks the streets and enters your homes at will. She stands next to your bed for nights on end. Everybody knows that her eyes may never be opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elders of Black Spring have virtually quarantined the town by using high-tech surveillance to prevent their curse from spreading. Frustrated with being kept in lockdown, the town's teenagers decide to break their strict regulations and go viral with the haunting, but in so doing send the town spiraling into the dark, medieval practices of the past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dictionary of words that don't exist for feelings that do written by &lt;i&gt;The Middle&lt;/i&gt; actress Eden Sher and illustrated by acclaimed graphic novelist Julia Wertz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A must-read for bad, good and just plain complicated days." --&lt;b&gt;Oprah.com&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; All her life, Eden Sher has suffered from &lt;b&gt;dyscommunicatia&lt;/b&gt; (n. the inability to articulate a feeling through words.). Then, one day, she decided that, whenever she had an emotion for which she had no word, she would make one up. &lt;br /&gt; The result of this is &lt;i&gt;The Emotionary&lt;/i&gt;, which lives at the intersection of incredibly funny and very useful. Chock full of words you always wanted/never knew you needed, often accompanied by illustrations of hilarious and all-too-familiar situations, &lt;i&gt;The Emotionary&lt;/i&gt; will be a cherished tool for you or the world-class feelings-haver in your life. &lt;br /&gt; At long last, all your complicated feelings can be put into words, so you can recognize them for what they are, speak their names aloud, and move on. Finally!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In case you were wondering, I didn’t do it. I didn’t have anything to do with Frank’s death. I don’t have an alibi, so you’ll have to take my word for it...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forty-eight hours after leaving her husband’s body at the base of the stairs, Tanya Dubois cashes in her credit cards, dyes her hair brown, demands a new name from a shadowy voice over the phone, and flees town. It’s not the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She meets Blue, a female bartender who recognizes the hunted look in a fugitive’s eyes and offers her a place to stay. With dwindling choices, Tanya-now-Amelia accepts. An uneasy―and dangerous―alliance is born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s almost impossible to live off the grid today, but Amelia-now-Debra and Blue have the courage, the ingenuity, and the desperation, to try. Hopscotching from city to city, Debra especially is chased by a very dark secret…can she outrun her past?</description>

But one cold, dark night, when bandits surprise her in the woods, Hortense discovers that her shadow is the very thing she needs most.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An entrancing new series starring a funny, impulsive, and sometimes self-congratulatory young woman who discovers she has psychic abilities—and then must decide whether she will use her skills for good or…not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy Cannon isn’t your typical twenty-something woman. Yes she’s resourceful, bright, and scrappy. But she can also read people with uncanny precision. What she doesn’t realize: she’s actually psychic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a series of bad decisions leads Teddy to a run-in with the police, a mysterious stranger intervenes. He invites her to apply to the School for Psychics, a facility hidden off the coast of San Francisco where students are trained like Delta Force operatives: it’s competitive, cutthroat, and highly secretive. They’ll learn telepathy, telekinesis, investigative skills, and SWAT tactics. And if students survive their training, they go on to serve at the highest levels of government, using their skills to protect America, and the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In class, Teddy befriends Lucas, a rebel without a cause who can start and manipulate fire; Jillian, a hipster who can mediate communication between animals and humans; and Molly, a hacker who can apprehend the emotional state of another individual. But just as Teddy feels like she’s found where she might belong, strange things begin to happen: break-ins, missing students, and more. It leads Teddy to accept a dangerous mission that will ultimately cause her to question everything—her teachers, her friends, her family, and even herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Set in a world very much like our own, &lt;i&gt;School for Psychics&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a stay-up-all night series.</description>

  <description>How far are you willing to go for Mister Tender?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fourteen, Alice Hill was viciously attacked by two of her classmates and left to die. The teens claim she was a sacrifice for a man called Mister Tender, but that could never be true: Mister Tender doesn’t exist. His sinister character is pop-culture fiction, created by Alice’s own father in a series of popular graphic novels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a decade later, Alice has changed her name and is trying to heal. But someone is watching her. They know more about Alice than any stranger could: her scars, her fears, and the secrets she keeps locked away. She can try to escape her past, but Mister Tender is never far behind. He will come with a smile that seduces, and a dark whisper in her ear…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a true story, this gripping thriller plunges you into a world of haunting memories and unseen threats, leaving you guessing until the harrowing end.</description>

  <description>A decade ago, teacher Nathan Brookes saw four of his students walk up a hill and vanish. Only one returned: Olivia, starved, terrified, and with no memory of where she'd been. Questioned by the police but released for lack of evidence, Nathan spent the years trying to forget. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a body is found in the same ancient woodland where they disappeared, it is first believed to be one of the missing children, but is soon identified as a Bronze Age warrior, nothing more than an archaeological curiosity. Yet Nathan starts to have horrific visions of the students, alive but trapped. Then Olivia reappears, desperate that the warrior's body be returned to the earth. For he is the only thing keeping a terrible evil at bay.</description>

  <description>In 1986, Eddie and his friends are just kids on the verge of adolescence. They spend their days biking around their sleepy English village and looking for any taste of excitement they can get. The chalk men are their secret code: little chalk stick figures they leave for one another as messages only they can understand. But then a mysterious chalk man leads them right to a dismembered body, and nothing is ever the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016, Eddie is fully grown, and thinks he's put his past behind him. But then he gets a letter in the mail, containing a single chalk stick figure. When it turns out that his friends got the same message, they think it could be a prank . . . until one of them turns up dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's when Eddie realizes that saving himself means finally figuring out what really happened all those years ago.</description>

  <description>At the end of a dark prairie road, nearly forgotten in the Kansas countryside, lies the Finch House. For years it has perched empty, abandoned, and overgrown--but soon the door will be opened for the first time in many decades. But something waits, lurking in the shadows, anxious to meet its new guests. &lt;br /&gt;When best-selling horror author Sam McGarver is invited to spend Halloween night in one of the country's most infamous haunted houses, he reluctantly agrees. At least he won't be alone; joining him are three other masters of the macabre, writers who have helped shape modern horror. But what begins as a simple publicity stunt soon becomes a fight for survival--the entity they have awakened will follow them, torment them, threatening to make them part of the bloody legacy of Kill Creek.</description>

  <description>“The poems in this volume fall into two parts. Hand Games, poems of the first section, is the daily bread of my past two years or so. They are the artifacts of loving in a personal way, of struggles in a wide and a narrower frame, of planting and harvesting in the earth and on paper, of building new friendships and mourning the death of friends. They speak of zucchini and oaks and cats, of jogging and writing, of nuclear power plants and suicide, of fat and of street hassling.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;”The Lunar Cycle forms the second part. I first heard of the lunar calendar in my childhood, when I asked why Passover falls on a different date every year and was answered that it falls on Nisan 14, the fourteenth day of the lunar month of Nisan. The next time I came across the moon-month was in reading Robert Graves in search of the old goddess religions. But the lunar calendar has really only been an intimate part of my life since I moved near the ocean and the bay and had to become conscious of the tides; for one thing, to get the sweet Wellfleet oysters.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For more precise understanding I owe a lot to Nancy F. W.Passmore of the Luna Press, who every year produces The Lunar Calendar with thirteen months, their old Celtic names, associations from around the world, time of moon rise and set and all the phases. It tells me at a glance when my period will come and when I can expect to ovulate, and it is the most beautiful calendar I have ever seen, with the months in the form of spirals rather than grids.&lt;br /&gt;”Not being constrained by commerce to produce a calendar to sell by January first, Roman time, I begin when my year opens, in the spring; with Nisan, the first month of the Jewish religious year – although I have used the Celtic names, as does The Lunar Calendar, in homage to that labor of love. Rediscovering the lunar calendar has been a part of rediscovering women’s past, but it has also meant for me a series of doorways to some of the non-rational aspects of being a living woman: Thus The Lunar Cycle, explorations of my last two years.”</description>

  <description>The GRRL SCOUTS (Gwen, Daphne, and Rita) are back in action and involved in their most bizarre adventure yet! Their mission is to figure out the mystery of the Magic Socks, a powerful new weapon that everyone is trying to get their greedy little hands on. Problem is, Daphne's crazy cousin, Josie, is also after the Socks, and she won't stop at anything until she is able to harness its deadly power! Action-packed, psychedelic, hilarious, destructive insanity ensues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magic Socks collects the entire pulse-pounding six issue comic book series from superstar artist JIM MAHFOOD. The book is packed with extra goodies, including a sketchbook section, unreleased art, behind the scenes comics, and bonus art from some of today's top creators including SKOTTIE YOUNG, BILL SIENKIEWICZ, LAUREN YS, ERIC CANETE, ELIZA IVANOVA, and MIKE HUDDLESTON. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;We all knew about Cullen Hickson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Siblings Brielle and Ray O’Dell are lost. Anxious. Restless. Bullied at his Catholic school for being small and timid, Ray wants to be someone people respect or, even better, someone people fear. Meanwhile, Brielle—whose “popular” status feels tenuous at best—knows that something is off about her friendship with the shiny, happy, sophisticated blond girls on her field hockey team. They don’t really understand Bri, and if Bri is being totally honest, she doesn’t really understand them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When storied delinquent Cullen Hickson enters the orbit of the O’Dell siblings, though, everything changes. Brielle and Ray find an alluring, addictive outlet in Cullen, who opens their eyes to a world they didn’t know existed. For Ray, that means experiencing the singular thrill of small-time crime—from breaking and entering to grand theft auto—while Brielle quickly dives into an all-consuming romance with the enigmatic upperclassman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Brielle and Ray find themselves more and more entwined with Cullen’s antics, the once-thrilling experiences begin to feel increasingly dangerous, culminating in a life-changing event that shakes the teens to their core.</description>

  <description>The most important thing is that Jess Wong is Angie Redmond's best friend, even if Angie can't see how she truly feels. It's okay that Jess is the girl on the sidelines that nobody notices. That means she's free to watch everyone else and be at Angie's side. But when Angie starts falling for Margot, a girl from the nearby boarding school, Jess can already see what's going to happen. And suddenly her gift for observation is a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Angie drags Jess further into Margot's circle, Jess finds more than her friend's growing crush. Secrets lie just beneath the carefree surface of this world, and when they come out, Jess knows Angie won't be able to handle the consequences. When the inevitable darkness finally descends, Angie will need her best friend.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Memory Trees&lt;/i&gt; is a dark magical realism novel about a mysterious family legacy, a centuries-old feud, and a tragic loss that resurfaces when sixteen-year-old Sorrow returns to her mother’s family orchard for the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorrow Lovegood’s life has been shaped by the stories of the women who came before her: brave, resilient women who settled long ago on a mercurial apple orchard in Vermont. The land has been passed down through generations, and Sorrow and her family take pride in its strange history. Their offbeat habits may be ridiculed by other townspeople—especially their neighbors, the Abrams family—but for the first eight years of her life, the orchard is Sorrow’s whole world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one winter night everything changes. Sorrow’s sister Patience is tragically killed. Their mother suffers a mental breakdown. Sorrow is sent to live with her dad in Miami, away from the only home she’s ever known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now sixteen, Sorrow’s memories of her life in Vermont are maddeningly hazy; even the details of her sister’s death are unclear. She returns to the orchard for the summer, determined to learn more about her troubled childhood and the family she left eight years ago. Why has her mother kept her distance over the years? What actually happened the night Patience died? Is the orchard trying to tell her something, or is she just imagining things?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize finalist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award-winning novelist and memoirist Amber Dawn reveals a gutsy lyrical sensibility in her debut poetry collection: a collection of glosa poems written as an homage to and an interaction with queer poets such as Gertrude Stein, Christina Rossetti, and Adrienne Rich. By doing so, Dawn delves deeper into the themes of trauma, memory, and unblushing sexuality that define her work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amber Dawn&lt;/b&gt; is the author of the Lambda Award-winning novel &lt;i&gt;Sub Rosa&lt;/i&gt; and the memoir &lt;i&gt;How Poetry Saved My Life&lt;/i&gt; (winner of the Vancouver Book Award). Her other awards include the Writers' Trust of Canada Dayne Ogilvie Prize.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Beasts roar! Beasts destroy! But not Maurice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This frightfully unbeastly tale about staying true to yourself is for everyone who’s just a little bit different.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; With his melodious voice, fondness for kale, and unfailing politeness, Maurice isn’t quite like other beasts. So his concerned Mama and Papa send their ridiculously photogenic beastie to the Abominable Academy for Brutish Beasts to learn how to behave badly. Will Maurice master growling, scowling, snarling, and howling? Or will he prove that being &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; is a good thing after all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;One of Us Is Lying&lt;/i&gt; is the story of what happens when five strangers walk into detention and only four walk out alive. Everyone is a suspect, and everyone has something to hide.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay close attention and you might solve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.&lt;br /&gt; Bronwyn, &lt;b&gt;the brain, &lt;/b&gt; is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. &lt;br /&gt; Addy, &lt;b&gt; the beauty, &lt;/b&gt; is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. &lt;br /&gt; Nate, &lt;b&gt;the criminal&lt;/b&gt;, is already on probation for dealing.&lt;br /&gt; Cooper, &lt;b&gt;the athlete&lt;/b&gt;, is the all-star baseball pitcher.&lt;br /&gt; And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Simon, &lt;b&gt; the outcast&lt;/b&gt;, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention, Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who's still on the loose? &lt;br /&gt;Everyone has secrets, right? What really matters is how far you would go to protect them.</description>

  <description>Lately, Athena Windham has been spending all her spare time in her grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her parents—owners of a cemetery in Upstate New York—are proud of her devoutness, but her younger sister, Laurel, would rather spend her time exploring the forest that surrounds the Windham’s’ property than in her own grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Windham girls lead secluded lives—their older sister died in a tragic accident and their parents’ protectiveness has made the family semi-infamous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the new school year begins, the outside world comes creeping in through encounters with mean girls, a new friend, and a runaway boy hiding out in the cemetery. Meanwhile, a ghost hangs around the Windham property—the only grave keeper never to cross over—plotting how to keep the sisters close to home and close to her . . . forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A breathtaking new collection from one of today’s boldest and most adventurous poets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colloquial and incantatory, the poems in Patricia Lockwood’s second collection address the most urgent questions of our time, like: what if a deer did porn? Is America going down on Canada? What happens when Niagara Falls gets drunk at a wedding? Is it legal to marry a stuffed owl exhibit? What would Walt Whitman’s tit-pics look like? Why isn’t anyone named Gary anymore? Did the Hatfield and McCoy babies ever fall in love? The steep tilt of Lockwood’s lines sends the reader snowballing downhill, accumulating pieces of the scenery with every turn. The poems’ subject is the natural world, but their images would never occur in nature. This book is serious and funny at the same time, like a big grave with a clown lying in it.</description>

  <description>There is one version of my story that everyone knows. And then there is the truth. This is how it happened. How I went from being Peter Pan’s first—and favorite—lost boy to his greatest enemy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peter brought me to his island because there were no rules and no grownups to make us mind. He brought boys from the Other Place to join in the fun, but Peter's idea of fun is sharper than a pirate’s sword. Because it’s never been all fun and games on the island. Our neighbors are pirates and monsters. Our toys are knife and stick and rock—the kinds of playthings that bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter promised we would all be young and happy forever.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alice’s life on the road, always a step ahead of the uncanny bad luck biting at their heels. But when Alice’s grandmother, the reclusive author of a cult-classic book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate, the Hazel Wood, Alice learns how bad her luck can really get: her mother is stolen away―by a figure who claims to come from the Hinterland, the cruel supernatural world where her grandmother's stories are set. Alice's only lead is the message her mother left behind: “Stay away from the Hazel Wood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice has long steered clear of her grandmother’s cultish fans. But now she has no choice but to ally with classmate Ellery Finch, a Hinterland superfan who may have his own reasons for wanting to help her. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmother's tales began―and where she might find out how her own story went so wrong.</description>

  <description>Retired serial killer Edwyn Stoffgruppen is in love with Virginia, a girl he "met online." Her affection quiets his vile urges. &lt;br /&gt;Together, they tour the back roads of America in their LTD Crown Vic, eating doughnuts and enjoying their insatiable appetites for each other. Life is good...until a Louisiana billionaire kidnaps Virginia, forcing Edwyn to kill again in exchange for her freedom. &lt;br /&gt;And the twist to all of this? Virginia is a sex doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer DOUG WAGNER teams up with artists DANIEL HILLYARD and LAURA MARTIN for a chilling new crime series that ROBERT KIRKMAN (THE WALKING DEAD) reviewed as: "This is the weirdest s**t I've ever read. I love it!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects issues 1-5.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Who's afraid of the Big Bad Fox? No one, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fox dreams of being the terror of the barnyard. But no one is intimidated by him, least of all the hens. When he picks a fight with one, he always ends up on the losing end. Even the wolf, the most fearsome beast of the forest, can't teach him how to be a proper predator. It looks like the fox will have to spend the rest of his life eating turnips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the wolf comes up with the perfect scheme. If the fox steals some eggs, he could hatch the chicks himself and raise them to be a plump, juicy chicken dinner. Unfortunately, this plan falls apart when three adorable chicks hatch and call the fox Mommy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beautifully rendered in watercolor by Benjamin Renner, &lt;i&gt;The Big Bad Fox&lt;/i&gt; is a hilarious and surprisingly tender parable about parenthood that's sure to be a hit with new parents (and their kids too).&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Gert finally realizes that being such a murderous maniac might be the reason she's not been able to find her way out of the candy-coated world of Fairyland that has been her nightmare for over forty years. She sets off on a new quest to redeem herself and tries to earn her way back home with good deeds and kindness and love and whatever other mushy, touchy-feely things she can manage. &lt;br /&gt;The epic and hilarious fantasy quest continues from fan favorite cartoonist SKOTTIE YOUNG &lt;br /&gt;Collecting issues 11 through 15. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Stay away from the woods…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Silla and Nori arrive at their aunt’s home, it’s immediately clear that the manor is cursed. The endless creaking of the house at night and the eerie stillness of the woods surrounding them would be enough of a sign, but there are secrets too—questions that Silla can’t ignore: Why does it seem that, ever since they arrived, the trees have been creeping closer? Who is the beautiful boy who’s appeared from the woods? And who is the tall man with no eyes who Nori plays with in the basement at night… a man no one else can see?</description>

  <description>With a strange, otherworldly style, poetic clarity, and striking honesty, &lt;i&gt;Ask Baba Yaga&lt;/i&gt; contains beautifully skewed wisdom to be consulted in times of need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Dear Baba Yaga,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;I think I must crave male attention too much. I fear that, without it, I would feel invisible.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;BABA YAGA:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;When you seek others this way, you are invisible nonetheless. Yr shawl is covered in mirrors in which others admire themselves; this is why they greet you so passionately. It is good to be seen, but it is better to see. Find a being to look hard into, &amp;amp; you will see yrself and what is more than you.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In age-old Slavic fairy tales, the witch Baba Yaga is sought out by those with a burning need for guidance. In contemporary life, Baba Yaga—a dangerous, slippery oracle—answered earnest questions on The Hairpin for years. These pages collect her most poignant, surreal, and humorous exchanges along with all-new questions and answers for those seeking her mystical advice.&lt;br /&gt; </description>

  <description>Anastasia Collins: beautiful, smart, seductive, not to be messed with. Nick Hammond: hamdsome, suave, lethal, going to prison. Together, they are the Mystery Society. They are rich, resourceful, refined, determined to uncover the paranormal secrets of the world's underbelly... and in need of new recruits. A ghoul named Secret Skull, two twin girls Nick sprung from Area 51, and a robot with the brain of Jules Verne are up for the job. If the burgeoning team can espace the government baddies they've ticked off, reverse the smear campaign waged against Nick, and uncover the secrets of the twins' powers, they just might have time to chase down leads for their first case: finding the missing skull of Edgar Allan Poe.</description>

  <description>Three misfits come together to avenge the rape of a fellow classmate and in the process trigger a change in the misogynist culture at their high school transforming the lives of everyone around them in this searing and timely story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who are the Nowhere Girls?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They’re everygirl. But they start with just three:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace Salter is the new girl in town, whose family was run out of their former community after her southern Baptist preacher mom turned into a radical liberal after falling off a horse and bumping her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosina Suarez is the queer punk girl in a conservative Mexican immigrant family, who dreams of a life playing music instead of babysitting her gaggle of cousins and waitressing at her uncle’s restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin Delillo is obsessed with two things: marine biology and &lt;i&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;, but they aren’t enough to distract her from her suspicion that she may in fact be an android.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Grace learns that Lucy Moynihan, the former occupant of her new home, was run out of town for having accused the popular guys at school of gang rape, she’s incensed that Lucy never had justice. For their own personal reasons, Rosina and Erin feel equally deeply about Lucy’s tragedy, so they form an anonymous group of girls at Prescott High to resist the sexist culture at their school, which includes boycotting sex of any kind with the male students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in alternating perspectives, this groundbreaking novel is an indictment of rape culture and explores with bold honesty the deepest questions about teen girls and sexuality.</description>

  <description>From the outside, the Cane family looks like they have it all. A successful military father, a loving mother and five beautiful teenage daughters. But on the inside, life isn't quite so idyllic: the Cane sisters can barely stand each other, their father is always away, and their neglectful mother struggles with addiction and depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When their youngest and most beloved sister, Rose, dies in a tragic accident, Mona Cane and her sisters are devastated. And when she is brought back from the dead, they are relieved. But soon they discover that Rose must eat human flesh to survive, and when their mother abandons them, the sisters will find out just how far they'll go to keep their family together.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A humorous book about history's worst plagues—from the Antonine Plague, to leprosy, to polio—and the heroes who fought them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1518, in a small town in France, Frau Troffea began dancing and didn’t stop. She danced herself to her death six days later, and soon thirty-four more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had died from the mysterious dancing plague. In late-nineteenth-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome—a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure. And in turn-of-the-century New York, an Irish cook caused two lethal outbreaks of typhoid fever, a case that transformed her into the notorious Typhoid Mary and led to historic medical breakthroughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout time, humans have been terrified and fascinated by the plagues they've suffered from. &lt;i&gt;Get Well Soon&lt;/i&gt; delivers the gruesome, morbid details of some of the worst plagues in human history, as well as stories of the heroic figures who fought to ease their suffering. With her signature mix of in-depth research and upbeat storytelling, and not a little dark humor, Jennifer Wright explores history’s most gripping and deadly outbreaks.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When life starts coming at you like a freight train, you have two options: run away screaming or lean into the hit.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first day of Fresh Meat Orientation for the Eastside Roller Girls, Jennifer and Maisie knew they’d be fast friends. But when they’re drafted to different teams, the pull of competition — and their increasingly messy personal lives — threaten to drive them apart. In roller derby you take your hits, get back up, and learn how to be a better jammer, a better blocker, a better lover, and a better friend. Derby can heal your heart...but it might break a bone or two in the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling novelist, screenwriter, and retired Los Angeles Derby Doll Pamela Ribon (&lt;i&gt;Going In Circles, Why Girls Are Weird&lt;/i&gt;) joins artist Veronica Fish (&lt;i&gt;Archie, Silk&lt;/i&gt;) for a tale of friendship, heartbreak, and truly epic jams.</description>

  <description>It’s 1992, and the world is caught up in the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the Balkan Wars, but for fifteen-year-old Julie Winter, the news is noise. In Portland, Oregon, Julie moves through her days in a series of negatives: the skaters she doesn’t think are cute, the trinkets she doesn’t buy at the craft fair, the umbrella she refuses to carry despite the incessant rain. Her family life is routine and restrained, and no one talks about Julie’s older brother, a one-time Olympic-hopeful swimmer who now lives in self-imposed exile in Berlin. Julie has never considered swimming herself, until Alexis, the girls’ swim team captain, tries to recruit her. It’s a dare, and a flirtation—and a chance for Julie to find her brother, or to finally let him go. Anything could happen when her body hits water.</description>

  <description>Mark's out of the military, these days, with his boring, safe civilian job doing explosives consulting. But you never really get away from war. So it feels inevitable when his old army buddy Jason comes calling, with a lucrative military contract for a mining job in an obscure South-East Asian country called Quanlom. They'll have to operate under the radar--Quanlom is being torn apart by civil war, and the US military isn't strictly supposed to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no career prospects and a baby on the way, Mark finds himself making the worst mistake of his life and signing on with Jason. What awaits him in Quanlom is going to change everything. &lt;br /&gt;What awaits him in Quanlom is weirdness of the highest order: a civil war led by ten-year-old twins wielding something that looks a lot like magic, leading an army of warriors who look a lot like gods.&lt;br /&gt;What awaits him in Quanlom is an actual goddamn dragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From world-renowned artists Asaf and Tomer Hanuka (twins, whose magic powers are strictly confined to pen and paper) and Boaz Lavie, &lt;i&gt;The Divine&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced, brutal, and breathlessly beautiful portrait of a world where ancient powers vie with modern warfare and nobody escapes unscathed.</description>

  <description>The best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&lt;/em&gt; expands our sense of what it means to treat the dead with “dignity.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascinated by our pervasive terror of dead bodies, mortician Caitlin Doughty set out to discover how other cultures care for their dead. In rural Indonesia, she observes a man clean and dress his grandfather’s mummified body. Grandpa’s mummy has lived in the family home for two years, where the family has maintained a warm and respectful relationship. She meets Bolivian natitas (cigarette-smoking, wish-granting human skulls), and introduces us to a Japanese kotsuage, in which relatives use chopsticks to pluck their loved-ones’ bones from cremation ashes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With curiosity and morbid humor, Doughty encounters vividly decomposed bodies and participates in compelling, powerful death practices almost entirely unknown in America. Featuring Gorey-esque illustrations by artist Landis Blair, &lt;i&gt;From Here to Eternity&lt;/i&gt; introduces death-care innovators researching green burial and body composting, explores new spaces for mourning—including a glowing-Buddha columbarium in Japan and America’s only open-air pyre—and reveals unexpected new possibilities for our own death rituals.</description>

  <description>Are you a sensible, universally competent individual? Are you tired of the crushing monotony of leaping gracefully from one lily pad of success to the next? Are you sick of doing everything right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this brutally honest and humorous debut, musician and artist George Watsky chronicles the small triumphs over humiliation that make life bearable and how he has come to accept defeat as necessary to personal progress. The essays in &lt;i&gt;How to Ruin Everything &lt;/i&gt;range from the absurd (how he became an international ivory smuggler) to the comical (his middle-school rap battle dominance) to the revelatory (his experiences with epilepsy), yet all are delivered with the type of linguistic dexterity and self-awareness that has won Watsky more than 765,000 YouTube subscribers.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Alternately ribald and emotionally resonant, &lt;i&gt;How to Ruin Everything&lt;/i&gt; announces a versatile writer with a promising career ahead.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of the unforgettable &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt; comes a masterful new psychological suspense novel--the story of a young woman whose diabolical smarts are her ticket into a charmed life. But how many times can someone reinvent themselves? You be the judge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imogen is a runaway heiress, an orphan, a cook, and a cheat.&lt;br /&gt;Jule is a fighter, a social chameleon, and an athlete. &lt;br /&gt;An intense friendship. A disappearance. A murder, or maybe two. &lt;br /&gt;A bad romance, or maybe three.&lt;br /&gt;Blunt objects, disguises, blood, and chocolate. The American dream, superheroes, spies, and villains. &lt;br /&gt;A girl who refuses to give people what they want from her.&lt;br /&gt;A girl who refuses to be the person she once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Praise for E. Lockhart's &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Haunting, sophisticated. . . . Twisty and well-told." --&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"[It] will leave you dying to talk about the book with a pal or ten." --Parade.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You're going to want to remember the title. &lt;i&gt;Liars&lt;/i&gt; details the summers of a girl who harbors a dark secret, and delivers a satisfying but shocking twist ending." --&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An ambitious novel with an engaging voice, a clever plot and some terrific writing." --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Thrilling, beautiful, and blisteringly smart, &lt;i&gt;We Were Liars&lt;/i&gt; is utterly unforgettable." --John Green, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A collection of four chilling novels, ingeniously wrought gems of terror from the brilliantly imaginative, Joe Hill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snapshot&lt;/i&gt; is the disturbing story of a Silicon Valley adolescent who finds himself threatened by “The Phoenician,” a tattooed thug who possesses a Polaroid Instant Camera that erases memories, snap by snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young man takes to the skies to experience his first parachute jump. . . and winds up a castaway on an impossibly solid cloud, a Prospero’s island of roiling vapor that seems animated by a mind of its own in &lt;i&gt;Aloft&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a seemingly ordinary day in Boulder, Colorado, the clouds open up in a downpour of nails—splinters of bright crystal that shred the skin of anyone not safely under cover. &lt;i&gt;Rain&lt;/i&gt; explores this escalating apocalyptic event, as the deluge of nails spreads out across the country and around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt;, a mall security guard in a coastal Florida town courageously stops a mass shooting and becomes a hero to the modern gun rights movement. But under the glare of the spotlights, his story begins to unravel, taking his sanity with it. When an out-of-control summer blaze approaches the town, he will reach for the gun again and embark on one last day of reckoning.</description>

  <description>Parallel plotlines, one told in text and one in art, inform each other as a young girl unravels the mystery of a ghost next door.&lt;br /&gt;Mary is an orphan at the Thornhill Institute for Children at the very moment that it's closing down for good. But when a bully goes too far, Mary's revenge will have a lasting effect on the bully, on Mary, and on Thornhill itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, Ella moves to a new town where she has a perfect view of the dilapidated, abandoned Thornhill Institute. Determined to befriend the mysterious, evasive girl she sees there, Ella resolves to unravel Thornhill's history and uncover its secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella's story is told through striking, bold art; Mary's is told through diary entries. Each informs the other until the two eventually intersect to reveal the truth behind Thornhill's shadowy past, once and for all. Strikingly told and masterfully illustrated, Pam Smy bends genres and expectations alike.</description>

  <description>In this follow-up to the 1987 cult classic film, horror masters Tim Seeley and Scott Godlewski wade into the bloody, badass world of California vampires for an all-new tale of thrills, chills, and good old-fashioned heart-staking action in THE LOST BOYS VOL. 1!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to scenic Santa Carla, California. Great beaches. Colorful characters. Killer nightlife. And, of course, all the damn vampires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emerson brothers (Sam and Michael) and the Frog brothers (Edgar and Alan) learned that last part the hard way--these underage slayers took on the vampire master Max and his pack of punked-out minions, and drove a stake right through their plans to suck Santa Carla dry. After scraping the undead goo off their shoes, they figured everything was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now there are new vamps in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A coven of female undead called the Blood Belles has moved in, and they've targeted Sam, Michael, the Frog Brothers, and every other vampire hunter in Santa Carla for bloody vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It'll take every trick in the brothers' monster-killing book to stop these bloodsuckers from unleashing an entire army of the damned. And they'll need help from an unexpected source--a certain shirtless sax-playing savior known only as the Believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; still believe? Collects #1-6.</description>

  <description>In this neighborhood, danger lies close to home. A domestic thriller packed full of secrets, and a twisty story that never stops—from the bestselling author of The Couple Next Door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He looks at her, concerned. “How do you feel?” She wants to say, Terrified. Instead, she says, with a faint smile, “Glad to be home.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen and Tom Krupp are happy—they’ve got a lovely home in upstate New York, they’re practically newlyweds, and they have no kids to interrupt their comfortable life together. But one day, Tom returns home to find Karen has vanished—her car’s gone and it seems she left in a rush. She even left her purse—complete with phone and ID—behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a knock on the door—the police are there to take Tom to the hospital where his wife has been admitted. She had a car accident, and lost control as she sped through the worst part of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accident has left Karen with a concussion and a few scrapes. Still, she’s mostly okay—except that she can’t remember what she was doing or where she was when she crashed. The cops think her memory loss is highly convenient, and they suspect she was up to no good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen returns home with Tom, determined to heal and move on with her life. Then she realizes something’s been moved. Something’s not quite right. Someone’s been in her house. And the police won't stop asking questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in this house, everyone’s a stranger. Everyone has something they’d rather keep hidden. Something they might even kill to keep quiet.</description>

  <description>Danger is hard to resist in this sexy thriller from Becca Fitzpatrick, the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of the Hush, Hush saga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Britt Pheiffer has trained to backpack the Teton Range, but she isn’t prepared when her ex-boyfriend, who still haunts her every thought, wants to join her. Before Britt can explore her feelings for Calvin, an unexpected blizzard forces her to seek shelter in a remote cabin, accepting the hospitality of its two very handsome occupants—but these men are fugitives, and they take her hostage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Britt is forced to guide the men off the mountain, and knows she must stay alive long enough for Calvin to find her.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;1990&lt;/i&gt;. The teen detectives once known as the Blyton Summer Detective Club (of Blyton Hills, a small mining town in the Zoinx River Valley in Oregon) are all grown up and haven't seen each other since their fateful, final case in 1977. Andy, the tomboy, is twenty-five and on the run, wanted in at least two states. Kerri, one-time kid genius and budding biologist, is bartending in New York, working on a serious drinking problem. At least she's got Tim, an excitable Weimaraner descended from the original canine member of the team. Nate, the horror nerd, has spent the last thirteen years in and out of mental health institutions, and currently resides in an asylum in Arhkam, Massachusetts. The only friend he still sees is Peter, the handsome jock turned movie star. The problem is, Peter's been dead for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time has come to uncover the source of their nightmares and return to where it all began in 1977. This time, it better not be a man in a mask. The real monsters are waiting.</description>

  <description>At twenty-two, Bibi Blair’s doctors tell her that she’s dying. Two days later, she’s impossibly cured. Fierce, funny, dauntless, she becomes obsessed with the idea that she was spared because she is meant to save someone else. Someone named Ashley Bell. This proves to be a dangerous idea. Searching for Ashley Bell, ricocheting through a southern California landscape that proves strange and malevolent in the extreme, Bibi is plunged into a world of crime and conspiracy, following a trail of mysteries that become more sinister and tangled with every twisting turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unprecedented in scope, infinite in heart, &lt;i&gt;Ashley Bell&lt;/i&gt; is a magnificent achievement that will capture lovers of dark psychological suspense, literary thrillers, and modern classics of mystery and adventure. Beautifully written, at once lyrical and as fast as a bullet, here is the most irresistible novel of the decade.</description>

  <description>Based on a popular online comic, &lt;i&gt;The Tragedy Series&lt;/i&gt; presents a series of sepia-toned drawings that address such unfortunate events as “what bad roommates the taxidermist and the necromancer make,” or “the triceratops that never got to see the ocean,” or the hurdles to romance that secret lobster claws present. One part Victoriana, one part theater of the absurd, and the rest full of heart, these illustrations delight the brain and the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This collection offers not just an array of funny-sad scenarios, however. Creator Benjamin Dewey also includes both a series of “sadness reprieves” as well as original, exclusive content to draw in the skinflints who might otherwise stick to the Internet’s free buffet.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet Jane Hawk—a remarkable new heroine certain to become an icon of suspense, propelled by the singular narrative genius of #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Dean Koontz.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I very much need to be dead.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the chilling words left behind by a man who had everything to live for—but took his own life. In the aftermath, his widow, Jane Hawk, does what all her grief, fear, and fury demand: find the truth, no matter what. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People of talent and accomplishment, people admired and happy and sound of mind, have been committing suicide in surprising numbers. When Jane seeks to learn &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;, she becomes the most-wanted fugitive in America. Her powerful enemies are protecting a secret so important—so terrifying—that they will exterminate anyone in their way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all their power and viciousness may not be enough to stop a woman as clever as they are cold-blooded, as relentless as they are ruthless—and who is driven by a righteous rage they can never comprehend. Because it is born of love.</description>

  <description>Kelly Sue DeConnick (Avengers Assemble, Captain Marvel) and Emma Rios (Dr. Strange, Osborn) present the collected opening arc of their surprise-hit series that marries the magical realism of Sandman with the western brutality of Preacher. Death's daughter rides the wind on a horse made of smoke and her face bears the skull marks of her father. Her origin story is a tale of retribution as beautifully lush as it is unflinchingly savage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's a perfect match for the gorgeous, dizzying artwork in a sumptuous palette-overlaid panels add intricate choreography to fight scenes, and detailed, whirling splash pages beg for long-lingering looks. Couple that, along with a handful of Eisner nominations, with a multicultural cast of tough-as-nails women who all fight for their own honor, and this is a series to watch out for." - Booklist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's ambitious and challenging (two qualities that are not often valued, but that probably should be), under a façade of violence and sacrifice. Rio's art is lush and detailed, and is more than capable of keeping up with the far-reaching story." - PW</description>

  <description>Trine Hampstead knows everything. Just knows it. Ask her a question like, "Where are my keys?" or, "Is my husband cheating on me?" or, "How can there be perfectly preserved mammoths in the ice of Siberia when the ice isn't that old?" and she just knows the answer. She's the Mystery Girl. The only thing she doesn't know is anything about the last ten years of her own life, including what happened to give her this ability. But that's a mystery for later. The mystery for now is about those mammoths. Trine knows why they're there but surprises anyone who knows Trine by demanding to leave her London-based sidewalk detective setup to go to Siberia with the archaeological team to see them for herself. And close behind is a vicious killer who is targeting her for reasons even Trine doesn't know.</description>

  <description>A whimsically illustrated collection of fascinating, surprising, and funny facts about extinct animals. In this beautifully illustrated book, Swedish artist and author of &lt;i&gt;The Illustrated Compendium of Amazing Animal Facts&lt;/i&gt;, Maja Safstrom, explores the world of extinct animals. &lt;i&gt;Animals of a Bygone Era&lt;/i&gt; features 54 extinct animals from the ancient and modern world--including well-known examples such as wooly mammoths and dodo birds, as well as lesser-known (but no less fascinating) animals like semiaquatic sea minks, marsupial Tasmanian tigers, and tiny Eurasian wild horses.</description>

  <description>The illustrated story of a lonely alien sent to observe Earth, where he meets all sorts of creatures with all sorts of perspectives on life, love, and happiness, while learning to feel a little better about himself—based on the enormously popular Twitter account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are unique and inventive—bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny’s curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too&lt;/em&gt; is also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all the earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we will all learn how sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are.</description>

  <description>“Steve is a fine horse,” begins Kelly Collier's picture book. “But he thinks he could be finer. He wants to be EXCEPTIONAL.” When Steve finds a beautiful gold horn lying on the ground in the forest, he realizes he has found his path to the exceptional! He immediately ties the horn to the top of his head and prances off to show his friends. Not everyone is impressed, but most of his friends agree --- Steve and his horn are indeed exceptional. In fact, many of his friends are so inspired, they decide to tie items to the tops of their heads as well. So when Steve discovers his horn has suddenly gone missing, he's devastated and frantically searches everywhere to find it. He won't be exceptional without his horn! Or will he?</description>

Good thing Deadpool is renowned for his investigative skills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collecting&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Deadpool: Too Soon?&lt;/i&gt; 1-4</description>

She catches them and creates wonderful creatures to play with until she falls asleep, and in the morning brings them back to life in the whimsical drawings. When a mysterious new girl appears at school, Sandy's drawings are noticed for the first time... but Morfie's fascination with Sandy's talent soon turns into something far more sinister.</description>

  <description>Susan, Esther, and Daisy started at university three weeks ago and became fast friends. Now, away from home for the first time, all three want to reinvent themselves. But in the face of handwringing boys, “personal experimentation,” influenza, mystery-mold, nu-chauvinism, and the willful, unwanted intrusion of “academia,” they may be lucky just to make it to spring alive. Going off to university is always a time of change and growth, but for Esther, Susan, and Daisy, things are about to get a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collects issues #1-4.</description>

  <description>THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE NEW ON-GOING SERIES&lt;br /&gt;From writer, BRIAN AZZARELLO and artist, EDUARDO RISSO -- the Eisner award-winning creative team behind the crime classic, 100 Bullets -- comes a brutal new series! &lt;br /&gt;Set during Prohibition, and deep in the backwoods of Appalachia, MOONSHINE #1 tells the story of LOU PIRLO, a city-slick "torpedo" sent from New York City to negotiate a deal with the best moonshiner in West Virginia, one HIRAM HOLT. Lou figures it for milk run -- how hard could it be to set-up moonshine shipments from a few ass-backward hillbillies? What Lou doesn't figure on is that Holt is just as cunning as ruthless as any NYC crime boss and Lou is in way over his pin-striped head. Because not only will Holt do anything to protect his illicit booze operation, he'll stop at nothing to protect a much darker family secret...a bloody, supernatural secret that must never see the light of day...or better still, the light of the full moon. &lt;br /&gt;Volume one of MOONSHINE reunites the acclaimed creative team that defined modern crime comics with 100 Bullets...and now puts a horror-twist on a classic gangster tale! &lt;br /&gt;Collects Issues 1-6 &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Welcome to the Library.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's here that every story ever written is catalogued and monitored by a single man, who's begun to notice something strange: the books are rebelling. Image Comics proudly presents this experimental graphic novella from writer W. Maxwell Prince and artist John Amor, which recounts a troublesome week in the Library via seven short stories—one for each day—that use comics, infographics, prose, and poetry to play with the graphic medium and explore the multivalent world of living narrative.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Stay on the roads. Don’t enter the woods. Never go out at night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the rules in Rowan’s Glen, a remote farming community in the Missouri Ozarks where Ivy Templeton’s family has lived for centuries. It’s an old-fashioned way of life, full of superstition and traditions, and sixteen-year-old Ivy loves it. The other kids at school may think the Glen kids are weird, but Ivy doesn’t care—she has her cousin Heather as her best friend. The two girls share everything with each other—or so Ivy thinks. When Heather goes missing after a May Day celebration, Ivy discovers that both her best friend and her beloved hometown are as full of secrets as the woods that surround them.</description>

  <description>Cochlea &amp;amp; Eustachia appear to be twin human girls, but this has yet to be confirmed. Their actions seem to be motivated less by curiosity than boredom and an inclination towards purposeless destruction. Any connate objective remains to be determined. They never stray apart from each other, out of an unspoken proclivity. Perhaps they keep together because they resemble each other; a mixture of vanity and comfort is the foundation of their constant companionship. They seem to consider any creature with dissimilar features as inept or untrustworthy. They are suspected of giving hypnotic suggestions to cats. They do not seem particularly malicious, just meddlesome. This new graphic novel from the author of the acclaimed Squirrel Machine is lighter in tone than his previous works, yet its myriad charms remain as sinister as Rickheit fans would expect.</description>

  <description>David Dahlgren, a high-school senior, finds solace in running with the track team; he's a fast runner, and he enjoys the camaraderie. But team events become a source of tension when he develops a crush on one of his teammates, Sean. Scared to admit his feelings, David does everything he can to suppress them: he dates a girl, keeps his distance from his best friend who has become openly gay, and snaps a rubber band on his wrist every time he has "inappropriate" urges. Before long, Sean expresses the thoughts David has been trying to hide, and everything changes for the better. Or so it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this thoughtful yet searing coming-of-age novel, Lee Bantle offers a raw, honest, and incredibly compelling account of a teenager who learns to accept himself for who he is.</description>
