  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by an incredible true story of two Jewish friends who survived the Holocaust, this sweeping novel of love and friendship spans World War II from Budapest to Austria and the postwar years from Naples to Caracas, perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The German Girl &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;We Were the Lucky Ones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1946 when Vera Frankel and her best friend Edith Ban arrive in Naples. Refugees from Hungary, they managed to escape from a train headed for Auschwitz and spent the rest of the war hiding on an Austrian farm. Now, the two young women must start new lives abroad. Armed with a letter of recommendation from an American officer, Vera finds work at the United States embassy where she falls in love with Captain Anton Wight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Vera and Edith grapple with the aftermath of the war, so too does Anton, and when he suddenly disappears, Vera is forced to change course. Their quest for a better life takes Vera and Edith from Naples to Ellis Island to Caracas as they start careers, reunite with old friends, and rebuild their lives after terrible loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving, evocative, and compelling, this timely tale of true friendship, love, and survival will stay with you long after you turn the final page.</description>

      <![CDATA[I requested this because while we get a lot of WWII historical fiction, we don't get a lot of post-war from the jewish perspective, so this sounded interesting. The story itself was fine, but I found the writing to be a little flat, and I really did not like Vera at all.]]>

  <description>From the author of the breathtaking bestsellers &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dragonfly in Amber&lt;/i&gt;, the extraordinary saga continues.&lt;p&gt;Their passionate encounter happened long ago by whatever measurement Claire Randall took. Two decades before, she had traveled back in time and into the arms of a gallant eighteenth-century Scot named Jamie Fraser. Then she returned to her own century to bear his child, believing him dead in the tragic battle of Culloden. Yet his memory has never lessened its hold on her... and her body still cries out for him in her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Claire discovers that Jamie survived. Torn between returning to him and staying with their daughter in her own era, Claire must choose her destiny. And as time and space come full circle, she must find the courage to face the passion and pain awaiting her...the deadly intrigues raging in a divided Scotland... and the daring voyage into the dark unknown that can reunite or forever doom her timeless love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"The moment I decided to leave him, the moment I thought, enough, we were thirty-five thousand feet above the ocean, hurtling forward but giving the illusion of stillness and tranquility. &lt;i&gt;Just like our marriage."&lt;/i&gt; So opens Meg Wolitzer's compelling and provocative novel &lt;i&gt;The Wife,&lt;/i&gt; as Joan Castleman sits beside her husband on their flight to Helsinki. Joan's husband, Joseph Castleman, is "one of those men who own the world...who has no idea how to take care of himself or anyone else, and who derives much of his style from the Dylan Thomas Handbook of Personal Hygiene and Etiquette." He is also one of America's preeminent novelists, about to receive a prestigious international award to honor his accomplishments, and Joan, who has spent forty years subjugating her own literary talents to fan the flames of his career, has finally decided to stop. &lt;p&gt; From this gripping opening, Wolitzer flashes back fifty years to 1950s Smith College and Greenwich Village -- the beginning of the Castleman relationship -- and follows the course of the famous marriage that has brought them to this breaking point, culminating in a shocking ending that outs a carefully kept secret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wolitzer's most important and ambitious book to date, &lt;i&gt;The Wife&lt;/i&gt; is a wise, sharp-eyed, compulsively readable story about a woman forced to confront the sacrifices she's made in order to achieve the life she thought she wanted. But it's also an unusually candid look at the choices all men and women make for themselves, in marriage, work, and life. With her skillful storytelling and pitch-perfect observations, Wolitzer invites intriguing questions about the nature of partnership and the precarious position of an ambitious woman in a man's world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One sweltering night in 2013, four former high school classmates converge on their hometown in northeastern Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s Bill Ashcraft, a passionate, drug-abusing young activist whose flailing ambitions have taken him from Cambodia to Zuccotti Park to post-BP New Orleans, and now back home with a mysterious package strapped to the undercarriage of his truck; Stacey Moore, a doctoral candidate reluctantly confronting her family and the mother of her best friend and first love, whose disappearance spurs the mystery at the heart of the novel; Dan Eaton, a shy veteran of three tours in Iraq, home for a dinner date with the high school sweetheart he’s tried desperately to forget; and the beautiful, fragile Tina Ross, whose rendezvous with the washed-up captain of the football team triggers the novel’s shocking climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set over the course of a single evening, &lt;i&gt;Ohio &lt;/i&gt;toggles between the perspectives of these unforgettable characters as they unearth dark secrets, revisit old regrets and uncover—and compound—bitter betrayals. Before the evening is through, these narratives converge masterfully to reveal a mystery so dark and shocking it will take your breath away.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Inspired by an incredible true story of two Jewish friends who survived the Holocaust, this sweeping novel of love and friendship spans World War II from Budapest to Austria and the postwar years from Naples to Caracas, perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The German Girl &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;We Were the Lucky Ones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1946 when Vera Frankel and her best friend Edith Ban arrive in Naples. Refugees from Hungary, they managed to escape from a train headed for Auschwitz and spent the rest of the war hiding on an Austrian farm. Now, the two young women must start new lives abroad. Armed with a letter of recommendation from an American officer, Vera finds work at the United States embassy where she falls in love with Captain Anton Wight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Vera and Edith grapple with the aftermath of the war, so too does Anton, and when he suddenly disappears, Vera is forced to change course. Their quest for a better life takes Vera and Edith from Naples to Ellis Island to Caracas as they start careers, reunite with old friends, and rebuild their lives after terrible loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving, evocative, and compelling, this timely tale of true friendship, love, and survival will stay with you long after you turn the final page.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A sweeping tale of adventure and danger, innovation and corruption, and two women whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways on America’s first transcontinental train trip&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;May 1870.&lt;/i&gt; Crowds throng the Boston station, mesmerized by the mechanical wonder huffing on the rails: the Pullman Hotel Express, the first train to travel from coast to coast. Boarding the train are congressmen, railroad presidents, and even George Pullman himself. For two young women, strangers until this fateful day, it’s the beginning of a journey that will change their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive Louisa dreads the trip, but with limited prospects, she’s reluctantly joined the excursion as a governess to a wealthy family. Hattie is traveling to San Francisco to meet her fiancé, yet she’s far more interested in the workings of the locomotive than she is in the man awaiting her arrival. As the celebrated train moves westward, the women move toward one another, pulled by an unexpected attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is danger in this closeness, just as there is in the wilds of the frontier and in the lengths the railroad men will go to protect their investments. Before their journey is over, Louisa and Hattie will find themselves very far from where they intended to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt;... a magnificent epic that once again sweeps us back in time to the drama and passion of 18th-century Scotland...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For twenty years Claire Randall has kept her secrets. But now she is returning with her grown daughter to Scotland's majestic mist-shrouded hills. Here Claire plans to reveal a truth as stunning as the events that gave it birth: about the mystery of an ancient circle of standing stones ...about a love that transcends the boundaries of time ...and about James Fraser, a Scottish warrior whose gallantry once drew a young Claire from the security of her century to the dangers of his ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a legacy of blood and desire will test her beautiful copper-haired daughter, Brianna, as Claire's spellbinding journey of self-discovery continues in the intrigue-ridden Paris court of Charles Stuart ...in a race to thwart a doomed Highlands uprising ...and in a desperate fight to save both the child and the man she loves....</description>

  <description>In this follow-up to The Tattooist of Auschwitz, the author tells the story, based on a true one, of a woman who survives Auschwitz, only to find herself locked away again. Cilka Klein is 18 years old when Auschwitz-Birkenau is liberated by Soviet soldiers. But Cilka is one of the many women who is sentenced to a labor camp on charges of having helped the Nazis--with no consideration of the circumstances Cilka and women like her found themselves in as they struggled to survive. Once at the Vorkuta gulag in Sibera, where she is to serve her 15-year sentence, Cilka uses her wits, charm, and beauty to survive.</description>

  <description>When her father falls into a coma, Indian American photographer Sonya reluctantly returns to the family she’d fled years before. Since she left home, Sonya has lived on the run, free of any ties, while her soft-spoken sister, Trisha, has created a perfect suburban life, and her ambitious sister, Marin, has built her own successful career. But as these women come together, their various methods of coping with a terrifying history can no longer hold their memories at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buried secrets rise to the surface as their father—the victim of humiliating racism and perpetrator of horrible violence—remains unconscious. As his condition worsens, the daughters and their mother wrestle with private hopes for his survival or death, as well as their own demons and buried secrets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with forceful honesty, &lt;i&gt;Trail of Broken Wings&lt;/i&gt; reveals the burden of shame and secrets, the toxicity of cruelty and aggression, and the exquisite, liberating power of speaking and owning truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;2014 Winner — Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award — Young Adult Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no cure for being who you truly are...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a cottage high atop Llanfair Mountain, sixteen-year-old Clara lives with her sister, Maren, and guardian Auntie. By day, they gather herbs for Auntie’s healing potions. By night, Auntie spins tales of faraway lands and wicked fairies. Clara’s favorite story tells of three orphan infants—Clara, who was brought to Auntie by a stork; Maren, who arrived in a seashell; and their best friend, O’Neill, who was found beneath an apple tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, Clara discovers shimmering scales just beneath her sister’s skin. She realizes that Maren is becoming a mermaid—and knows that no mermaid can survive on land. Desperate to save her, Clara and O’Neill place the mermaid-girl in their gypsy wagon and set out for the sea. But no road is straight, and the trio encounters trouble around every bend. Ensnared by an evil troupe of traveling performers, Clara and O’Neill must find a way to save themselves and the ever-weakening mermaid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And always, in the back of her mind, Clara wonders, &lt;i&gt;if my sister is a mermaid, then what am I?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>It is the world of the near future, and Offred is a Handmaid in the home of the Commander and his wife. She is allowed out once a day to the food market, she is not permitted to read, and she is hoping the Commander makes her pregnant, because she is only valued if her ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she was an independent woman, had a job of her own, a husband and child. But all of that is gone now ... everything has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Deserves the highest praise." —&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy stranger at the seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant--and that her lover is married--she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that will echo down through the generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters--strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis--survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.</description>

  <description>Quickly becoming a cornerstone of Holocaust historiography—a devastatingly stark memoir from one of the lone survivors of Treblinka&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why do some live while so many others perish? Tiny children, old men, beautiful girls. In the gas chambers of Treblinka, all are equal. The Nazis kept the fires of Treblinka burning night and day, a central cog in the wheel of the Final Solution.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of Elie Wiesel’s Night and Primo Levi’s Survival at Auschwitz and The Drowned and the Saved, Rajchman provides the only survivors’ record of Treblinka. Originally written in Yiddish in 1945 without hope or agenda other than to bear witness, Rajchman’s tale shows that sometimes the bravest and most painful act of all is to remember.</description>

  <description>In the 1680s the slave trade in the Americas is still in its infancy. Jacob Vaark is an Anglo-Dutch trader and adventurer, with a small holding in the harsh North. Despite his distaste for dealing in “flesh,” he takes a small slave girl in part payment for a bad debt from a plantation owner in Catholic Maryland. &lt;br /&gt;This is Florens, who can read and write and might be useful on his farm. Rejected by her mother, Florens looks for love, first from Lina, an older servant woman at her new master's house, and later from the handsome blacksmith, an African, never enslaved, who comes riding into their lives.&lt;br /&gt;A Mercy reveals what lies beneath the surface of slavery. But at its heart, like Beloved, it is the ambivalent, disturbing story of a mother and a daughter - a mother who casts off her daughter in order to save her, and a daughter who may never exorcise that abandonment.</description>

  <description>At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers—one they are determined to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.</description>

  <description>Since her astonishing debut at twenty-five with &lt;i&gt;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&lt;/i&gt;, Jeanette Winterson has achieved worldwide critical and commercial success as "one of the most daring and inventive writers of our time" (&lt;i&gt;Elle&lt;/i&gt;). Her new novel, &lt;i&gt;Frankissstein&lt;/i&gt;, is an audacious love story that weaves together disparate lives into an exploration of transhumanism, artificial intelligence, and queer love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake Geneva, 1816. Nineteen-year-old Mary Shelley is inspired to write a story about a scientist who creates a new life-form. In Brexit Britain, a young transgender doctor called Ry is falling in love with Victor Stein, a celebrated professor leading the public debate around AI and carrying out some experiments of his own in a vast underground network of tunnels. Meanwhile, Ron Lord, just divorced and living with his mom again, is set to make his fortune launching a new generation of sex dolls for lonely men everywhere. Across the Atlantic, in Phoenix, Arizona, a cryogenics facility houses dozens of bodies of men and women who are medically and legally dead... but waiting to return to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will happen when &lt;i&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; is no longer the smartest being on the planet? In fiercely intelligent prose, Jeanette Winterson shows us how much closer we are to that future than we realize. Funny and furious, bold and clear-sighted, &lt;i&gt;Frankissstein&lt;/i&gt; is a love story about life itself.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Girl In Pieces &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;meets &lt;em&gt;Moxie&lt;/em&gt; in this unflinching exploration of the many forms of abuse society inflicts upon women, and the strength it takes to rise above it all to claim your worth.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girls at North Bay Academy are taking sides. It all started when Mike Parker's girlfriend showed up with a bruise on her face. Or, more specifically, when she walked into the principal's office and said Mike hit her. But the students have questions. Why did she go to the principal and not the polcie? Why did she stay so long if he was hurting her? Obviously, if it's true, Mike should be expelled. But &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; it true? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some girls want to rally for his expulsion—and some want to rally around Mike. The only thing that the entire student body can agree on? Someone is lying. And the truth has to come out. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ready.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised in the countryside by her overprotective uncle, Miss Mina Penny's dream of a triumphant London season is finally here. She determined her perfect match long ago: Rafe Bentley, the wickedest rake of them all. There's only one very large, very unyielding obstacle: Rafe's brother Andrew, the reclusive Duke of Thorndon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was supposed to be simple. Duke goes to London. Duke selects suitable bride. Love match? Not a chance. But when Drew meets Mina, she complicates everything. How can a lady armed with such beauty and brains fall for his irresponsible degenerate of a brother? Drew vows to save her from heartbreak and ruin, no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desire!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mina is no damsel in distress. She's daring, intuitive, passionate...and halfway to melting Drew's cold heart. And although Mina thought she knew exactly what she wanted, one breathtakingly seductive kiss from Drew changes everything. Now Mina must decide between long-held dreams and dangerous new desires. Could her true destiny lie in the arms of a duke?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;From 'one of the most gifted writers working today' (New York Times) comes an audacious new novel about the bodies we live in and the bodies we desire&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Brexit Britain, a young transgender doctor called Ry is falling in love – against their better judgement – with Victor Stein, a celebrated professor leading the public debate around AI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Ron Lord, just divorced and living with Mum again, is set to make his fortune launching a new generation of sex dolls for lonely men everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the Atlantic, in Phoenix, Arizona, a cryogenics facility houses dozens of bodies of men and women who are medically and legally dead… but waiting to return to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scene is set in 1816, when nineteen-year-old Mary Shelley writes a story about creating a non-biological life-form. &lt;i&gt;‘Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will happen when homo sapiens is no longer the smartest being on the planet? Jeanette Winterson shows us how much closer we are to that future than we realise. Funny and furious, bold and clear-sighted, &lt;i&gt;Frankissstein&lt;/i&gt; is a love story about life itself.</description>

  <description>The world knows the public face of the fourteenth Dalai Lama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have read about his near escape from Tibet after the Chinese invasion, his Nobel Peace Prize, and his friendships with world leaders, Hollywood actors, and scientists around the world. But what are his inner, personal thoughts on his own spiritual life? For the first time and in his own words, the Dalai Lama charts his spiritual journey from his boyhood days in rural Tibet to his years as a monk in the capital city of Dharamsala, to his life in exile as a world leader and symbol of peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Spiritual Journey&lt;/em&gt; provides a vivid and moving portrait of the Dalai Lama’s life journey that is personal in tone but universal in scope. He explores three phases or commitments of his spiritual life — as a human being, as a Buddhist monk, and as the Dalai Lama — each of which has made him more dedicated to exploring and teaching human values and inner happiness, promoting harmony among all religions, and advocating for the civil rights and well-being of the Tibetan people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the age of two, little Tenzin Gyatso was identified as the fourteenth incarnation of the first Dalai Lama. From then on, his life has been a trajectory few can imagine. Some see him as a living Buddha and moral authority, others identify him as a “god-king,” which still others see him in political terms as either a hero or a counterrevolutionary. In &lt;em&gt;My Spiritual Journey&lt;/em&gt;, we see the personal struggles, the courage, the laughter, and the compassion that have defined the remarkable life of one of our world’s greatest living legends.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a group of outcasts with extraordinary abilities comes out of hiding, their clash with a violent society will spark a revolution—or an apocalypse.&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avi Hirsch has always known his daughter was different. But when others with incredible, otherworldly gifts reveal themselves to the world, Avi realizes that her oddness is something more—that she is something more. With this, he has a terrifying revelation: Emmeline is now entering a society where her unique abilities unfairly mark her as a potential threat. And even though he is her father, Avi cannot keep her safe forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmeline soon meets others just like her: Carrie Norris, a teenage girl who can turn invisible . . . but just wants to be seen. Fahima Deeb, a woman with an uncanny knack for machinery . . . but it’s her Muslim faith that makes the U.S. government suspicious of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the nobody people—ordinary individuals with extraordinary gifts who want one only thing: to live as equals in an America that is gripped by fear and hatred. But the government is passing discriminatory laws. Violent mobs are taking to the streets. And one of their own—an angry young man seething with self-loathing—has used his power in an act of mass violence that has put a new target on the community. The nobody people must now stand together and fight for their future, or risk falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book of a timely two-part series, The Nobody People is a powerful novel of love and hope in the face of bigotry that uses a world touched by the fantastic to explore our current reality. It is a story of family and community. It is a story of continuing to fight for one another, no matter the odds. It is the story of us.</description>

  <description>At 01:23:40 on April 26th 1986, Alexander Akimov pressed the emergency shutdown button at Chernobyl’s fourth nuclear reactor. It was an act that forced the permanent evacuation of a city, killed thousands and crippled the Soviet Union. The event spawned decades of conflicting, exaggerated and inaccurate stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book, the result of five years of research, presents an accessible but comprehensive account of what really happened. From the desperate fight to prevent a burning reactor core from irradiating eastern Europe, to the self-sacrifice of the heroic men who entered fields of radiation so strong that machines wouldn’t work, to the surprising truth about the legendary ‘Chernobyl divers’, all the way through to the USSR’s final show-trial. The historical narrative is interwoven with a story of the author’s own spontaneous journey to Ukraine’s still-abandoned city of Pripyat and the wider Chernobyl Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete with over 45 pages of photographs of modern-day Pripyat and technical diagrams of the power station, Chernobyl 01:23:40 is a fascinating new account of the world’s worst nuclear disaster.</description>

      <![CDATA[If you loved the TV miniseries, read this too. It gives even more haunting detail. I dont think I could have read it first, I wouldn't have understood the science--the show does such a great job of explaining. But to read this after is a great pairing.]]>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Jack Pedersen is finding life complicated ever since he came out to his mom. Even though she's been doing her best to be understanding, it's obvious to Jack that his mom still wants to cry every time she says the word gay. Complications go into hyperdrive when a new student arrives at school, and Jack starts experiencing feelings he's never allowed himself to feel before. When a near tragedy turns life upside down, Jack realizes it's time to stop hiding from himself and everyone around him, and he decides to organize his small town's first Pride Parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more of Jack's story in Liane Shaw's previous novel, Caterpillars Can't Swim.</description>

      <![CDATA[The best new book I've read in 2019. As a girl from a pretty homogeneous small town, where conservative religious beliefs reign, this book struck a major chord. So many people I know are coming out now that they are away from home, and it really shows how scary it is to live in a place that doesn...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;BUDDHA is an inspiring re–imagining of the life of a prince who gave up the trappings of royalty for something much more important–wisdom and enlightenment. This revolutionary journey has changed the world forever, and the lessons Buddha taught continue to influence every corner of the globe today. This is a new form of teaching for beloved Chopra and with it he brings us closer to understanding the true nature of life and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the Author's Note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I wrote this book as a sacred journey, fictionalized in many of its externals but psychologically true, I hope, to what the seeker's path feels like. In all three phases of his life–Siddhartha the prince, Gautama the monk, and Buddha the Compassionate One––he was as mortal as you and I, yet he attained enlightenment and was raised to the rank of an immortal. The miracle is that he got there following a heart as human as yours and mine, and just as vulnerable. "&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Cosmos has 13 heavily illustrated chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos television series. In the book, Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of science and civilization. Cosmos traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method, mixing science and philosophy, and speculates to the future of science. The book also discusses the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists throughout history, placing their contributions into the broader context of the development of modern science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book covers a broad range of topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological, cosmological, biological, historical, and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth.</description>

The history of the discoveries, the breakdown of the elements, it's all there. It's hard to describe a book on science as timeless, as so much is always being uncove...]]>

  &lt;i&gt;Cloud isn’t just a place to work. It’s a place to live. And when you’re here, you’ll never want to leave.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“On the surface, &lt;i&gt;The Warehouse&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling story of corporate espionage at the highest level, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a terrifying cautionary tale of the nightmare world we are making for ourselves.”—Blake Crouch, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paxton never thought he’d be working for Cloud, the giant tech company that’s eaten much of the American economy. Much less that he’d be moving into one of the company’s sprawling live-work facilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But compared to what’s left outside, Cloud’s bland chainstore life of gleaming entertainment halls, open-plan offices, and vast warehouses…well, it doesn’t seem so bad. It’s more than anyone else is offering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinnia never thought she’d be infiltrating Cloud. But now she’s undercover, inside the walls, risking it all to ferret out the company’s darkest secrets. And Paxton, with his ordinary little hopes and fears? He just might make the perfect pawn. If she can bear to sacrifice him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the truth about Cloud unfolds, Zinnia must gamble everything on a desperate scheme—one that risks both their lives, even as it forces Paxton to question everything about the world he’s so carefully assembled here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they’ll learn just how far the company will go…to make the world a better place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the confines of a corporate panopticon that’s at once brilliantly imagined and terrifyingly real, &lt;i&gt; The Warehouse &lt;/i&gt; is a near-future thriller about what happens when Big Brother meets Big Business--and who will pay the ultimate price.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author and acclaimed historian Alison Weir tells the little-known story of Henry VIII’s fourth wife, as a grieving king chooses a bride sight unseen in the fourth novel in the epic and intrigue-filled Six Tudor Queens series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly widowed and the father of an infant son, Henry VIII realizes he must marry again to insure the royal succession. Now forty-six, overweight and unwell, Henry is soundly rejected by some of Europe’s most eligible princesses, but Anna of Kleve—a small German duchy—is twenty-four and eager to wed. Henry requests Anna’s portrait from his court painter, who enhances her looks, painting her straight-on in order not to emphasize her rather long nose. Henry is entranced by the lovely image, only to be bitterly surprised when Anna arrives in England and he sees her in the flesh. She is pleasant looking, just not the lady that Henry had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is a fascinating story of this awkward royal union that had to somehow be terminated tactfully. Alison Weir takes a fresh and surprising look at this remarkable royal marriage by describing it from the point of view of Queen Anna, a young woman with hopes and dreams of her own, alone in a royal court that rejected her from the day she arrived.</description>

  <description>A long-overdue and dramatic reinterpretation of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots by one of the leading historians at work today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was crowned Queen of Scotland at nine months of age, and Queen of France at sixteen years; at eighteen she ascended the throne that was her birthright and began ruling one of the most fractious courts in Europe, riven by religious conflict and personal lust for power. She rode out at the head of an army in both victory and defeat; saw her second husband assassinated, and married his murderer. At twenty-five she entered captivity at the hands of her rival queen, from which only death would release her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of Mary Stuart is one of unparalleled drama and conflict. From the labyrinthine plots laid by the Scottish lords to wrest power for themselves, to the efforts made by Elizabeth's ministers to invalidate Mary's legitimate claim to the English throne, John Guy returns to the archives to explode the myths and correct the inaccuracies that surround this most fascinating monarch. He also explains a central mystery: why Mary would have consented to marry – only three months after the death of her second husband, Lord Darnley – the man who was said to be his killer, the Earl of Bothwell. And, more astonishingly, he solves, through careful re-examination of the Casket Letters, the secret behind Darnley's spectacular assassination at Kirk o'Field. With great pathos, Guy illuminates how the imprisoned Mary's despair led to a reckless plot against Elizabeth – and thus to her own execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portrait that emerges is not of a political pawn or a manipulative siren, but of a shrewd and charismatic young ruler who relished power and, for a time, managed to hold together a fatally unstable country.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;To an undaunted wallflower, he's just the beast next door.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy and ruthless, Gabriel Duke clawed his way from the lowliest slums to the pinnacle of high society—and now he wants to get even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyal and passionate, Lady Penelope Campion never met a lost or wounded creature she wouldn’t take into her home and her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her imposing—and attractive—new neighbor demands she clear out the rescued animals, Penny sets him a challenge. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; will part with her precious charges, if &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; can find them loving homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done, Gabriel says. How hard can it be to find homes for a few kittens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a two-legged dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a foul-mouthed parrot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a goat, an otter, a hedgehog . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done, for a cold-blooded bastard who wouldn’t know a loving home from a workhouse. Soon he’s covered in cat hair, knee-deep in adorable, and bewitched by a shyly pretty spinster who defies his every attempt to resist. Now she’s set her mind and heart on saving &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if he ruins her first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;For a duchess with practical desires, falling in love is an inconceivable part of her plan…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As owner of the Elysium Club which caters to women's fantasies, Aiden Trewlove is accustomed to introducing adventurous ladies to sin and vice. But he is uncharacteristically intrigued by the mysterious beauty who visits his club one night, yearning to indulge in the forbidden—with him. Drawn to her indomitable spirit, he breaks his rule of never becoming personally involved with his clientele and is determined to fully awaken her desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent widow, Selena Sheffield, Duchess of Lushing, has never known passion, not until Aiden's slow, sensual seduction leads her on a journey of discovery and incredible pleasure. But her reasons for visiting the notorious club are not all that they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Selena's motives become complicated by love, she finds herself with a most unexpected choice: forge ahead with a secret plan that could secure her future—or follow her heart which could prove ruinous.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;They call him the Duke of Ruin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To an undaunted wallflower, he's just the beast next door.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wealthy and ruthless, Gabriel Duke clawed his way from the lowliest slums to the pinnacle of high society—and now he wants to get even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loyal and passionate, Lady Penelope Campion never met a lost or wounded creature she wouldn’t take into her home and her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her imposing—and attractive—new neighbor demands she clear out the rescued animals, Penny sets him a challenge. She will part with her precious charges, if he can find them loving homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done, Gabriel says. How hard can it be to find homes for a few kittens?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a two-legged dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a foul-mouthed parrot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a goat, an otter, a hedgehog . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easier said than done, for a cold-blooded bastard who wouldn’t know a loving home from a workhouse. Soon he’s covered in cat hair, knee-deep in adorable, and bewitched by a shyly pretty spinster who defies his every attempt to resist. Now she’s set her mind and heart on saving him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if he ruins her first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Content advisories are available for this book at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tessadare.com/content-advisories/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tessadare.com/content-advisories/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A seductive thief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady’s maid Molly Wilkins is done with thieving—and cheating and stabbing and all the rest of it. She’s determined to keep her hands to herself, so she really shouldn’t be tempted to seduce her employer’s prim and proper companion, Alice. But how can she resist when Alice can’t seem to keep her eyes off Molly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Finds her own heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in her life, Alice Stapleton has absolutely nothing to do. The only thing that seems to occupy her thoughts is a lady’s maid with a sharp tongue and a beautiful mouth. Her determination to know Molly’s secrets has her behaving in ways she never imagined as she begins to fall for the impertinent woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Has been stolen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an unwelcome specter from Alice’s past shows up unexpectedly at a house party, Molly volunteers to help the only way she knows how: with a little bit of mischief.</description>

But soon she discovers that here, freedom can also mean danger. When thugs destroy the school she has set up and then target her, Valinda runs for her life—and straight into the arms of Captain Drake LeVeq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an architect from an old New Orleans family, Drake has a deeply personal interest in rebuilding the city.

But when Valinda's father demands she return home to marry a man she doesn't love, her daring rebellion draws Drake into an irresistible intrigue.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;"She smiled a soft, troubled smile and I felt the whole world slipping away, and I wanted to slip with it, to go wherever she was going... I had existed whole years without her, but that was all it had been. An existence. A book with no words."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Hazard has just moved back to London, his old home, to settle down and become a high school history teacher. And on his first day at school, he meets a captivating French teacher at his school who seems fascinated by him. But Tom has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but owing to a rare condition, he's been alive for centuries. Tom has lived history--performing with Shakespeare, exploring the high seas with Captain Cook, and sharing cocktails with Fitzgerald. Now, he just wants an ordinary life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Tom, the Albatross Society, the secretive group which protects people like Tom, has one rule: Never fall in love. As painful memories of his past and the erratic behavior of the Society's watchful leader threaten to derail his new life and romance, the one thing he can't have just happens to be the one thing that might save him. Tom will have to decide once and for all whether to remain stuck in the past, or finally begin living in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Stop Time&lt;/i&gt; tells a love story across the ages--and for the ages--about a man lost in time, the woman who could save him, and the lifetimes it can take to learn how to live. It is a bighearted, wildly original novel about losing and finding yourself, the inevitability of change, and how with enough time to learn, we just might find happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon to be a major motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch.</description>

  <description>Simon Snow is the worst Chosen One who's ever been chosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what his roommate, Baz, says. And Baz might be evil and a vampire and a &lt;i&gt;complete git&lt;/i&gt;, but he's probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the time, Simon can't even make his wand work, and the other half, he starts something on fire. His mentor's avoiding him, his girlfriend broke up with him, and there's a magic-eating monster running around, wearing Simon's face. Baz would be having a field day with all this, if he were here — it's their last year at the Watford School of Magicks, and Simon's infuriating nemesis didn't even bother to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Carry On - The Rise and Fall of Simon Snow&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; is a ghost story, a love story and a mystery. It has just as much kissing and talking as you'd expect from a Rainbow Rowell story - but far, far more monsters.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Debut YA author Natasha Diaz pulls from her personal experience to inform this powerful coming-of-age novel about the meaning of friendship, the joyful beginnings of romance, and the racism and religious intolerance that can both strain a family to the breaking point and strengthen its bonds.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is Nevaeh Levitz?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up in an affluent suburb of New York City, sixteen-year-old Nevaeh Levitz never thought much about her biracial roots. When her Black mom and Jewish dad split up, she relocates to her mom's family home in Harlem and is forced to confront her identity for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevaeh wants to get to know her extended family, but one of her cousins can't stand that Nevaeh, who inadvertently passes as white, is too privileged, pampered, and selfish to relate to the injustices they face on a daily basis as African Americans. In the midst of attempting to blend their families, Nevaeh's dad decides that she should have a belated bat mitzvah instead of a sweet sixteen, which guarantees social humiliation at her posh private school. Even with the push and pull of her two cultures, Nevaeh does what she's always done when life gets complicated: she stays silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's only when Nevaeh stumbles upon a secret from her mom's past, finds herself falling in love, and sees firsthand the prejudice her family faces that she begins to realize she has a voice. And she has choices. Will she continue to let circumstances dictate her path? Or will she find power in herself and decide once and for all who and where she is meant to be?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;____________________&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gun violence, climate change and unemployment have ravaged the United States beyond recognition&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst the wreckage, an online retail giant named Cloud reigns supreme. Cloud brands itself not just as an online storefront, but as a global saviour. Yet, beneath the sunny exterior, lurks something far more sinister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paxton never thought he’d be working Security for the company that ruined his life, much less that he’d be moving into one of their sprawling live-work facilities. But compared to what’s left outside, perhaps Cloud isn’t so bad. Better still, through his work he meets Zinnia, who fills him with hope for their shared future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that Zinnia is not what she seems. And Paxton, with his all-access security credentials, might just be her meal ticket.&lt;br /&gt;As Paxton and Zinnia’s agendas place them on a collision course, they’re about to learn just how far the Cloud will go to make the world a better place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To beat the system, you have to be inside it.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A speculative thriller in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Power&lt;/i&gt;. Optioned by Universal and Elizabeth Banks to be a major motion picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SURVIVE THE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one speaks of the grace year. It’s forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Garner County, girls are told they have the power to lure grown men from their beds, to drive women mad with jealousy. They believe their very skin emits a powerful aphrodisiac, the potent essence of youth, of a girl on the edge of womanhood. That’s why they’re banished for their sixteenth year, to release their magic into the wild so they can return purified and ready for marriage. But not all of them will make it home alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Tierney James dreams of a better life—a society that doesn’t pit friend against friend or woman against woman, but as her own grace year draws near, she quickly realizes that it’s not just the brutal elements they must fear. It’s not even the poachers in the woods, men who are waiting for a chance to grab one of the girls in order to make a fortune on the black market. Their greatest threat may very well be each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sharp prose and gritty realism, &lt;i&gt;The Grace Year&lt;/i&gt; examines the complex and sometimes twisted relationships between girls, the women they eventually become, and the difficult decisions they make in-between.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;One little wager will determine their fate—a daring escape or falling into temptation with a rakish lord.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Betsy Wilde’s first season was triumphant by any measure, and a duke has proposed—but before marriage, she longs for one last adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No gentleman would agree to her scandalous plan—but Lord Jeremy Roden is no gentleman. He offers a wager. If she wins a billiards game, he’ll provide the breeches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he wins…she is his, for one wild night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when Jeremy realizes that one night will never be enough? In the most important battle of his life, he’ll have to convince Betsy to say no to the duke.</description>

  <description>With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally bestselling author George R. R. Martin, this is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice &amp;amp; Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros.</description>

      <![CDATA[Interesting if you're a GOT fans, but I did think it overly long and repetitive, and it's ONLY about the Targaryens. It also ends before we get to "recent" history. Will be interested to see if he does more spinoffs like this for other families, or if we get to see what happens with Ned and Rober...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Co-written by sisters Maika and Maritza Moulite, and told in epistolary style through letters, articles, emails, and diary entries, this exceptional debut novel captures a sparkling new voice and irrepressible heroine in a celebration of storytelling sure to thrill fans of Nicola Yoon, Ibi Zoboi and Jenna Evans Welch!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a school presentation goes very wrong, Alaine Beauparlant finds herself suspended, shipped off to Haiti and writing the report of a lifetime…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might ask the obvious question: What do I, a seventeen-year-old Haitian American from Miami with way too little life experience, have to say about anything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to “the incident” (don’t ask), I'm spending the next two months doing what my school is calling a "spring volunteer immersion project.” It’s definitely no vacation. I’m toiling away under the ever-watchful eyes of Tati Estelle at her new nonprofit. And my lean-in queen of a mother is even here to make sure I do things right. Or she might just be lying low to dodge the media sharks after a &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more public incident of her own…and to hide a rather devastating secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, there are some pretty nice perks…like flirting with Tati’s distractingly cute intern, getting actual face time with my mom and experiencing Haiti for the first time. I’m even exploring my family’s history—which happens to be loaded with betrayals, superstitions and possibly even a family curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, typical drama. But it's nothing I can't handle.</description>

  <description>In these stories, Jemisin sharply examines modern society, infusing magic into the mundane, and drawing deft parallels in the fantasy realms of her imagination. Dragons and hateful spirits haunt the flooded city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In a parallel universe, a utopian society watches our world, trying to learn from our mistakes. A black mother in the Jim Crow south must figure out how to save her daughter from a fey offering impossible promises. And in the Hugo award-nominated short story “The City Born Great,” a young street kid fights to give birth to an old metropolis’s soul.</description>

      <![CDATA[The writing is clearly brilliant. I loved the stories in the first half of this book. However, the second half became a bit too sci fi for me and I didn't enjoy them as much. That's more a fault of mine tho than the author's or the book's. Each story is captivating in it's own way, and they are a...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/i&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

However, I felt there was a lot of detail that kind of fell off--lots of ghost stories without really being a ghost story. The narrator almost builds a gothic tale, but then nothing reall...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;They are sworn enemies…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theodore Prescott the Third, one of Manhattan’s Rogues of Millionaire Row, has really done it this time. The only way to survive his most recent, unspeakably outrageous scandal is marry someone respectable. Someone sensible. Someone like Daisy Swan. Of all the girls in Gilded Age Manhattan, it had to be her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Pretending to be lovers...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Swan has plans and they do not involve a loveless marriage with anyone. But when a devastating family secret threatens to destroy her standing in society, suddenly a fake engagement with Theo is just the thing to make all her dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;And now it’s time to kiss and make up…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy Swan aspires to sell cosmetics that she has created, but this brainy scientist needs a smooth talking charmer’s flair for words and eye for beauty to make it a success. Before long, Daisy and Theo are trading kisses. And secrets. And discovering that despite appearances, they might be the perfect couple after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against her better judgement, spirited beauty Sabine Noble agrees to speedily marry a stranger who can remove her from the home of an abusive uncle. The union allows her to relocate to London and start a new life writing travel guides and enjoying the city on her own terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A DOWRY WITH NO EXPECTATIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Captain Jon Stoker has no desire to be a husband, but Sabine's offer of a commitment-free marriage and a hefty dowry is hard to refuse. After he delivers Sabine from her violent uncle, the deal allows Stoker to say good-bye and sail away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A CHANCE RESCUE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Stoker's travels put him in harm's way, neither dowry nor freedom can save him. His unconscious body is returned to England, and a chance discovery by his estranged wife rescues him from the morgue. Sabine is uncertain of her responsibilities to the unconscious husband she barely knows, but she begins the reluctant job of nursing him back to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A RECOVERY OF THE HEART&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the private confines of Sabine's bedroom, the estranged husband and wife reckon with the attraction that has been there all along and the new, hot-sparking desire. And when Stoker has recovered and Sabine takes revenge on her dangerous uncle, they realize that attraction and desire have evolved into love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From storytelling phenomenon The Moth, 45 unforgettable true stories about risk, courage, and facing the unknown, drawn from the best ever told on their stages&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Carefully selected by the creative minds at The Moth, and adapted to the page to preserve the raw energy of live storytelling, &lt;i&gt;All These Wonders&lt;/i&gt; features voices both familiar and new. Alongside Louis C.K., Tig Notaro, John Turturro, and Meg Wolitzer, readers will encounter: an astronomer gazing at the surface of Pluto for the first time, an Afghan refugee learning how much her father sacrificed to save their family, a hip-hop star coming to terms with being a one-hit wonder, a young female spy risking everything as part of Churchill's secret army during World War II, and more. &lt;br /&gt; High-school student and neuroscientist alike, the storytellers share their ventures into uncharted territory and how their lives were changed indelibly by what they discovered there. With passion, and humor, they encourage us all to be more open, vulnerable, and alive."</description>

Will they find Abigail? Is she still alive? Will they find the newbie camp? Will they find out who the leader of Territory M is? Will the leader help them bring the walls down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma thought escaping from Territory L would solve all of her problems. She soon finds out that escaping to Territory M is not all she envisioned it would be.

  <description>Two teens meet after tragedy and learn about love, loss, and letting go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naima Rodriguez doesn’t want your patronizing sympathy as she grieves her father, her hero—a fallen Marine. She’ll hate you forever if you ask her to open up and remember him “as he was,” though that’s all her loving family wants her to do in order to manage her complex OCD and GAD. She’d rather everyone back the-eff off while she separates her Lucky Charms marshmallows into six, always six, Ziploc bags, while she avoids friends and people and living the life her father so desperately wanted for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dew respectfully requests a little more time to process the sudden loss of his parents. It's causing an avalanche of secret anxieties, so he counts on his trusty voice recorder to convey the things he can’t otherwise say aloud. He could really use a friend to navigate a life swimming with pain and loss and all the lovely moments in between. And then he meets Naima and everything’s changed—just not in the way he, or she, expects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candace Ganger's &lt;i&gt;Six Goodbyes We Never Said&lt;/i&gt; is no love story. If you ask Naima, it’s not even a like story. But it is a story about love and fear and how sometimes you need a little help to be brave enough to say goodbye.</description>

  <description>A young adult, fantasy novel about a teenager who is the last eighteen-year-old in her territory. There will never be another child; every baby born after her has been taken away. Everyone wonders why she survived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Whisperer was born in 2080, in the small futuristic world of Craigluy. President Esther, in charge for the last twenty-two years, has divided their world into three territories, separated by classes—the rich, the working class, and the poor—because she believes the poor should not mingle with the others. And, the poor are no longer allowed to have children, since they do not have the means to take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any babies born, accidentally or willfully, are killed. Emma is the last eighteen-year-old in her territory; every baby born after her has died. Somehow, she survived this fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the president’s Monday night speech, she announces a party will be held to honor the last child in the territory, Emma Whisperer. Emma must read a speech, expressing how happy she is to be the last eighteen-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma doesn’t like the rules; she doesn’t believe in them. So, she feels she must rebel against them. Her family doesn’t agree with her rebellion, since they are hiding a big secret. If this secret gets out, it will be disastrous, and deadly, for her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During Emma’s journey, she meets—and becomes friends with—Eric. He is one of the guards for the president. She also befriends Samuel, another guard for the president, who is summoned to watch over her. As Emma meets new people, she doesn’t know who she can trust. Yet, she finds herself falling for a guy, something which has never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing what she feels is right, Emma finds herself in imminent danger. In the end, she must make one gut-wrenching decision, a decision that may be disastrous for them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Fans of dystopian fantasy will devour this book. L. J. Epps writes a story that, while dealing with heavy subject matter, is still a light, enjoyable read. This dystopian fantasy novel ignites the imagination, and is a must read for fans of The Hunger Games and the Divergent Trilogy.”&lt;br /&gt;—Kristina Gemmell,&lt;br /&gt;Beta Reader</description>

  <description>Self-made man Aidan Iverson has seen more closed doors in his thirty years than he’s ever cared to count. As a member of the elite Duke’s Den, he has all the money he could possibly need, but the one thing he can’t purchase is true power. If roguish Aidan can’t buy his way into society’s hallowed halls, he’ll resort to a more extreme measure: marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought up to be a proper lady, the only thing Diana Ashby desires is to be left alone to the creation of her own devices. But when her dreams are crushed, she must find another way to secure the future of her invention. Knowing his desire to enter her world, Diana strikes a deal to arrange Aidan’s marriage to the perfect lady—as long as that lady isn’t her. She doesn’t need any distractions from her work, particularly of the sinfully handsome variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Diana and Aidan set out to find him an aristocratic match, neither are prepared for the passion that ignites between them or the love they can’t ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Duke’s Den, can happiness ever be a winning prospect?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She's a deliciously scandalous woman who is no man's bride…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's a black sheep, forced to return home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they enter a make-believe betrothal that shocks London society…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After twelve years in Her Majesty's Navy, Griffith Davies must leave his sea-going life of outrageous freedom behind, forced to rejoin London society as the heir to the Duke of Northam. But though he is now shackled to the land, he has no desire to wed some innocently dull young thing. Who best to shield him from the matchmakers than a woman as notorious as he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Della Howlett's reputation was tattered years ago, so entering into a false engagement with Griffith is hardly going to make matters worse. What's one more shock to the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; to set their tongues wagging? And this pact certainly has its pleasures; the passion Griffith commands in her goes well beyond their agreement. Could her feelings might be more honorable than she'd first imagined?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, Griffith and Della are arousing more than scandal; they're courting heartbreak. And more than their reputations could still be at risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;One reluctant heir&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else had asked for his help publishing a naughty novel, Ash would have had the sense to say no. But he’s never been able to deny Verity Plum. Now he has his hands full illustrating a book and trying his damnedest not to fall in love with his best friend. The last thing he needs is to discover he’s a duke’s lost heir. Without a family or a proper education, he’s had to fight for his place in the world, and the idea of it—and Verity—being taken away from him chills him to the bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One radical bookseller&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Verity wants is to keep her brother out of prison, her business afloat, and her hands off Ash. Lately it seems she’s not getting anything she wants. She knows from bitter experience that she isn’t cut out for romance, but the more time she spends with Ash, the more she wonders if maybe she’s been wrong about herself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One disaster waiting to happen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ash has a month before his identity is exposed, and he plans to spend it with Verity. As they explore their long-buried passion, it becomes harder for Ash to face the music. Can Verity accept who Ash must become or will he turn away the only woman he’s ever loved?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: off page domestic violence, off page neglect of child, epileptic seizure</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A woman with a shocking past…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Branded a money-hungry con artist for marrying the elderly Duke of Tremaine days before his death, Viola Cartwright has found refuge in her work at St. Agatha’s Hospital. No one must know the painful reason behind her marriage. She steers clear of attachments—until Henry Lowell, heir to the Viscount Armswell, lands on her operating table after a duel. Charming and wickedly handsome, Lowell is one of London’s most inveterate scoundrels. Yet he may not be all that he appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;And the man who can promise a future filled with love…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posing as an unrepentant rake has helped Lowell avoid women pursuing him only for his title. But now that duty has finally called on him to marry, he finds himself entranced by the mysterious, independent-minded Viola. Then her late husband’s son returns from overseas, contesting Viola’s inheritance. Lowell longs to help her and sets out to convince Viola that a strategic union may be the best way to save all she holds dear. But can he also persuade her to take a chance on love…?</description>

  <description>Rebellion drove Mercy Rutherford to Scotland to escape the possessive grip of her fiancé. But it’s fate that lands her in the crumbling highlands castle of Ross Caithart. A dreamer with visions of inventing airships, he’s most certainly mad. Handsome beyond words, he’s also causing an irresistible flutter in her stomach beyond reason. When Gregory arrives to see their arranged marriage to its bitter end, Mercy desperately turns to Ross with an offer of her fortune—and her hand in marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earl of Morton has a reputation for being a daredevil eccentric, but even he is hesitant to engage in such a rash proposition—no matter how utterly beguiled he is by the wildly independent American heiress. And yet, with so much at stake, how can he possibly say no? But when their unconventional union grows into a passionate and inseparable love, more than Gregory’s obsession threatens them. Now, Ross and Mercy will have to risk more than their hearts to save it.</description>

  <description>A tragedy on a hot summer night at a lake house forever alters the lives of two best friends—and the man they both love. But the truth isn’t as simple as it appears in this intricate novel of love, friendship, betrayal, and forgiveness in the tradition of Miranda Beverly-Whittemore’s Bittersweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leah Tessaro has been waiting for this moment for a long time: Her boyfriend, Ollie, is taking her to his family’s home on Seneca Lake for a week of lazy summer bliss, boating, and barbeque. The couple has been together for four years, and Leah is convinced that Ollie is finally going to pop the question. And Leah can’t wait to share the joyous news with her best friend, June Kang, who is joining them on their getaway, and whose presence will make everything feel more real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven years later, the moment June has been dreading has finally arrived: Her fiancé, Ollie, is taking her to his family’s lake house. But this is not an ordinary visit to an ordinary place; it is a house haunted by June’s long-buried memories of her lost friend, Leah—and the connection that appears to remain between Leah and the man for whom June’s love is as deep as her sense of foreboding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternating between the two women’s vibrant voices, One Night at the Lake is a gripping novel that explores a complex tangle of friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, all driving toward one question: What exactly happened to Leah on that hot summer night?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this epic tale of friendship and loss from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Sugar Men&lt;/i&gt;, fate pushes childhood friends to opposite sides of a terrible war—but is forgiveness always possible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ukraine, 1923. On a small farm, two boys are born within days of each other, both Ukrainian, one Jewish. Mykhail and Asher grow up inseparable, together finding friendship, adventure and escape from the harshness of Russian rule. But after Asher’s family flees to Warsaw, their worlds are torn to shreds by the Second World War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war brings cruelty to both boys. Although Asher finds love in Warsaw, the city is far from the haven his family sought; meanwhile Mykhail becomes a victim of the bitter struggle for Ukraine. But worse follows in the shape of the Treblinka death camp. There, both men must obey orders, and both find their morals compromised and their souls tortured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inhuman horrors they witness cast long shadows. Many years later, their paths cross once more, and each man must confront the legacy of his actions. When the darkest of secrets can no longer be kept hidden, can their friendship survive the final reckoning?</description>

  <description>In 1936, tucked deep into the woods of Troublesome Creek, KY, lives blue-skinned 19-year-old Cussy Carter, the last living female of the rare Blue People ancestry. The lonely young Appalachian woman joins the historical Pack Horse Library Project of Kentucky and becomes a librarian, riding across slippery creek beds and up treacherous mountains on her faithful mule to deliver books and other reading material to the impoverished hill people of Eastern Kentucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along her dangerous route, Cussy, known to the mountain folk as Bluet, confronts those suspicious of her damselfly-blue skin and the government's new book program. She befriends hardscrabble and complex fellow Kentuckians, and is fiercely determined to bring comfort and joy, instill literacy, and give to those who have nothing, a bookly respite, a fleeting retreat to faraway lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek&lt;i&gt; is a powerful message about how the written word affects people--a story of hope and heartbreak, raw courage and strength splintered with poverty and oppression, and one woman's chances beyond the darkly hollows. Inspired by the true and historical blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the brave and dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse library service, &lt;i&gt;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek showcases a bold and unique tale of the Pack horse Librarians in literary novels — a story of fierce strength and one woman's belief that books can carry us anywhere — even back home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Armstrong shares her story of living with debilitating depression and the radical treatment she underwent to cure it. For years she controlled her depression with a mixture of prescriptions, but when their effects start fading, Armstrong experiences an 18-month period of deep depression fueled by suicidal thoughts. Scared of what will become of her and the possibility of losing custody of her daughters, Armstrong opts for a month-long experimental treatment. One of only 3 people participating, she receives 10 doctor-administered treatments, each of which induces a coma that leaves her brain-dead for a short period of time.</description>

  <description>She was the mother of Henry VIII and wife of Henry VII, but who was Elizabeth of York? Raised as the precious oldest child of Edward IV, Elizabeth had every reason to expect a bright future until Edward died, and her life fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Elizabeth's uncle became Richard III, she was forced to choose sides. Should she trust her father's brother and most loyal supporter or honor the betrothal that her mother has made for her to her family's enemy, Henry Tudor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The choice was made for her on the field at Bosworth, and Elizabeth the Plantagenet princess became the first Tudor queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Elizabeth find happiness with Henry? Did she ever discover the truth about her missing brothers, who became better known as the Princes in the Tower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose yourself in Elizabeth's world in &lt;i&gt;Plantagenet Princess, Tudor Queen&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selected as an Editor's Choice by the Historical Novel Society and long-listed for the 2016 HNS Indie Award.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Could ten days at a health resort really change you forever? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nine perfect strangers are about to find out...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer—or should she run while she still can?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining all of the hallmarks that have made Liane Moriarty's writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, &lt;i&gt;Nine Perfect Strangers&lt;/i&gt; once again shows why she is a master of her craft.</description>

  <description>The last thing Jamie Watson wants is a rugby scholarship to Sherringford, a Connecticut prep school just an hour away from his estranged father. But that’s not the only complication: Sherringford is also home to Charlotte Holmes, the famous detective’s great-great-great-granddaughter, who has inherited not only Sherlock’s genius but also his volatile temperament. From everything Jamie has heard about Charlotte, it seems safer to admire her from afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment they meet, there’s a tense energy between them, and they seem more destined to be rivals than anything else. But when a Sherringford student dies under suspicious circumstances, ripped straight from the most terrifying of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Jamie can no longer afford to keep his distance. Jamie and Charlotte are being framed for murder, and only Charlotte can clear their names. But danger is mounting and nowhere is safe—and the only people they can trust are each other.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Come Up&lt;/i&gt; is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;A chilling ghost story with a twist: the &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;The Winter People&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; returns to the woods of Vermont to tell the story of a husband and wife who don't simply move into a haunted house, they start building one from scratch, without knowing it, until it's too late . . . &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate abandon the comforts of suburbia and their teaching jobs to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project: building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this charming property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. As Helen starts carefully sourcing decorative building materials for her home--wooden beams, mantles, historic bricks--she starts to unearth, and literally conjure, the tragic lives of Hattie's descendants, three generations of "Breckenridge women," each of whom died amidst suspicion, and who seem to still be seeking something precious and elusive in the present day.</description>

      <![CDATA[Loved this book. Mixes suspense with historical fiction, and throws in a splash of witchy paranormal. I didn't care so much for Nate, but otherwise the characters were well written, and it was an easy plot to fall into. I didn't want to put this down.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dear Lady Truelove...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My twin brother and I need a new mother, though Papa insists he'll never marry again. Must be nice, brainy, and fond of cats...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Truelove may be London's most famous advice columnist, but James St. Clair, the Earl of Kenyon, knows his wild young sons need a tutor, not a new mother. They need a man tough enough to make his hellions tow the line, and James is determined to find one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Amanda Leighton, former schoolteacher and governess, knows she has all the qualifications to be a tutor. And while female tutors are unheard of, Amanda isn't about to lose the chance at her dream job because of pesky details like that. If Lord Kenyon insists on hiring a man, then she has only one option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie isn't sure what to make of his new employee, until he realizes the shocking truth—beneath the ill-fitting suits, his boys' tutor is a woman. An unconventional, outspoken, thoroughly intriguing woman. Despite Amanda's deception, he can't dismiss her when his boys are learning so much. Yet Jamie, too, is learning surprising lessons—about desire, seduction, and passionate second chances.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A personal and urgent examination of Fascism in the twentieth century and how its legacy shapes today’s world, written by one of America’s most admired public servants, the first woman to serve as U.S. secretary of state&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Fascist, observes Madeleine Albright, “is someone who claims to speak for a whole nation or group, is utterly unconcerned with the rights of others, and is willing to use violence and whatever other means are necessary to achieve the goals he or she might have.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twentieth century was defined by the clash between democracy and Fascism, a struggle that created uncertainty about the survival of human freedom and left millions dead. Given the horrors of that experience, one might expect the world to reject the spiritual successors to Hitler and Mussolini should they arise in our era. In &lt;em&gt;Fascism: A Warning&lt;/em&gt;, Madeleine Albright draws on her experiences as a child in war-torn Europe and her distinguished career as a diplomat to question that assumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascism, as she shows, not only endured through the twentieth century but now presents a more virulent threat to peace and justice than at any time since the end of World War II.  The momentum toward democracy that swept the world when the Berlin Wall fell has gone into reverse.  The United States, which historically championed the free world, is led by a president who exacerbates division and heaps scorn on democratic institutions.  In many countries, economic, technological, and cultural factors are weakening the political center and empowering the extremes of right and left.  Contemporary leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are employing many of the tactics used by Fascists in the 1920s and 30s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fascism: A Warning&lt;/em&gt; is a book for our times that is relevant to all times.  Written  by someone who has not only studied history but helped to shape it, this call to arms teaches us the lessons we must understand and the questions we must answer if we are to save ourselves from repeating the tragic errors of the past.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A laird's daughter kidnaps a Highlander—and loses her heart… in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lynsay Sands' new historical romance...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Evina Maclean has heard much about Rory Buchanan's skill as a healer. What she hasn't heard is how good the brawny Highlander looks bathing in a waterfall. But Evina can't afford the distraction, for her ailing father urgently needs care. Only when she's rendered Buchanan unconscious and dragged him back to her family's castle does the truth emerge—it's not Rory she's kidnapped but his brother Conran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ladies try to ensnare Conran with flattery. Evina hits him over the head with the hilt of her sword to save her kin—and Conran likes the spirited redhead all the more for it. He's learned enough from his brother to heal Evina's father, but there are other dangers swirling around the Maclean clan. And while the beautiful, independent lady has sworn not to marry, this wrong Highlander may be just the right man for her.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Following their adventures in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Girl in the Tower&lt;/i&gt;, Vasya and Morozko return in this stunning conclusion to the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Winternight Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, battling enemies mortal and magical to save both Russias, the seen and the unseen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Moscow has been struck by disaster. Its people are searching for answers—and for someone to blame. Vasya finds herself alone, beset on all sides. The Grand Prince is in a rage, choosing allies that will lead him on a path to war and ruin. A wicked demon returns, stronger than ever and determined to spread chaos. Caught at the center of the conflict is Vasya, who finds the fate of two worlds resting on her shoulders. Her destiny uncertain, Vasya will uncover surprising truths about herself and her history as she desperately tries to save Russia, Morozko, and the magical world she treasures. But she may not be able to save them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for &lt;i&gt;The Winter of the Witch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Katherine Arden’s Winternight Trilogy isn’t just good—it’s hug-to-your-chest, straight-to-the-favorites-shelf, reread-immediately good, and each book just gets better. The Winter of the Witch plunges us back to fourteenth-century Moscow, where old gods and new vie for the soul of Russia and fate rests on a witch girl’s slender shoulders. Prepare to have your heart ripped out, loaned back to you full of snow and magic, and ripped out some more.”—&lt;b&gt;Laini Taylor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously published edition of ISBN 9780525646990. An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47907309-spin-the-dawn" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Runway&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Mulan&lt;/i&gt; in this sweeping YA fantasy about a young girl who poses as a boy to compete for the role of imperial tailor and embarks on an impossible journey to sew three magic dresses, from the sun, the moon, and the stars.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maia Tamarin dreams of becoming the greatest tailor in the land, but as a girl, the best she can hope for is to marry well. When a royal messenger summons her ailing father, once a tailor of renown, to court, Maia poses as a boy and takes his place. She knows her life is forfeit if her secret is discovered, but she'll take that risk to achieve her dream and save her family from ruin. There's just one catch: Maia is one of twelve tailors vying for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstabbing and lies run rampant as the tailors compete in challenges to prove their artistry and skill. Maia's task is further complicated when she draws the attention of the court magician, Edan, whose piercing eyes seem to see straight through her disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And nothing could have prepared her for the final challenge: to sew three magic gowns for the emperor's reluctant bride-to-be, from the laughter of the sun, the tears of the moon, and the blood of stars. With this impossible task before her, she embarks on a journey to the far reaches of the kingdom, seeking the sun, the moon, and the stars, and finding more than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steeped in Chinese culture, sizzling with forbidden romance, and shimmering with magic, this young adult fantasy is pitch-perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas or Renée Ahdieh.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this "compelling and disturbing" true story (Rebecca Traister), a young woman's toxic mentor develops a dark, stalking obsession that disrupts her career -- and her peace of mind.&lt;/strong&gt; Donna Freitas has lived two lives. In one life, she is a well-published author and respected scholar who has traveled around the country speaking about Title IX, consent, religion, and sex on college campuses. In the other, she is a victim, a woman who suffered and suffers still because she was stalked by her graduate professor for more than two years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a doctoral candidate, Freitas loved asking big questions, challenging established theories and sinking her teeth into sacred texts. She felt at home in the library, and safe in the book-lined offices of scholars whom she admired. But during her first year, one particular scholar became obsessed with Freitas' academic enthusiasm. He filled her student mailbox with letters and articles. He lurked on the sidewalk outside her apartment. He called daily and left nagging voicemails. He befriended her mother, and made himself comfortable in her family's home. He wouldn't go away. While his attraction was not overtly sexual, it was undeniably inappropriate, and most importantly--unwanted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In&lt;i&gt; Consent: A Memoir of Unwanted Attention&lt;/i&gt;, Donna Freitas delivers a forensic examination of the years she spent stalked by her professor, and uses her nightmarish experience to examine the ways in which we stigmatize, debate, and attempt to understand consent today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sly and humorous portrait of modern relationships and an urban comedy of manners in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P&lt;/i&gt;, James Gregor’s &lt;i&gt;Going Dutch&lt;/i&gt; finds a struggling gay male graduate student in an unexpected—yet stirring—relationship with his brilliant female classmate. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exhausted by dead-end forays in the gay dating scene, surrounded constantly by friends but deeply lonely in New York City, and drifting into academic abyss, twenty-something graduate student Richard has plenty of sources of anxiety. But at the forefront is his crippling writer’s block, which threatens daily to derail his graduate funding and leave Richard poor, directionless, and desperately single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enter Anne: his brilliant classmate who offers to &lt;i&gt;“help”&lt;/i&gt; Richard write his papers in exchange for his company, despite Richard’s fairly obvious sexual orientation. Still, he needs her help, and it doesn’t hurt that Anne has folded Richard into her abundant lifestyle. What begins as an initially transactional relationship blooms gradually into something more complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But then a one-swipe-stand with an attractive, successful lawyer named Blake becomes serious, and Richard suddenly finds himself unable to detach from Anne, entangled in her web of privilege, brilliance, and, oddly, her unabashed acceptance of Richard’s flaws. As the two relationships reach points of serious commitment, Richard soon finds himself on a romantic and existential collision course—one that brings about surprising revelations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Going Dutch&lt;/i&gt; is an incisive portrait of relationships in an age of digital romantic abundance, but it’s also a heartfelt and humorous exploration of love and sexuality, and a poignant meditation on the things emotionally ravenous people seek from and do to each other. James Gregor announces himself with levity, and a fresh, exciting voice in his debut.</description>

  <description>A smart young Muslim Canadian woman navigates the complexities of career, love, and family in this lively homage to a Jane Austen classic. "While it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single Muslim man must be in want of a wife, there's an even greater truth: To his Indian mother, his own inclinations are of secondary importance." With that nod to Pride and Prejudice firmly in place, Jalaluddin lays the groundwork for a raucous story that mixes a zany cast of characters with a tightly wound plot.</description>

  <description>From the author of the hit literary horror debut Bird Box (”Hitchcockian.” —USA Today) comes a chilling novel about a group of musicians conscripted by the US government to track down the source of a strange and debilitating sound&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Danes—the band known as the “Darlings of Detroit”—are washed up and desperate for inspiration, eager to once again have a number one hit. That is, until an agent from the US Army approaches them. Will they travel to an African desert and track down the source of a mysterious and malevolent sound? Under the guidance of their front man, Philip Tonka, the Danes embark on a harrowing journey through the scorching desert—a trip that takes Tonka into the heart of an ominous and twisted conspiracy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in a nondescript Midwestern hospital, a nurse named Ellen tends to a patient recovering from a near-fatal accident. The circumstances that led to his injuries are mysterious-and his body heals at a remarkable rate. Ellen will do the impossible for this enigmatic patient, who reveals more about his accident with each passing day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part Heart of Darkness, part Lost, Josh Malerman’s breathtaking new novel plunges us into the depths of psychological horror, where you can’t always believe everything you hear.</description>

  <description>"So while the assumption when I was born was that I was or would grow up to be a neurotypical heterosexual boy, that whole idea didn't really pan out long term."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this candid, first-of-its-kind memoir, Laura Kate Dale recounts what life is like growing up as a gay trans woman on the autism spectrum. From struggling with sensory processing, managing socially demanding situations and learning social cues and feminine presentation, through to coming out as trans during an autistic meltdown, Laura draws on her personal experiences from life prior to transition and diagnosis, and moving on to the years of self-discovery, to give a unique insight into the nuances of sexuality, gender and autism, and how they intersect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charting the ups and downs of being autistic and on the LGBT spectrum with searing honesty and humour, this is an empowering, life-affirming read for anyone who's felt they don't fit in.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A prize-winning bestseller in its native France, a vivid and evocative coming-of-age tale, set against the backdrop of the Rwandan genocide and the civil war in Burundi, of a young boy's childhood innocence shattered by the brutal tides of history.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1992, Gabriel, ten years old, lives in Burundi in a comfortable expatriate neighborhood with his French father, his Rwandan mother and his little sister, Ana. In this joyful idyll, Gabriel spends the better part of his time with his mischievous band of friends, in a tiny cul-de-sac they have turned into their kingdom. But their peaceful existence will suddenly shatter when this small African country is brutally battered by history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this magnificent coming-of-age story, Gael Faye describes an end of innocence and drives deep into the heart and mind of a young child caught in the maelstrom of history.</description>

  <description>“Bitter Brew deftly chronicles the contentious succession of kings in a uniquely American dynasty. You’ll never crack open a six again without thinking of this book.”&lt;br /&gt;—John Sayles, Director of &lt;em&gt;Eight Men Out&lt;/em&gt; and author of &lt;em&gt;A Moment in the Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creators of Budweiser and Michelob beers, the Anheuser-Busch company is one of the wealthiest, most colorful and enduring family dynasties in the history of American commerce. In &lt;em&gt;Bitter Brew&lt;/em&gt;, critically acclaimed journalist William Knoedelseder tells the riveting, often scandalous saga of the rise and fall of the dysfunctional Busch family—an epic tale of prosperity, profligacy, hubris, and the dark consequences of success that spans three centuries, from the open salvos of the Civil War to the present day.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s powerful prison memoir begins half an hour before his release on 12 December 1978. A year earlier, he recalls, armed police arrived at his home and took him to Kenya’s Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. There, Ngugi lives in a block alongside other political prisoners, but he refuses to give in to the humiliation. He decides to write a novel in secret, on toilet paper – it is a book that will become his classic, &lt;i&gt;Devil on the Cross&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wrestling with the Devil&lt;/i&gt; is Ngugi’s unforgettable account of the drama and challenges of living under twenty-four-hour surveillance. He captures not only the pain caused by his isolation from his family, but also the spirit of defiance and the imaginative endeavours that allowed him to survive.</description>

  <description>The Reluctant Royals series returns with a good girl searching for the life that’s not too big, and not too small, and the bad boy prince who might be just right for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya Jerami fled Thesolo for the glitz and glamour of NYC but discovered that her Prince Charming only exists in her virtual dating games. When Nya returns home for a royal wedding, she accidentally finds herself up close and personal—in bed—with the real-life celebrity prince who she loves to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Johan von Braustein, the red-headed step-prince of Liechtienbourg, acting as paparazzi bait is a ruse that protects his brother—the heir to the throne—and his own heart. When a royal referendum threatens his brother’s future, a fake engagement is the perfect way to keep the cameras on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya and Johan both have good reasons to avoid love, but as desires are laid bare behind palace doors, they must decide if their fake romance will lead to a happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>As a child, David McKinstry always knew one thing: he wanted to be a father. However, as a single—and secretly gay—man, David's only option was to adopt. Lying about his sexuality on adoption applications, David was consistently met with a resounding "no."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenging the Canadian government to champion his cause, in 199X officials finally agreed to use David as a test case to see if a gay man could adopt internationally. All thirteen applications were met with the same response: "we don't give kids to fags." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undeterred, and facing unfathomable levels of stigma, bigotry, and red tape from global adoption agencies, social workers, and politicians, David continued to advocate for change. Fighting for his dream, and with a little lie from the Canadian government, David became a true "rebel with a cause" by becoming the first gay Canadian man approved to adopt internationally and then, with his husband, the first to co-adopt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebel Dad: Triumphing Over Bureaucracy to Adopt Two Orphans Born Worlds Apart recounts David's emotional and inspiring journey as he navigates both coming to terms with his own sexuality and fighting to create a family he could call his own.</description>

  <description>Ouabache is the old French spelling of Wabash, the Algonquin word waapaahšiiki, the name the Miami Indians gave to the river that runs for 491 miles through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. This is a novel about life in the Wabash Valley during the French Colonial period. It has been over three centuries since the first of these French-speaking adventurers paddled their canoes down the Wabash River and the details of their everyday lives are still largely a mystery. The novel is based on a mix of facts and folklore, designed to entertain readers and inspire them to learn more about the Wabash Valley. Told from the perspective of a boy and his mother surrounded by actual characters and events in history including the establishment of the first permanent European settlement in present day Indiana now known as Vincennes.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the first novel in Christy Carlyle’s sizzling Duke’s Den series, three men, intent on making a fortune, discover irresistible opportunities . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas Lyon gambled his way into a fortune and ownership of the most opulent, notorious gentlemen’s club in England. But when Nick’s cruel brother dies, he inherits a title he never wanted. The sooner Nick is rid of the estate that has always haunted him, the sooner he can return to the life he’s built in London. But there’s one obstacle—the exquisite Thomasina Thorne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the new heir to the Tremayne dukedom suddenly appears in Mina Thorne’s life, she’s flustered. Not only is he breathtakingly handsome, but he’s also determined to take away her home and position as steward of the Enderley estate. If Mina learns what makes the enigmatic duke tick, perhaps she can change his mind—as long as she doesn’t get &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; close to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each day Nick spends with Mina, his resolve weakens as their colliding wills lead to explosive desire. Could she be the one woman who can help him finally bury the ghosts of his past?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time there were three young ladies who, despite their fortunes, had been on the marriage mart a bit too long. They were known as "the Spinster Heiresses"...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it wrong for a woman to want more?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not if she is a Spinster Heiress. They do not settle. Any young miss would be very lucky to find herself promised to a man like the Duke of Camberly. However, Miss Willa Reverly has watched her friends marry for love. Camberly may be the prize of the season, but she will not be "sold" to any man. She wants his devotion or she wants nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When is a Marriage of Convenience inconvenient?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newly named to the ducal title, Matthew Addison is determined to discover the secrets behind Mayfield, the bankrupt estate he has inherited. He doesn't have time to coddle a headstrong heiress who is determined to ditch him over something as silly as "love." Little does he know that his questions will place her in jeopardy. Now he must do what he must to save them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could it be that in running from danger they might be racing headlong into a truly unexpected fate: falling in love?&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She was in the wrong place...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiercely independent and adventurous, Poppy Bridgerton will only wed a suitor whose keen intellect and interests match her own. Sadly, none of the fools from her London season qualify. While visiting a friend on the Dorset coast, Poppy is pleasantly surprised to discover a smugglers' hideaway tucked inside a cave. But her delight turns to dismay when two pirates kidnap her and take her aboard a ship, leaving her bound and gagged on the captain's bed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He found her at the wrong time...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Known to society as a rascal and reckless privateer, Captain Andrew James Rokesby actually transports essential goods and documents for the British government. Setting sail on a time-sensitive voyage to Portugal, he's stunned to find a woman waiting for him in his cabin. Surely, his imagination is getting the better of him. But no, she is very real—and his duty to the Crown means he's stuck with her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can two wrongs make the most perfect right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Andrew learns that she is a Bridgerton, he knows he will likely have to wed her to avert a scandal—though Poppy has no idea that he is the son of an earl and neighbor to her aristocratic cousins in Kent. On the high seas, their war of words soon gives way to an intoxicating passion. But when Andrew's secret is revealed, will his declaration of love be enough to capture her heart…?</description>

  <description>After five years away, Lady Eliza Cartwick isn't relishing returning to the whirl of the London season. But the young widow knows to ensure the best future for herself and her young daughter, Rosa, she must remarry. If only Lord Evanston, the dashing rogue who has haunted her dreams since she was sixteen, didn't insist on distracting her with his searing looks and lingering touches at the most inconvenient times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas, Lord Evanston, has wanted Eliza since her engagement ball all those years ago. His best friend's sister has constantly been out of reach...until now. The forbidden has always tempted him, but when Thomas realizes he wants the object of his fantasies for far more than a dalliance, he must convince her that he's not just a rake; he's a viscount who's worth the wait.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In the first novel of Maya Rodale's enthralling new series, an English duke vows to make an American seamstress his duchess...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Gilded Age Manhattan, anything can happen...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeking a wealthy American bride who can save his family's estate, Brandon Fiennes, the duke of Kingston, is a rogue determined to do the right thing. But his search for an heiress goes deliciously awry when an enchanting seamstress tumbles into his arms instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and true love is always in fashion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Adeline Black aspires to be a fashionable dressmaker—&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a duchess—and not even an impossibly seductive duke will distract her. But Kingston makes an offer she can't refuse: join him at society events to display her gowns and advise him on which heiresses are duchess material. It's the perfect plan—as long as they resist temptation, avoid a scandal, and above all do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; lose their hearts.</description>

  <description>On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; reporter and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt;, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, &lt;i&gt;The Library Book&lt;/i&gt; is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.</description>

  <description>Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology, arrives at the ultramodern Guggenheim Museum Bilbao to attend the unveiling of a discovery that "will change the face of science forever." The evening's host is Edmond Kirsch, a forty-year-old billionaire and futurist, and one of Langdon's first students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch's precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced to flee. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch. They travel to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch's secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme re-ligion, Langdon and Vidal must evade an enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain's Royal Palace. They uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch's shocking discovery...and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An American heiress and an English earl fight against the conventions of society—and their attraction to each other—in the second book in the &lt;em&gt;Dary to Defy&lt;/em&gt; series by &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Syrie James.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madeleine Atherton is no typical American heiress, sent to England to marry an English lord. A brilliant college graduate who secretly dreams of becoming a published author, she wants to marry for love. After receiving a proposal from a future duke, Madeleine flees the London Season for Cornwall to seek her sister’s advice, never expecting her decision to be complicated by a charming, handsome earl she’s certain she dislikes—even though his every touch sets her blood on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Grayson, the Earl of Saunders, has secrets and ambitions of his own. Although under pressure from his mother and gravely ill father to marry his cousin, Charles cannot find the words to propose. But this fascinating American visitor does not figure into his plans, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together unexpectedly at Trevelyan Manor, Madeleine and Charles struggle to rise above their intense attraction. But as things heat up between them over a summer that becomes increasingly scandalous, Madeleine and Charles will both be forced to make a difficult choice. Can two dreamers dare to defy convention and find their own happily ever after?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Joanna Shupe returns to New York City’s Gilded Age, where fortunes and reputations are gained and lost with ease—and love can blossom from the most unlikely charade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the fate of her disgraced family resting on her shoulders, Lady Christina Barclay has arrived in New York City from London to quickly secure a wealthy husband. But when her parents settle on an intolerable suitor, Christina turns to her reclusive neighbor, a darkly handsome and utterly compelling inventor, for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oliver Hawkes reluctantly agrees to a platonic marriage . . . with his own condition: The marriage must end after one year. Not only does Oliver face challenges that are certain to make life as his wife difficult, but more importantly, he refuses to be distracted from his life’s work—the development of a revolutionary device that could transform thousands of lives, including his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to his surprise, his bride is more beguiling than he imagined. When temptation burns hot between them, they realize they must overcome their own secrets and doubts, and every effort to undermine their marriage, because one year can never be enough.</description>

  <description>The epic new novel from the internationally acclaimed and best-selling author of 1Q84&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Killing Commendatore&lt;/i&gt;, a thirty-something portrait painter in Tokyo is abandoned by his wife and finds himself holed up in the mountain home of a famous artist, Tomohiko Amada. When he discovers a previously unseen painting in the attic, he unintentionally opens a circle of mysterious circumstances. To close it, he must complete a journey that involves a mysterious ringing bell, a two-foot-high physical manifestation of an Idea, a dapper businessman who lives across the valley, a precocious thirteen-year-old girl, a Nazi assassination attempt during World War II in Vienna, a pit in the woods behind the artist’s home, and an underworld haunted by Double Metaphors. A tour de force of love and loneliness, war and art—as well as a loving homage to &lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Killing Commendatore&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning work of imagination from one of our greatest writers.</description>

  <description>If adventure has a name...it must be Lady India Rochester. The intrepid archaeologist possesses a sharp blade and an even sharper knack for uncovering history's forgotten women. Unfortunately, she has one annoying weakness: the dangerously handsome Duke of Ravenwood. Former best friend. Current enemy. And the man who dared to break her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Bonds, the Duke of Ravenwood, is a thrill-seeking antiquities hunter who only plays by one rule: Never fall in love. He's in it for the fortune and glory. At least that's what he wants the world to think. He's sworn to hide his tangled web of secrets, especially from the one woman he cares about and will protect at any cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a priceless relic is stolen from the British Museum, the rivals must align forces. Racing to recover the stolen antiquity and avert an international disaster? All in a day's work. Avoiding their buried feelings? More and more impossible. For love is about to become the greatest treasure of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The grand adventure begins...now!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;United in a common cause…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette Matthews longs to be much more than just another pretty ornament in society. But using her recently acquired fortune to do some good is more complicated than she anticipated. Young ladies are not expected to risk their safety in helping the less fortunate. And the one gentleman who could help in her mission is stubborn, infernally handsome—and far too honorable to act on their mutual attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And in a desire impossible to deny…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Florian Lowell has suddenly been made heir to the Duke of Redding—a far cry from his status as a dedicated physician. Yet even with his new role as the country's most eligible bachelor, the beautiful, fearless Juliette is utterly beyond his reach. The scandalous circumstances of his birth would destroy both their reputations if they became known. But when a more urgent danger threatens Juliette's life, Florian must gamble everything…including the heart only one woman can tame.</description>

  <description>The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, "None of what’s going to happen is your fault". Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: "Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When you gamble at love...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Hugh Deveraux discovers his newly inherited earldom is bankrupt, he sets about rebuilding the family fortune—in the gaming hells of London. But the most daring wager he takes isn't at cards. A wealthy tradesman makes a tantalizing offer: marry the man's spinster daughter, and Hugh's debts will be paid and his fortune made. The only catch is that she must never know about their agreement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You risk losing your heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heiress Eliza Cross has given up hope of marriage until she meets the impossibly handsome Earl of Hastings, her father's new business partner. The earl is everything a gentleman should be, and is boldly attentive to her. It doesn't take long for Eliza to lose her heart and marry him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Eliza discovers that there is more to the man she loves—and to her marriage—her trust is shattered. And it will take all of Hugh's power to prove that now his words of love are real.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;World Poetry&lt;/i&gt; is an incomparable collection in which the ancient and the contemporary are seamlessly interwoven; it is a cornucopia of surprises. When you turn to the Dante section, instead of finding excerpts from well-known versions of the &lt;i&gt;Commedia&lt;/i&gt;, there are selections by poets such as Shelley, Howard Nemerov, Susan Mitchell, and James Schuyler. &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;World Poetry&lt;/i&gt; can be read in the light of Ezra Pound's dicta: points define a periphery. The editors scoured the archives for versions that would stand as poems on their own. When nothing met their standards, as in the case of Victor Hugo, Maurice Scève, or Gottfried Benn, they commissioned new translations. Louis Simpson gives new life to Hugo's famous poem about Napoleon's armies, "Expiation": &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; It was snowing, always snowing! The cold lash&lt;br /&gt; Whistled. These warriors had no bread to eat,&lt;br /&gt; They walked across the ice with naked feet.&lt;br /&gt; No longer living hearts, they seemed to be&lt;br /&gt; A dream lost in a fog, a mystery,&lt;br /&gt; A march of shadows under a black sky.&lt;br /&gt; Vast solitudes, appalling to the eye,&lt;br /&gt; Stretched out, mute and revengeful, everywhere.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Perhaps the greatest reward that lies in wait is discovering stunning poems by great and good poets who are almost entirely unknown in the English-speaking world, such as Marceline Desbordes-Valmore (1786-1859), Giuseppe Gioacchino Belli (1791-1863), and the amazing Andreas Gryphius (1616-1664), who proves that Petrarch and the Elizabethans aren't the only great sonneteers. &lt;blockquote&gt; What are we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;? Pain's return address.&lt;br /&gt; A ball for luck, blindfolded, to kick around.&lt;br /&gt; A flick of the switch. A stage darkened by fear.&lt;br /&gt; A candle doused, snow melting on bare ground.&lt;br /&gt; Life slips away like gossip or last night's joke.&lt;br /&gt; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;br /&gt; Whatever breathes will vanish into air.&lt;br /&gt; Our graves are large and lonely. What's left to say?&lt;br /&gt; We're smoke that the wind has caught, and blown away.&lt;br /&gt; 	(from "Misery," trans. Christopher Benfey) &lt;/blockquote&gt; This book is different from other anthologies in its determination to enable us to experience all poetry as contemporaneous. You will encounter, in all likelihood for the first time, any number of anonymous masterpieces, such as "The Vigil of Venus" translated by David R. Slavitt (anonymous, circa A.D. 200) and "The Old Woman of Beare," translated by Brendan Kenneally (anonymous, circa A.D. 800). Both poems are rendered in elegant yet idiomatic English. "The Old Woman of Beare" is breathtaking: "The sea crawls from the shore / Leaving there / The despicable weed, / A corpse's hair. / In me, / The desolate withdrawing sea." &lt;p&gt; In the case of your favorite poets, you're bound to quarrel with the selection. It is thrilling to find the "At five in the afternoon" section of Lorca's great elegy to the bullfighter Ignacio Sénchez Mejías, but it seems inappropriate to publish half of Eugenio Montale's "Motets," instead of choosing several of his self-enclosed, dynamic, shorter poems. But arguing with the anthologists is part of the fun, and you're free to return with a vengeance to the poems that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think should have been included. &lt;i&gt;World Poetry&lt;/i&gt; is an ideal book to have if you're going to be away from your own library for any amount of time. It is easy to get lost in its opulence, roaming the points of its compass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Five well-bred sisters, one sensational scandal. Now the Duke of Marymount's daughter Ida is about to find love in the most unconventional way...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy for society to overlook Lady Ida Howlett; they found her bookish, opinionated, and off the marriage mart. But little did they know that behind a calm exterior beats the heart of an adventuress, one who, determined to discover her runaway sister's whereabouts, steals a carriage and sets off on a daring mission. Then she discovers she's not alone! Bennett, Lord Carson, is inside, and he refuses to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord Carson's plans had always been to find a soft, gentle wife who would run his home and raise his children. Still, he makes a bargain with Ida—he won't desert her during her mad adventure. He'll make sure she's safe, and then find a suitable lady to fall in love with. But when rules (and garments) become discarded during this long, intimate journey, it's soon clear that this surprisingly daring lady is the woman he's needed all along.</description>

  <description>Set in an America where half the population has been silenced, &lt;i&gt;VOX&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing, unforgettable story of what one woman will do to protect herself and her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the day the government decrees that women are no longer allowed to speak more than 100 words daily, Dr. Jean McClellan is in denial—this can't happen here. Not in America. Not to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is just the beginning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon women can no longer hold jobs. Girls are no longer taught to read or write. Females no longer have a voice. Before, the average person spoke sixteen thousand words a day, but now women only have one hundred to make themselves heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But this is not the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For herself, her daughter, and every woman silenced, Jean will reclaim her voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heart-wrenching novel about a sixteen-year-old girl trapped in an abusive relationship—and the path she takes to freedom and happiness, from award-winning author Heather Demetrios.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“&lt;b&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt;, it is one of those rare books that can have a real, lasting impact on readers, and can start important conversations.&lt;/b&gt;” —Adi Alsaid, author of &lt;i&gt;Let’s Get Lost &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Never Always Sometimes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grace wants out. Out of her house, where her stepfather wields fear like a weapon and her mother makes her scrub imaginary dirt off the floors. Out of her California town, too small to contain her big city dreams. Out of her life, and into the role of Parisian artist, New York director—anything but scared and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Gavin: charming, talented, adored. Controlling. Dangerous. When Grace and Gavin fall in love, Grace is sure it's too good to be true. She has no idea their relationship will become a prison she's unable to escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deeply affecting and unflinchingly honest portrayal of a destructive relationship, &lt;i&gt;Bad Romance &lt;/i&gt;is a young adult novel about spiraling into darkness—and emerging into the light again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also by Heather Demetrios:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'll Meet You There&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something Real&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Bad Romance&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Like &lt;i&gt;Speak&lt;/i&gt;, it is one of those rare books that can have a real, lasting impact on readers, and can start important conversations.” —Adi Alsaid, author of &lt;i&gt;Let’s Get Lost &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Never Always Sometimes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A raw, honest, unrelenting novel. Demetrios writes with heartbreaking clarity about the way first love can turn from safe to dangerous, from beautiful to ugly. Brave, bold, and deeply felt.” —Corey Ann Haydu, author of &lt;i&gt;OCD Love Story &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Careful Undressing of Love&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“[A]n intense reflection on abusive relationships.” —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A realistic, worthwhile look at dating violence.” —&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Through Grace’s lively, engaging voice, readers gain a vivid picture of the way a smart, self-assured girl can fall into an abusive relationship . . . . Demetrios’ well-drawn characters are tremendously appealing, and Grace’s discovery of the power of her own strength will make readers cheer." —Booklist</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I live for the dream that my children will be born free," she says. "That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I live for you," I say sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eo kisses my cheek. "Then you must live for more."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s been a bad, bad rake—and it takes a governess to teach him a lesson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The accidental governess.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her livelihood slips through her fingers, Alexandra Mountbatten takes on an impossible post: transforming a pair of wild orphans into proper young ladies. However, the girls don’t need discipline. They need a loving home. Try telling that to their guardian, Chase Reynaud: duke’s heir in the streets and devil in the sheets. The ladies of London have tried—and failed—to make him settle down. Somehow, Alexandra must reach his heart... without risking her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The infamous rake.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-respecting libertine, Chase lives by one rule: no attachments. When a stubborn little governess tries to reform him, he decides to give her an education—in pleasure. That should prove he can’t be tamed. But Alexandra is more than he bargained for: clever, perceptive, passionate. She refuses to see him as a lost cause. Soon the walls around Chase’s heart are crumbling... and he’s in danger of falling, hard.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 13: 9780060853969&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a distinct hint of Armageddon in the air. According to &lt;em&gt;The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch&lt;/em&gt; (recorded, thankfully, in 1655, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; she blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world's last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon -- each of whom has lived among Earth's mortals for many millennia and has grown rather fond of the lifestyle -- are not particularly looking forward to the coming Rapture. If Crowley and Aziraphale are going to stop it from happening, they've got to find and kill the Antichrist (which is a shame, as he's a really nice kid). There's just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced him. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First published in 1990, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's brilliantly dark and screamingly funny take on humankind's final judgment is back -- and just in time -- in a new hardcover edition (which includes an introduction by the authors, comments by each about the other, and answers to some still-burning questions about their wildly popular collaborative effort) that the devout and the damned alike will surely cherish until the end of all things.</description>

I was hoping with the addition of Neil Gaiman's lore, which I do like, Good Omens would be a good way for me to get in to TP. But, he's still a little too far out there.

  <description>RUDIN (1856) by Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev (1818-1883) tells the story of a character typical to Turgenev -- a "superfluous" man, weak of will, brimming with indecisive frustration -- and yet tormented by ideals. Rudin is made impotent by the dissonance of honoring the older generations while at the same time embracing the new bold epoch of pre-revolutionary Russia. The theme of melancholic powerless men coupled with vital idealistic women is prevalent in Turgenev's work, and it would be hard to find a clearer study of the type than RUDIN.</description>

  <description>Arthur is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it’s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn’t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend’s things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if they can’t quite nail a first date . . . or a second first date . . . or a third?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work . . . and Ben doesn’t try hard enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if life really isn’t like a Broadway play?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if it is?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Everyone knows a rancher in possession of a large spread needs a wife."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lacy Williams is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the acclaimed Wyoming Legacy and Cowboy Fairytales series.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About Cowboy Pride: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;First impressions count.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liza Bennett has two missions in life: keep the family’s shop afloat, and ensure her shy sister finds love. Sparks fly when she meets rancher Rob Darcy at a town dance, but when she overhears him insult her, she vows to put the man out of her mind. Rob Darcy is instantly attracted to the vivacious Liza but a lack of social graces and the promise he’s keeping ruin his chances of winning her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once jilted, Janie Bennett is appropriately gun-shy of falling in love again. But she doesn't seem to be able to help herself when she meets charming Nathan Bingley. Bingley desperately wants a wife and family of his own. Can he trust that Janie returns his feelings? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Janie is injured in a spring storm, she and Liza are sequestered on Nathan’s ranch. Hearts and emotions get tangled, but will first impressions prove true, or false? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Cowboy Pride is a Wild West version of Pride and Prejudice with dual love stories.&lt;/b&gt;

      <![CDATA[A clever remake of Pride and Prejudice, July's #BigLibraryRead. Not quite word for word, but pretty dang close. This is an easy Saturday afternoon read. It's a romance, but not smutty, so it's great for those who like the love without the sex. There's much more drama than in Austen's novels--I su...]]>

  <description>Life constantly seems to be wavering between really good and really bad for Owen, a lonely sixteen-year-old still reeling from the unexpected death of his mother and a fresh move to Toronto. After ducking into an old bookstore to escape high school bullies, Owen discovers that he can travel to a parallel, twisted version of the city with a magical tablet called a Battledoor, where he encounters new allies, bizarre creatures, and the ultimate antagonist who will stop at nothing to procure the magical Golden Slate for himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to work together with friends and enemies in order to return home, Owen is faced with a series of choices that will prompt him to find courage he never knew he had, explore the possibility of romance, and try to find a way to let go of his painful past and move on. But is Owen ready to finally take control, and become the protagonist of his own story?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed PEN-Faulkner Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Great Man&lt;/i&gt; comes a riveting high-seas adventure that combines Christensen’s signature wit, irony, and humanity to create a striking and unforgettable vision of our times.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1950s vintage ocean liner Queen Isabella is making her final voyage before heading to the scrapyard. For the guests on board, among them Christine Thorne, a former journalist turned Maine farmer, it’s a chance to experience the bygone mid-20th century era of decadent luxury cruising, complete with fine dining, classic highballs, string quartets, and sophisticated jazz. Smoking is allowed but not cell phones–or children, for that matter. The Isabella sets sail from Long Beach, CA into calm seas on a two-week retro cruise to Hawaii and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the second decade of an uncertain new millennium, not the sunny, heedless fifties, and certain disquieting signs of strife and malfunction above and below decks intrude on the festivities. Down in the main galley, Mick Szabo, a battle-weary Hungarian executive sous-chef, watches escalating tensions among the crew. Meanwhile, Miriam Koslow, an elderly Israeli violinist with the Sabra Quartet, becomes increasingly aware of the age-related vulnerabilities of the ship herself and the cynical corners cut by the cruise ship company, Cabaret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a time of crisis begins, Christine, Mick, and Miriam find themselves facing the unknown together in an unexpected and startling test of their characters.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Three generations. Seven days. One big secret. The author of &lt;em&gt;The Coincidence of Coconut Cake&lt;/em&gt; unfolds a mother-daughter story told by three women whose time to reckon with a life-altering secret is running out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gina Zoberski wants to make it through one day without her fastidious mother, Lorraine, cataloguing all her faults, and her sullen teenage daughter, May, snubbing her. Too bad there’s no chance of that. Her relentlessly sunny disposition annoys them both, no matter how hard she tries. Instead, Gina finds order and comfort in obsessive list-making and her work at Grilled G’s, the gourmet grilled cheese food truck built by her late husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Lorraine suffers a sudden stroke, Gina stumbles upon a family secret Lorraine's kept hidden for forty years. In the face of her mother’s failing health and her daughter’s rebellion, this optimist might find that piecing together the truth is the push she needs to let go...</description>

      <![CDATA[Sweet and tissue worthy. One of those books with one hit after another. It's the story of a mother of a boy on the autistic spectrum, one who wasn't diagnosed until he was 9.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;USA Today Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the next sizzling romance in Kristen Proby's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Fusion series, two celebrity chefs compete in a culinary competition, but resisting each other will prove to be the greater challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooking isn't what Mia Palazzo does, it's who she is. Food is her passion . . . her pride . . . her true love. She's built a stellar menu full of delicious and sexy meals for her restaurant, Seduction. Now, after being open for only a few short years, Mia’s restaurant is being featured on Best Bites TV. To say Seduction is a wild success is an understatement. All the blood, sweat, tears, and endless hours of work Mia has put into the restaurant has finally paid off. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Camden Sawyer, the biggest mistake of her life, walks into her kitchen . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camden's celebrity chef status is world-renowned. He's the best there is, and the kitchen is where he's most at home. He can't resist the invitation to Portland for a showdown against Mia for a new television show. Mia was in his life years ago, and just like before, he's met his match in the beautiful Italian spitfire. The way she commands the kitchen is mesmerizing, and her recipes are clever and delicious. He's never had qualms about competition, and this is no different. He can't wait to go head to head with Mia. But can he convince her the chemistry they share in the kitchen would be just as great in the bedroom as well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mia and Camden face off, neither realizes how high the stakes are as their reputations are put on the line and their hearts are put to the ultimate test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>“Sometimes having company is not all it’s cracked up to be.” Fourteen-year-old Finn is a loner, living with his dad and his amazing dog, Dylan. This summer he’s hoping for a job where he doesn’t have to talk to anyone except his pal Matthew. Then Johanna moves in next door. She’s 10 years older, cool, funny, and she treats Finn as an equal. Dylan loves her, too. Johanna’s dealing with breast cancer, and Matthew and Finn learn to care for her, emotionally and physically. When she hires Finn to create a garden, his gardening ideas backfire comically. But Johanna and the garden help Finn discover his talents for connecting with people.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Assistants&lt;/i&gt; comes another gutsy book about the importance of women taking the reins—except this time, when it comes to finding sexuality, pleasure, and love sometimes where you least expect it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie Daniels is a perfection-seeking 28-year-old lawyer living the New York dream. She’s engaged to charming art curator Paul Michael, has successfully made her way up the ladder at a multinational law firm and has a hold on apartments in Soho and the West Village. Suffice it to say, she has come a long way from her Kentucky upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the rug is swept from under Katie when she is suddenly dumped by her fiance, Paul Michael, leaving her devastated and completely lost. On a whim, she agrees to have a drink with Cassidy Price-a self-assured, sexually promiscuous woman she meets at work. The two form a newfound friendship, which soon brings into question everything Katie thought she knew about sex—and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When Katie Met Cassidy&lt;/i&gt; is a romantic comedy that explores how, as a culture, while we may have come a long way in terms of gender equality, a woman’s capacity for an entitlement to sexual pleasure still remain entirely taboo. This novel tackles the question: Why, when it comes to female sexuality, are so few women figuring out what they want and then going out and doing it?</description>

  <description>For fans of television shows &lt;i&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Westworld, &lt;/i&gt; this compelling, mind-bending novel is a twisted look into the future, exploring how far we will go to remake ourselves into the perfect human specimen and what it means to be human at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in our world, spanning the near to distant futures, &lt;i&gt;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is a novel made up of six interconnected stories that ask how far we will go to remake ourselves into the perfect human specimens, and how hard that will push the definition of "human."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extraordinary work explores the amazing possibilities of genetic manipulation and life extension, as well as the ethical quandaries that will arise with these advances. The results range from the heavenly to the monstrous. Deeply thoughtful, poignant, horrifying, and action-packed, Arwen Elys Dayton's &lt;i&gt;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is groundbreaking in both form and substance.</description>

  <description>Pulsating with the rhythms of fifties underground America, jazz, sex, illicit drugs, and the mystery and promise of the open road, Jack Kerouac's classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be "Beat," and has inspired every generation since its initial publication in 1957. Based on Kerouac's adventures with Neal Cassady, &lt;i&gt; On the Road&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of two friends, whose four cross-country road trips are a quest for meaning and true experience. Written with a mixture of sad-eyed naivete and wild abandon, and imbued with Kerouac's love of America, his compassion for humanity, and his sense of language as jazz, &lt;i&gt;One the Road&lt;/i&gt; is the quintessential American vision of freedom and hope-vibrant, compelling, and full of wonder.</description>

  <description>Return to New York Times Bestselling Author Lori Wilde's beloved town of Cupid, Texas, where wedding fever is in the air . . . and two best friends discover that sometimes the perfect match is standing right in front of you . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ember Alzate is a fantastic matchmaker with one big problem: she can't find the perfect mate for herself! Alzate family legend says that when she kisses "the One" she'll hear a mysterious humming in her head. Well, Ember's kissed a lot of guys and she's never heard a thing. Now, instead of searching for herself, she vows to find her best friend, Ranger Lockhart, a bride. It's clear this smart, sexy man just needs to meet the right gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranger's returned home to Cupid with marriage on his mind, but he's not interested in the parade of women Ember pushes under his nose. His thoughts keep returning to his best friend--with her combustible combination of curves and sass. No one compares to Ember, but what's it going to take to convince her she's the woman for him?</description>

  <description>Theirs is a world of opposites. The privileged live in sky manors held aloft by a secretive magic known only as the Mysteries. Below, the earthbound poor are forced into factory work to maintain the engine of commerce. Only the wealthy can afford to learn the Mysteries, and they use their knowledge to further lock their hold on society.&lt;p&gt;Cettie Pratt is a waif doomed to the world below, until an admiral attempts to adopt her. But in her new home in the clouds, not everyone treats her as one of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sera Fitzempress is a princess born into power. She yearns to meet the orphan girl she has heard so much about, but her father deems the girl unworthy of his daughter’s curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither girl feels that she belongs. Each seeks to break free of imposed rules. Now, as Cettie dreams of living above and as Sera is drawn to the world below, they will follow the paths of their own choosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both girls will be needed for the coming storm that threatens to overturn both their worlds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt; Countless others have rendered their verdict. Now it is your turn.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Russia, July 17, 1918&lt;/b&gt; Under direct orders from Vladimir Lenin, Bolshevik secret police force Anastasia Romanov, along with the entire imperial family, into a damp basement in Siberia where they face a merciless firing squad. None survive. At least that is what the executioners have always claimed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Germany, February 17, 1920&lt;/b&gt; A young woman bearing an uncanny resemblance to Anastasia Romanov is pulled shivering and senseless from a canal in Berlin. Refusing to explain her presence in the freezing water, she is taken to the hospital where an examination reveals that her body is riddled with countless, horrific scars. When she finally does speak, this frightened, mysterious woman claims to be the Russian Grand Duchess Anastasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her detractors, convinced that the young woman is only after the immense Romanov fortune, insist on calling her by a different name: Anna Anderson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As rumors begin to circulate through European society that the youngest Romanov daughter has survived the massacre, old enemies and new threats are awakened.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'll always love the story of Anastasia--from princess movie to the mysterious history. I am Anastasia is every bit as captivating, and I love the unique way the author writes the two timelines so that they meet in the middle. I'm not sure I've ever read a book that marches backwards like that. ]]>

  <description>It's finally here--the comprehensive, authoritative book that does for beer what "The Wine Bible" does for wine. Written by an expert from the West Coast, where America's craft beer movement got its start, "The Beer Bible" is the ultimate reader- and drinker-friendly guide to all the world's beers. No other book of this depth and scope approaches the subject of beer?in the same way that beer lovers do--by style, just as a perfect pub menu is organized--and gets right to the pleasure of discovery, knowledge, and connoisseurship. Divided into four major families--ales, lagers, wheat beers, and tart and wild ales--there's everything a beer drinker wants to know about the hundreds of different authentic types of brews, from bitters, bocks, and IPAs to weisses, milk stouts, lambics, and more. Each style is a chapter unto itself, delving into origins, ingredients, description and characteristics, substyles, and tasting notes, and ending with a recommended list of the beers to know in each category. Hip infographics throughout make the explanation of beer's flavors, brewing methods, ingredients, labeling, serving, and more as immediate as it is lively. The book is written for passionate beginners, who will love its "if you like X, try Y" feature; for intermediate beer lovers eager to go deeper; and for true geeks, who will find new information on every page. History, romance, the art of tasting, backstories and anecdotes, appropriate glassware, bitterness units, mouthfeel, and more--it's all here. Plus a primer on pairing beer and food using the three Cs-- complement, contrast, or cut. It's the book that every beer lover will read with pleasure, and use with even more.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Nothing is Okay&lt;/em&gt; is the second full-length poetry collection by Rachel Wiley, whose work simultaneously deconstructs the lies that we were taught about our bodies and our beings, and builds new ways of viewing ourselves. As she delves into queerness, feminism, fatness, dating, and race, Wiley molds these topics into a punching critique of culture and a celebration of self. A fat positive activist, Wiley's work soars and challenges the bounds of bodies and hearts, and the ways we carry them.</description>

  <description>A smart, dark, and take-no-prisoners look at rape culture and the extremes to which ideology can go, &lt;i&gt;The Red Word&lt;/i&gt; is a campus novel like no other. As her sophomore year begins, Karen enters into the back-to-school revelry--particularly at a fraternity called GBC. When she wakes up one morning on the lawn of Raghurst, a house of radical feminists, she gets a crash course in the state of feminist activism on campus. GBC is notorious, she learns, nicknamed "Gang Bang Central" and a prominent contributor to a list of date rapists compiled by female students. Despite continuing to party there and dating one of the brothers, Karen is equally seduced by the intellectual stimulation and indomitable spirit of the Raghurst women, who surprise her by wanting her as a housemate and recruiting her into the upper-level class of a charismatic feminist mythology scholar they all adore. As Karen finds herself caught between two increasingly polarized camps, ringleader housemate Dyann believes she has hit on the perfect way to expose and bring down the fraternity as a symbol of rape culture--but the war between the houses will exact a terrible price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Red Word&lt;/i&gt; captures beautifully the feverish binarism of campus politics and the headlong rush of youth toward new friends, lovers, and life-altering ideas. With strains of Jeffrey Eugenides's &lt;i&gt;The Marriage Plot&lt;/i&gt;, Alison Lurie's &lt;i&gt;Truth and Consequences&lt;/i&gt;, and Tom Wolfe's &lt;i&gt;I Am Charlotte Simmons&lt;/i&gt;, Sarah Henstra's debut adult novel arrives on the wings of furies.</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity, and is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods: witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When love drives Circe to cast a dark spell, wrathful Zeus banishes her to the remote island of Aiaia. There she learns to harness her occult craft, drawing strength from nature. But she will not always be alone; many are destined to pass through Circe's place of exile, entwining their fates with hers. The messenger god, Hermes. The craftsman, Daedalus. A ship bearing a golden fleece. And wily Odysseus, on his epic voyage home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is danger for a solitary woman in this world, and Circe's independence draws the wrath of men and gods alike. To protect what she holds dear, Circe must decide whether she belongs with the deities she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>The many manifestations of migraine can vary dramatically from one patient to another, even within the same patient at different times. Among the most compelling and perplexing of these symptoms are the strange visual hallucinations and distortions of space, time, and body image which migraineurs sometimes experience. Portrayals of these uncanny states have found their way into many works of art, from the heavenly visions of Hildegard von Bingen to Alice in Wonderland. Dr. Oliver Sacks argues that migraine cannot be understood simply as an illness, but must be viewed as a complex condition with a unique role to play in each individual's life.</description>

  <description>Based on Gabor Maté’s two decades of experience as a medical doctor and his groundbreaking work with the severely addicted on Vancouver’s skid row, &lt;i&gt;In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts&lt;/i&gt; radically reenvisions this much misunderstood field by taking a holistic approach. Dr. Maté presents addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout (and perhaps underpins) our society; not a medical "condition" distinct from the lives it affects, rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional, and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs (and behaviors) of addiction. Simplifying a wide array of brain and addiction research findings from around the globe, the book avoids glib self-help remedies, instead promoting a thorough and compassionate self-understanding as the first key to healing and wellness. &lt;i&gt;In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts &lt;/i&gt;argues persuasively against contemporary health, social, and criminal justice policies toward addiction and those impacted by it. The mix of personal stories—including the author’s candid discussion of his own "high-status" addictive tendencies—and science with positive solutions makes the book equally useful for lay readers and professionals.</description>

  <description>The science of forensic entomology-the application of insect biology to the investigation of crime-is extremely specialized, combining as it does an expert knowledge of entomology with keen powers of observation and deduction. Dr. Erzinclioglu has been a practitioner for over twenty-five years and has been involved in a great number of investigations, including some recent high-profile cases, where his evidence has been critical to the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great admirerer of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Erzinclioglu compares his own techniques with those of his fictional hero, and takes the reader behind the often gruesome but deeply fascinating scenes of a murder investigation. This absorbing book ranges over cases from history, prehistory and mythology to the present day and is as gripping and readable as a good thriller.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Meet Tess, a brave new heroine from beloved epic fantasy author Rachel Hartman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the medieval kingdom of Goredd, women are expected to be ladies, men are their protectors, and dragons get to be whomever they want. Tess, stubbornly, is a troublemaker. You can’t make a scene at your sister’s wedding and break a relative’s nose with one punch (no matter how pompous he is) and not suffer the consequences. As her family plans to send her to a nunnery, Tess yanks on her boots and sets out on a journey across the Southlands, alone and pretending to be a boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Tess is headed is a mystery, even to her. So when she runs into an old friend, it’s a stroke of luck. This friend is a quigutl—a subspecies of dragon—who gives her both a purpose and protection on the road. But Tess is guarding a troubling secret. Her tumultuous past is a heavy burden to carry, and the memories she’s tried to forget threaten to expose her to the world in more ways than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the fascinating world she created in the award-winning and New York Times bestselling &lt;i&gt;Seraphina&lt;/i&gt;, Rachel Hartman introduces readers to a new character and a new quest, pushing the boundaries of genre once again in this wholly original fantasy.</description>

  <description>Results from world-renowned relationship expert John Gottman’s famous Love Lab have proven an incredible truth: Men make or break relationships. Based on 40 years of research, &lt;i&gt;The Man’s Guide to Women&lt;/i&gt; unlocks the mystery of how to attract, satisfy, and succeed with a woman for a lifetime. For the first time ever, there is a science-based answer to the age-old question: What do women really want in a man?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Gottman, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work,&lt;/i&gt; and his wife and collaborator, clinical psychologist Julie Schwartz Gottman, PhD, have pored over the research along with bestselling coauthors Douglas Abrams and Rachel Carlton Abrams, MD. Together, they have written this definitive guide for men, providing answers on everything from how to approach a woman and build a connection with her to how to truly satisfy her in bed and know when the relationship is on the right track. &lt;i&gt;The Man’s Guide to Women &lt;/i&gt;is a must-have playbook for how to play—and win—the game of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A timely and captivating memoir about gender identity set against the backdrop of the transgender equality movement, by a leading activist and the National Press Secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sarah McBride is on a mission to fight for transgender rights around the world. But before she was a prominent activist, and before she became the first transgender person to speak at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, she was a teenager struggling with her identity.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With emotional depth and unparalleled honesty, Sarah shares her personal struggle with gender identity, coming out to her supportive but distraught parents, and finding her way as a woman. She inspires readers with her barrier-breaking political journey that took her, in just four years, from a frightened, closeted college student to one of the nation's most prominent transgender activists walking the halls of the White House, passing laws, and addressing the country in the midst of a heated presidential election. She also details the heartbreaking romance with her first love and future husband Andy, a trans man and activist, who passed away from cancer in 2014 just days after they were married.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sarah's story of identity, love, and tragic loss serves as a powerful entry point for readers who want to gain a deeper understanding of gender identity and what it means to be openly transgender. From issues like bathroom access to healthcare, identification and schools, Sarah weaves the important political milestones, cultural and political debates, and historical context into a personal journey that will open hearts and change minds.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tomorrow Will Be Different&lt;/i&gt; highlights Sarah’s work as an activist and the key issues at the forefront of the fight for trans equality, providing a call-to-arms and empowering look at the road ahead. The fight for equality and freedom has only just begun.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“We must never be a country that says there’s only one way to love, only one way to look, and only one way to live.” –Sarah McBride</description>

  <description>Rose Marshall died in 1952 in Buckley Township, Michigan, run off the road by a man named Bobby Cross—a man who had sold his soul to live forever, and intended to use her death to pay the price of his immortality. Trouble was, he didn’t ask Rose what she thought of the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been more than sixty years since that night, and she’s still sixteen, and she’s still running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have names for her all over the country: the Girl in the Diner. The Phantom Prom Date. The Girl in the Green Silk Gown. Mostly she just goes by “Rose,” a hitchhiking ghost girl with her thumb out and her eyes fixed on the horizon, trying to outrace a man who never sleeps, never stops, and never gives up on the idea of claiming what’s his. She’s the angel of the overpass, she’s the darling of the truck stops, and she’s going to figure out a way to win her freedom. After all, it’s not like it can kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can’t kill what’s already dead.</description>

  <description>An extraordinary debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; explores the surreal experience of having a fractured self. It centers around a young Nigerian woman, Ada, who develops separate selves within her as a result of being born "with one foot on the other side." Unsettling, heartwrenching, dark, and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp evocation of a rare way of experiencing the world, one that illuminates how we all construct our identities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ada begins her life in the south of Nigeria as a troubled baby and a source of deep concern to her family. Her parents, Saul and Saachi, successfully prayed her into existence, but as she grows into a volatile and splintered child, it becomes clear that something went terribly awry. When Ada comes of age and moves to America for college, the group of selves within her grows in power and agency. A traumatic assault leads to a crystallization of her alternate selves: Asụghara and Saint Vincent. As Ada fades into the background of her own mind and these selves--now protective, now hedonistic--move into control, Ada's life spirals in a dark and dangerous direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated by the various selves within Ada and based in the author's realities, &lt;i&gt;Freshwater&lt;/i&gt; dazzles with ferocious energy and serpentine grace, heralding the arrival of a fierce new literary voice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sprawling, genre-defying epic set in a dystopian metropolis plagued by dragons, this debut about what it’s like to be young in a very old world is pure storytelling pleasure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the burned-out, futuristic city of Empire Island, three young people navigate a crumbling metropolis constantly under threat from a pair of dragons that circle the skies. When violence strikes, reality star Duncan Humphrey Ripple V, the spoiled scion of the metropolis’ last dynasty; Baroness Swan Lenore Dahlberg, his tempestuous, death-obsessed betrothed; and Abby, a feral beauty he discovered tossed out with the trash; are forced to flee everything they've ever known. As they wander toward the scalded heart of the city, they face fire, conspiracy, mayhem, unholy drugs, dragon-worshippers, and the monsters lurking inside themselves. In this bombshell of a novel, Chandler Klang Smith has imagined an unimaginable world: scathingly clever and gorgeously strange, &lt;i&gt;The Sky Is Yours&lt;/i&gt; is at once faraway and disturbingly familiar, its singular chaos grounded in the universal realities of love, family, and the deeply human desire to survive at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sky Is Yours&lt;/i&gt; is incredibly cinematic, bawdy, rollicking, hilarious, and utterly unforgettable, a debut that readers who loved &lt;i&gt;Cloud Atlas, Super Sad True Love Story&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/i&gt; will adore.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Lady Truelove,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a girl of noble family, but I am painfully shy, especially in my encounters with those of the opposite sex . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Clara Deverill, standing in for the real Lady Truelove means dispensing advice on problems she herself has never managed to overcome. There’s nothing for it but to retreat to a tearoom and hope inspiration strikes between scones. It doesn’t—until Clara overhears a rake waxing eloquent on the art of “honorable” jilting. The cad may look like an Adonis, but he’s about to find himself on the wrong side of Lady Truelove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rex Galbraith is an heir with no plans to produce a spare. He flirts with the minimum number of eligible young ladies to humor his matchmaking aunt, but Clara is the first to ever catch his roving eye. When he realizes that Clara—as Lady Truelove—has used his advice as newspaper fodder, he’s infuriated. But when he’s forced into a secret alliance with her, he realizes he’s got a much bigger problem—because Clara is upending everything Rex thought he knew about women—and about himself. . . .</description>

Looking for a way out, she seeks employment as a lady's maid in the home of the prominent businessman Andrew Carnegie. Soon, the bond between Clara and her employer deepens into love.

  <description>Sixteen-year-old author Scott Beck never wanted to be an Immortal Writer—not after his father was killed on a mission attempting to dispatch his own villain. Scott blames Shakespeare and the Writers for his father's untimely demise, but no amount of hatred will prevent the oncoming alien attack, which has come over to reality straight from Scott's book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott is forced to collect his characters—an Air Force colonel, two of the best pilots on Earth, and an alien enthusiast from the year 2134—and defeat the alien king before Earth is obliterated by his ships. But an odd sickness Scott calls his Writing Fever might just kill him before the aliens have the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Scott be able to defeat the monsters he created, or will the world end in flames?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;'s Best Books of 2017 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of Donna Tartt and Megan Abbott, a novel about a woman whose family and identity are threatened by the secrets of her past, f&lt;b&gt;rom the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;She's Not There&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm August night in 1980, six college students sneak into the dilapidated ruins of Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary, looking for a thrill. With a pianist, a painter and a teacher among them, the friends are full of potential. But it's not long before they realize they are locked in--and not alone. When the friends get lost and separated, the terrifying night ends in tragedy, and the unexpected, far-reaching consequences reverberate through the survivors' lives. As they go their separate ways, trying to move on, it becomes clear that their dark night in the prison has changed them all. Decades later, new evidence is found, and the dogged detective investigating the cold case charges one of them--celebrity chef Jon Casey-- with murder. Only Casey's old friend Judith Carrigan can testify to his innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Judith is protecting long-held secrets of her own - secrets that, if brought to light, could destroy her career as a travel writer and tear her away from her fireman husband and teenage son. If she chooses to help Casey, she risks losing the life she has fought to build and the woman she has struggled to become. In any life that contains a "before" and an "after," how is it possible to live one life, not two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaving deftly between 1980 and the present day, and told in an unforgettable voice, &lt;i&gt;Long Black Veil&lt;/i&gt; is an intensely atmospheric thriller that explores the meaning of identity, loyalty, and love. Readers will hail this as Boylan's triumphant return to fiction.</description>

  <description>At birth, Mick Trewlove, the illegitimate son of a duke, was handed over to a commoner. Despite his lowly upbringing, Mick has become a successful businessman, but all his wealth hasn’t satisfied his need for revenge against the man who still won’t acknowledge him. What else can Mick do but destroy the duke’s legitimate son—and woo the heir’s betrothed into his own unloving arms . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and sheltered, Lady Aslyn Hastings longs for a bit of adventure. With her intended often preoccupied, Aslyn finds herself drawn to a darkly handsome entrepreneur who seems to understand her so well. Surely a lady of her station should avoid Mick Trewlove. If only he weren’t so irresistible . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets are about to be exposed, Mick must decide if his plan for vengeance is worth risking what his heart truly desires.</description>

  <description>Two Chinese-American sisters—Miranda, the older, responsible one, always her younger sister’s protector; Lucia, the headstrong, unpredictable one, whose impulses are huge and, often, life changing. When Lucia starts hearing voices, it is Miranda who must find a way to reach her sister. Lucia impetuously plows ahead, but the bitter constant is that she is, in fact, mentally ill. Lucia lives life on a grand scale, until, inevitably, she crashes to earth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Miranda leaves her own self-contained life in Switzerland to rescue her sister again—but only Lucia can decide whether she wants to be saved. The bonds of sisterly devotion stretch across oceans—but what does it take to break them?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Here Is Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; is, at its heart, an immigrant story, and a young woman’s quest to find fulfillment and a life unconstrained by her illness. But it’s also an unforgettable, gut-wrenching story of the sacrifices we make to truly love someone—and when loyalty to one’s self must prevail over all.</description>

  <description>Once beloved by London's fashionable elite, Hartley Sedgwick has become a recluse after a spate of salacious gossip exposed his most-private secrets. Rarely venturing from the house whose inheritance is a daily reminder of his downfall, he’s captivated by the exceedingly handsome man who seeks to rob him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since retiring from the boxing ring, Sam Fox has made his pub, The Bell, into a haven for those in his Free Black community. But when his best friend Kate implores him to find and destroy a scandalously revealing painting of her, he agrees. Sam would do anything to protect those he loves, even if it means stealing from a wealthy gentleman. But when he encounters Hartley, he soon finds himself wanting to steal more than just a painting from the lovely, lonely man—he wants to steal his heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Content Warning from Author: This book includes a main character who was sexually abused in the past; abuse happens off page but is alluded to.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Some of Ben Sedgwick's favorite things: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Helping his poor parishioners&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baby animals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shamelessly flirting with the handsome Captain Phillip Dacre&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an unconventional upbringing, Ben is perfectly content with the quiet, predictable life of a country vicar, free of strife or turmoil. When he's asked to look after an absent naval captain's three wild children, he reluctantly agrees, but instantly falls for the hellions. And when their stern but gloriously handsome father arrives, Ben is tempted in ways that make him doubt everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some of Phillip Dacre's favorite things: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;His ship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;People doing precisely as they're told&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Touching the irresistible vicar at every opportunity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillip can't wait to leave England's shores and be back on his ship, away from the grief that haunts him. But his children have driven off a succession of governesses and tutors and he must set things right. The unexpected presence of the cheerful, adorable vicar sets his world on its head and now he can't seem to live without Ben's winning smiles or devastating kisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of runaway children, a plot to blackmail Ben's family, and torturous nights of pleasure, Ben and Phillip must decide if a safe life is worth losing the one thing that makes them come alive.</description>

  <description>Best friends Corey and Kyra were inseparable in their snow-covered town of Lost Creek, Alaska. When Corey moves away, she makes Kyra promise to stay strong during the long, dark winter, and wait for her return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just days before Corey is to return home to visit, Kyra dies. Corey is devastated―and confused. The entire Lost community speaks in hushed tones about the town's lost daughter, saying her death was meant to be. And they push Corey away like she's a stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corey knows something is wrong. With every hour, her suspicion grows. Lost is keeping secrets―chilling secrets. But piecing together the truth about what happened to her best friend may prove as difficult as lighting the sky in an Alaskan winter...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestseller about two identical twin sisters who couldn't look more alike . . . or live more differently. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nantucket is only eleven miles away from Martha's Vineyard. But they may as well be worlds apart for estranged twin sisters Harper and Tabitha Frost. After not speaking for more than a decade, Harper and Tabitha switch islands-and lives-to save what's left of their splintered family. But the twins quickly discover that the secrets, lies, and gossip they thought they'd outrun can travel between islands just as easily as they can. Will Harper and Tabitha be able to bury the hatchet and end their sibling rivalry once and for all? Before the last beach picnic of the season, there will be enough old resentments, new loves, and cases of mistaken identity to make this the most talked-about summer that Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket have experienced in ages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Organize your life, record what matters, and get stuff done!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the heck is a dot journal? It’s a planner, to-do list, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; diary for every aspect of your life: work, home, relationships, hobbies, &lt;i&gt;everything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early adopter Rachel Wilkerson Miller explains how to make a dot journal work for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;—whether you find the picture-perfect examples on Pinterest inspiring or, well, intimidating. You decide how simple or elaborate your journal will be, and what goes in there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Lists&lt;/b&gt; of your to-dos, to-don’ts, and more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Symbols&lt;/b&gt; that will make those lists efficient and effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Spreads&lt;/b&gt; to plan your day, week, month, or year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Trackers&lt;/b&gt; for your habits and goals (think health, money, travel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Accoutrements&lt;/b&gt; such as washi tape, book darts, and more!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"This isn't some Jedi bull****; the force I'm talking about is real, and its energies are everywhere, working on everyone."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston, 1992. David Greenfeld is one of the few white kids at the Martin Luther King Middle School. Everybody clowns him, girls ignore him, and his hippie parents won't even buy him a pair of Nikes, let alone transfer him to a private school. Unless he tests into the city's best public high school--which, if practice tests are any indication, isn't likely--he'll be friendless for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody's more surprised than Dave when Marlon Wellings sticks up for him in the school cafeteria. Mar's a loner from the public housing project on the corner of Dave's own gentrifying block, and he confounds Dave's assumptions about black culture: He's nerdy and neurotic, a Celtics obsessive whose favorite player is the gawky, white Larry Bird. Together, the two boys are able to resist the contradictory personas forced on them by the outside world, and before long, Mar's coming over to Dave's house every afternoon to watch vintage basketball tapes and plot their hustle to Harvard. But as Dave welcomes his new best friend into his world, he realizes how little he knows about Mar's. Cracks gradually form in their relationship, and Dave starts to become aware of the breaks he's been given--and that Mar has not.</description>

  <description>Miryem is the daughter and granddaughter of moneylenders... but her father isn't a very good one. Free to lend and reluctant to collect, he has loaned out most of his wife's dowry and left the family on the edge of poverty--until Miryem steps in. Hardening her heart against her fellow villagers' pleas, she sets out to collect what is owed--and finds herself more than up to the task. When her grandfather loans her a pouch of silver pennies, she brings it back full of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having the reputation of being able to change silver to gold can be more trouble than it's worth--especially when her fate becomes tangled with the cold creatures that haunt the wood, and whose king has learned of her reputation and wants to exploit it for reasons Miryem cannot understand.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gripping narrative of the Truman Administration's response to the fall of Nationalist China and the triumph of Mao Zedong's Communist forces in 1949--an extraordinary political revolution that continues to shape East Asian politics to this day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the opening months of 1949, U.S. President Harry S. Truman found himself faced with a looming diplomatic catastrophe--"perhaps the greatest that this country has ever suffered," as the journalist Walter Lippmann put it. Throughout the spring and summer, Mao Zedong's Communist armies fanned out across mainland China, annihilating the rival troops of America's one-time ally Chiang Kai-shek and taking control of Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities. As Truman and his aides--including his shrewd, ruthless secretary of state, Dean Acheson--scrambled to formulate a response, they were forced to contend not only with Mao, but also with unrelenting political enemies at home, in Congress and even within the administration. Over the course of this tumultuous year, Mao fashioned a new revolutionary government in Beijing, laying the foundation for the creation of modern China, while Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island sanctuary of Taiwan. These events transformed American foreign policy--leading, ultimately, to decades of friction with Communist China, a long-standing U.S. commitment to Taiwan, and the subsequent wars in Korea and Vietnam. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drawing on Chinese and Russian sources, as well as recently declassified CIA documents, Kevin Peraino tells the story of this remarkable year through the eyes of the key players, including Mao Zedong, President Truman, Secretary of State Acheson, Minnesota congressman Walter Judd, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the influential first lady of the Republic of China. Truman and his administration struggled to navigate a disorienting new political landscape that was being reshaped daily by the emerging technology of television, the rising tensions of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and growing fears of spying, infiltration, and Russia’s acquisition of the atomic bomb. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Today, the legacy of 1949 is more relevant than ever to the relationships between China, the United States, and the rest of the world, as Beijing asserts its claims in the South China Sea and tensions endure between Taiwan and the mainland. Yet at the heart of the book is a story for any season--a thoughtful and moving examination of the fierce determination of the human will.</description>

  <description>On the heels of her triumphant &lt;em&gt;How to Be a Victorian&lt;/em&gt;, Ruth Goodman travels even further back in English history to the era closest to her heart, the dramatic period from the crowning of Henry VII to the death of Elizabeth I. A celebrated master of British social and domestic history, Ruth Goodman draws on her own adventures living in re-created Tudor conditions to serve as our intrepid guide to sixteenth-century living. Proceeding from daybreak to bedtime, this “immersive, engrossing” (&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;) work pays tribute to the lives of those who labored through the era. From using soot from candle wax as toothpaste to malting grain for homemade ale, from the gruesome sport of bear-baiting to cuckolding and cross-dressing—the madcap habits and revealing intimacies of life in the time of Shakespeare are vividly rendered for the insatiably curious.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this intimate memoir of survival, a former captive of ISIS tells her harrowing and ultimately inspiring story.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadia Murad was born and raised in Kocho, a small village of farmers and shepherds in Iraq. A member of the Yazidi community, she and her eleven brothers and sisters lived a quiet life. Nadia was in high school and had dreams of becoming a history teacher and opening her own beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On August 15th, 2014, when Nadia was just twenty-one years old, this life ended. ISIS militants massacred the people of her village, executing men old enough to fight and women too old to become sex slaves. Six of Nadia's brothers were killed, and her mother soon after, their bodies swept into mass graves. Nadia and her two sisters were taken to Mosul, where they joined thousands of Yazidi girls in the ISIS slave trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadia would be sold three times, raped, beaten, and forced to convert to Islam in order to marry one of her captors. Finally, she managed a narrow escape through the streets of Mosul, finding shelter in the home of a Sunni Muslim family whose eldest son risked his life to smuggle her to the safety of a refugee camp. There, surrounded by bereaved and broken Yazidi families, Nadia decided to devote her life to bringing ISIS to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a farm girl in rural Iraq, Nadia could not have imagined she would one day address the United Nations or be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. She had never been to Baghdad, or even seen an airplane. As a slave, she was told by her captors that Yazidis would be erased from the face of the earth, and there were times when she believed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Nadia's story--as a witness to ISIS, a survivor of rape, a refugee, a Yazidi--has forced the world to pay attention to the ongoing genocide in Iraq. It is a call to action, a testament to the human will to survive, and a love letter to a lost country, a fragile community, and a family torn apart by war.</description>

A decade and a half later, “Iraqi” to many Americans simply means “Terrorist.” In reality, there are many different ethnic groups and cultures in Iraq, and “terrorist” is not...]]>

  <description>It all begins with a fugitive billionaire and the promise of a cash reward. &lt;i&gt;Turtles All the Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is about lifelong friendship, the intimacy of an unexpected reunion, Star Wars fan fiction, and tuatara. But at its heart is Aza Holmes, a young woman navigating daily existence within the ever-tightening spiral of her own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his long-awaited return, John Green shares Aza's story with shattering, unflinching clarity.</description>

His books are ok–I can understand why people love them, and they are fun to read, but they are also pretty problematic. That manic pix...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The magical adventure begun in &lt;i&gt;The Bear and the Nightingale&lt;/i&gt; continues as brave Vasya, now a young woman, is forced to choose between marriage or life in a convent and instead flees her home—but soon finds herself called upon to help defend the city of Moscow when it comes under siege.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and cast out as a witch by her village, Vasya’s options are few: resign herself to life in a convent, or allow her older sister to make her a match with a Moscovite prince. Both doom her to life in a tower, cut off from the vast world she longs to explore. So instead she chooses adventure, disguising herself as a boy and riding her horse into the woods. When a battle with some bandits who have been terrorizing the countryside earns her the admiration of the Grand Prince of Moscow, she must carefully guard the secret of her gender to remain in his good graces—even as she realizes his kingdom is under threat from mysterious forces only she will be able to stop.</description>

  <description>Kaine Prescott is no stranger to death. When her husband died two years ago, her pleas for further investigation into his suspicious death fell on deaf ears. In desperate need of a fresh start, Kaine purchases an old house sight unseen in her grandfather's Wisconsin hometown. But one look at the eerie, abandoned house immediately leaves her questioning her rash decision. And when the house's dark history comes back with a vengeance, Kaine is forced to face the terrifying realization she has nowhere left to hide. &lt;br /&gt;A century earlier, the house on Foster Hill holds nothing but painful memories for Ivy Thorpe. When an unidentified woman is found dead on the property, Ivy is compelled to discover her identity. Ivy's search leads her into dangerous waters and, even as she works together with a man from her past, can she unravel the mystery before any other lives--&lt;br /&gt;including her own--are lost?</description>

  <description>A healer who cannot be healed . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Zivah falls prey to the deadly rose plague, she knows it’s only a matter of time before she fully succumbs. Now she’s destined to live her last days in isolation, cut off from her people and unable to practice her art—until a threat to her village creates a need that only she can fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A soldier shattered by war . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broken by torture at the hands of the Amparan Empire, Dineas thirsts for revenge against his captors. Now escaped and reunited with his tribe, he’ll do anything to free them from Amparan rule—even if it means undertaking a plan that risks not only his life but his very self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust together on a high-stakes mission to spy on the capital, the two couldn’t be more different: Zivah, deeply committed to her vow of healing, and Dineas, yearning for vengeance. But as they grow closer, they must find common ground to protect those they love. And amidst the constant fear of discovery, the two grapple with a mutual attraction that could break both of their carefully guarded hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smart, sweeping fantasy with a political edge and a slow-burning romance will capture fans of The Lumatere Chronicles and An Ember in the Ashes.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The magicians want her to lead. The sorcerers want her to lie. The demons want her blood. Henrietta wants to save the one she loves. But will his dark magic be her undoing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henrietta doesn’t need a prophecy to know that she’s in danger. She came to London to be named the chosen one, the first female sorcerer in centuries, the one who would defeat the bloodthirsty Ancients. Instead, she discovered a city ruled by secrets. And the biggest secret of all: Henrietta is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the chosen one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, she must play the role in order to keep herself and Rook, her best friend and childhood love, safe. But can she truly save him? The poison in Rook’s system is transforming him into something monstrous as he begins to master dark powers of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Henrietta finds a clue to the Ancients’ past that could turn the tide of the war, she persuades Blackwood, the mysterious Earl of Sorrow-Fell, to travel up the coast to seek out strange new weapons. And Magnus, the brave, reckless flirt who wants to win back her favor, is assigned to their mission. Together, they will face monsters, meet powerful new allies, and uncover the most devastating weapon of all: the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I am Henrietta Howel. The first female sorcerer. The prophesied one. Or am I?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Henrietta Howel can burst into flames. When she is brought to London to train with Her Majesty's sorcerers, she meets her fellow sorcerer trainees, young men eager to test her powers and her heart. One will challenge her. One will fight for her. One will betray her. As Henrietta discovers the secrets hiding behind the glamour of sorcerer life, she begins to doubt that she's the true prophesied one. With battle looming, how much will she risk to save the city--and the one she loves?</description>

  <description>From beloved romance author Molly Harper (&lt;i&gt;Half-Moon Hollow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Nice Girls&lt;/i&gt; series) comes the first title in her new rom-com women’s fiction series, Southern Eclectic, which features the lives, losses and loves of the McCready family as they manage their family’s generational funeral home and bait shop (you read that correctly) on the shore of picturesque Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type-A Margot Cary is the leading event planner for the crème de la crème of Chicago high society. No request is too extravagant for her to execute with trademark perfection. That is, until an unfortunate incident involving a shrimp tower, live flamingos, and a shellfish allergy puts her on the black list of the rich and social and out of a job. With the lights about to be shut off in the trendy condo she can no longer afford, and her savings account dwindling, Margot’s situation is near to desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In steps her birth father’s side of the family (who she’s never met), the McCreadys…the McCreadys of the McCready Family Funeral Home and Bait Shop in small town Georgia—and as luck would have it, they’re looking for an event planner and don’t care about her reputation among the A-list crowd. As Margot tackles small town life—where everyone knows everything about everyone—and builds a relationship with a father who she’d never known, she discovers the comforts that community, a rather large extended family, and a rugged, unpretentious country man can offer...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When a blizzard strands them in Salt Lake City, two strangers agree to charter a plane together, hoping to return home; Ben Payne is a gifted surgeon returning from a conference, and Ashley Knox, a magazine writer, is en route to her wedding. But when unthinkable tragedy strikes, the pair find themselves stranded in Utah's most remote wilderness in the dead of winter, badly injured and miles from civilization. Without food or shelter, and only Ben's mountain climbing gear to protect themselves, Ashley and Ben's chances for survival look bleak, but their reliance on each other sparks an immediate connection, which soon evolves into something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days in the mountains become weeks, as their hope for rescue dwindles. How will they make it out of the wilderness and if they do, how will this experience change them forever? Heart-wrenching and unputdownable, &lt;i&gt;The Mountain Between Us&lt;/i&gt; will reaffirm your belief in the power of love to sustain us.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Arcadia&lt;/i&gt; takes us back and forth between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ranging over the nature of truth and time, the difference between the Classical and the Romantic temperament, and the disruptive influence of sex on our orbits in life. Focusing on the mysteries--romantic, scientific, literary--that engage the minds and hearts of characters whose passions and lives intersect across scientific planes and centuries, it is "Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and... emotion. It's like a dream of levitation: you're instantaneously aloft, soaring, banking, doing loop-the-loops and then, when you think you're about to plummet to earth, swooping to a gentle touchdown of not easily described sweetness and sorrow... Exhilarating" (Vincent Canby, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>In a ruined, nameless city of the future, a woman named Rachel, who makes her living as a scavenger, finds a creature she names “Borne” entangled in the fur of Mord, a gigantic, despotic bear. Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won’t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The ultimate guide to the former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, filled with all the fun, all the inspiration, and none of the malarkey.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aviators. The Amtrak. The Obama bromance. Few politicians are as iconic, or as beloved, as Joe Biden. Now, in&lt;i&gt;The Book of Joe&lt;/i&gt;, Biden fans and political junkies alike have the ultimate look at America's favorite vice president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Covering the key chapters in Biden's life and career--and filled with classic Biden-isms, including "That's a bunch of malarkey" and "I may be Irish, but I'm not stupid"--this entertaining blend of biography, advice, and muscle cars explores the moments that forged Joe Biden, and what they can teach us today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But along with this "Wisdom of Joe," the book also reveals the inspirational story of a man whose life has been shaped by his father's advice: &lt;i&gt;Get back up&lt;/i&gt;. Time after time, Biden has bounced back from both personal heartbreaks and professional disappointments, and just like Joe, sometimes we all have to dust ourselves off and fight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with lessons we need now more than ever, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Joe &lt;/i&gt;is both a celebration of a revered political figure and a testament to the power of a life filled with integrity, perseverance, and plenty of ice cream.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternate cover edition for ASIN B01L1CEZ6K can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33143055-beneath-a-scarlet-sky" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Based on the true story of a forgotten hero, &lt;i&gt;Beneath a Scarlet Sky&lt;/i&gt; is the triumphant, epic tale of one young man’s incredible courage and resilience during one of history’s darkest hours.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pino Lella wants nothing to do with the war or the Nazis. He’s a normal Italian teenager—obsessed with music, food, and girls—but his days of innocence are numbered. When his family home in Milan is destroyed by Allied bombs, Pino joins an underground railroad helping Jews escape over the Alps, and falls for Anna, a beautiful widow six years his senior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to protect him, Pino’s parents force him to enlist as a German soldier—a move they think will keep him out of combat. But after Pino is injured, he is recruited at the tender age of eighteen to become the personal driver for Adolf Hitler’s left hand in Italy, General Hans Leyers, one of the Third Reich’s most mysterious and powerful commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command, Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in secret, his courage bolstered by his love for Anna and for the life he dreams they will one day share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of &lt;i&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Unbroken&lt;/i&gt; will enjoy this riveting saga of history, suspense, and love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For this novel, Scott moved far away from the setting of his own turbulent time. He went back to the late 12th century, and to England rather than the Scottish settings of all his previous novels. He connected his writing &lt;i&gt;Ivanhoe&lt;/i&gt; with his concerns about contemporary events.&lt;br /&gt;Scott drew together the apparently opposing themes of historical reality and chivalric romance, social realism and high adventure, past and present.</description>

  <description>“It’s never the disasters you see coming that finally come to pass—it’s the ones you don’t expect at all,” says Julia, in this spellbinding novel of catastrophe and survival by a superb new writer. Luminous, suspenseful, unforgettable, &lt;i&gt;The Age of Miracles&lt;/i&gt; tells the haunting and beautiful story of Julia and her family as they struggle to live in a time of extraordinary change.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; On an ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, Julia awakens to discover that something has happened to the rotation of the earth. The days and nights are growing longer and longer; gravity is affected; the birds, the tides, human behavior, and cosmic rhythms are thrown into disarray. In a world that seems filled with danger and loss, Julia also must face surprising developments in herself, and in her personal world: divisions widening between her parents; strange behavior by her friends; the pain and vulnerability of first love; a growing sense of isolation; and a surprising, rebellious new strength. With crystalline prose and the indelible magic of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker paints a breathtaking portrait of people finding ways to go on in an ever-evolving world.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A posthumous collection of essays about the modern world from one of Europe’s greatest, and best-selling, literary figures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Umberto Eco was an international cultural superstar. In this, his last collection, the celebrated essayist and novelist observes the changing world around him with irrepressible curiosity and profound wisdom. He sees with fresh eyes the upheaval in ideological values, the crises in politics, and the unbridled individualism that have become the backdrop of our lives—a “liquid” society in which it’s not easy to find a polestar, though stars and starlets abound.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; In these pieces, written for his regular column in &lt;i&gt;L’Espresso&lt;/i&gt; magazine, Eco brings his dazzling erudition and keen sense of the everyday to bear on topics such as popular culture and politics, being seen, conspiracies, the old and the young, new technologies, mass media, racism, and good manners. It is a final gift to his reader—astute, witty, and illuminating.</description>

  <description>Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer – in case he or she decides to strike again.</description>

  <description>Jazz Bashara is a criminal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself—and that now, her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The official companion to the critically acclaimed Netflix drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, &lt;i&gt;The Crown&lt;/i&gt; by Peter Morgan, featuring additional historical background and exclusive images.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II and John Lithgow as Winston Churchill, Netflix's original series &lt;i&gt;The Crown&lt;/i&gt;, created by Peter Morgan and growing out of his Oscar-winning movie &lt;i&gt;The Queen&lt;/i&gt; starring Helen Mirren, paints a unique and intimate portrait of Britain's longest-reigning monarch. This official companion to the show's first season is an in-depth exploration of the early years of Elizabeth II's time as Queen, complete with extensive research, additional material, and exclusive, beautifully reproduced images.&lt;br /&gt; One of the show's most powerful themes is that royals do not choose their duty; it is thrust upon them. Princess Elizabeth never expected her father to die so suddenly, so young, leaving her not only a throne to fill but a global institution to govern. Crowned at twenty-five, already a wife and mother, follow the journey of a woman learning to become a queen while facing her own challenges within her own family. This is the story of how Elizabeth II drew on every ounce of strength and British reserve to deal with crises not only on the continent but at home as well.&lt;br /&gt; Written by bestselling historical biographer Robert Lacey, who also serves as the show's historical consultant, this official companion provides an in-depth exploration from behind the palace gates. Relive the majesty of the first season of the hit show, with behind-the-scenes photos, meticulously researched images from the time, and more.</description>

  <description>With her best-selling debut, &lt;i&gt;Girls in White Dresses&lt;/i&gt;, Jennifer Close captured friendship in those what-on-earth-am-I-going-to-do-with-my-life years of early adulthood. Now, with her sparkling new novel of parenthood and sibling rivalry, Close turns her gimlet eye to the only thing messier than friendship: family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Weezy Coffey’s parents had always told her she was the smart one, while her sister was the pretty one. “Maureen will marry well,” their mother said, but instead it was Weezy who married well, to a kind man and good father. Weezy often wonders if she did this on purpose—thwarting expectations just to prove her parents wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But now that Weezy’s own children are adults, they haven’t exactly been meeting her expectations either. Her oldest child, Martha, is thirty and living in her childhood bedroom after a spectacular career flameout. Martha now works at J.Crew, folding pants with whales embroidered on them and complaining bitterly about it. Weezy’s middle child, Claire, has broken up with her fiancé, canceled her wedding, and locked herself in her New York apartment—leaving Weezy to deal with the caterer and florist. And her youngest, Max, is dating a college classmate named Cleo, a girl so beautiful and confident she wears her swimsuit to family dinner, leaving other members of the Coffey household blushing and stammering into their plates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As the Coffey children’s various missteps drive them back to their childhood home, Weezy suddenly finds her empty nest crowded and her children in full-scale regression. Martha is moping like a teenager, Claire is stumbling home drunk in the wee hours, and Max and Cleo are skulking around the basement, guarding a secret of their own. With radiant style and a generous spirit, &lt;i&gt;The Smart One&lt;/i&gt; is a story about the ways in which we never really grow up, and the place where we return when things go drastically awry: home.</description>

  <description>Laurie Notaro isn’t exactly a domestic goddess—unless that means she fully embraces her genetic hoarding predisposition, sneaks peeks at her husband’s daily journal, or has made a list of the people she wants on her Apocalypse Survival team (her husband’s not on it). Inspired by Victorian household manuals, Notaro chronicles her chronic misfortune in the domestic arts, including cooking, cleaning, and putting on Spanx while sweaty (which should technically qualify as an Olympic sport). &lt;i&gt;Housebroken &lt;/i&gt;is a rollicking new collection of essays showcasing her irreverent wit and inability to feel shame. From defying nature in the quest to making her own Twinkies, to begging her new neighbors not to become urban livestock keepers, to teaching her eight-year-old nephew about hobos, Notaro recounts her best efforts—and hilarious failures—in keeping a household inches away from being condemned. After all, home wasn’t built in a day.</description>

  <description>In this spectacular father/son collaboration, Stephen King and Owen King tell the highest of high-stakes stories: what might happen if women disappeared from the world of men?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a future so real and near it might be now, something happens when women go to sleep; they become shrouded in a cocoon-like gauze. If they are awakened, if the gauze wrapping their bodies is disturbed or violated, the women become feral and spectacularly violent; and while they sleep they go to another place... The men of our world are abandoned, left to their increasingly primal devices. One woman, however, the mysterious Evie, is immune to the blessing or curse of the sleeping disease. Is Evie a medical anomaly to be studied? Or is she a demon who must be slain? Set in a small Appalachian town whose primary employer is a women’s prison, &lt;i&gt;Sleeping Beauties&lt;/i&gt; is a wildly provocative, gloriously absorbing father/son collaboration between Stephen King and Owen King.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In his much-anticipated debut novel, Hank Green--cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow--spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Carls just appeared. Coming home from work at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship--like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor--April and her friend Andy make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world--everywhere from Beijing to Buenos Aires--and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now April has to deal with the pressure on her relationships, her identity, and her safety that this new position brings, all while being on the front lines of the quest to find out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring from the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye.</description>

  <description>Over 100 pages of movie ideas TOO AWESOME for Hollywood. ...because they’re jokes. In this book you’ll find comics, prose, scripts, and even reviews of the best movies that we’d never seriously want see to get made. Unless you’ve got big studio money to throw around. We’re overflowing with artistic integrity but we’ve also got mortgages. We accept wire transfers, most major credit cards, and personal checks.</description>

  <description>Have you ever had a strange urge to jump from a tall building, or steer your car into oncoming traffic? You are not alone. In this captivating fusion of science, history and personal memoir, writer David Adam explores the weird thoughts that exist within every mind, and how they drive millions of us towards obsessions and compulsions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David has suffered from OCD for twenty years, and The Man Who Couldn’t Stop is his unflinchingly honest attempt to understand the condition and his experiences. What might lead an Ethiopian schoolgirl to eat a wall of her house, piece by piece; or a pair of brothers to die beneath an avalanche of household junk that they had compulsively hoarded? At what point does a harmless idea, a snowflake in a clear summer sky, become a blinding blizzard of unwanted thoughts? Drawing on the latest research on the brain, as well as historical accounts of patients and their treatments, this is a book that will challenge the way you think about what is normal, and what is mental illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told with fierce clarity, humour and urgent lyricism, this extraordinary book is both the haunting story of a personal nightmare, and a fascinating doorway into the darkest corners of our minds.</description>

  <description>Eli’s willing to admit it: he’s a little obsessed with the mysterious woman he met years ago. Okay, maybe a lot obsessed. But come on, how often do you meet someone who’s driving a hundred-year-old car, clad in Revolutionary-War era clothes, wielding an oddly modified flintlock rifle—someone who pauses just long enough to reveal strange things about you and your world before disappearing in a cloud of gunfire and a squeal of tires?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the traveler finally reappears in his life, Eli is determined that this time he’s not going to let her go without getting some answers. But his determination soon leads him into a strange, dangerous world and a chase not just across the country but through a hundred years of history—with nothing less than America’s past, present, and future at stake.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Are Hanne's powers a gift from the old Norse gods, or a curse?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her brother Stieg swears their powers are a gift from the old gods, but Hanne Hemstad knows she is truly cursed. It's not Stieg's fault that their father is dead, their mother has left, and their brother Knut has been accused of a crime he didn't commit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, the fault lies with Hanne and her inability to control her murderous "gift"--she is a Berserker. When someone she loves is threatened, she flies into a killing state. The siblings must leave Norway for the American frontier or risk being brought to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aided by a young cowboy who agrees to be their guide, Hanne and her siblings use their powers to survive the perilous trail, where blizzards, wild animals, and vicious bounty hunters await.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they be able to reach their uncle, the one man Hanne believes may be able to teach her how to control her drive to kill? With &lt;i&gt;Berserker&lt;/i&gt;, Emmy Laybourne, the author of &lt;i&gt;Monument 14&lt;/i&gt;, presents her vision of an American west studded with Viking glory.</description>

  <description>"We were eight years in power" was the lament of Reconstruction-era black politicians as the American experiment in multiracial democracy ended with the return of white supremacist rule in the South. Now Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America's "first white president."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period--and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation's old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective--the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Were Eight Years in Power &lt;/i&gt;features Coates's iconic essays first published in &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic, &lt;/i&gt; including &lt;i&gt;Fear of a Black President, The Case for Reparations&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration&lt;/i&gt;, along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates's own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era. &lt;i&gt;We Were Eight Years in Power&lt;/i&gt; is a vital account of modern America, from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment.</description>

  <description>This first-person narrative about an archaeological discovery is rewriting the story of human evolution. A story of defiance and determination by a controversial scientist, this is Lee Berger's own take on finding &lt;i&gt;Homo naledi&lt;/i&gt;, an all-new species on the human family tree and one of the greatest discoveries of the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2013, Berger, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, caught wind of a cache of bones in a hard-to-reach underground cave in South Africa. He put out a call around the world for petite collaborators--men and women small and adventurous enough to be able to squeeze through 8-inch tunnels to reach a sunless cave 40 feet underground. With this team of "underground astronauts," Berger made the discovery of a lifetime: hundreds of prehistoric bones, including entire skeletons of at least 15 individuals, all perhaps two million years old. Their features combined those of known prehominids like Lucy, the famous &lt;i&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/i&gt;, with those more human than anything ever before seen in prehistoric remains. Berger's team had discovered an all new species, and they called it &lt;i&gt;Homo naledi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cave quickly proved to be the richest primitive hominid site ever discovered, full of implications that shake the very foundation of how we define what makes us human. Did this species come before, during, or after the emergence of &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt; on our evolutionary tree? How did the cave come to contain nothing but the remains of these individuals? Did they bury their dead? If so, they must have had a level of self-knowledge, including an awareness of death. And yet those are the very characteristics used to define what makes us human. Did an equally advanced species inhabit Earth with us, or before us? Berger does not hesitate to address all these questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Berger is a charming and controversial figure, and some colleagues question his interpretation of this and other finds. But in these pages, this charismatic and visionary paleontologist counters their arguments and tells his personal story: a rich and readable narrative about science, exploration, and what it means to be human.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Steeped in history and filled with heart-wrenching twists, &lt;i&gt;The Stolen Marriage&lt;/i&gt; is an emotionally captivating novel of secrets, betrayals, prejudice, and forgiveness. It showcases Diane Chamberlain at the top of her talent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;One mistake, one fateful night, and Tess DeMello’s life is changed forever. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 1944. Pregnant, alone, and riddled with guilt, twenty-three-year-old Tess DeMello abruptly gives up her budding career as a nurse and ends her engagement to the love of her life, unable to live a lie. Instead, she turns to the baby’s father for help and agrees to marry him, moving to the small, rural town of Hickory, North Carolina. Tess’s new husband, Henry Kraft, is a secretive man who often stays out all night, hides money from his new wife, and shows her no affection. Tess quickly realizes she’s trapped in a strange and loveless marriage with no way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Hickory love and respect Henry but see Tess as an outsider, treating her with suspicion and disdain. When one of the town’s golden girls dies in a terrible accident, everyone holds Tess responsible. But Henry keeps his secrets even closer now, though it seems that everyone knows something about him that Tess does not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a sudden polio epidemic strikes Hickory, the townspeople band together to build a polio hospital. Tess knows she is needed and defies Henry’s wishes to begin working at there. Through this work, she begins to find purpose and meaning. Yet at home, Henry’s actions grow more alarming by the day. As Tess works to save the lives of her patients, can she untangle the truth behind her husband’s mysterious behavior and find the love—and the life—she was meant to have?</description>

  <description>With his trademark compassion and erudition, Oliver Sacks, whom The New York Times has called "the poet Laureate of medicine," explores the place music occupies in the brain and how it affects the human condition. In Musicophilia, he examines the powers of music through the individual experiences of patients, musicians, and everyday people. Among them a surgeon who is struck by lightning and suddenly becomes obsessed with Chopin; people with "amusia," to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory spans only seven seconds - for everything but music. Dr. Sacks describes how music can animate people with Parkinson's disease who cannot otherwise move, give words to stroke patients who cannot otherwise speak, and calm and organize people who are deeply disoriented by Alzheimer's or schizophrenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music can be inspiring, moving us to the heights or depths of emotion - and it can also be our best medicine. In Musicophilia Oliver Sacks tells us why. (back cover)</description>

  <description>An award-winning memoir and instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller that goes far beyond its riveting medical mystery, &lt;i&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful account of one woman’s struggle to recapture her identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When twenty-four-year-old Susannah Cahalan woke up alone in a hospital room, strapped to her bed and unable to move or speak, she had no memory of how she’d gotten there. Days earlier, she had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: at the beginning of her first serious relationship and a promising career at a major New York newspaper. Now she was labeled violent, psychotic, a flight risk. What happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a swift and breathtaking narrative, Cahalan tells the astonishing true story of her descent into madness, her family’s inspiring faith in her, and the lifesaving diagnosis that nearly didn’t happen.</description>
