  <description>Yetu holds the memories for her people—water-dwelling descendants of pregnant African slave women thrown overboard by slave owners—who live idyllic lives in the deep. Their past, too traumatic to be remembered regularly, is forgotten by everyone, save one—the historian. This demanding role has been bestowed on Yetu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yetu remembers for everyone, and the memories, painful and wonderful, traumatic and terrible and miraculous, are destroying her. And so, she flees to the surface, escaping the memories, the expectations, and the responsibilities—and discovers a world her people left behind long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yetu will learn more than she ever expected to about her own past—and about the future of her people. If they are all to survive, they’ll need to reclaim the memories, reclaim their identity—and own who they really are.</description>

  <description>Police officer Megan Luz and her loyal K-9 partner Brigit are back on the beat—and under the gun—when the local rodeo show goes to the dogs…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;OUT OF THE DOGHOUSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;After capturing the notorious Fort Worth "Tunabomber," Megan and Brigit are practically celebrities. Which is why the police chief lassoed them into doing rodeo duty —mostly as a public relations stunt for the department. Megan's not a fan of calf roping, bull riding, or goat milking contests. But when a thief appears to be working the circuit, her trusty K-9 partner starts sniffing for clues…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;INTO THE FIRE HYDRANT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The culprit is "Robin Hood," a young Texas golddigger who steals from the rich to give to the poor—namely, herself. With Brigit hot on the trail, Megan has to juggle her on-again off-again reputation in the FWPD with her on-again off-again relationship with sexy bomb-squader Seth Rutledge. This time, Megan is determined to rope in her suspect &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; her man…before chaos, and/or her trusted furry partner, is unleashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Readers should be prepared for a laugh fest. Diane Kelly is first class."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;—&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Night Owl Romance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Introducing police officer Megan Luz and her loyal K-9 partner Brigit—two Fort Worth cops who are worth their weight in kibble.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHE’S ON A SHORT LEASH.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Officer Luz is lucky she still has a job after tasering a male colleague where it counts the most. Sure, he had it coming—which is why the police chief is giving Megan a second chance. The catch? Her new partner can’t carry a gun, can’t drive a cruiser, and can’t recite the Miranda Rights. Because her new partner is a big furry police dog. So &lt;i&gt;that’s&lt;/i&gt; what the chief meant when he called Megan’s partner a real b*tch…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WILL FATE THROW HER A BONE?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Brigit out on the beat, Megan is writing up enough tickets to wallpaper the whole station. But when a bomb goes off at the mall’s food court, it’s up to Megan and Brigit to start digging—and sniffing—for clues. With the help of dead-sexy bomb-squad expert Seth Rutledge and his own canine partner named Blast, Megan finds herself in a desperate race to collar a killer. Will justice be served—or will she end up in the doghouse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Readers should be prepared for a laugh fest. Diane Kelly is first class."—&lt;i&gt;Night Owl Romance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>A six-hundred-mile canoe trip in the Canadian wilderness is a seventeen-year-old's dream adventure, but after he is mauled by a grizzly bear, it's all about staying alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This true-life wilderness survival epic recounts seventeen-year-old Alex Messenger's near-lethal encounter with a grizzly bear during a canoe trip in the Canadian tundra. The story follows Alex and his five companions as they paddle north through harrowing rapids and stunning terrain. Twenty-nine days into the trip, while out hiking alone, Alex is attacked by a barren-ground grizzly. Left for dead, he wakes to find that his summer adventure has become a struggle to stay alive. Over the next hours and days, Alex and his companions tend his wounds and use their resilience, ingenuity, and dogged perseverance to reach help at a remote village a thousand miles north of the US-Canadian border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Twenty-Ninth Day is a coming-of-age story like no other, filled with inspiring subarctic landscapes, thrilling riverine paddling, and a trial by fire of the human spirit.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Then She Was Gone&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Watching You&lt;/i&gt; comes another page-turning look inside one family’s past as buried secrets threaten to come to light. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful who you let in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she’s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: I am finally going to know who I am. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She soon learns not only the identity of her birth parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London’s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood, worth millions. Everything in Libby’s life is about to change. But what she can’t possibly know is that others have been waiting for this day as well—and she is on a collision course to meet them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old happily cooing in her crib in the bedroom. Downstairs in the kitchen lay three dead bodies, all dressed in black, next to a hastily scrawled note. And the four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Family Upstairs&lt;/i&gt;, the master of “bone-chilling suspense” (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;) brings us the can’t-look-away story of three entangled families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Former Army MP Mercy Carr and her retired bomb-sniffing dog Elvis are back in &lt;i&gt;Blind Search&lt;/i&gt;, the sequel to the page-turning, critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;A Borrowing of Bones&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s October, hunting season in the Green Mountains—and the Vermont wilderness has never been more beautiful or more dangerous. Especially for nine-year-old Henry, who’s lost in the woods. Again. Only this time he sees something terrible. When a young woman is found shot through the heart with a fatal arrow, Mercy thinks that something is murder. But Henry, a math genius whose autism often silences him when he should speak up most, is not talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there’s a murderer hiding among the hunters in the forest—and Mercy and Elvis must team up with their crime-solving friends, game warden Troy Warner and search-and-rescue dog Susie Bear, to find the killer—before the killer finds Henry. When an early season blizzard hits the mountains, cutting them off from the rest of the world, the race is on to solve the crime, apprehend the murderer, and keep the boy safe until the snowplows get through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the true search-and-rescue case of an autistic boy who got lost in the Vermont wilderness, Paula Munier's mystery is a compelling roller coaster ride through the worst of winter—and human nature.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“Gareth Russell has chosen a handful of passengers on the doomed liner and by training a spotlight on every detail of their lives, he has given us a meticulous, sensitive, and at times harsh picture of the early 20th century in Britain and America. A marvelous piece of work.” —Julian Fellowes, creator of &lt;i&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;A riveting account of the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt; disaster and the unraveling of the gilded Edwardian society that had created it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 1912, six notable people were among those privileged to experience the height of luxury—first class passage on “the ship of dreams,” the RMS &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;: Lucy Leslie, Countess of Rothes; son of the British Empire, Tommy Andrews; American captain of industry John Thayer and his son Jack; Jewish-American immigrant Ida Straus; and American model and movie star Dorothy Gibson. Within a week of setting sail, they were all caught up in the horrifying disaster of the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;’s sinking, one of the biggest news stories of the century. Today, we can see their stories and the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;’s voyage as the beginning of the end of the established hierarchy of the Edwardian era.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Writing in his elegant signature prose and using previously unpublished sources, deck plans, journal entries, and surviving artifacts, Gareth Russell peers through the portholes of these first-class travelers to immerse us in a time of unprecedented change in British and American history. Through their intertwining lives, he examines social, technological, political, and economic forces such as the nuances of the British class system, the explosion of competition in the shipping trade, the birth of the movie industry, the Irish Home Rule Crisis, and the Jewish-American immigrant experience while also recounting their intimate stories of bravery, tragedy, and selflessness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Masterful in its superb grasp of the forces of history, gripping in its moment-by-moment account of the sinking, revelatory in discounting long-held myths, and lavishly illustrated with color and black and white photographs, this absorbing, accessible, and authoritative account of the &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt;’s life and death is destined to become the definitive book on the subject.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;__________________________&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You may take my balls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But I will lick what remains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And then, dear, your face&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine if your dog could talk to you. Better still, imagine if it could express its innermost feelings in poetic form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hilarious, insightful book confirms what we've all long suspected - that inside every dog is the soul of a poet. From retrieving sticks to rivalry with cats; from cold winter walks to endlessly chasing tennis balls, no stone of a dog's life is left unturned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a delightful photo alongside every haiku, this is the perfect gift for any dog lover.</description>

  <description>Felix Allsey is a travel writer with a keen eye for the paranormal, and he's carved out a unique, if only slightly lucrative, niche for himself in nonfiction; he writes travelogues of the country's most haunted places, after haunting them himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he convinces the owner of the infamous Rotterdam Mansion to let him stay on the premises for 13 nights, he believes he's finally found the location that will bring him a bestseller. As with his other gigs, he sets rules for himself: no leaving the house for any reason, refrain from outside contact, and sleep during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Thomas Ruth, Felix's oldest friend and fellow horror film obsessive, joins him on the project, the two dance around a recent and unspeakably painful rough-patch in their friendship, but eventually fall into their old rhythms of dark humor and movie trivia. That's when things start going wrong: screams from upstairs, figures in the thresholds, and more than what should be in any basement. Felix realizes the book he's writing, and his very state of mind, is tilting from nonfiction into all out horror, and the shocking climax answers a question that's been staring these men in the face all along: In Rotter House, who's haunting who?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;On a rugged Colorado mountain ridge, Mattie Cobb and her police dog partner Robo make a grisly discovery-and become the targets of a ruthless killer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colorado's Redstone Ridge is a place of extraordinary beauty, but this rugged mountain wilderness harbors a horrifying secret. When a charred body is discovered in a shallow grave on the ridge, officer Mattie Cobb and her K-9 partner Robo are called in to spearhead the investigation. But this is no ordinary crime-and it soon becomes clear that Mattie has a close personal connection to the dead man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joined by local veterinarian Cole Walker, the pair scours the mountaintop for evidence and makes another gruesome discovery: the skeletonized remains of two adults and a child. And then, the unthinkable happens. Could Mattie become the next victim in the murderer's deadly game?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A deranged killer torments Mattie with a litany of dark secrets that call into question her very identity. As a towering blaze races across the ridge, Cole and Robo search desperately for her-but time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 MP3 CD (approximately 9 hr., 30 min.)</description>

  &lt;b&gt;Private investigator Kate Weller knows her co-workers are in serious trouble when she is unable to reach them in the third enthralling Marked for Retribution mystery.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Weller's boss, Nate Price, has some exciting news: Julian Frazier, a friend of one of the agency's wealthy clients, has invited the Nate Price Investigations team and their partners on a trip of a lifetime to his home on Elysian Island, an exclusive retreat off the Georgian coast. But there's a catch. Frazier has written his own murder mystery script, and the PIs must work out whodunnit. As they're about to discover, though, the murder Frazier wants them to solve is a real cold case, and there's a killer twist that isn't in the script . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unable to reach Elysian Island and her co-workers, Kate is sure that someone wants her to stay away. Can she stop a ruthless killer and uncover the truth behind a deadly game?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Listening length:&lt;/b&gt; 13 hours and 55 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive, dramatic untold story of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, based on original reporting and new archival research.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 25, 1986, in Chernobyl, was a turning point in world history. The disaster not only changed the world’s perception of nuclear power and the science that spawned it, but also our understanding of the planet’s delicate ecology. With the images of the abandoned homes and playgrounds beyond the barbed wire of the 30-kilometer Exclusion Zone, the rusting graveyards of contaminated trucks and helicopters, the farmland lashed with black rain, the event fixed for all time the notion of radiation as an invisible killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chernobyl was also a key event in the destruction of the Soviet Union, and, with it, the United States’ victory in the Cold War. For Moscow, it was a political and financial catastrophe as much as an environmental and scientific one. With a total cost of 18 billion rubles—at the time equivalent to $18 billion—Chernobyl bankrupted an already teetering economy and revealed to its population a state built upon a pillar of lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The full story of the events that started that night in the control room of Reactor No.4 of the V.I. Lenin Nuclear Power Plant has never been told—until now. Through two decades of reporting, new archival information, and first-hand interviews with witnesses, journalist Adam Higginbotham tells the full dramatic story, including Alexander Akimov and Anatoli Dyatlov, who represented the best and worst of Soviet life; denizens of a vanished world of secret policemen, internal passports, food lines, and heroic self-sacrifice for the Motherland. &lt;i&gt;Midnight in Chernobyl&lt;/i&gt;, award-worthy nonfiction that reads like sci-fi, shows not only the final epic struggle of a dying empire but also the story of individual heroism and desperate, ingenious technical improvisation joining forces against a new kind of enemy.</description>

  <description>The Easton family has just moved into their new fixer-upper, a beautiful old house that they bought at a steal, and Alice, the youngest of the family, is excited to explore the strange, new place. Her excitement turns to growing dread as she discovers a picture hidden under the old wallpaper, a child’s drawing of a family just like hers. Soon after, members of the family begin to disappear, each victim marked on the child’s drawing with a dark black X. It’s up to her to unlock the grim mystery of the house before she becomes the next victim.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Tempest Michaels is about to have a bad week.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When a newspaper ad typo sends all manner of daft paranormal enquiries his way, P.I. Tempest Michaels has no sense of the trouble and danger heading his way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In no time at all, he has multiple cases to investigate, but it’s all ridiculous nonsense like minor celebrity Richard Claythorn, who believes he is being stalked by a werewolf and a shopkeeper in a nearby village with an invisible thief. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Solving these cases might be fun if his demanding mother (Why are there no grandchildren, Tempest?) didn’t insist on going with him, but the simple case of celebrity stalking might not be all it seems when he catches a man lurking behind the client’s property just in time to see him step into the moonlight and begin to transform. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All he wanted was a nice easy job where he got to be his own boss and could take his trusty Dachshunds to work. How much trouble can a typo cause? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The paranormal? It’s all nonsense, but proving it might get him killed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The tragic lives of Henry VIII and his six wives are reimagined by seven acclaimed and bestselling authors in this riveting novel, perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;Wolf Hall&lt;/i&gt; and Netflix's &lt;i&gt;The Crown&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was King Henry VIII, a charismatic and extravagant ruler obsessed with both his power as king and with siring a male heir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were his queens--six ill-fated women, each bound for divorce, or beheading, or death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch spellbound as each of Henry's wives attempts to survive their unpredictable king and his power-hungry court. See the sword flash as fiery Anne Boleyn is beheaded for adultery. Follow Jane Seymour as she rises from bullied court maiden to beloved queen, only to die after giving birth. Feel Catherine Howard's terror as old lovers resurface and whisper vicious rumors to Henry's influential advisors. Experience the heartache of mothers as they lose son after son, heir after heir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in stirring first-person accounts, &lt;i&gt;Fatal Throne&lt;/i&gt; is at once provocative and heartbreaking, an epic tale that is also an intimate look at the royalty of the most perilous times in English history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who's Who: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * M. T. Anderson - Henry VIII&lt;br /&gt; * Candace Fleming - Katharine of Aragon&lt;br /&gt; * Stephanie Hemphill - Anne Boleyn&lt;br /&gt; * Lisa Ann Sandell - Jane Seymour&lt;br /&gt; * Jennifer Donnelly - Anna of Cleves&lt;br /&gt; * Linda Sue Park - Catherine Howard&lt;br /&gt; * Deborah Hopkinson - Kateryn Parr</description>

  <description>In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As psychically terrifying as &lt;i&gt;Firestarter&lt;i&gt;, and with the spectacular kid power of &lt;i&gt;It&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Institute&lt;/i&gt; is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Longlisted for the 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This blazingly intimate biography of Janis Joplin establishes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the Queen of Rock &amp;amp; Roll&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as the rule-breaking musical trailblazer and complicated, gender-bending rebel she was.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janis Joplin’s first transgressive act was to be a white girl who gained an early sense of the power of the blues, music you could only find on obscure records and in roadhouses along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast. But even before that, she stood out in her conservative oil town. She was a tomboy who was also intellectually curious and artistic. By the time she reached high school, she had drawn the scorn of her peers for her embrace of the Beats and her racially progressive views. Her parents doted on her in many ways, but were ultimately put off by her repeated acts of defiance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Janis Joplin has passed into legend as a brash, impassioned soul doomed by the pain that produced one of the most extraordinary voices in rock history. But in these pages, Holly George-Warren provides a revelatory and deeply satisfying portrait of a woman who wasn’t all about suffering. Janis was a perfectionist: a passionate, erudite musician who was born with talent but also worked exceptionally hard to develop it. She was a woman who pushed the boundaries of gender and sexuality long before it was socially acceptable. She was a sensitive seeker who wanted to marry and settle down—but couldn’t, or wouldn’t. She was a Texan who yearned to flee Texas but could never quite get away—even after becoming a countercultural icon in San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Written by one of the most highly regarded chroniclers of American music history, and based on unprecedented access to Janis Joplin’s family, friends, band mates, archives, and long-lost interviews, &lt;i&gt;Janis&lt;/i&gt; is a complex, rewarding portrait of a remarkable artist finally getting her due.</description>

  <description>WANTED: Men and women willing to drive through the valley of the shadow of death. The world’s population has been decimated by the Change, a chain reaction of events triggered by global warming. In Europe, governments have fallen, cities have crumbled and the wheels of production have ground to a halt. The Alps region, containing most of the continent’s remaining fresh water, has become a closed state with heavily fortified borders. Survivors cling on by trading through the Runners, truck drivers who deliver cargo and take a percentage. Amid the ruins of central Germany, two Runners, Cassady and Ghazi, are called on to deliver medical supplies to a research base deep in the Italian desert, where scientists claim to be building a machine that could reverse the effects of the Change. Joining the pair are a ragtag collection of drivers, all of whom have something to prove. Standing in their way are starving nomads, crumbling cities, hostile weather and a rogue state hell-bent on the convoy's destruction. And there's another problem: Cassady is close to losing his nerve.</description>

But this story of the aftermath of the fall of civilization really grabbed my attention immediately an...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The essential collection of beloved ghost stories, compiled by the editor who helped define the genre—including stories from award-winning, bestselling authors such as Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Hoffman, Seanan McGuire, and Paul Tremblay.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves a good ghost story, especially Ellen Datlow—the most lauded editor in short works of supernatural suspense and dark fantasy. &lt;i&gt;The Saga Anthology of Ghost Stories&lt;/i&gt; is her definitive collection of ghost stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These thirty stories, including all new works from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling authors Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Hoffman, Seanan McGuire, and Paul Tremblay, span from the traditional to the eclectic, from the mainstream to the literary, from pure fantasy to the bizarrely supernatural. Whether you’re reading alone under the covers with a flashlight, or around a campfire with a circle of friends, there’s something here to please—and spook—everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contributors include: Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Hoffman, Vincent J. Masterson, A.C. Wise, M. Rickert, Seanan McGuire, Lee Thomas, Alison Littlewood, M.L.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Residents of Rudolph keep the spirit of Christmas alive year-round—but their joy is threatened when a group of grinches visits the town, in the charming fourth installment of the Year-Round Christmas series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the week before Thanksgiving, and Merry Wilkinson, owner of Mrs. Claus's Treasures, is preparing for a weekend reunion of her mother's college friends. But when the group of women comes into Merry's shop, Merry is met with frosty attitudes and cold hearts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women argue amongst themselves constantly, and the bickering only intensifies after one of the friends is poisoned. With her father's role as Santa in danger due to his proximity to the crime, Merry will need to use all of her investigative gifts to wrap this mystery up and save Santa and her favorite holiday.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Gathered in one volume for the very first time, here are three yuletide tales of mystery, murder, and romance, featuring your favorite sleuths . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE TWELVE DESSERTS OF CHRISTMAS by JOANNE FLUKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It's the perfect mix of naughty and nice when two lovestruck boarding school teachers watch six kids over Christmas break. But when someone wants the cozy couple's romance to burn out faster than a scorched fruitcake, it's Hannah Swensen to the rescue, armed with her sleuthing &lt;br /&gt; skills--and twelve deliciously festive recipes . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;NIGHTMARE ON ELF STREET by LAURA LEVINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Aside from the mortifying costume, how bad can a gig as a mall Santa's elf be? Jaine Austen finds out when she's teamed up with the Santa from Hell. But things go from bad to worse when he's found murdered on the job--and Jaine is a suspect. Now all she wants for Christmas is to find the real killer . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CHRISTMAS THIEF by LESLIE MEIER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Elizabeth Stone is ready for a white Christmas in Tinker's Cove, Maine--until a fancy Yule ball at the Florida hotel where she works dumps snow on her plans. The sponsor's jewels have gone missing and the police are asking about her ties to a cute mystery guest. Good thing Elizabeth's mother, Lucy Stone, flew down to surprise her. ʼTis the season for a little investigating . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes Luscious Holiday Recipes!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Haunted art is in the eye of the beholder . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artist Celeste Cabot welcomes the chance to show her paintings at a craft fair in her hometown of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where she and her Chihuahua, Van Gogh, can park her vintage Shasta trailer and sell her creations, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, her sales take a hit when a customer returns a painting, claiming it's haunted. When a fellow vendor discovers images hidden in Celeste's artwork--and a ghost pays her a late-night visit--she's shocked to realize she has psychic abilities. After the grumpy manager of the craft fair is found with a knife in his neck, Celeste's brushes with the paranormal may help fill in the picture--and make sure the wrong person doesn't get framed . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Rose Pressey and the Haunted Vintage Mysteries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Rose Pressey's books are fun!" --&lt;b&gt;Janet Evanovich&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Chock full of ghosts, cats possessed by spirits, a handsome police officer boyfriend, and tips on the afterlife and vintage shopping." --&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"An appealing protagonist who is as sweet as a Southern accent." --&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "A sheer delight."&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Kate Carlisle&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Listening Length: 9 hours, 53 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deputy Mattie Cobb is working through issues from her past and has withdrawn from Cole Walker and his family to focus on herself, when she and her K-9 partner Robo get called to track a missing junior high student. Until they find the girl on Smoker's Hill behind the high school, dead. But that's only the start of trouble in Timber Creek, because soon another girl goes missing--and this time it's Sophie Walker. Hard as they search, Cole, Mattie, and Robo can't find her anywhere. Mattie's primary suspect, a strange man who lives near the wilderness area, calls to report he hears deer "screaming" in the woods. Suspecting the man might have lost touch with reality and be referring to something he's done to Sophie, Mattie takes Robo into the dense pine forest, hoping to pick up a trace of her scent. But when Robo does catch Sophie's trail, it leads them to another clue that challenges everything they thought they knew about the case. Now Mattie and Robo must rush to hunt down Sophie's kidnapper before they're too late in &lt;i&gt;Hunting Hour&lt;/i&gt;, the third installment in critically acclaimed author Margaret Mizushima's exhilarating mystery series.</description>

  <description>In the charming town of Mayville Heights, librarian Kathleen Paulson and her two cats pounce on clues to catch a killer, in the eleventh installment of this New York Times bestselling series. Spring is coming to Mayville Heights, and Kathleen's brother, Ethan, has arrived in town with his band, The Flaming Gerbils. But not everything goes as scheduled when one of Ethan's bandmates gets into a fight with a man interested in investing in the town. When the businessman's body is later found, Ethan's friend is implicated in the crime. Kathleen wants to help her brother by solving the case, but she has no shortage of suspects from which to choose. Prior to his death, the investor was fighting like cats and dogs with lots of people. If this librarian wants more than a whisker's chance of solving the case, she will need to rely on her trusty feline sidekicks, Owen and Hercules.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Addie Greyborne is preparing for the holidays at her bookstore in seaside New England--but a winter storm is coming, in more ways than one . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addie's getting into the spirit for the upcoming Charity Auction—especially since she's got an 1843 copy of Charles Dickens's &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol &lt;/i&gt;to donate. Her former colleagues at the Boston Public Library have confirmed that its worth runs toward the high five figures, which should help with the new pediatric wing. Her mood darkens, though, when a visitor from the past appears—Jonathan Hemingway, the father of her late fiancé. His presence stirs up sad memories for Addie, but also has her fuming when Jonathan, true to his womanizing ways, runs off for a lunchtime liaison with Teresa Lang, who's in charge of the auction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after, Addie heads to Teresa's office at the hospital—and finds the poor woman's dead body. What she doesn't find is her valuable first edition. What sort of Scrooge would steal from sick children and commit murder in the process? As a Nor'easter bears down and a mystery emerges about Jonathan's past, Addie must find out if she can appraise people's motives and characters as well as she can appraise rare books . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Professor Emily Cavanaugh makes a horrific discovery while writing her book on Dostoevsky in the entertaining fourth Crime with the Classics cozy.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professor Emily Cavanaugh has left Windy Corner behind and is back at Reed College on her sabbatical, determined to finish writing her book on Dostoevsky. She is soon reunited with one of her promising students, Daniel Razumov, as well as familiar faces on the teaching staff - her friend, Marguerite Grenier, her half-brother, Oscar Lansing, the abrasive division chair, Richard McClintock, and the predatory Taylor Curzon. Known for her relentless pursuit of young male students, Taylor now has Daniel firmly in her sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily knows Taylor must be stopped, but as she starts gathering evidence of Daniel's harassment, she has a disturbing flashback, and then makes a gruesome discovery . . . Can Emily catch a dangerous campus killer while also confronting events from her own past?</description>

  <description>1914. The outbreak of war. In the French city of Arras, a Father is brutally murdered. The Catholic Inquisition - still powerful, but now working in the shadows - sends its most determined and unhinged of Inquisitors, Poldek Tacit to investigate: his mission to protect the Church from those who would seek to undermine it, no matter what the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet as Tacit arrives, armed forces led by Britain and Germany confront each other across No Man's Land. As the Inquisitor strives in vain to establish the truth behind the murder and to uncover the motives of other Vatican servants seeking to undermine him, a beautiful and spirited woman, Sandrine, warns British soldier Henry Frost of a mutual foe even more terrible lurking beneath the killing fields that answers to no human force and wreaks their havoc by the light of the moon. Faced with impossible odds and his own demons, Tacit must battle the forces of evil, and a church determined at all costs to achieve its aims, to reach the heart of a dark conspiracy that seeks to engulf the world, plunging it ever deeper into conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morally complex and fast paced, this is a gripping work of dark fiction set in an alternative twentieth century, where humanity's desire for love, compassion and peace face daunting challenges in a world overwhelmed by total war and mysterious dark forces.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;'Tis the season for hot chocolate and mouthwatering treats. But sometimes too much of a good thing can be downright deadly . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;CHRISTMAS COCOA MURDER by CARLENE O'CONNOR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Siobh�n O'Sullivan's hopes for a quiet Irish Christmas are dashed when the local Santa turns up dead in a carnival dunk tank of hot cocoa. Now instead of hunting down holiday gifts, she's pursuing a heartless killer. Seems the dead Santa was no angel either, stealing neighborhood dogs to guide his sleigh. But was it his holiday antics--or worse--that led to his death by chocolate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHRISTMAS COCOA AND A CORPSE by MADDIE DAY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When local businessman Jed Greenberg is found dead with a Chocolate lab whimpering over his body, the police start sniffing around Robbie Jordan's country restaurant for answers. Was it something in Robbie's hot cocoa that killed Jed, or was it Cocoa the dog? As the suspects pile as high as her holiday tree, Robbie attempts to get to the bottom of the sickly-sweet murder . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEATH BY HOT COCOA by Alex Erickson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A Christmas-themed escape game seems like the perfect pre-holiday treat for bookstore caf� owner Krissy Hancock and her best friend. But when the host is found dead in a pool of hot cocoa, it's up to Krissy and her team to catch the killer--or escape before getting killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There's nothing like a hot cup of murder to warm up the holiday season!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>A dream job it's not. But for Emily Prentice, working as a seafood inspector in Ketchikan, Alaska, takes her one step closer to becoming a marine biologist. And it'll give her a first taste of independence from her overprotective mom and the doctor boyfriend she's pushing into Emily's arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily's certainly not looking for romance . . . until a huge dog knocks her down and sends her flying into fish goo. It's love at first sight for Emily and Bear, whose handsome owner, Sam, becomes flummoxed when the fallen worker in the hard hat turns out to be a pretty young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emily and Bear begin a beautiful relationship, with Sam in tow. And before long the attraction between the humans becomes undeniable. But separation and a dangerous undertaking soon leave Emily wondering if she'll lose Sam before she gets to tell him how she really feels . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear wants his humans staying together, and before he's done, both Emily and Sam will learn one essential canine truth: A dog is the only one on earth who loves you more than you love yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Praise for Sue Pethick's Novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;

Everyone is excited for their first family Christmas with nothing to hide. Why? Because Georgia’s daughter Madison is now in the know about Sid, their walking, talking family skeleton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their Christmas cheer is interrupted when the Thackerys' dog Byron goes missing on a cold December night. When he’s finally found, he has a femur clutched between his jaws, and Georgia and Madison race to apologize to Sid for letting the dog gnaw on him yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that all of Sid’s bones are present and accounted for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bone is from somebody else, and when they trace Byron’s trail to an overgrown lot nearby, they find the rest of the skeleton. It’s the normal kind, not moving or telling jokes, and when the police come to take charge, they’re sure it was murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one of Georgia’s adjunct friends could be implicated.</description>

      <![CDATA[I collect cookbooks, especially bookish ones. I love Louisa Mae Alcott's book about the March family. It's been one of my favorite classics ever since I first read it as a child. Reading through the recipes and quotes in this cookbook make me want to re-read the novel! I added it to my TBR list!...]]>

  <description>Apples are at the core of the family business run by Winona Mae Montgomery and her Granny Smythe. But this year's crop is unseasonably ripe with murder . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ONE ROTTEN APPLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Blossom Valley, West Virginia, is home to Smythe Orchards, Winnie and her Granny's beloved twenty-five-acre farm and family business. But any way you slice it, it's struggling. That's why they're trying to drum up business with the "First Annual Christmas at the Orchard," a good old-fashioned holiday festival with enough delicious draw to satisfy apple-picking locals and cider-loving tourists alike--until the whole endeavor takes a sour turn when the body of Nadine Cooper, Granny's long-time, grudge-holding nemesis, is found lodged in the apple press. Now, with Granny the number one suspect, Winnie is hard-pressed to prove her innocence before the real killer delivers another murder . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes Recipes!&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Two brutal murders, a menacing band of poachers, and a fearsome creature on the loose in the mountains plunge Mattie Cobb and her K-9 partner Robo into a sinister vortex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An explosion outside a community dance sends Mattie Cobb and Cole Walker reeling into the night, where they discover a burning van and beside it the body of outfitter Nate Fletcher. But the explosion didn't kill Nate--it was two gunshots to the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The investigation leads them to the home of rancher Doyle Redman, whose daughter is Nate's widow, and the object of one of their suspect's affection. But before they can make an arrest, they receive an emergency call from a man who's been shot in the mountains. Mattie and Robo rush to the scene, only to be confronted by the ominous growl of a wild predator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As new players emerge on the scene, Mattie begins to understand the true danger that's enveloping Timber Creek. They journey into the cold, misty mountains to track the animal--but discover something even more deadly in Tracking Game, the fifth installment in Margaret Mizushima's Timber Creek K-9 mysteries.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A novel filled with new insights into the story of Henry VIII’s second—and most infamous—wife, Anne Boleyn. The second book in the epic Six Tudor Queens series, from the acclaimed historian and bestselling author of Katherine of Aragon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the spring of 1527. Henry VIII has come to Hever Castle in Kent to pay court to Anne Boleyn. He is desperate to have her. For this mirror of female perfection he will set aside his Queen and all Cardinal Wolsey’s plans for a dynastic French marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Boleyn is not so sure. She loathes Wolsey for breaking her betrothal to the Earl of Northumberland’s son, Harry Percy, whom she had loved. She does not welcome the King’s advances; she knows that she can never give him her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hers is an opportunist family. And whether Anne is willing or not, they will risk it all to see their daughter on the throne…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A girl searches for a killer on an island where deadly sirens lurk just beneath the waves in this gripping, atmospheric debut novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The sea holds many secrets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moira Alexander has always been fascinated by the deadly sirens who lurk along the shores of her island town. Even though their haunting songs can lure anyone to a swift and watery grave, she gets as close to them as she can, playing her violin on the edge of the enchanted sea. When a young boy is found dead on the beach, the islanders assume that he's one of the sirens’ victims. Moira isn’t so sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain that someone has framed the boy’s death as a siren attack, Moira convinces her childhood friend, the lighthouse keeper Jude Osric, to help her find the real killer, rekindling their friendship in the process. With townspeople itching to hunt the sirens down, and their own secrets threatening to unravel their fragile new alliance, Moira and Jude must race against time to stop the killer before it’s too late—for humans and sirens alike.</description>

  <description>"Perhaps there is no simple, easy way to educate children about the Holocaust. Yet [this] new extraordinary work in the form of a nonfiction graphic novel for children is a valiant attempt to do just that. These testimonials... serve as a reminder never to allow such a tragedy to happen again."&lt;em&gt;--BookTrib&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between 1933 and 1945, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party were responsible for the persecution of millions of Jews across Europe. This extraordinary graphic novel tells the true stories of six Jewish children who survived the Holocaust. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From suffering the horrors of Auschwitz, to hiding from Nazi soldiers in war-torn Paris, to sheltering from the Blitz in England, each true story is a powerful testament to the survivors' courage. These remarkable testimonials serve as a reminder never to allow such a tragedy to happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features a current photograph of each contributor and an update about their lives, along with a glossary and timeline to support reader understanding of this period in world history.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The comprehensive biography of STAN LEE, father of SPIDER-MAN and THE AVENGERS, beloved comicbook writer and editor, and former president and publisher of Marvel Comics, by Lee's colleague of over four decades. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stan Lee co-created SPIDER-MAN! And IRON MAN! And the HULK! And the X-MEN! And more than 500 other iconic characters! His name has appeared on more than a billion comic books, in 75 countries, in 25 languages. His superheroes have starred in multibillion-dollar grossing movies and TV series. This is the story of how Stanley Martin Lieber, a poor kid from Washington Heights became STAN LEE, international legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Danny Fingeroth (comics industry veteran, author, and longtime Stan Lee friend and colleague) &lt;/b&gt;writes a comprehensive biography of this powerhouse of ideas who changed the world’s understanding of what a hero is and how a story should be told, while exploring Lee's unique path to becoming the face of comics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With behind-the-scenes stories and sourced with exclusive, new interviews with Lee himself and other legendary comics and media figures,&lt;i&gt; A Marvelous Life&lt;/i&gt; has insights and revelations that only an insider like Fingeroth can offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingeroth, himself a longtime writer and editor at Marvel Comics and now a lauded pop culture critic and historian, knew and worked closely with Stan Lee for over forty years. Fingeroth is able to put Lee’s life and work in a context that makes events and actions come to life as no other writer could.</description>

  <description>The eleventh novel in the legendary &lt;b&gt;Poldark&lt;/b&gt; saga. Cornwall, 1815: Demelza sees a horseman riding down the valley and senses disruption to the domestic contentment she has fought so hard to achieve. For Ross has little option but to accept the summons - and travel to Paris with his family, as an "observer" of the French armed forces. Parisian life begins well with an exhilarating round of balls and parties. But the return of Napoleon brings separation, distrust and danger to the Poldarks... and always for Demelza, there is the shadow of the secret she does not even share with Ross.</description>

  <description>Harleen is a tough, outspoken, rebellious kid who lives in a ramshackle apartment above a karaoke cabaret owned by a drag queen named MAMA. Ever since Harleen's parents split, MAMA has been her only family. When the cabaret becomes the next victim in the wave of gentrification that's taking over the neighborhood, Harleen gets mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Harleen decides to turn her anger into action, she is faced with two choices: join Ivy, who's campaigning to make the neighborhood a better place to live, or join The Joker, who plans to take down Gotham one corporation at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harley Quinn: Breaking Glass&lt;/i&gt; is at once a tale of the classic Harley readers know and love, and a heartfelt story about the choices teenagers make and how they can define—or destroy—their lives. This is the first title in DC's new line of original graphic novels for middle grade and young adult readers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a young woman clears out her deceased grandmother’s home in rural North Carolina, she finds long-hidden secrets about a strange colony of beings in the woods.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mouse’s dad asks her to clean out her dead grandmother's house, she says yes. After all, how bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Answer: pretty bad. Grandma was a hoarder, and her house is stuffed with useless rubbish. That would be horrific enough, but there’s more—Mouse stumbles across her step-grandfather’s journal, which at first seems to be filled with nonsensical rants…until Mouse encounters some of the terrifying things he described for herself.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alone in the woods with her dog, Mouse finds herself face to face with a series of impossible terrors—because sometimes the things that go bump in the night are real, and they’re looking for you. And if she doesn’t face them head on, she might not survive to tell the tale.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From Hugo Award–winning author Ursula Vernon, writing as T. Kingfisher.</description>

  <description>11 hours &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the #1&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;In a Dark, Dark Wood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Woman in Cabin 10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Death of Mrs. Westaway&lt;/i&gt; comes Ruth Ware’s highly anticipated fifth novel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Cornwall, 1818-1820&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stories of the Poldark family—Ross, the strong, independent squire and his beautiful, outspoken wife Demelza; their son Jeremy; their talented, headstrong daughter Bella; and their long-standing feud with humorless landowner Sir George Warleggan—have sold millions of copies, and in the 1970s were made into the most widely watched TV series of the decade. Now, the twelfth and final novel brings the family story to a close—with Bella taking center stage, moving between her home at Nampara on the rugged Cornish coast and the wildly exciting world of the theater in London and Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The perfect life. The perfect love. The perfect lie. From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl Before&lt;/i&gt; comes a gripping new psychological thriller. . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Dynamic, razor-sharp, and thought-provoking . . . a cutting-edge suspense novel unlike any you've read before."--Mary Kubica, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Good Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abbie awakens in a daze with no memory of who she is or how she landed in this unsettling condition. The man by her side claims to be her husband. He's a titan of the tech world, the founder of one of Silicon Valley's most innovative start-ups. He tells Abbie that she is a gifted artist, an avid surfer, a loving mother to their young son, and the perfect wife. He says she had a terrible accident five years ago and that, through a huge technological breakthrough, she has been brought back from the abyss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a miracle of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Abbie pieces together memories of her marriage, she begins to question her husband's motives--and his version of events. Can she trust him when he says he wants them to be together forever? And what &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; happened to her, half a decade ago?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware the man who calls you . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PERFECT WIFE&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>EDGAR ALLAN POE mangles classic tales and brand new stories in this cross between Drunk History and Tales from the Crypt! A comedic collection of Edgar Allan Poe's sickest stories, adapted by comics' snarkiest talents, and original stories--all introduced by Poe at his drunkest. Collecting all of the comics from the 6-issue AHOY Comics series, plus prose, a puzzle, and poetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A zany look at horror through the weird interpretive lens of a drunk Edgar Allan Poe as your guide through classic tales of the macabre." -- io9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Snifter of Terror is the EC Comics-meets-Mad Magazine book you'll want to read." -- PC MAG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A tantalizing new collection of frightful stories ..... It's a refreshing measure of the macabre from some of the genre's top talent, with a unique twist on the source material."-- SYFY WIRE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What do you get when you mix Edgar Allan Poe, syphilis, breakfast cereal, and a barnacle? Sounds like a joke with a terrible punchline, but in this case, the result is splendid. Edgar Allan Poe's Snifter of Terror #1 provides the world with all of that and so much more." -- FANBASE PRESS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"'Dark Chocolate' by Russell and Snejbjerg is...an absolute work of genius. If ever there needed to be one sole reason to check this book out, it's this story. It's no secret that Mark Russell is a great writer and can turn just about any idea into solid gold, but this story about a vampire who is renowned for his breakfast cereals is fantastic. Russell's wit is all over the tale and Snejbjerg's cartoonish style works perfectly with the tone." -- ADVENTURES IN POOR TASTE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We're suckers for a great anthology, and the creator list AHOY has put together here is beyond amazing." -- COMICS BEAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Exploring hilariously dark tales of suspense, shock and horror, this is one ghoulishly excellent comic you won't want to miss!" -- IMPULSE GAMER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A great, fun read." -- COMICON&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Fun and creepy in all the right ways." -- FANDOM POST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Absolutely hysterical." -- READING WITH A FLIGHT RING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Writer Rachel Pollack brings together the eerie tones of the original, with some opium flavored humor to make silly jokes at Poe's expense. Rick Geary's renditions of Victorian-era art, with Michael Garland's colors, perfectly captures the gothic ambiance with comedic expressions."-- EVERYTHING ACTION</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The first novel in Mollie Cox Bryan's brand new mystery series, set in the Blue Ridge Mountains, will keep you guessing until the cows come home . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas is a time for new beginnings, so after her big breakup, Brynn MacAlister takes the gouda with the bad. With her three Red Devon cows, she settles in bucolic Shenandoah Springs, eager for a new life as an organic micro-dairy farmer and cheese-maker. Then her dear cow Petunia's bellows set the whole town on edge. But it isn't until Brynn's neighbor, Nancy, dies in a mysterious fire that her feelings about small town life begin to curdle . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems some folks were not happy with Nancy's plan to renovate the Old Glebe Church. But is a fear of change a motivation for murder? As a newcomer, Brynn can't ignore the strange events happening just on the other side of her frosty pasture--and soon on her very own farm. Suddenly Christmas doesn't feel so festive as everyone demands she muzzle sweet Petunia, and Brynn is wondering if someone wants to silence her--for good . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Mollie Cox Bryan's mysteries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;This holiday season, teddy bear shop manager Sasha Silverman must solve the slaying of Santa Bear . . . &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sasha and her sister Maddie are thrilled that the Silver Bear Shop and Factory has won the Teddy Bear Keepsake Contest, which means they get to produce a holiday specialty toy, a wizard bear named "Beary Potter." Promising to be just as magical is Silver Hollow's annual tree-lighting ceremony and village parade. Only one hitch: the parade's mascot, Santa Bear--played by Mayor Cal Bloom--is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a frantic search among the floats, Bloom is found dead. When the outfit is removed, it's clear the mayor's been electrocuted. Who zapped hizzoner and then stuffed him into his Santa Bear suit? While the police investigate the grisly crime, Sasha attempts to track down the murderer herself, with some help from the Guilty Pleasures Gossip Club. Can they wrap up this case in time for Christmas--or will Sasha meet her own shocking end?</description>

  <description>The day that etched Charles Manson into the mind of the world's collective consciousness was Friday, August 8th, 1969. That was the fateful weekend when Manson's alleged cult named the "Manson Family" slaughtered seven people. It wasn't the first time the group had committed murder, nor would it be the last, but the events of that weekend are why Charlie Manson will be remembered as the devil incarnate. A real-life boogeyman capable of untold evil. A maniacal puppet master who carved a swastika in his head with a razor blade. Ironically, the first murder of Manson's infamous crime spree was one of poor timing. Steven Parent was an eighteen-year-old California native whose freshman yearbook photo looks remarkably like Buddy Holly. The oldest of five, Steven was raised in El Monte, a city east of Los Angles. His family was working class and being the eldest, Steven was ambitious. His father had nurtured Steve's love of electronics and by the summer of 1969, Steven was working two jobs with plans to attend community college in the fall. On the evening August 8th, just after 11:00 pm, Steven had closed up shop at his second job at Jonas Miller Stereo and driven through Los Angeles to visit an acquaintance who lived in a guest house at the far end of a secluded property in Beverly Hills. The property was located at 10050 Cielo Drive. It was where Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate now lived. A place they rented from the Beach Boys Promoter, Terry Melcher who was dating Candice Bergen at the time. For 50 years the legendary Manson Family Murders have fascinated and mortified that such brutal acts of cold blooded murder could have taken place and with women playing a key role those murders. Manson was an enigmatic drifter who could draw in a group of people into his web of deceit and evil that eventually led to the brutal Tate and then Labianca murders. The prosecution would go on to spin what was considered the de-facto theory behind the murder spree and the world bought into the Helter Skelter conspiracy. Now for the first time Documentary film producer and author James Buddy Day takes readers through a more rational and believable set of reasons for the murders. In 2017 Buddy Day produced the award winning Documentary The Final Words https: //&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-pty-pty_extension&amp;amp;hsimp=yhs-pty_extension&amp;amp;hspart=pty&amp;amp;p=the+last+words+of+charles+manson#id=1&amp;amp;vid=f4637ff0583b2243bb79eacbbc07f61e&amp;amp;action=click" rel="nofollow"&gt;video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=...&lt;/a&gt; which brought together some of the true motivations of Manson and his followers. With first account interviews it becomes apparent that revenge and happenstance are more likely to have played key roles in the murders rather than the myth behind A Race War as forwarded by Bugliosi the prosectuing attourney and originator of the now famous book Helter Skelter which captivated audience the world over.James Buddy Day in the last author to have interviewed Charles Manson to get his perspective on what the prosecution and his conviction for murder when he was forty miles away when both acts were committed. The book will appeal to readers searching for facts and truths about the most iconic mass murder in the 20th century. You will get to know Manson through the pages of this book. Descriptions and interviews are very graphic and the material may not be suitable for some people.</description>

  <description>Great Expectations has it all: romance, mystery, comedy, and unforgettable characters woven through a gripping rags-to-riches tale. Naive Pip, creepy Miss Haversham, beautifully cold Estella, terrifying Abel Magwitch, and the rest of Dicken’s fantastic cast are perfectly envisioned in this new adaptation in this 300-plus page volume featuring artwork by artist Nokman Poon. Manga Classics editions feature classic stories, faithfully adapted and illustrated in manga style, and available in both hardcover and softcover editions. Proudly presented by UDON Entertainment and Morpheus Publishing.</description>

Though she meets with further abuse, she receives an education, and eventually takes a job as a governess at the estate of Edward Rochester.

When Jane uncovers the terrible secret Rochester has been hiding, she flees and finds temporary refuge at the home of St. John Rivers.</description>

  <description>Impulsive Marianne Dashwood and cautious Elinor are as different as two sisters could be, yet both are shattered by their father's sudden Death. Elinor's attachment to the reserved Edward Ferrars is torn asunder by family opposition and his own dark secret, while Marianne's brilliant romance with the dashing John Willoughby comes to a tumultuous end in a devastating public betrayal. Can the two sisters overcome these trials to find true, lasting happiness?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Austen's beloved first novel, filled with romance, redemption and social critique, is brought to life for a modern audience in this gorgeous manga-style adaptation!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller from Emmy Award-winning actor Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is shocked by the six-eyed alien strolling around the Universal back lot. The tourists just think he’s part of the show. It doesn’t take long for Buddy to land a role on a popular TV show, playing (of course) an alien. He becomes an overnight heartthrob and is suddenly faced with legions of adoring fans, rides in glamorous limos, and appearances at “all-the-shrimp-you-can-eat” red carpet parties. But can Buddy maintain his secret identity while in the spotlight?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One pet crow fights to save humanity from an apocalypse in this uniquely hilarious debut from a genre-bending literary author.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S.T., a domesticated crow, is a bird of simple pleasures: hanging out with his owner Big Jim, trading insults with Seattle's wild crows (those idiots), and enjoying the finest food humankind has to offer: Cheetos ®.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Big Jim's eyeball falls out of his head, and S.T. starts to feel like something isn't quite right. His most tried-and-true remedies--from beak-delivered beer to the slobbering affection of Big Jim's loyal but dim-witted dog, Dennis--fail to cure Big Jim's debilitating malady. S.T. is left with no choice but to abandon his old life and venture out into a wild and frightening new world with his trusty steed Dennis, where he discovers that the neighbors are devouring each other and the local wildlife is abuzz with rumors of dangerous new predators roaming Seattle. Humanity's extinction has seemingly arrived, and the only one determined to save it is a foul-mouthed crow whose knowledge of the world around him comes from his TV-watching education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hollow Kingdom&lt;/i&gt; is a humorous, big-hearted, and boundlessly beautiful romp through the apocalypse and the world that comes after, where even a cowardly crow can become a hero.</description>

  <description>This is the astonishing true story of three teenage Dutch girls, Hannie Schaft and sisters Truus and Freddie Oversteegen, that has inspired many throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands in World War II, these girls took up arms against the enemy by seducing high-ranking Nazi officers, luring them into the woods and killing them. They provided Jewish children with safe houses and gathered vital intelligence for the resistance. They did what they did "because it had to be done." Above all, they tried to remain human in inhuman circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannie Schaft was executed by the Nazis three weeks before the end of the war and became the icon of female Dutch resistance. Truus and Freddie Oversteegen survived the war, but were forever haunted by the demons of their past.</description>

  <description>It’s not your typical family vacation when Olive, and her adopted siblings Darwin and Charlotte find themselves falling into other worlds as they explore Grandma Lupé’s strange hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPEN THE DOOR. ADVENTURE AWAITS. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Olive and her adopted siblings Charlotte and Darwin are spending the summer with their estranged grandma at her creepy hotel and it’s all work and no play. They’re stuck inside doing boring chores but they soon stumble upon an incredible secret... Behind each room door of the hotel lies a portal to a different strange and mysterious place. The simple turn of a knob transports them to a distant magical world filled with space pirates. Behind the next door are bearded wizards. Down the hall is a doorway to a cotton-candied kingdom. But once the doors are opened, worlds start colliding, and only one family can save them before they tear themselves apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Written by Terry Blas (The Amazing World of Gumball) and illustrated by the talented Claudia Aguirre (Kim &amp;amp; Kim), this world-hopping fantasy tale breaks down the door to imagination and dares you to embrace the idea that family is everything. </description>

  <description>"The lights took him."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the seven-year-old grandson of U.S. Senator vanishes in the woods behind his home, the only witness is his older brother who whispers, “The lights took him,” and then never speaks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the FBI and National Guard launch a massive search, the boys' grandmother Lynn Roseworth fears only she knows the truth. But coming forward would ruin her family and her husband’s political career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1960s, before she became the quiet wife of a politician, Lynn was a secretary in the astronomy department at the University of Illinois. It was there where she began taking mysterious messages for one of the professors; messages from people desperate to find their missing loved ones who vanished into beams of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to find her beloved grandson and expose the truth, she must return to the work she once abandoned to unravel the existence of a place long forgotten by the world. It is there, buried deep beneath the bitter snow and the absent memories of its inhabitants, where her grandson may finally be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are forces that wish to silence her. And Lynn will find how far they will go to stop her, and how the truth about her own forgotten childhood could reveal the greatest mystery of all time.</description>

  <description>Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age.&lt;br /&gt;Ross Poldark returns to Cornwall from war, looking forward to a joyful homecoming with his family and his beloved Elizabeth. But instead he discovers that his father has died, his home is overrun by livestock and drunken servants, and Elizabeth, having believed Ross dead, is now engaged to his cousin. Ross must start over, building a completely new path for his life, one that takes him in exciting and unexpected directions...&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that listeners will not soon forget.</description>

  <description>1 hour, 30 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of THE DEAD WILL TELL comes a new short story delving into Chief of Police Kate Burkholder's past and her Amish roots.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's autumn in Painter's Mill, and fourteen-year-old Kate Burkholder is picking apples in Miller's Orchard when her best friend Mattie arrives to help. The two girls enjoy themselves laughing and gossiping when suddenly Billy Marquardt and his gang of friends interrupts them. While Kate knows better than to associate with the English boys, Mattie flirts shamelessly before disappearing with Billy. When she returns, the smell of cigarette smoke clings to her clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moments later, the Millers’ barn is consumed by fire and Kate suspects Mattie had &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; to do with the blaze. While Mattie denies it, Kate's penchant for crime novels spurs her to begin her own investigation—but will their friendship survive what she finds?</description>

  <description>Things are looking great for Alex Cross. He is in love with a very special woman, and even a series of ghastly murders he's investigating can't diminish his happiness. Cross' pursuit of the killer quickly produces a suspect -- a British diplomat named Geoffrey Shaffer. However, proving that Shaffer is the murderer is a difficult challenge. The diplomat engages in a brilliant series of surprising counter moves, in and out of court, and Cross and his fiancee become the targets of a deadly cabal of killers masterminded by Shaffer. "Pop! Goes the Weasel" is James Patterson at the peak of his power. It's his most dynamic and powerful psychological thriller to date. Here is a villain no listener will forget, a love story of great tenderness, and a plot of relentless suspense and heart-pounding pace.Alex Cross faces a complex and formidable villain who threatens to destroy everything Cross holds dear.</description>

  <description>Lena and Campbell aren't friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lena has her killer style, her awesome boyfriend, and a plan. She knows she's going to make it big. Campbell, on the other hand, is just trying to keep her head down and get through the year at her new school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When both girls attend the Friday-night football game, what neither expects is for everything to descend into sudden mass chaos. Chaos born from violence and hate. Chaos that unexpectedly throws them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren't friends. They hardly understand the other's point of view. But none of that matters when the city is up in flames, and they only have each other to rely on if they're going to survive the night.</description>

  <description>When eleven-year-old Ollie lost her mother in a plane crash, she sought solace in her books. So when she stumbles upon a distraught woman standing on the banks of the river intent on throwing a book into the water, Ollie stops her, steals the book and rides away on her bike. Upon reading, Ollie discovers a chilling ghost story about a girl, Elizabeth Morrison, who is being chased through cornfields filled with scarecrows by two brothers with deadly intent. When she finds the graves of Elizabeth Morrison and her tormentors, Jonathan and Caleb, on a farm during a school trip, on a day already full of odd occurrences, Ollie starts to think this book is more than just a book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the ride home, the school bus breaks down along the side of the road and none of the kids or their teacher can get service on their cell phones to call for help. And then Ollie's digital wristwatch starts a mysterious countdown, with the word RUN spelled out on the face. She and two unlikely new friends are the only ones to heed its warning. As night begins to fall, they head out into the woods, bracketed by fearsome scarecrows. The bus driver gives them a word of advice. In order to survive whatever is coming, they'll need to keep to small spaces.</description>

  <description>As a child, Abby had the same recurring nightmare night after night, in which she wandered through a field ridden with human skulls and bones. Now an adult, Abby thinks she's outgrown her demons, until, the evening before her wedding, the terrible dream returns and forces her to confront the dark secrets from her past she has kept from her new husband, Willem. The following day--less than 24 hours after exchanging vows--Abby steps out into traffic. As his wife lies in her hospital bed, sleeping in fits and starts, Willem tries to determine whether this was an absentminded accident or a premeditated plunge, and he quickly discovers a mysterious set of clues about what his wife might be hiding. Why, for example is there a rash-like red mark circling her wrist? What does she dream about that causes her to wake from the sound of her own screams?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly, Abby begins to open up to her husband, revealing to him what she has never shared with anyone before--the story of a terrified mother; a jealous, drug addled father; and a daughter's terrifying captivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a suspenseful, alternating narrative that travels between the present and Abby's tortured childhood, &lt;i&gt;The Pursuit&lt;/i&gt; is a meticulously crafted, deeply disquieting tale that showcases Oates's masterful storytelling.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Tricks and treats keep the Halloween spirit alive in coastal Maine. But this year the haunted house theme is getting carried a little too far . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;HAUNTED HOUSE MURDER by LESLIE MEIER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Newcomers to Tinker’s Cove, Ty and Heather Moon have moved into a dilapidated house reputed to be a haven for ghosts. Now strange noises and flickering lights erupt from the house at all hours and neighborly relations are on edge. And when a local boy goes missing near the house, it’s up to Lucy Stone to unravel the mystery of the eccentric couple and their increasingly frightful behavior.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;DEATH BY HAUNTED HOUSE by LEE HOLLIS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the past two years, the house next door to Hayley Powell has sat abandoned after the owner died under mysterious circumstances. The Salinger family has recently taken possession of the property, but the realtor behind the deal has vanished—after a very public and angry argument with Damien Salinger. If Bar Harbor’s newest neighbors are murderers, Hayley will haunt them until they confess.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;HALLOWED OUT by BARBARA ROSS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With its history of hauntings and ghost sightings, Busman’s Harbor is the perfect setting for Halloween festivities. But when a reenactment of a Prohibition-era gangster’s murder ends with a literal bang and a dead actor from New Jersey, Julia Snowden must identify a killer before she ends up sleeping with the fishes.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;There’s nothing like home sweet home in this trio of Halloween tales . . .&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Hester Thursby has given up using her research skills to trace people who don’t want to be found. A traumatic case a few months ago unearthed a string of violent crimes, and left Hester riddled with&lt;br /&gt;self-doubt and guilt. Caring for a four-year-old is responsibility enough in a world filled with terrors Hester never could have imagined before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finisterre Island, off the coast of Maine, is ruggedly beautiful and remote—the kind of place tourists love to visit, though rarely for long. But not everyone who comes to the island is welcome. A dilapidated Victorian house has become home to a group of squatters and junkies, and strangers have a habit of bringing trouble with them. A young boy disappeared during the summer, and though he was found safely, the incident stirred suspicion among locals. Now another child is missing. Summoned to the island by a cryptic text, Hester discovers a community cleaning up from a devastating storm—and uncovers a murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Soon Hester begins to connect the crime and the missing children. And as she untangles the secrets at the center of the small community, she finds grudges and loyalties that run deep, poised to converge with a force that will once again shake her convictions about the very nature of right and wrong . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRAISE FOR &lt;i&gt;THE MISSING ONES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A brilliantly composed mystery…a hurricane of suspense with squalls of twists that’ll just take your breath away. A salty, stormy and seductive read.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mario Giordano, author of Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions and Auntie Poldi and the Vineyards of Etna&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Darkly textured and gorgeously twisted, this atmospheric novel of suspense proves Edwin Hill is a major talent. A master class in setting and character, and with penetrating psychological insight, this story is seamless and surprising and devastating—as turbulent and unpredictable as a New England gale."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hank Phillippi Ryan, best-selling and award-winning author of THE MURDER LIST</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;This Christmas, lawyer Andy Carpenter and his golden retriever, Tara, can't say no to helping young Danny and his dachshund, Murphy. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lawyer Andy Carpenter and his wife, Laurie, have started a new Christmas tradition. Their local pet store has a Christmas tree, where instead of ornaments there are wishes from those in need. One poignant wish leads Andy to a child named Danny, whose selfless plea strikes a chord. Danny asked Santa for a coat for his mother, a sweater for his dachshund, Murphy, and for the safe return of his missing father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out Danny's father doesn't want to be found, he's on the run after just being arrested for a murder that took place fourteen years ago - a murder that Danny's mother swears he didn't commit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his trademark humor and larger-than-life characters - including a police officer and his K-9 partner, Simon - Rosenfelt never fails to deliver as Andy and his eccentric crew dash to reunite a family in time for Christmas.</description>

  <description>Autumn has arrived on the shores of Lake Michigan, but Marlee Jacob, proprietor of The Berry Basket, is feeling a chill for other reasons …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Harvest Health Fair in full swing, Marlee makes sure to stock up on elderberry products for cold and flu season. But this year there's also a run on mulberry when an eccentric customer wants to use the dried berries to ward off evil forces. True, it's almost Halloween, but something else seems to be spooking Leticia the Lake Lady, Oriole Point's oddest resident. She believes someone plans to kill her—and the ghost. Only mulberries can protect them. Marlee doesn't take her fears seriously until a man named Felix Bonaventure arrives in the village, asking questions about a mysterious woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, Marlee finds Bonaventure dead on Leticia's property—shot through the heart with an arrow made of mulberry wood. And Leticia has disappeared. Marlee soon learns the Lake Lady has a deadly past that is connected to the famous Sable family who are in town for the health fair. A bunch of clues start to come together—and figuring out what's going on puts Marlee in a real jam …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes Berry Recipes!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;There's a poltergeist in Joe Quinn's house, and Davie is determined to discover its source in this lively, hopeful graphic storybook from David Almond and Dave McKean.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Quinn has been telling everyone about the poltergeist in his house, but no one believes him. No one, that is, except Davie. Davie's felt the inexplicable presence in the Quinns' house and seen random objects fly through the air. And there's something else . . . a memory of Davie's beloved sister and a feeling deep down that it might just be possible for ghosts to exist. Full of thoughts of hauntings and grief and God, Davie hovers on a precipice of uncertainty and possibility, a space that storyteller David Almond occupies comfortably and returns to again and again -- here paired once more with the dynamic, dreamlike mixed-media art of Dave McKean.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Cloud isn’t just a place to work. It’s a place to live. And when you’re here, you’ll never want to leave.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“On the surface, &lt;i&gt;The Warehouse&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling story of corporate espionage at the highest level, but dig a little deeper and you’ll find a terrifying cautionary tale of the nightmare world we are making for ourselves.”—Blake Crouch, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paxton never thought he’d be working for Cloud, the giant tech company that’s eaten much of the American economy. Much less that he’d be moving into one of the company’s sprawling live-work facilities. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But compared to what’s left outside, Cloud’s bland chainstore life of gleaming entertainment halls, open-plan offices, and vast warehouses…well, it doesn’t seem so bad. It’s more than anyone else is offering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinnia never thought she’d be infiltrating Cloud. But now she’s undercover, inside the walls, risking it all to ferret out the company’s darkest secrets. And Paxton, with his ordinary little hopes and fears? He just might make the perfect pawn. If she can bear to sacrifice him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the truth about Cloud unfolds, Zinnia must gamble everything on a desperate scheme—one that risks both their lives, even as it forces Paxton to question everything about the world he’s so carefully assembled here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, they’ll learn just how far the company will go…to make the world a better place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in the confines of a corporate panopticon that’s at once brilliantly imagined and terrifyingly real, &lt;i&gt; The Warehouse &lt;/i&gt; is a near-future thriller about what happens when Big Brother meets Big Business--and who will pay the ultimate price.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this electrifying thriller by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Linda Castillo, Kate Burkholder must uncover a family's long-hidden past to solve a brutal murder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a tornado tears through Painters Mill and unearths human remains, Chief of Police Kate Burkholder finds herself tasked with the responsibility of identifying the bones--and notifying the family. Evidence quickly emerges that the death was no accident and Kate finds herself plunged into a thirty year old case that takes her deep into the Amish community to which she once belonged. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, turmoil of an emotional and personal nature strikes at the very heart of Kate's budding relationship with state agent John Tomasetti.

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Between the bustling local bakery, helpful neighbors, and down-home wisdom, Sugar Lake is a delicious place to call home--and love is the sweetest risk . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandrea Gale put her acting career on hold to help keep her family's bakery in business--and gave it a few eye-catching updates while she was at it. To earn money to return to New York, she puts her designs skills to work with a job renovating a once thriving local vintage theater. But Alexandrea didn't bargain on the owner's business-minded grandson fighting her every step of the way--or proving so unexpectedly irresistible . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the new president of his family's real estate business, Kellen Kilborn feels that selling the theater is the only way to do right by the grandmother who helped raise him. He just can't take a risk on Alexandrea's inventive ideas--but he also can't walk away from her warm-hearted free spirit. As troubling decisions threaten to tear them apart, can they create a way to turn their dreams into the sweetest of futures together?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the Sugar Lake series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Readers will love [these] warm, witty characters who remind us all that happiness and love come only when we're brave enough to follow our hearts."&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; --Jamie Beck, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;When You Knew&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Perfectly captures the charm and enchantment of a small Southern town." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Farrah Rochon, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“By some uncanny act of artistic appropriation, [Clinch] has, without imitating Dickens, entered into the phantasmagoric realm that is the great novelist’s quintessential territory…Startling and creative…Remarkable… Masterly.” —&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Finn &lt;/i&gt;comes a masterful reimagining of Dickens’s classic &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol &lt;/i&gt;with this darkly entertaining exploration of the relationship between Ebenezer Scrooge and Jacob Marley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Marley was dead, to begin with,” Charles Dickens tells us at the beginning of &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol.&lt;/i&gt; But in Jon Clinch’s ingenious novel, Jacob Marley, business partner to Ebenezer Scrooge, is very much alive: a rapacious and cunning boy who grows up to be a forger, a scoundrel, and the man who will be both the making and the undoing of Scrooge.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They meet as youths in the gloomy confines of Professor Drabb’s Academy for Boys, where Marley begins their twisted friendship by initiating the innocent Scrooge into the gentle art of extortion. Years later, in the dank heart of London, their shared ambition manifests itself in a fledgling shipping empire. Between Marley’s genius for deception and Scrooge’s brilliance with numbers, they amass a considerable fortune of dubious legality, all rooted in a pitiless commitment to the soon-to-be-outlawed slave trade.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Marley toys with the affections of Scrooge’s sister, Fan, Scrooge falls under the spell of Fan’s best friend, Belle Fairchild. Now, for the first time, Scrooge and Marley find themselves at cross-purposes. With their business interests inextricably bound together and instincts for secrecy and greed bred in their very bones, the two men engage in a shadowy war of deception, false identities, forged documents, theft, and cold-blooded murder. Marley and Scrooge are destined to clash in an unforgettable reckoning that will echo into the future and set the stage for Marley’s ghostly return.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meticulously crafted and beguilingly told, &lt;i&gt;Marley&lt;/i&gt; revisits and illuminates one of Charles Dickens’s most cherished works to spellbinding effect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The third book in an amazing series that features crime à la library at America's most famous institution of higher reading. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note from bartender Brian McNulty, Raymond Ambler’s friend, confidant, and sometimes adviser, sets the librarian sleuth off on a murder investigation, one that he pursues reluctantly until a second murder upends the world as he knows it. The second victim is a lady friend of McNulty’s—and the prime suspect is McNulty himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ambler pursues his investigation, he discovers that the murdered woman had a double life. Her intermittent visits to the city—a whirlwind of reckless drinking and illicit liaisons with men she met in the cocktail lounges—had their counterpart in suburban Fairfield County Connecticut where, as Dr. Sandra Dean, she practiced dermatology and lived in a gated community with a doting husband and a young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Ambler looks into the past of Dr. Sandra Dean to understand the murder of Shannon Darling in the present, NYPD homicide detective Mike Cosgrove investigates the men in Shannon Darling’s life. She might have been murdered because she frustrated the wrong man. It could have been a jealous wife. In fact, any number of people might have murdered Shannon Darling. Or, as Ambler suspects, did someone murder Dr. Sandra Dean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, no matter which way he turns, McNulty emerges as a suspect. Ambler’s dilemma seems insurmountable: Should he keep searching for the truth behind the murders if the deeper he probes, the more evidence he finds that points to the morally rumpled bartender as a murderer?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; In this sequel to the critically-acclaimed novel that grabbed fans of X-Files and Stranger Things, Jeremy Finley returns with another thriller full of aliens and government cover-ups. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For most of his life, William Chance has been the living proof that his grandmother and her fellow researchers into missing people were right all along about the terror from the stars. Now, he’s avoiding the limelight and hiding out from everyone, including his family. He knows he can avoid everything, except for the nightmares: fires, storms, disease and violence – he dreams of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he’s suddenly exposed, he finds that the media, government operatives and renegade true believers are desperate to find him, but he has another mission. Joined by a girl with terrifying abilities, he begins a desperate journey across the United States to find the others who share his dreams to stop what could be the final days of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeremy Finley’s debut &lt;i&gt;The Darkest Time of Night &lt;/i&gt;was called “outstanding” in a starred review from &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;and was a June 2018 SIBA Okra Selection. Now, he continues the story of Lynn and William, fifteen years later in a new fast-paced novel full of suspense and government cover-ups, perfect for thriller and supernatural fans alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;“sharp, scary, gorgeously evocative tale of love, art, and obsession” (Paula Hawkins, #1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;), a beautiful young artist in Victorian London is stalked by an insane collector of curiosities who may also be a serial killer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1850s London, the Great Exhibition is being erected in Hyde Park and, among the crowd watching the dazzling spectacle, two people meet by happenstance. For Iris, an arrestingly attractive aspiring artist, it is a brief and forgettable moment but for Silas, a curiosity collector enchanted by all things strange and beautiful, the meeting marks a new beginning.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Iris is asked to model for Pre-Raphaelite artist Louis Frost, she agrees on the condition that he will also teach her to paint. Suddenly, her world begins to expand beyond her wildest dreams—but she has no idea that evil is waiting in the shadows. Silas has only thought of one thing since that chance meeting, and his obsession is darkening by the day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“A page-turning psychological thriller” (Essie Fox, author of &lt;i&gt;The Somnambulist&lt;/i&gt;) that will haunt you long after you finish it, &lt;i&gt;The Doll Factory&lt;/i&gt; is perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Alienist&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Drood&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Historian&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who or what is responsible for the gruesome deaths of members of the secret society known as the Order of Osiris?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Armiston, an irascible, confirmed bachelor who believes in medicine not mysticism, is certain the deaths are only tragic accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The members of the Order of Osiris suspect something more sinister is at work. They profess to believe an ancient curse has been visited upon their society. Handsome and mysterious Captain Maxwell requests Armiston’s help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarot cards? Egyptology? Spiritualism? Armiston has little patience with the superficial and silly pastimes of the rich, but he does love a good puzzle. Or could it be that he is more drawn to young Captain Maxwell than he wishes to admit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, Armiston must solve the secret of the cursed sarcophagus very soon, for Captain Maxwell is the next slated to die…</description>

  <description>There is a stranger outside Caroline's house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her spectacular new beach house, built for hosting expensive parties and vacationing with the family she thought she'd have. But her husband is lying to her and everything in her life is upside down, so when the stranger, Aiden, shows up as a bartender at the same party where Caroline and her husband have a very public fight, it doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As her marriage collapses around her and the lavish lifestyle she's built for herself starts to crumble, Caroline turns to Aiden for comfort...and revenge. After a brief and desperate fling that means nothing to Caroline and everything to him, Aiden's obsession with Caroline, her family, and her house grows more and more disturbing. And when Caroline's husband goes missing, her life descends into a nightmare that leaves her accused of her own husband's murder.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Charlene Morris knew Salem, Massachusetts had a spooky reputation. But when she decided to open her B&amp;amp;B there, she expected guests--not ghosts...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A grieving young widow, Charlene needed a new start--so she bought a historic mansion, sight unseen, and drove from Chicago to New England to start turning it into a bed-and-breakfast. On her first night in the house, she awakens to find a handsome man with startling blue eyes in her bedroom. Terror turns to utter disbelief when he politely introduces himself as Jack Strathmore--and explains that he used to live here--when he was alive. He firmly believes that someone pushed him down the stairs three years ago, and he won't be able to leave until someone figures out who. If Charlene wants to get her business up and running in time for the Halloween tourist rush, and get this haunting houseguest out of the way, she'll have to investigate. Though truth be told, this ghost is starting to grow on her . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Soon to be a Netflix original series!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lady of the Lake is the true hero in this cinematic twist on the tale of King Arthur created by Thomas Wheeler and legendary artist, producer, and director Frank Miller (300, Batman: The Dark Night Returns, Sin City). Featuring 8 full color and 30 black-and-white pieces of original artwork by Frank Miller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whosoever wields the Sword of Power shall be the one true King.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if the Sword has chosen a Queen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimue grew up an outcast. Her connection to dark magic made her something to be feared in her Druid village, and that made her desperate to leave…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until her entire village is slaughtered by Red Paladins, and Nimue’s fate is forever altered. Charged by her dying mother to reunite an ancient sword with a legendary sorcerer, Nimue is now her people’s only hope. Her mission leaves little room for revenge, but the growing power within her can think of little else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimue teams up with a charming mercenary named Arthur and refugee Fey Folk from across England. She wields a sword meant for the one true king, battling paladins and the armies of a corrupt king. She struggles to unite her people, avenge her family, and discover the truth about her destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But perhaps the one thing that can change Destiny itself is found at the edge of a blade.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In the newest mystery from nationally bestselling author Joanna Carl, a dive into house flipping becomes a deadly flop....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a house near Lee and Joe's home goes up for sale, the couple teams up with Lee's aunt and uncle, Nettie and Hogan, to buy it, remodel it, and resell it for a sweet profit. But after the owners of the house, the Baileys, accept their offer, a local developer, Richard "Spud" Dirk, suddenly swoops in with a higher one, and it seems their dreams might be snatched away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee, never as passionate about the plan as her husband and uncle, is anxious to get back to focusing on managing TenHuis Chocolade. But when a long-hidden gun is found behind a pipe in the Baileys' basement, she begins to suspect a mystery is afoot. And when Spud turns up dead in the Baileys' carport a few days later, it becomes clear there's something rotten at the foundation....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To solve the murder, Lee will have to strip away layers of secrets--that is, if someone doesn't level her first....</description>

  <description>Listening Length: 8 hours, 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The author of &lt;i&gt;Black Cat Crossing&lt;/i&gt; is back as mystery novelist Sabrina Tate and her cat Hitchcock find themselves roped into another dangerous murder case...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sabrina finds it difficult to work on her latest suspense novel when her Aunt Rowe’s antics keep tying up her thoughts. This time Rowe and her fun-loving friends have decided to compete in the upcoming Texas Hill Country Senior Pro Rodeo. The problem is these women have little to no experience with lassos, bulls, or even horseback riding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Before Sabrina can keep the stubborn seniors from mounting their steeds, she’s sidetracked by a bigger problem. An uppity local business owner is found dead in an accident—right after a black cat was seen in her office. While the townsfolk think the bad luck cat has struck again, Sabrina suspects there might be something more murderous afoot. With a twisted killer on the loose, she’ll have to round up clues quickly before she or her aunt are steered straight into the path of danger...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A timeless, complex story about a young boy, his father, and the the world that comes between them, from the author of &lt;i&gt;The Bully Book&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marlin is not slow or mute; what he is is a stutterer, and that makes it impossible for him to convince people otherwise. What he is also is a Rackham: the youngest son of the world-famous explorer Roland Rackham, renowned for his daring exploits on the dark continents, taming wild beasts, and filling in the blank spaces on the map. Roland is the owner and proprietor of the Zoo at the Edge of the World, a resort where the well-to-do from all over the world can come to experience the last bit of the wild left in the world in the mid-nineteenth century. For Roland, each day is a new opportunity to cast a light into the dark recesses of the world; for Marlin, each day is a struggle: to speak, to communicate, to live up to the lofty expectations that his family name carries. This isn’t easy when the only people who understand him are his father and his pet monkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to impress a powerful duke who comes to visit the Zoo, Marlin’s father ventures into the jungle and brings back a mysterious black jaguar, now the only one in captivity. Everyone is terrified of the jaguar, including Marlin—until one night, when the jaguar confers upon him a powerful gift. Soon Marlin finds himself with a difficult choice to make and, finally, something to say. If only he can figure out how to say it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 CDs / 4.75 Hours</description>

  <description>Confronting Nazi evil is the subject of the latest installment in the mega-bestselling Killing series&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the true horrors of the Third Reich began to be exposed immediately after World War II, the Nazi war criminals who committed genocide went on the run. A few were swiftly caught, including the notorious SS leader, Heinrich Himmler. Others, however, evaded capture through a sophisticated Nazi organization designed to hide them. Among those war criminals were Josef Mengele, the “Angel of Death” who performed hideous medical experiments at Auschwitz; Martin Bormann, Hitler’s brutal personal secretary; Klaus Barbie, the cruel "Butcher of Lyon"; and perhaps the most awful Nazi of all: Adolf Eichmann.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killing the SS is the epic saga of the espionage and daring waged by self-styled "Nazi hunters." This determined and disparate group included a French husband and wife team, an American lawyer who served in the army on D-Day, a German prosecutor who had signed an oath to the Nazi Party, Israeli Mossad agents, and a death camp survivor. Over decades, these men and women scoured the world, tracking down the SS fugitives and bringing them to justice, which often meant death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in the fast-paced style of the Killing series, Killing the SS will educate and stun the listener. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final chapter is truly shocking.</description>

  <description>Midsummer’s Eve, 1648, England is in the grip of a civil war between renegade king and rebellious parliament. The struggle reaches every corner of the kingdom, even the remote tidelands —the marshy landscape of the south coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alinor, a descendant of wisewomen, trapped in poverty and superstition, waits in the graveyard under the full moon for a ghost who will declare her free from her abusive husband. Instead, she meets James, a young man on the run, and shows him the secret ways across the treacherous marsh, not knowing that she is leading disaster into the heart of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspected of possessing dark secrets in superstitious times, Alinor’s ambition and determination mark her out from her neighbors. This is the time of witch mania, and Alinor, a woman without a husband, skilled with herbs, suddenly enriched, arouses envy in her rivals and fear among the villagers, who are ready to take lethal action into their own hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is dangerous for a woman to be different.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Shell and her two furry sidekicks must cat-ch a killer to save their pet shop&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crishell "Shell" McMillan sees the cancellation of her TV series as a blessing in disguise. The former actress can now take over her late aunt's pet shop, the Purr N' Bark, and do something she loves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While getting the shop ready for re-opening, Shell is asked to loan her aunt's Cary Grant posters to the local museum for an exhibit. She finds the prospect exciting—until a museum board member, who had a long-standing feud with Shell's aunt, votes against it. When she discovers the board member dead in the museum, Shell becomes suspect number one. Can she, her Siamese cat Kahlua, and her new sidekick—her aunt's Persian Purrday—find the real culprit, or will her latest career go up in kitty litter?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; The first in the groundbreaking Nora Kelly series from #1 bestselling authors Preston &amp;amp; Child blends the legend of the Donner party with a riveting suspense tale, taking the dynamic duo's work to new heights.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nora Kelly, a young but successful curator with a series of important excavations already under her belt, is approached by the handsome Historian, Clive Benton, to lead an expedition unlike any other. Clive tells his story--one involving the ill-fated Donner Party, who became permanently lodged in the American consciousness in the winter of 1847, when the first skeletonized survivors of the party stumbled out of the California mountains, replete with tales of courage, resourcefulness, bad luck, murder, barbarism--and, finally, starvation and cannibalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captivated by the Donner Party, Nora agrees and they venture into the Sierra Nevada in search of the camp. Quickly, they learn that the discovery of the missing starvation camp is just the tip of the iceberg--and that the real truth behind those long-dead pioneers is not only far more complex and surprising than they could have imagined...but it is one that puts them both in mortal danger from a very real, present-day threat in which the search for the lost party, and its fabled fortune in gold, are merely means to a horrifying end.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>When a man is found dead in a freshly dug grave adjacent to a golf course, Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings arrive on the scene only to be met by a hostile local police detective who is unwilling to share information. But Poirot's methodical investigation slowly and surely reveals the real killer amid a host of suspects and clues, including an impassioned love letter and heavy lead piping found near the body. However, as Poirot and Hastings rush to solve the murder, a similarly slain corpse and fresh clues are discovered.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;'We lost all three girls that summer. Let them slip away like the words of some half-remembered song and when one came back, she wasn't the one we were trying to recall to begin with.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So begins Tikka Molloy's recounting of the summer of 1992 - the summer the Van Apfel sisters, Hannah, the beautiful Cordelia and Ruth - disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven and one-sixth years old, Tikka is the precocious narrator of this fabulously endearing coming-of-age story, set in an eerie Australian river valley suburb with an unexplained stench. The Van Apfel girls vanish from the valley during the school's 'Showstopper' concert, held at the outdoor amphitheatre by the river. While the search for the sisters unites the small community on Sydney's urban fringe, the mystery of their disappearance remains unsolved forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly observed, sharp, lively, funny and entirely endearing, this novel is part mystery, part coming-of-age story - and quintessentially Australian. Think &lt;i&gt;The Virgin Suicides&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Jasper Jones&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Picnic at Hanging Rock&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A curmudgeon and his eccentric new roommate join together to plan an epic escape in this charming, poignant tale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joel lives in a nursing home, and he’s not one bit happy about it. He hates being told when to eat, when to sleep, when to take his pills. He’s fed up with life and begins to plan a way out when his new roommate, a retired soap opera actor named Frank, moves in and turns the nursing-home community upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the two men couldn’t be more opposite, a fast friendship is formed when Frank is the only one who listens to and stands up for Joel. When he tells Frank about his burgeoning plan, they embark together on a mission to find the perfect escape, and along the way will discover that it’s never too late for new beginnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with colorful characters, sparkling humor and deep emotion, &lt;em&gt;The Great Unexpected&lt;/em&gt; is the story of friendship, finding oneself later in life and experiencing newfound joy in the most unexpected places.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Sabrina Tate and her cat, Hitchcock, must sort through the clues when a librarian is killed and justice is overdue . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With construction on the town’s new library nearing completion, mystery writer Sabrina Tate is thrilled that local book lovers, and her own forthcoming novel, will soon have a fresh new home. But tensions are rising at the site as the headstrong new librarian insists on telling the construction crew how to do their jobs, bringing work to a standstill. When Sabrina’s cat unearths the dead body of the librarian not long after—and a good friend’s husband is named as the main suspect—she finds herself being pulled into a murder investigation yet again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While virtually all the workers at the site had a motive to commit the dark deed, Sabrina turns her attention to the victim’s background looking for clues, but hits a dead end when she can’t locate any of the woman’s family. As a string of planted evidence and a murky collection of malicious characters starts to surface, Sabrina knows she and Hitchcock will have to tread carefully, before the library killer decides to check them out for good . . . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Includes delicious dessert recipes!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for the Bad Luck Cat Mysteries:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“I loved every page of &lt;i&gt;Black Cat Crossing&lt;i&gt;, and I can’t wait for a return visit to Lavender.” &lt;br /&gt;—Miranda James, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Black Cat Crossing&lt;i&gt; has everything a cozy mystery reader could want—intrigue, memorable characters, a small-town setting, and even a few mouthwatering recipes . . . A purr-fectly cozy read.” &lt;br /&gt;—Ellery Adams, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;“Finch has, yet again, offered a great tale of female and feline that cozy readers will love.” &lt;br /&gt;—&lt;i&gt;Suspense Magazine&lt;i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Author:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kay Finch is the national bestselling author of the Bad Luck Cat Mysteries. Though her character, Sabrina Tate, is a mystery writer who’s left the paralegal profession behind to move to the Texas Hill Country, Kay still works as a paralegal at a Houston law firm. A country girl at heart, Kay grew up on a farm in Pennsylvania, and she loves the huge cattle-filled fields near her Texas home. She resides in a Houston suburb with her husband and rescue pets.

  <description>People are dying at Strong Lake, and the worst is yet to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An idyllic weekend camping trip is cut short when Reese Wallace’s friends are brutally murdered. As the group’s only survivor, Reese is the prime suspect, and his story doesn’t make much sense. A disembodied voice warning him to leave the campground the night before? A strange, blackened tree that gave him an electric shock when he cut it down for firewood?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detective Greyeyes isn’t having any of it―until she hears the voice herself and finds an arrowhead at the crime scene―an arrowhead she can’t get rid of. Troubling visions of a doomed Native American tribe who once called the campground home, and rumors of cursed land and a mythical beast plague the strangest murder case she’s ever been a part of.</description>

  <description>Five years after Ashley King survived the infamous Resort Massacre, she’s found hanging in her basement by her fiancé, Todd Matthews. She left behind clues as to what really happened that night, clues that may reveal the identity of the killer the press has called The Wraith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of his friends, Todd goes back to the crumbling Hayden Resort, a death-tinged ruin in the Catskills Mountains. What they find is a haunted history that’s been lying in wait for a fresh set of victims. The Wraith is back, and he’s nothing what they expected.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When a famous pooch comes to Wagtail for some downtime, inn owner Holly Miller learns that murder never rests in this all-new Paws &amp;amp; Claws mystery in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America's favorite dog comes to pet-friendly Wagtail for some rest and relaxation, but Holly quickly discovers that this perfect pup is a total scamp who takes every opportunity to run off and misbehave. During an outdoor treasure-hunting game, the star dog and Trixie, Holly's beloved Jack Russell terrier, stumble across a dead body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly has more than murder to worry about, though, when a man shows up after reading an article featuring Trixie in a magazine and claims that he is the dog's rightful owner. Holly will need to prove that she is her pup's only parent and catch a killer to restore peace to her pet-loving happy place.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Every town has its secrets, but no one has a secret like hers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber Blackwood, lifelong resident of Edgehill, Oregon, has earned a reputation for being a semi-reclusive odd duck. Her store, The Quirky Whisker, is full of curiosities, from extremely potent sleepy teas and ever-burning candles to kids’ toys that seem to run endlessly without the aid of batteries. The people of Edgehill think of the Quirky Whisker as an integral part of their feline-obsessed town, but most give Amber herself a wide berth. Amber prefers it that way; it keeps her secret safe. But that secret is thrown into jeopardy when Amber’s friend Melanie is found dead, a vial of headache tonic from Amber’s store clutched in her hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Edgehill’s newest police chief has had it out for Amber since he arrived three years before. He can’t possibly know she’s a witch, but his suspicions about her odd store and even odder behavior have shot her to the top of his suspect list. When the Edgehill rumor mill finds out Melanie was poisoned, it’s not only the police chief who looks at Amber differently. Determined to both find justice for her friend and to clear her own name, Amber must use her unique gifts to help track down Melanie’s real killer. A quest that threatens much more than her secret …</description>

  <description>Detective Ulf Varg from the Department of Sensitive Crimes is often called upon to investigate unusual matters. But rarely is he asked to conduct an inquiry on behalf of his own family. Is such a thing ethical? Adding to Ulf’s moral discomfort is the fact that he does not exactly see eye to eye with his younger brother Bjorn—a leading player in one of Sweden’s rightwing parties, the Moderate Extremists. Still, family is family, so Ulf finds himself working to uncover the mole leaking secrets to a rival party, the Extreme Moderates. All of this in addition to his responsibilities to the Department, which include investigating a case of cat-related sabotage. As always, it’s up to Ulf to close the case . . . even if he encounters unexpected resistance from the victims themselves.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From literary master McCall Smith, this is a bewitching short foray, witty and warm, into Scandinavian mystery—Nordic Blanc, that is, not Nordic Noir.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When a baby-only hours old-is discovered on the Amish bishop's front porch in Painter's Mill, Ohio, Chief of Police Kate Burkholder is called in to investigate. The newborn is swaddled in an Amish crib quilt, and the only other item found with the child is a hand-carved wood rattle, which Kate also recognizes as Amish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The little girl seems healthy and whole; but who would abandon her and why? Though the quilt and rattle &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; be purchased, Kate suspects the mother is Amish, possibly young and unmarried, both of which would be powerful motives for such a desperate act. With the rattle and the baby quilt as the only clues, Kate must call upon her own Amish roots, and with the help of state agent John Tomasetti, search the Amish and "English" communities of Painters Mill for clues to unravel the poignant, puzzling mystery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>At 01:23:40 on April 26th 1986, Alexander Akimov pressed the emergency shutdown button at Chernobyl's fourth nuclear reactor. It was an act that forced the permanent evacuation of a city, killed thousands, and crippled the Soviet Union. The event spawned decades of conflicting, exaggerated, and inaccurate stories. This book, the result of five years of research, presents an accessible but comprehensive account of what really happened-from the desperate fight to prevent a burning reactor core from irradiating eastern Europe, to the self-sacrifice of the heroic men who entered fields of radiation so strong that machines wouldn't work, to the surprising truth about the legendary "Chernobyl diver," all the way through to the USSR's final show-trial. The historical narrative is interwoven with a story of the author's own spontaneous journey to Ukraine's still-abandoned city of Pripyat and the wider Chernobyl Zone.</description>

  <description>Everyone in Painters Mill knows the abandoned Hochstetler farm is haunted. But only a handful of the residents remember the terrible secrets lost in the muted/hushed whispers of time—and now death is stalking them, seemingly from the grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On a late-night shift, Chief of Police Kate Burkholder is called to the scene of an apparent suicide—an old man found hanging from the rafters in his dilapidated barn. But evidence quickly points to murder and Kate finds herself chasing a singularly difficult and elusive trail of evidence that somehow points back to the tragedy of that long ago incident. Meanwhile, Kate has moved in with state agent John Tomasetti and for the first time in so long, they're both happy; a bliss quickly shattered when one of the men responsible for the murders of Tomasetti’s family four years ago is found not guilty, and walks away a free man. Will Tomasetti be pulled back to his own haunted past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a second man is found dead—also seemingly by his own hand—Kate discovers a link in the case that sends the investigation in a direction no one could imagine and revealing the horrifying truth of what really happened that terrible night thirty-five years ago, when an Amish father and his four children perished—and his young wife disappeared without a trace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as Kate knows—the past never truly dies . . . in &lt;i&gt;The Dead Will Tell&lt;/i&gt; by Linda Castillo</description>

  <description>An extraordinarily beautiful Amish woman, a dangerous femme fatale, is the central figure in Linda Castillo's &lt;i&gt;Her Last Breath, &lt;/i&gt;a story that reveals a dark side of Painters Mill and its seemingly perfect Amish world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A rainy night, an Amish father returning home with his three children, a speeding car hurtling toward them out of nowhere.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;What at first seems like a tragic, but routine car accident suddenly takes on a more sinister cast as evidence emerges that nothing about the crash is accidental. But who would want to kill an Amish deacon and two of his children? He leaves behind a grieving widow and a young boy who clings to life in the intensive care wing of a hospital, unable to communicate. He may be the only one who knows what happened that night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to find out who killed her best friend's husband and why, Kate begins to suspect she is not looking for a reckless drunk, but instead is on the trail of a cold blooded killer amid the residents of Painter's Mill. It is a search that takes her on a chilling journey into the darkest reaches of the human heart and makes her question everything she has ever believed about the Amish culture into which she was born.</description>

  <description>1 hour, 25 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s autumn in Painters Mill, and Chief of Police Kate Burkholder and John Tomasetti are taking a much-needed vacation at a small bed and breakfast an hour outside of town. After closing a difficult case, they’re looking forward to some down time, but their relaxation is cut short by rumors that the old house where they’re staying is haunted by a girl who disappeared twenty years earlier, leaving nothing behind but some bloody clothes by the river and rumors of a volatile relationship. Swept up in the girl’s story, and a need for justice, Kate and John begin looking into the mysterious disappearance of Angela Blaine.  They discover long-buried secrets—and unravel a mystery with an unexpected outcome.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A tender and terrifying literary horror novel - the author's debut - that tells the story of a family (creators of a haunted house attraction called the Wandering Dark) and the hereditary monsters - both metaphorical and all-too-real - that haunt them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monsters both figurative and &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; literal stalk the Turner family. The youngest child, Noah, narrates the family history: how in the late '60s, his bookish mother Margaret marries Lovecraft-lover Harry against her better judgment. The couple has two daughters - Sydney, born for the spotlight, and the brilliant but awkward Eunice, a natural writer and storyteller. But finances are tight, Margaret and Eunice are haunted by horrific dreams, and Harry starts acting strangely. He becomes obsessed with the construction of an elaborately crafted haunted house attraction, christened the Wandering Dark. The family tries to shield baby Noah from the house's faux horrors, but unbeknownst to them, he's being visited by a furry beast with glowing orange eyes - the same ghastly being glimpsed by both his mother and sister. However, unlike them, Noah decides to let the creature in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he approaches the conclusion of his family's tale, it becomes more and more apparent that there's only one way the story can end: with Noah making the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a group of outcasts with extraordinary abilities comes out of hiding, their clash with a violent society will spark a revolution—or an apocalypse.&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avi Hirsch has always known his daughter was different. But when others with incredible, otherworldly gifts reveal themselves to the world, Avi realizes that her oddness is something more—that she is something more. With this, he has a terrifying revelation: Emmeline is now entering a society where her unique abilities unfairly mark her as a potential threat. And even though he is her father, Avi cannot keep her safe forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmeline soon meets others just like her: Carrie Norris, a teenage girl who can turn invisible . . . but just wants to be seen. Fahima Deeb, a woman with an uncanny knack for machinery . . . but it’s her Muslim faith that makes the U.S. government suspicious of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are the nobody people—ordinary individuals with extraordinary gifts who want one only thing: to live as equals in an America that is gripped by fear and hatred. But the government is passing discriminatory laws. Violent mobs are taking to the streets. And one of their own—an angry young man seething with self-loathing—has used his power in an act of mass violence that has put a new target on the community. The nobody people must now stand together and fight for their future, or risk falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first book of a timely two-part series, The Nobody People is a powerful novel of love and hope in the face of bigotry that uses a world touched by the fantastic to explore our current reality. It is a story of family and community. It is a story of continuing to fight for one another, no matter the odds. It is the story of us.</description>

  <description>Nico, Opal, Tyler, Emma, and Logan survived their worst fears come to life, and saved their tiny Pacific Northwest town of Timbers from a monstrous figment invasion. Now they just want to keep their heads down, enjoy Halloween, and explore the secrets of their mysterious houseboat clubhouse. And also figure out their new Torchbearer responsibilities as keepers of the Darkdeep, an ancient whirlpool hidden in Still Cove that can make both dreams and nightmares into reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a dangerous new breed of figments starts appearing on their own, and the very environment around them begins to spiral out of control, the friends realize they have no idea what they are doing-or how they're supposed to restrain the Darkdeep. They must uncover the pool's origins, as well as those of the freaky Thing in a Jar, a seemingly lifeless green creature Opal believes is communicating with her. To make matters worse, a trashy YouTube series has rolled into town intent on finding the Beast, the legendary local sea monster suddenly stirring up the countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As threats rapidly close in around them, the friends must fight to protect their secrets, defeat new enemies, and save Timbers and all that they love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Told from alternating points of view, this chilling sequel from bestselling duo Ally Condie and Brendan Reichs will once again have readers sleeping with the lights on.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of A Head Full of Ghosts adds an inventive twist to the home invasion horror story in a heart-palpitating novel of psychological suspense that recalls Stephen King’s Misery, Ruth Ware’s In a Dark, Dark Wood, and Jack Ketchum’s cult hit The Girl Next Door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven-year-old Wen and her parents, Eric and Andrew, are vacationing at a remote cabin on a quiet New Hampshire lake. Their closest neighbors are more than two miles in either direction along a rutted dirt road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon, as Wen catches grasshoppers in the front yard, a stranger unexpectedly appears in the driveway. Leonard is the largest man Wen has ever seen but he is young, friendly, and he wins her over almost instantly. Leonard and Wen talk and play until Leonard abruptly apologizes and tells Wen, "None of what’s going to happen is your fault." Three more strangers then arrive at the cabin carrying unidentifiable, menacing objects. As Wen sprints inside to warn her parents, Leonard calls out: "Your dads won’t want to let us in, Wen. But they have to. We need your help to save the world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus begins an unbearably tense, gripping tale of paranoia, sacrifice, apocalypse, and survival that escalates to a shattering conclusion, one in which the fate of a loving family and quite possibly all of humanity are entwined. The Cabin at the End of the World is a masterpiece of terror and suspense from the fantastically fertile imagination of Paul Tremblay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 9 hrs and 25 mins</description>

  <description>When a bullying incident sends twelve-year-old Nico Holland over the edge of a cliff into the icy waters of Still Cove, where no one ever goes, friends Tyler and Ella – and even 'cool kid' Opal – rush to his rescue... only to discover an island hidden in the swirling mists below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shrouded by dense trees and murky tides, the island appears uninhabited, although the kids can't quite shake the feeling that something about it is &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt;. Their suspicions grow when they stumble upon an abandoned houseboat with an array of curiosities inside: odd-looking weapons, unnerving portraits, maps to places they've never heard of, and a glass jar containing something completely unidentifiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the group delves deeper into the unknown, their discoveries – and their lives –begin to intertwine in weird and creepy ways. Something ancient has awakened... and it knows their wishes and dreams – and their darkest, most terrible secrets. Do they have what it takes to face the shadowy things that lurk within their own hearts?</description>

  <description>Police Chief Kate Burkholder is called to the scene of a horrific tragedy on a peaceful Amish farm.&lt;p&gt;The Slabaugh family are model Amish farmers, prosperous and hardworking, with four children and a happy extended family. When the parents and an uncle are found dead in their barn, it appears to be a gruesome accident: methane gas asphyxiation caused by a poorly ventilated cesspit. But in the course of a routine autopsy, the coroner discovers that one of the victims suffered a head wound before death—clearly, foul play was involved. But who would want to make orphans of the Slabaughs’ children? And is this murder somehow related to a recent string of shocking hate crimes against the Amish? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having grown up Amish, Kate is determined to bring the killer to justice. Because the other series of attacks are designated hate crimes, the state sends in agent John Tomasetti, with whom Kate has a long and complex relationship. Together, they search for the link between the crimes—and uncover a dark secret at work beneath the placid surface of this idyllic Amish community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fast-paced, evocative, and intensely suspenseful, Tim Wynne-Jones's latest psychological thriller finds a teenager setting his wits against the frigid wilderness and a menacing crew of escapees.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months after his best friend, Dodge, disappeared near their families' camp in a boat accident, Nate is still haunted by nightmares. He'd been planning to make the treacherous trek to the remote campsite with a friend -- his first time in winter without his survival-savvy father, Burt. But when his friend gets grounded, Nate secretly decides to brave the trip solo in a journey that's half pilgrimage, half desperate hope he will find his missing friend when no one else could. What he doesn't expect to find is the door to the cabin flung open and the camp occupied by strangers: three men he's horrified to realize have escaped from a maximum-security prison. Snowed in by a blizzard and with no cell signal, Nate is confronted with troubling memories of Dodge and a stunning family secret, and realizes that his survival now depends on his wits as much as his wilderness skills. As things spiral out of control, Nate finds himself dealing with questions even bigger than who gets to leave the camp alive.</description>

  <description>After being burned alive by a gang, the Hell Riders, he used to belong to, Eddie Ryder returns as a heavy-metal spouting ghost with a temper that's worse now than when he was alive. At first he is nothing more than a floating presence, depressed he has to spend eternity watching his teenage brother, Carson, and ailing mother struggle without him. Then he develops powers. And he can control electricity. He can conjure the ghostly doppelganger of his motorcycle, Diablo, and fly across the sky, but he can't escape the boundaries of his hometown, Hell Creek. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie decides to exact his revenge on the bikers who killed him. Before he can do more than scare some of the bikers, however, he discovers something even better: he can posses people. He uses this ability to get the gang members to attack each other, and to deliver a message to the current leader, Hank Bowman: Eddie's Coming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spouting fire and lightning from his fingers and screaming heavy metal lyrics as he rides the sky above the town of Hell Creek, he brings destruction down on all those who wronged him, his power growing with every death. Only Eddie's younger brother, Carson, and the police chief's daughter, Ellie, understand what's really happening, and now they have to stop him before he destroys the whole town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the beloved and bestselling author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series comes a lighthearted comedic novel about a Swedish police department tasked with solving the most unusual, complicated, and, often, insignificant crimes.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detectives who work in Malmo Police's Department of Sensitive Crimes take their job very seriously. The lead detective, Ulf Varg, prioritizes his cases above even his dog's mental health. Then there are detectives Anna Bengsdotter, who keeps her relationship with Varg professional even as she realizes she's developing feelings for him . . . or at least for his car, and Carl Holgersson, first to arrive in the morning and last to leave, who would never read his colleagues' personal correspondence--unless it could help solve a crime, of course. Finally, there's Erik Nykvist, who peppers conversations with anecdotes about fly fishing.&lt;br /&gt; Along with an opinionated local police officer named Blomquist, the Department of Sensitive Crimes takes on three extremely strange cases. First, the detectives investigate how and why a local business owner was stabbed . . . in the back of the knee. Next, a young woman's imaginary boyfriend goes missing. And, in the final investigation, Varg must determine whether nocturnal visitations at a local spa have a supernatural element.&lt;br /&gt; Using his renowned wit and warmth, Alexander McCall Smith brings a unique perspective on Scandinavian crime. Equal parts hilarious and heartening, &lt;i&gt;The Department of Sensitive Crimes&lt;/i&gt; is a tour de farce from a literary master.</description>

  <description>Alejandro Padilla isn't superstitious and he doesn't believe the stories that an old sailor doll in a Key West, Florida, museum is haunted. Robert the Doll might look creepy, but that doesn't mean the doll is cursed. So Al ignores the tour guide's warning to ask Robert's permission before taking the doll's photograph. But it isn't long after Al's field trip to the museum that strange things start happening. Al is quick to dismiss the odd occurrences as coincidence and bad luck . . . that is until they become more frequent and more sinister. Is the doll tormenting Al? And if so, what will Al have to do to get him to stop? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every state has its own spine-tingling stories of ghosts and mysterious hauntings grounded in its regional history. The Haunted States of America series uses real-life ghost lore as jumping-off points to new, chilling tales. An author’s note provides historical origins and fascinating facts, but beware: sometimes real life is stranger than fiction.</description>

  <description>Published in January 1922, The Secret Adversary is the second detective fiction&lt;br /&gt;novel by British crime novelist Agatha Christie. The book introduces the&lt;br /&gt;characters of Tommy Beresford and Prudence "Tuppence" Cowley, two out-ofwork twenty-somethings in post-war London. The two agree to form The Young&lt;br /&gt;Adventurers, Ltd, hiring themselves out with the slogan "no reasonable offer&lt;br /&gt;refused." They are quickly enlisted to solve the mysterious disappearance of a&lt;br /&gt;young woman who was entrusted with sensitive diplomatic documents amid the&lt;br /&gt;sinking of the RMS Lusitania. Reviewed positively at the time of its release, the&lt;br /&gt;story maintains its gripping suspense until the very end.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nobody visits Eerie-on-Sea in the winter. Especially not when darkness falls and the wind howls around Maw Rocks and the wreck of the battleship &lt;/i&gt;Leviathan, &lt;i&gt;where even now some swear they have seen the unctuous malamander creep…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbert Lemon, Lost-and-Founder at the Grand Nautilus Hotel, knows that returning lost things to their rightful owners is not easy – especially when the lost thing is not a thing at all, but a girl. No one knows what happened to Violet Parma’s parents twelve years ago, and when she engages Herbie to help her find them, the pair discover that their disappearance might have something to do with the legendary sea-monster, the Malamander. Eerie-on-Sea has always been a mysteriously chilling place, where strange stories seem to wash up. And it just got stranger...</description>

  <description>Anne encounters spirits far more troubled than her own when she's sent off to a small seaside village, away from her parents' disintegrating marriage. A dead man scrawls desperate messages to her in the dust. A demonic dog digs up the bones of drowned sailors in the graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through dreams and hypnosis, Anne opens herself to otherworldly (and violent) forces. She's drawn deeper and deeper into a century-old tale of shipwreck and unsolved murder -- and she's haunted by anguished phantoms in the old Watch House on the cliff and on the deadly rocks below. At first, the new friends Anne has made try to hold her back. But when they, too, succumb to the lure of the supernatural, Anne finds herself marooned in a time and place from which it seems no one can save her. Gripped by ghosts, she must fight for her sanity -- and for her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fictiondb.com/author/robert-westall~the-watch-house~162324~b.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.fictiondb.com/author/robe...&lt;/a&gt;]</description>

  <description>Stagecoach robberies. Shoot-outs. Striking it rich. Throughout the Wild West small towns were formed, thriving with men and women from the East and gold from the mines. Notorious outlaws, desperadoes, and gunslingers rustled up trouble in town after town. When the gold disappeared, the outlaws, as well as the local folks, abandoned their towns. Or did they?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are still sounds, not just the paint peeling from the deserted storefronts, or the tumbleweeds whispering as they somersault down the empty streets. There are voices, whispering stories--are they real or imagined? Stories like the one about the Lost Mine in Maiden, Texas, or the Bad Man from Bodie, California, who's still searching for his lost finger. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Combining history, pop science, and in-depth reporting, a fascinating account of asteroids that hit Earth long ago, and those streaming toward us now, as well as how we are preparing against asteroid-caused catastrophe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these days, warns Gordon Dillow, the Earth &lt;i&gt;will &lt;/i&gt;be hit by a comet or asteroid of potentially catastrophic size. The only question is &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt;. In the meantime, we need to get much better at finding objects hurtling our way, and if they’re large enough to penetrate the atmosphere without burning up, figure out what to do about them.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We owe many of science’s most important discoveries to the famed Meteor Crater, a mile-wide dimple on the Colorado Plateau created by an asteroid hit 50,000 years ago. In his masterfully researched &lt;i&gt;Fire in the Sky&lt;/i&gt;, Dillow unpacks what the Crater has to tell us. Prior to the early 1900s, the world believed that all craters—on the Earth and Moon—were formed by volcanic activity. Not so. The revelation that Meteor Crater and others like it were formed by impacts with space objects has led to a now accepted theory about what killed off the dinosaurs, and it has opened up a new field of asteroid observation, which has recently brimmed with urgency. Dillow looks at great asteroid hits of the past and spends time with modern-day asteroid hunters and defense planning experts, including America’s first Planetary Defense Officer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Satellite sensors confirm that a Hiroshima-scale blast occurs in the atmosphere every year, and a smaller, one-kiloton blast every month. While Dillow makes clear that the objects above can be deadly, he consistently inspires awe with his descriptions of their size, makeup, and origins. At once a riveting work of popular science and a warning to not take for granted the space objects hurtling overhead, &lt;i&gt;Fire in the Sky &lt;/i&gt;is, above all, a testament to our universe’s celestial wonders.</description>

  <description>Sickness is ravaging America, driving the infected to savagery. Petty criminal Ben Silensky is determined to get his girlfriend Carlita and son Kyle free of the quarantined city they live in, enough so to risk a foolhardy crime and then to team up with Carlita's equally desperate cop cousin Nando. Once they're out, Nando is certain they'll find a place in the open prison where his uncle works, unbeknownst to him already become a survivalist colony named Funland under the management of entrepreneurial convict Plan John. In Funland itself, guard Doyle Johnson is shocked when his ex-wife abandons his son Austin into his care. Fearing the vulnerable position he's been placed in, he recruits the help of Katherine Aaronovich, the former prison's doctor. But Aaronovich's traumatic past has left her with vulnerabilities of her own, along with radical theories on the nature of the epidemic that will place all their lives in jeopardy. As the last vestiges of civilisation crumble, Funland may prove to be the safest or the most dangerous of places, depending on who comes out on top - and what can't be held together will inevitably be torn apart. FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>What are you willing to do, what are you willing to become, to save someone you love? On the one-year anniversary of his death in a terrible car accident, Sierra Sowell's brother Jeffrey is resurrected by a mysterious man known only as Corliss. Corliss also transforms several people in Sierra's life into inhuman monsters: her alcoholic neighbor Grace, her possessive ex-boyfriend Stuart, a creepy older man named Randall, and a sexually repressed colleague named Mandy. Each of these people harbor grudges against Sierra, sparks of anger and resentment which Corliss fans into murderous flames. Grace become a booze-fueled witch, Stuart a deadly cyborg, Randall a smiley faced serial killer, and Mandy an insatiable succubus. To matter worse, Jeffrey is only partially alive. He's a walking corpse possessing a devastating deathtouch. Sierra and Jeffrey's boyfriend Marc work to discover the reason for her brother's return to life while struggling to survive attacks by the monstrous quartet whose only desire it to see her dead. The monsters aren't willing to share Sierra, however, and they battle to determine which will be the one to kill her, leaving a pile of corpses in their wake. After the monsters carve a bloody swath through town - and each other - Corliss gives Sierra a chance to make Jeffrey's resurrection permanent: if she's willing to make a dreadful bargain. Can she do what it will take to save her brother, no matter how much blood is shed along the way? Or will she allow him to return to the land of the dead and perhaps join him there? FLAME TREE PRESS is the new fiction imprint of Flame Tree Publishing. Launched in 2018 the list brings together brilliant new authors and the more established; the award winners, and exciting, original voices.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Four women learn their boss (a man who’s always been surrounded by rumors about how he treats women) is next in line to be CEO—what will happen when they decide enough is enough?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane, Ardie, Grace, and Rosalita are four women who have worked at Truviv, Inc., for years. The sudden death of Truviv's CEO means their boss, Ames, will likely take over the entire company. Ames is a complicated man, a man they’ve all known for a long time, a man who’s always been surrounded by...whispers. Whispers that have always been ignored by those in charge. But the world has changed, and the women are watching Ames’s latest promotion differently. This time, they’ve decided enough is enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane and her colleagues set in motion a catastrophic shift within every floor and department of the Truviv offices. All four women’s lives—as women, colleagues, mothers, wives, friends, even adversaries—will change dramatically as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If only you had listened to us,” they tell us on page one, “none of this would have happened."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The second novel in a bewitching series "brimming with charm and charisma" that will make "fans of &lt;i&gt;Outlander&lt;/i&gt; rejoice!" (&lt;i&gt;Woman's World Magazine&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Paula Brackston’s &lt;i&gt;The Little Shop of Found Things&lt;/i&gt; was called “a page-turner that will no doubt leave readers eager for future series installments” (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;). Now, Brackston returns to the Found Things series with its sequel, &lt;i&gt;Secrets of the Chocolate House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her adventures in the seventeenth century, Xanthe does her best to settle back into the rhythm of life in Marlborough. She tells herself she must forget about Samuel and leave him in the past where he belongs. With the help of her new friends, she does her best to move on, focusing instead on the success of her and Flora’s antique shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are still things waiting to be found, still injustices needing to be put right, still voices whispering to Xanthe from long ago about secrets wanting to be shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking for new stock for the shop, Xanthe hears the song of a copper chocolate pot. Soon after, she has an upsetting vision of Samuel in great danger, compelling her to make another journey to the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time she'll meet her most dangerous adversary. This time her ability to travel to the past will be tested. This time she will discover her true destiny. Will that destiny allow her to return home? And will she be able to save Samuel when his own fate seems to be sealed?</description>

  <description>Perfect for fans of Laura Levine and Stephanie Barron, Elizabeth Blake’s Jane Austen Society mystery debut is a mirthfully morbid merger of manners and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this Austen-tatious debut, antiquarian bookstore proprietor Erin Coleridge uses her sense and sensibility to deduce who killed the president of the local Jane Austen Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erin Coleridge’s used bookstore in Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, England is a meeting place for the villagers and, in particular, for the local Jane Austen Society. At the Society’s monthly meeting, matters come to a head between the old guard and its young turks. After the meeting breaks for tea, persuasion gives way to murder—with extreme prejudice—when president Sylvia Pemberthy falls dead to the floor. Poisoned? Presumably…but by whom? And was Sylvia the only target?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handsome—but shy—Detective Inspector Peter Hadley and charismatic Sergeant Rashid Jarral arrive at the scene. The long suspect list includes Sylvia’s lover Kurt Becker and his tightly wound wife Suzanne. Or, perhaps, the killer was Sylvia’s own cuckolded husband, Jerome. Among the many Society members who may have had her in their sights is dashing Jonathan Alder, who was heard having a royal battle of words with the late president the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when Jonathan Alder narrowly avoids becoming the next victim, Farnsworth (the town’s “cat lady”) persuades a seriously time-crunched Erin to help DI Hadley. But the killer is more devious than anyone imagines.</description>

  <description>For the first time in 20 years, Ann Cleeves—international bestselling and award-winning author of the Vera and Shetland series, both of which are hit TV shows—embarks on a gripping new series.&lt;br /&gt;In North Devon, where two rivers converge and run into the sea, Detective Matthew Venn stands outside the church as his father’s funeral takes place. Once loved and cherished, the day Matthew left the strict evangelical community he grew up in, he lost his family too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as he turns and walks away again, he receives a call from one of his team. A body has been found on the beach nearby: a man with a tattoo of an albatross on his neck, stabbed to death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case calls Matthew back into the community he thought he had left behind, as deadly secrets hidden at its heart are revealed, and his past and present collide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An astonishing new novel told with compassion and searing insight, The Long Call will captivate fans of Vera and Shetland, as well as new readers.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Librarian Lucy Richardson unearths a mysterious map dating back to the Civil War. But if she can't crack its code, she may end up read and buried.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodie Island Lighthouse Library Classic Novel Book Club is reading &lt;i&gt;Journey to the Center of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; by Jules Verne while workers dig into the earth to repair the Lighthouse Library's foundations. The digging halts when Lucy pulls a battered tin box containing a Civil War-era diary from the pit. Tucked inside is a hand-drawn map of the Outer Banks accompanied by a page written in an indecipherable code.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The library is overrun by people clamoring to see the artifact. Later that night, Lucy and Connor McNeil find the body of historical society member Jeremy Hughes inside the library. Clearly Jeremy was not the only one who broke into the library--the map and the coded page are missing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lucy's nemesis, Louise Jane McKaughnan, confesses to entering the library after closing to sneak a peek but denies seeing Jeremy--or his killer. When Lucy discovers that fellow-librarian Charlene had a past with Jeremy, she's forced to do what she vowed not to do--get involved in the case. Meanwhile, the entire library staff and community become obsessed with trying to decode the page. But when the library has a second break in, it becomes clear that someone is determined to solve that code.</description>

  <description>An Amish grandmother is murdered on an abandoned farm, her seven year old granddaughter abducted. Chief of Police Kate Burkholder plunges headlong into a case that quickly becomes a race against the clock. She knows the longer the girl is missing, the more likely a tragic outcome. The family of the missing girl is well thought of—a pillar of the Amish community. Their pain is palpable and they cooperate in every way, but Kate soon learns they’re keeping secrets...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The investigation takes Kate to an isolated Old Order Amish settlement along the river in southern Ohio. At first, the community seems upstanding and helpful. But when Kate starts asking questions, they stonewall her—and the situation soon becomes dangerous. What are they hiding and why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an attempt on her life, Kate unearths a haunting and tragic secret that changes everything she thought she knew about the family for whom she is fighting, the Amish community as a whole—and everything she thought she knew about herself. Will she reach the girl in time to save her life?</description>

  <description>When a tragic accident takes the life of 17-year-old Raven Roth's foster mom—and Raven's memory—she moves to New Orleans to recover and finish her senior year of high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over isn't easy. Raven remembers everyday stuff like how to solve math equations and make pasta, but she can't remember her favorite song or who she was before the accident. And when impossible things start happening, Raven begins to think it might even be better not to know who she was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she grows closer to her new friends, her foster sister, Max, and Tommy Torres, a guy who accepts her for who she is now, Raven has to decide if she's ready to face what's buried in the past... and the darkness building inside her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Kami Garcia and first-time graphic novel artist Gabriel Picolo comes this riveting tale of finding the strength to face who you are and learning to trust others—and yourself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Unearth the enchanting origins of fantasy fiction with a collection of tales as vast as the tallest tower and as mysterious as the dark depths of the forest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fantasy stories have always been with us. They illuminate the odd and the uncanny, the wondrous and the fantastic: all the things we know are lurking just out of sight--on the other side of the looking-glass, beyond the music of the impossibly haunting violin, through the twisted trees of the ancient woods. Other worlds, talking animals, fairies, goblins, demons, tricksters, and mystics: these are the elements that populate a rich literary tradition that spans the globe. A work composed both of careful scholarship and fantastic fun, &lt;i&gt;The Big Book of Classic Fantasy &lt;/i&gt;is essential reading for anyone who's never forgotten the stories that first inspired feelings of astonishment and wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stories by pillars of the genre like the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Mary Shelley, Christina Rossetti, L. Frank Baum, Robert E. Howard, and J. R. R. Tolkien&lt;br /&gt; *Fantastical offerings from literary giants including Edith Wharton, Leo Tolstoy, Willa Cather, Zora Neale Hurston, Vladimir Nabokov, Hermann Hesse, and W.E.B. Du Bois&lt;br /&gt; *Rare treasures from Asian, Eastern European, Scandinavian, and Native American traditions&lt;br /&gt; *New translations, including fourteen stories never before in English&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Beautifully Bizarre Creatures! *Strange New Worlds Just Beyond the Garden Path!&lt;br /&gt; *Fairy Folk and Their Dark Mischief! *Seriously Be Careful--Do Not Trust Those Fairies!</description>

  <description>An FBI agent fights to stop a conspiracy to unleash a deadly virus on the world in this propulsive, exhilarating new thriller &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discovery of a deadly virus being smuggled across the border pits FBI Special Agent James Mason and his strike force against an unknown adversary hell-bent on humanity’s destruction. In a desperate effort to contain the pathogen, they launch a predawn raid, only to find that their enemy knows they’re coming…and it’s not about to be taken alive. An explosion rips through the building, killing the majority of Mason’s team, including his partner and mentor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tormented by guilt, Mason returns to his home division, but he can’t seem to let go of the tragedy. He remembers seeing something inside the building before it went up in flames, something that convinces him that not only is the virus still out there, it’s merely the first stage of an even more nefarious plan. Obsessed with unraveling the plot, he launches his own investigation and uncovers a shadow organization on the brink of enacting its genocidal agenda, one carried out by a sinister mass murderer who’s been photographed at the epicenter of seemingly every historical pandemic…without appearing to age. An evil man who attempts to derail Mason’s investigation by murdering his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of his longtime friends—Gunnar Backstrom, a corporate espionage gun-for-hire, and Ramses Donovan, a sin merchant of questionable morality—Mason’s hunt for his wife’s killer leads him from a dark union at the dawn of the twentieth century to a network of Nazi collaborators and a conspiracy against mankind more than a hundred years in the making. Fueled by anger and driven by the promise of vengeance, he must overcome a monster preparing to unleash his virulent wrath upon an unsuspecting world if he’s to have any hope of exposing a deep-state entity that’s rooted in every facet of our society, an entity known only as…The Thirteen.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author and master of horror Stephen King teams up with Bev Vincent of &lt;i&gt;Cemetery Dance&lt;/i&gt; to present a terrifying collection of sixteen short stories (and one poem) that tap into one of King’s greatest fears—air travel—featuring brand-new stories by King and Joe Hill, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;“an expertly compiled collection of tales that entertain and scare” (&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King hates to fly, and he and co-editor Bev Vincent would like to share their fear of flying with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to &lt;i&gt;Flight or Fright&lt;/i&gt;, an anthology about all the things that can go horribly wrong when you’re suspended six miles in the air, hurtling through space at more than 500 mph, and sealed up in a metal tube (like—gulp!—a coffin) with hundreds of strangers. Here are all the ways your trip into the friendly skies can turn into a nightmare, including some we’ll bet you’ve never thought of before... but now you will the next time you walk down the jetway and place your fate in the hands of a total stranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Featuring brand-new “standouts” (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) by Joe Hill and Stephen King, as well as fourteen classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Dan Simmons, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and many others, &lt;i&gt;Flight or Fright&lt;/i&gt; is, as King says, “ideal airplane reading, especially on stormy descents…Even if you are safe on the ground, you might want to buckle up nice and tight.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each story is introduced by Stephen King and all will have you thinking twice about how you want to reach your final destination.</description>

  <description>With the international bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&lt;/i&gt;, Nicholas Meyer brought to light a previously unpublished case of Sherlock Holmes, as recorded by Dr. John H. Watson. Now Meyer returns with a shocking discovery—an unknown case drawn from a recently unearthed Watson journal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 1905: Holmes and Watson are summoned by Holmes' brother Mycroft to undertake a clandestine investigation. An agent of the British Secret Service has been found floating in the Thames, carrying a manuscript smuggled into England at the cost of her life. The pages purport to be the minutes of a meeting of a secret group intent on nothing less than taking over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on real events, the adventure takes the famed duo—in the company of a bewitching woman—aboard the Orient Express from Paris into the heart of Tsarist Russia, where Holmes and Watson attempt to trace the origins of this explosive document. On their heels are desperate men of unknown allegiance, determined to prevent them from achieving their task. And what they uncover is a conspiracy so vast as to challenge Sherlock Holmes as never before.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Birds &amp;amp; Bees owner Amy Simms will need help from her fine-feathered friends when an uncommon bird sighting plunges her into a hornet’s nest of black magic and murder most foul . . . &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Amy’s enjoying a rare moment of relaxation when a customer shows up seeking her expertise in ID-ing an unusual bird she’s seen flying around her wooded cabin at the edge of town. Ruby Lake, North Carolina, newcomer Yvonne Rice resembles an exotic bird herself—apparently the kind that doesn’t fly. When she’s found shot to death in her locked cabin, the only witness found is a statue of a voodoo deity staring down from the mantel.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Does the rare yellow cardinal Yvonne spotted hold any clues to her demise? What about the Ouija board spelling out the words &lt;i&gt;I am murdered&lt;/i&gt;? As Amy delves deeper into Yvonne’s life and meets her strangely secretive neighbors, she’s determined to stop a fowl-hearted murderer from migrating to a new killing ground . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the national bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Alice&lt;/i&gt; comes a postapocalyptic take on the perennial classic "Little Red Riding Hood"...about a woman who isn't as defenseless as she seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not safe for anyone alone in the woods. There are predators that come out at night: critters and coyotes, snakes and wolves. But the woman in the red jacket has no choice. Not since the Crisis came, decimated the population, and sent those who survived fleeing into quarantine camps that serve as breeding grounds for death, destruction, and disease. She is just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that doesn't look anything like the one she grew up in, the one that was perfectly sane and normal and boring until three months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are worse threats in the woods than the things that stalk their prey at night. Sometimes, there are men. Men with dark desires, weak wills, and evil intents. Men in uniform with classified information, deadly secrets, and unforgiving orders. And sometimes, just sometimes, there's something worse than all of the horrible people and vicious beasts combined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red doesn't like to think of herself as a killer, but she isn't about to let herself get eaten up just because she is a woman alone in the woods....</description>

  <description>On Fur Bridge Farm, Jules cares for rescued rabbits. But when a killer strikes, she'll need a rabbit to rescue her . . .&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Juliette “Jules” Bridge prides herself on the tender rehabilitation she provides for injured or abused rabbits on her New Hampshire rescue farm, but she has a very special relationship with one bunny in particular. Bun is a black-and-white rabbit who happens to have the ability to communicate through mental telepathy. Once she got over the shock, Jules found her furry friend had a lot to say.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One frigid March morning on their walk together, Bun spots a body. The police identify the frozen stiff as Arthur Freeman, aka Arty the Mime. Jules and Arty knew each other on the children's party circuit, where he’d perform magic tricks and she had an educational rabbit petting pen. With Bun egging her on, Jules decides it’s time they hop to it and put their heads together to discover who silenced the mime. But their investigation leads them down a rabbit hole of more suspects and lies, while a killer sets a trap for them...</description>

  <description>Sailing from Greenland in 1775, the whaling ship &lt;i&gt;Herald&lt;/i&gt; came upon an eerie sight. The ship &lt;i&gt;Octavius&lt;/i&gt;, which had disappeared thirteen years earlier, appeared suddenly in the Arctic waters. When the captain and crew boarded the silent ship, all seemed to be in order. They found the captain at his table filling out the ship's log. His wife and son were asleep in the next cabin. A crew member was lighting a fire in the cabin stove. Only one thing was wrong. Everyone on board the &lt;i&gt;Octavius&lt;/i&gt; were frozen solid. The captain of the &lt;i&gt;Herald&lt;/i&gt; quickly grabbed the log book and abandoned the death ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to the crew of the ill-fated &lt;i&gt;Octavius&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;i&gt;Mysteries of Ships and Planes&lt;/i&gt; recalls fascinating real-life disappearances and bizarre happenings in the air and on the sea that to this day remain a mystery.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A wedding. A murder. A 200-year-old curse: Ishmael Jones is plunged into a baffling investigation when he answers an old friend's call for help.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although he hasn't seen Robert Bergin for 40 years, Ishmael feels duty bound to respond when his old friend calls for help. Robert's daughter Gillian is about to be married, and he is afraid she'll fall prey to the ancient family curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in rural Yorkshire, Ishmael and his partner Penny learn that the vicar who was to perform the ceremony has been found dead in the church, hanging from his own bell rope. With no clues, no evidence and no known motive, many locals believe the curse is responsible. Or is someone just using it as a smokescreen for murder? With the wedding due to take place the following day, Ishmael has just a few hours to uncover the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his investigations are hampered by sudden flashes of memory: memories of the time before he was human. What is it Ishmael's former self is trying to tell him ... ?</description>

They try to find a way to escape, and survive the House Out of Time.</description>

  <description>Consider: on the night before a dangerous mission, a Royal Air Force pilot believes he sees the face of a fellow crewman turn into a skull. The next day the same crewman is killed. Coincidence? You be the judge. But remember, each of the tales in this book are absolutely true. Fully illustrated with black and white art. Original.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lily and the Octopus&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel about a struggling writer who gets his big break, with a little help from the most famous woman in America.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of trying to make it as a writer in 1990s New York City, James Smale finally sells his novel to an editor at a major publishing house: none other than Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Jackie--or Mrs. Onassis, as she's known in the office--has fallen in love with James's candidly autobiographical novel, one that exposes his own dysfunctional family. But when the book's forthcoming publication threatens to unravel already fragile relationships, both within his family and with his partner, James finds that he can't bring himself to finish the manuscript. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackie and James develop an unexpected friendship, and she pushes him to write an authentic ending, encouraging him to head home to confront the truth about his relationship with his mother. Then a long-held family secret is revealed, and he realizes his editor may have had a larger plan that goes beyond the page... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Lily and the Octopus &lt;/i&gt;comes a funny, poignant, and highly original novel about an author whose relationship with his very famous book editor will change him forever--both as a writer and a son.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;From the author of the beloved Ruth Galloway series, a modern gothic mystery for fans of &lt;i&gt;Magpie Murders&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Lake House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clare Cassidy is no stranger to murder. A high school English teacher specializing in the Gothic writer R. M. Holland, she teaches a course on it every year. But when one of Clare’s colleagues and closest friends is found dead, with a line from R. M. Holland’s most famous story, “The Stranger,” left by her body, Clare is horrified to see her life collide with the storylines of her favourite literature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To make matters worse, the police suspect the killer is someone Clare knows. Unsure whom to trust, she turns to her closest confidant, her diary, the only outlet she has for her darkest suspicions and fears about the case. Then one day she notices something odd. Writing that isn't hers, left on the page of an old diary: "Hallo, Clare. You don’t know me." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Clare becomes more certain than ever: “The Stranger” has come to terrifying life. But can the ending be rewritten in time?&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Author James A. Moore offers up ten autumnal tales of the darker things that lurk just around the corner of Indian Summer. A man learns of a town's obsession with scarecrows and tries to find the answers as to why they are so important. Children move through familiar streets and find that Halloween makes everything different. Tis' the season when ghosts are real, witches soar through the night, and things in the Beldam Woods are not always what they seem. Sometimes it's the monsters that wear the masks.</description>

  <description>The road in front of Dr. Louis Creed's rural Maine home frequently claims the lives of neighborhood pets. Louis has recently moved from Chicago to Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their children and pet cat. Near their house, local children have created a cemetery for the dogs and cats killed by the steady stream of transports on the busy highway. Deeper in the woods lies another graveyard, an ancient Indian burial ground whose sinister properties Louis discovers when the family cat is killed.&lt;br /&gt;source: stephenking.com</description>

  <description>11 hours, 38 minutes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired FBI agent Brigid Quinn returns in Becky Masterman's fourth stunning thriller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1959, a family of four were brutally murdered in Holcomb, Kansas. Perry Smith and Dick Hickok were convicted and executed for the crime, and the murders and their investigation and solution became the subject of Truman Capote's masterpiece, IN COLD BLOOD. But what if there was a third killer, who remained unknown? What if there was another family, also murdered, who crossed paths with this band of killers, though their murder remains unsolved? And what if Dick Hickok left a written confession, explaining everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired FBI agent Brigid Quinn and her husband Carlo, a former priest and university professor, are trying to enjoy each other in this new stage in their lives. But a memento from Carlo's days as a prison chaplain--a handwritten document hidden away undetected in a box of Carlo's old things--has become a target for a man on the run from his past. Jerry Beaufort has just been released from prison after decades behind bars, and though he'd like to get on with living the rest of his life, he knows that somewhere there is a written record of the time he spent with two killers in 1959. Following the path of this letter will bring Jerry into contact with the last person he'll see as a threat: Brigid Quinn.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Librarian Carrie Singleton is building a haven, but one of her neighbors is &lt;i&gt;mis&lt;/i&gt;behavin'. Can resident spirit Evelyn help Carrie catch the culprit who made her a ghost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In winter, the Haunted Library is a refuge for homeless townspeople. When a group purchases a vacant house to establish a daytime haven for the homeless, Carrie offers the library as a meeting place for the Haven House committee, but quickly learns that it may be used for illegal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the new Sunshine Delegate, Carrie heads to the hospital to visit her cantankerous colleague, Dorothy, who had fallen outside the local supermarket. She tells Carrie that her husband tried to kill her—and that he murdered her Aunt Evelyn, the library's resident ghost, six years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then Dorothy is murdered—run off the road as soon as she returns to work. Evelyn implores Carrie to find her niece's killer, but that's no easy task: Dorothy had made a hobby of blackmailing her neighbors and colleagues. Carrie, Evelyn, and Smoky Joe the cat are on the case, but are the library cards stacked against them?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Give me one name. One person. And I will make them disappear . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sarah rescues a young girl in trouble, she expects nothing in return. But her act of bravery puts a powerful and dangerous man in her debt. He lives by his own brutal code, and all debts must be repaid - in the only way he knows how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He offers Sarah a way to solve a desperate situation with her intolerable boss. A once-in-a-lifetime deal that will make all her problems disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No consequences. No comeback. No chance of being found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it takes is a 29 second phone call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because everyone has a name to give. Don't they? &lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty-five years after her passing, Audrey Hepburn remains the most beloved of all Hollywood stars, known as much for her role as UNICEF ambassador as for films like &lt;i&gt;Roman Holiday &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Breakfast at Tiffany’s.&lt;/i&gt; Several biographies have chronicled her stardom, but none has covered her intense experiences through five years of Nazi occupation in the Netherlands. According to her son, Luca Dotti, “The war made my mother who she was.” Audrey Hepburn’s war included participation in the Dutch Resistance, working as a doctor’s assistant during the “Bridge Too Far” battle of Arnhem, the brutal execution of her uncle, and the ordeal of the Hunger Winter of 1944. She also had to contend with the fact that her father was a Nazi agent and her mother was pro-Nazi for the first two years of the occupation. But the war years also brought triumphs as Audrey became Arnhem’s most famous young ballerina. Audrey’s own reminiscences, new interviews with people who knew her in the war, wartime diaries, and research in classified Dutch archives shed light on the riveting, untold story of Audrey Hepburn under fire in World War II. Also included is a section of color and black-and-white photos. Many of these images are from Audrey’s personal collection and are published here for the first time.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When what appears to be the original Pandora's Box is discovered in an ancient city, neighboring countries fight for ownership and unleash a terrible plague. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Pandora Room&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Christopher Golden's chilling exploration of what happens when the original Pandora's Box is discovered in an ancient subterranean city, stirring international conflict and exposing the archaeological team to curses, whispers, and the terror of a legendary plague.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one ancient variation on the myth of Pandora's Box, there were two jars, one for Pandora and one for her sister, Anesidora. One contained all the blessings of the gods, the other all the world's curses. Now, in a subterranean city in Northern Iraq, archaeologist Sophie Durand has discovered a secret chamber covered in writing that confirms that version of the tale--a chamber which contains a single jar. "Weird shit" expert Ben Walker joins Sophie's team just as the mystery deepens and grows ugly. Those who believe the myth want to know which jar has been found in the Pandora Room, the one containing blessings, or the one full of curses. Governments rush to lay claim, but jihadi forces aren't waiting for the dust to settle. Whatever the jar contains, they want it, no matter who they have to kill...or what will emerge when they open it. For Sophie, Walker, and the others, the Pandora Room may soon become their tomb.</description>

  <description>Clare Cosi’s new friend, millionaire David Mintzer, has an offer no New York barista could turn down: an all-expenses-paid summer away from the sticky city. At his Hamptons mansion, she’ll relax, soak up the sun, and, oh yes, train the staff of his new restaurant. So Clare packs up her daughter, her former mother-in-law, and her special recipe for iced coffee—for what she hopes will be one de-latte-ful summer…Soon, Clare tends the coffee bar at her first Hamptons gala. But the festivities come to a bitter end when an employee turns up dead in David’s bathroom—a botched attempt on the millionaire’s life. Thanks to the Fourth of July fireworks no one heard any gunshots, and the police are stuck in holiday traffic. Concerned for everyone’s safety, Clare begins to investigate. What she finds will keep her up at night—and it’s not the java jitters....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </description>

Fearing that losing his family might cost him the last of his dwindling humanity, Brett must win back their love and respect, all the while attempting to find his new place in the world and reconcile his vegetarian morals with his insatiable appetite for live meat...</description>

First, her daughter died at the hands of witch hunter; then her son-in-law decided to hightail it out of town with her baby granddaughter in tow. Now, she's a woman - er, witch - on a mission. No, it’s not disposing of the beast that took her daughter away, she’s already done that. Instead, Granny is tasked with performing an important ceremony. One that will hide her granddaughter's true identity and give her the chance at a normal, non-magical life... except, Granny's Spell Book is missing on the very day she needs it most. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if she doesn’t have enough to worry about, she'll have to contend with her daughter’s arch nemesis, a new Police Chief, a sea witch, and find her missing Spell Book. Oh, and sneak a few friends out of jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On A Witch And A Spell is a short, humorous cozy mystery read filled with magic; a mystery or two; and snarky, no nonsense main character and her friends.</description>

  <description>The story of one woman’s quest to move to Los Angeles and got a job in animation...and how you can too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When artist Tally Nourigat left her life in Portland to move to Los Angeles and pursue a job in animation, she realized that despite her research, nothing truly prepared her for the wild world that awaited in the studios of Southern California. From grinding on storyboard test after storyboard test to getting a job at a major studio to searching for an apartment in...the Valley...this autobiographical how-to graphic novel explores the highest highs and lowest lows of pursuing a dream in animation. Brushed with a dose of humor and illustrated advice about salaries, studio culture, and everything in between, I Moved to Los Angeles to Work in Animation is the unique insider experience you won’t find anywhere else.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Magic under the big top.&lt;br /&gt;Murder under investigation.&lt;br /&gt;Can a non-practicing witch save the family business and live to see the encore?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte never had the choice to follow in her family’s magical footsteps. Her parents decided decades ago to live amongst the humans and leave the mystical circus far behind. But when her ringmaster uncle is murdered and wills her the family’s magical business, she feels the pull to step back under the big top. As she harnesses the awesome powers of the enchanted performance, she vows to bring her uncle’s killer to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of juggling her investigation, running the show, and navigating rival groups of carnies, the human-phobic Witches Council schemes to replace her faster than a flying trapeze. With threats coming from both sides of the tent, Charlotte must unmask her uncle’s murderer before the legendary circus takes its final bow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Witchiest Circus on Earth&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in the spellbinding &lt;i&gt;Magical Midway&lt;/i&gt; paranormal cozy mystery series. If you like colorful characters, supernatural circuses, and twisty mysteries, then you’ll love Leanne Leeds’ show-stopping whodunit.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>1967. In a quiet village in the wild lands of the Scottish borders, disgraced academic Cordelia Hemlock is trying to put her life back together. Grieving the loss of her son, she seeks out the company of the dead, taking comfort amid the ancient headstones and crypts of the local churchyard. When lightning strikes a tumbledown tomb, she glimpses a corpse that doesn't belong among the crumbling bones. But when the storm passes and the body vanishes, the authorities refuse to believe the claims of a hysterical 'outsider'. Teaming up with a reluctant witness, local woman Felicity Goose, Cordelia's enquiries all lead back to a former POW camp that was set up in the village during the Second World War. But not all Gilsland's residents welcome the two young women's interference. There are those who believe the village's secrets should remain buried ... whatever the cost.</description>

      <![CDATA[I have to admit...this book surprised me. I expected a flash-back style crime\murder mystery novel...but got something richer and much more interesting. This is a mystery novel with a touch of espionage, hidden war-time secrets, cover-ups, Nazis, POWs, traitors....and two old women still determin...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;“A must for CSNY fans.” —&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first ever biography focused on the formative and highly influential early years of “rock’s first supergroup” (&lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt;) Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young—when they were the most successful, influential, and politically potent band in America—in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of Woodstock and the formation of the band itself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1969 to 1974 were true golden years of rock n’ roll, bookmarking an era of arguably unparalleled musical power and innovation. But even more than any of their eminent peers, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young channeled and broadcast all the radical anger, romantic idealism, and generational angst of their time. Each of the members had already made their marks in huge bands (The Hollies, Buffalo Springfield, The Byrds), but together, their harmonies were transcendent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vast emotional range of their music, from delicate acoustic confessionals to raucous counter-culture anthems, was mirrored in the turbulence of their personal lives. Their trademark may have been vocal harmony, but few—if any—of their contemporaries could match the recklessness of their hedonistic and often combative lifestyles, when the four tenacious, volatile, and prodigal songwriters pursued chemical and sexual pleasure to life-threatening extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including full color photographs,&lt;i&gt; CSNY &lt;/i&gt;chronicles these four iconic musicians and the movement they came to represent, concentrating on their prime as a collective unit and a cultural force: the years between 1969, when Woodstock telegraphed their arrival to the world, and 1974, when their arch-enemy Richard Nixon was driven from office, and the band (to quote Graham Nash himself) “lost it on the highway.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even fifty years later, there are plenty of stories left to be told about Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young—and music historian Peter Doggett is here to bring them to light in the meticulously researched &lt;i&gt;CSNY&lt;/i&gt;, a quintessential and illuminative account of rock’s first supergroup in their golden hour for die-hard fans, nostalgic flower-children, and music history aficionados alike.</description>

  <description>A young adult, fantasy novel about a teenager who is the last eighteen-year-old in her territory. There will never be another child; every baby born after her has been taken away. Everyone wonders why she survived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma Whisperer was born in 2080, in the small futuristic world of Craigluy. President Esther, in charge for the last twenty-two years, has divided their world into three territories, separated by classes—the rich, the working class, and the poor—because she believes the poor should not mingle with the others. And, the poor are no longer allowed to have children, since they do not have the means to take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any babies born, accidentally or willfully, are killed. Emma is the last eighteen-year-old in her territory; every baby born after her has died. Somehow, she survived this fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the president’s Monday night speech, she announces a party will be held to honor the last child in the territory, Emma Whisperer. Emma must read a speech, expressing how happy she is to be the last eighteen-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma doesn’t like the rules; she doesn’t believe in them. So, she feels she must rebel against them. Her family doesn’t agree with her rebellion, since they are hiding a big secret. If this secret gets out, it will be disastrous, and deadly, for her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During Emma’s journey, she meets—and becomes friends with—Eric. He is one of the guards for the president. She also befriends Samuel, another guard for the president, who is summoned to watch over her. As Emma meets new people, she doesn’t know who she can trust. Yet, she finds herself falling for a guy, something which has never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing what she feels is right, Emma finds herself in imminent danger. In the end, she must make one gut-wrenching decision, a decision that may be disastrous for them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Fans of dystopian fantasy will devour this book. L. J. Epps writes a story that, while dealing with heavy subject matter, is still a light, enjoyable read. This dystopian fantasy novel ignites the imagination, and is a must read for fans of The Hunger Games and the Divergent Trilogy.”&lt;br /&gt;—Kristina Gemmell,&lt;br /&gt;Beta Reader</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NYPD detective Lex Cole tracks a missing Brooklyn teen whose bright future is endangered by the ghosts of his unknown father's past, in this highly anticipated sequel to &lt;i&gt;A Map of the Dark&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the few black kids on his Brighton Beach block, Titus "Crisp" Crespo was raised by his white mother and his Russian grandparents. He has two legacies from his absent father, Mo: his weird name and his brown skin. Crisp has always been the odd kid out, but a fundamentally good kid, with a bright future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one impulsive decision triggers a horrible domino effect--an arrest, no reason not to accompany his richer, whiter friend Glynnie on a visit to her weed dealer, and a trip onto his father's old home turf where he'll face certain choices he's always strived to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Detective Lex Cole tries to unravel the clues from Crisp's night out, they both find that what you don't know about your past can still come back to haunt you.</description>

  <description>A girl, missing&lt;br /&gt;A woman, searching&lt;br /&gt;A killer, planning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FBI Agent Elsa Myers finds missing people.&lt;br /&gt;She knows how it feels to be lost...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though her father lies dying in a hospital north of New York City, Elsa cannot refuse a call for help. A teenage girl has gone missing from Forest Hills, Queens, and during the critical first hours of the case, a series of false leads hides the fact that she did not go willingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each passing hour, as the hunt for Ruby deepens into a search for a man who may have been killing for years, the case starts to get underneath Elsa's skin. Everything she has buried - her fraught relationship with her sister and niece, her self-destructive past, her mother's death - threatens to resurface, with devastating consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to save the missing girl, she may have to lose herself...and return to the darkness she's been hiding from for years.</description>

  <description>Monster Mashup - Spooky Short Story Ominbus -- with Special Bonus Zombie Short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with twelve short stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monsters, magic, goblins, zombies, and more. Be prepared to sleep with the lights on. This collection of short stories will have you looking over your shoulder, avoiding mirrors, and jumping at the slightest sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From fiendish creatures hiding in your bathroom mirror, to Halloween pranks gone deadly wrong. Each story will scare, delight, and surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No gore or cursing here, just good ol' spine-chilling fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infinite Reflections – When Jessie's sister gets trapped in a haunted mirror, he must figure out how to destroy the creature within. Though, Mom might like it if he gets his sister out first.&lt;br /&gt;Bloody Marcy – Mixing a game of Bloody Mary with a practical joke proves to be a deadly combination.&lt;br /&gt;Monster in the Mirror - Nate, his little sister, and best buddy Dan, stumble upon a hidden room during a sleep-over. What they find inside is anything but friendly.&lt;br /&gt;Death Trap – Mike takes a bet to go inside a haunted house, but will he live long enough to collect?&lt;br /&gt;Steven, Space Stowaway – Steven sneaks onboard a spaceship bound for Mars. Just one problem: the Captain has a particularly unpleasant way of dealing with stowaways.&lt;br /&gt;The Price of Friendship – How much is a best friend worth? Joey finds out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;Hobgoblin Horror – Jake only volunteered at the retirement home because Shelby works there. So, it's no wonder he's doesn't hear Mr. Fitches' warnings about a local homicidal hobgoblin—too bad for him.&lt;br /&gt;Rolling Leprechauns for Change – Leprechauns can have a nasty sense of humor—especially, when they're getting even.&lt;br /&gt;Hide-n-Go-Coffin – Playing hide-and-seek in a cemetery is disrespectful. When it happens to be cursed, the results can be deadly, or maybe even worse.&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa's Suits – A game of spin-the-bottle with the school pervert isn't a bright idea. Fortunately for Zoey, she's not quite alone.&lt;br /&gt;Brother's Keeper – Zack would be wise to spend less time looking for his missing sled and more worrying about what is lurking outside. Too bad, he's not the only one who'll suffer for his single-mindedness.&lt;br /&gt;Super Zombie Juice Mega Bomb When Life gives you lemons, kill zombies. In this special short story that inspired the upcoming novel, Nate and Misty's town is overrun by the undead and they'll need a little luck to squeeze their way out of this sticky mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stories are not recommended for kids under 8.</description>

  <description>When life gives you lemons, kill zombies -- turns out lemon juice neutralizes the undead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a failed attempt at running away, best friends Nathan and Misty return home expecting to face angry parents. Instead, they discover the military has destroyed the bridges out of their rural town and everyone's fled—except a small horde of the living dead. The stress of flesh-eating zombies may be more than their already strained relationship can handle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Even with the help of the town geek and lemonade-powered Super-Soakers, there's not enough time to squeeze their way out of this sticky mess. Unless the trio eradicates the zombie infestation, while avoiding the deadly zombie snot, the military will blow the town, and them, to pulp.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Their only shot is something with a lot more punch. Something like the Super Zombie Juice Mega Bomb. But even if their friendship survives, there's another problem: Someone has to lure the undead into the trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes two free short stories.&lt;br /&gt;Print length is approximately 204 pages (40,000 words).&lt;br /&gt;May not be suitable for kids under 9.</description>

Did he lose hope and walk to his death?
