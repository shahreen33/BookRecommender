  <description>So how did I get myself into this situation, you ask? Simple: desperation. When you're faced with being homeless and hungry or taking off your clothes for money, the choice is easier than you'd imagine. That doesn't make it easy, though. Oh no. I hate it, in fact. There's nothing I'd like more than to quit and never go into another bar again, never hear the techno beat pulsing in my ears again, never feel the lecherous gazes of horny men again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, one day, I meet a man. He's in my club, front and center. He watches me do my routine, and his gaze is full of hunger. Not the kind of desire I'm used to though. It's something different. Something hotter, deeper, and more possessive. I know who he is; of course I do. Everyone knows who Dawson Kellor is. He's People Magazine's Sexiest Man alive. He's the hottest actor in Hollywood. He's the man hand-picked for the role of Rhett Butler in the long-awaited remake of Gone With the Wind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's the kind of man who can have any woman in the entire world with a mere crook of his finger. So what's he doing looking at me like he has to have me? And how do I resist him when he looks at me with those intoxicating, changeable, quicksilver eyes? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a virgin, and he's an American icon of male sexuality. I'm a stripper, and he's a man used to getting anything and everything he wants. And he wants me. I know I should say no, I know he's the worst kind of player…but what my mind knows, my body and my heart may not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then things get complicated.</description>

  <description>To the Green-eyed Lovebird:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met fifteen years ago, almost to the day, when I moved my stuff into the NYU dorm room next to yours at Senior House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You called us fast friends. I like to think it was more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We lived on nothing but the excitement of finding ourselves through music (you were obsessed with Jeff Buckley), photography (I couldn’t stop taking pictures of you), hanging out in Washington Square Park, and all the weird things we did to make money. I learned more about myself that year than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, somehow, it all fell apart. We lost touch the summer after graduation when I went to South America to work for National Geographic. When I came back, you were gone. A part of me still wonders if I pushed you too hard after the wedding…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t see you again until a month ago. It was a Wednesday. You were rocking back on your heels, balancing on that thick yellow line that runs along the subway platform, waiting for the F train. I didn’t know it was you until it was too late, and then you were gone. Again. You said my name; I saw it on your lips. I tried to will the train to stop, just so I could say hello.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing you, all of the youthful feelings and memories came flooding back to me, and now I’ve spent the better part of a month wondering what your life is like. I might be totally out of my mind, but would you like to get a drink with me and catch up on the last decade and a half?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Sweet Thing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nowhere But Here&lt;/i&gt; comes a love story about a Craigslist “missed connection” post that gives two people a second chance at love fifteen years after they were separated in New York City.</description>

  <description>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lesson is to make yourself strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her younger brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Sometimes the difference between a love story and a horror story is where the ending comes . . .&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Jude fought for power in the Court of Elfhame against the cruel Prince Cardan, her sister Taryn began to fall in love with the trickster, Locke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-apology and half-explanation, it turns out that Taryn has some secrets of her own to reveal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lost Sisters&lt;/i&gt; is a companion e-novella to the New York Times bestselling novel &lt;i&gt;The Cruel Prince&lt;/i&gt; by master writer Holly Black.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What if instead of feeling guilty and anxious about money, you felt happy and secure? Shannon Lee Simmons shows you how to create a financial plan that will let you spend knowing you’ll be ready for the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Managing your money can be frustrating and confusing. Life is expensive. It doesn’t matter if you make $40,000 or $140,000 a year, it can feel like you’re constantly broke. Can you afford that new car, that vacation, that night out? You think so, but it feels impossible to know. And rigid budgets that force you to spend your money in unrealistic ways (like $9.50 per week for pants) don’t make things any clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if there was a new way to manage your money? One that left you certain you had your bases covered—both for your monthly bills and your future retirement—and then let you &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; your money by spending it. (Yes, we just said that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Shannon Lee Simmons, a totally new voice in the world of personal finance, one who understands the new and very real pressures to survive modern life and keep up in the age of social media. Shannon doesn’t lecture, judge or patronize. The founder of the wildly popular New School of Finance, Shannon recognized that most of her thousands of clients felt broke, no matter what their income. And feeling broke can be as bad as actually being broke, because it leads to overspending and misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worry-Free Money &lt;/em&gt;takes a fresh approach to finances, looking at the &lt;em&gt;root cause&lt;/em&gt; of the pressure to spend and showing why traditional budgets don’t work. It is a deeply practical book that will help you break the cycle of guilt, understand why you overspend and find hope—and fun—in getting your money under control.</description>

      <![CDATA[The first part of this book is very helpful and inspiring and I can't wait to implement this new way of managing money! However, maybe about the second half (once she's finished explaining the actual strategy and plan) of the book was not as helpful in my opinion. I skimmed most of this portion.]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Of course I want to be like them. They’re beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jude was seven when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win a place at the Court, she must defy him–and face the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jude becomes more deeply embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, she discovers her own capacity for trickery and bloodshed. But as betrayal threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars. I think this is the first Holly Black book I've actually made it all the way through and I'm pretty sure I owe that to the audiobook narration. I always seem to struggle to connect with Black's characters for some reason. The audiobook helped with this and I was able to enjoy the story...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, &lt;i&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/i&gt; will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If you could do it all over again, would you still choose him?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At age thirty-nine, Lucie Walker has no choice but to start her life over when she comes to, up to her knees in the chilly San Francisco Bay, with no idea how she got there or who she is. Her memory loss is caused by an emotional trauma she knows nothing about, and only when handsome, quiet Grady Goodall arrives at the hospital does she learn she has a home, a career, and a wedding just two months away. What went wrong? Grady seems to care for her, but Lucie is no more sure of him than she is of anything. As she collects the clues of her past self, she unlocks the mystery of what happened to her. The painful secrets she uncovers could hold the key to her future—if she trusts her heart enough to guide her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;With wry wit and hard-earned wisdom, popular online personality and founder of TheChicSite.com founder Rachel Hollis helps readers break free from the lies keeping them from the joy-filled and exuberant life they are meant to have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Founder of the lifestyle website TheChicSite.com and CEO of her own media company, Chic Media, Rachel Hollis has created an online fan base of hundreds of thousands of fans by sharing tips for living a better life while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own. Now comes her highly anticipated first book featuring her signature combination of honesty, humor, and direct, no-nonsense advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;Girl, Wash Your Face&lt;/em&gt; begins with a specific lie Hollis once believed that left her feeling overwhelmed, unworthy, or ready to give up. As a working mother, a former foster parent, and a woman who has dealt with insecurities about her body and relationships, she speaks with the insight and kindness of a BFF, helping women unpack the limiting mind-sets that destroy their self-confidence and keep them from moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From her temporary obsession with marrying Matt Damon to a daydream involving hypnotic iguanas to her son's request that she buy a necklace to "be like the other moms," Hollis holds nothing back. With unflinching faith and tenacity, Hollis spurs other women to live with passion and hustle and to awaken their slumbering goals.</description>

  <description>Change your perception of meditation! This accessible, breezy guide introduces the concept of active meditation—moving meditations in which mind, body, and spirit become totally immersed in a single activity. Author and martial artist Chris Berlow takes readers through the many possible ways to meditate throughout even the busiest day, whether it’s during a session of high-powered exercise or while performing simple tasks like cooking and cleaning. In our fast-paced, technologically driven time, this alternative and nontraditional practice can help foster personal self-awareness, a peaceful mind, and internal happiness.</description>

  <description>A heart-stopping, page-turning first novel of a new YA trilogy from the author of the New York Times bestselling Underland Chronicles series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Format: 9 CDs, Unabridged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, the remains of what used be the United States. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When Kat's sister is chosen by lottery, Kat steps up to go in her place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARRATED by Carolyn McCormick</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He is a Legend.&lt;br /&gt;She is a Prodigy.&lt;br /&gt;Who will be Champion?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic—and each other—and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government’s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic’s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country’s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu’s bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion.</description>

  <description>Injured and on the run, it has been seven days since June and Day barely escaped Los Angeles and the Republic with their lives. Day is believed dead having lost his own brother to an execution squad who thought they were assassinating him. June is now the Republic's most wanted traitor. Desperate for help, they turn to the Patriots - a vigilante rebel group sworn to bring down the Republic. But can they trust them or have they unwittingly become pawns in the most terrifying of political games?</description>

  <description>"You must never do anything that might expose our secret. This means that, in general, you cannot form close bonds with humans. You can speak to us, and you can always commune with the Ocean, but you are deadly to humans. You are, essentially, a weapon. A very beautiful weapon. I won't lie to you, it can be a lonely existence, but once you are done, you get to live. All you have to give, for now, is obedience and time..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same speech has been given hundreds of times to hundreds of beautiful girls who enter the sisterhood of sirens. Kahlen has lived by these rules for years now, patiently waiting for the life she can call her own. But when Akinli, a human, enters her world, she can't bring herself to live by the rules anymore. Suddenly the life she's been waiting for doesn't seem nearly as important as the one she's living now.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>Something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interweaving past and present, &lt;i&gt;Bird Box&lt;/i&gt; is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Tanner Scott’s family relocated from California to Utah, a move that nudged the bisexual teen temporarily back into the closet. Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High’s prestigious Seminar—where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester—Tanner can’t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class. And it takes less than a month for Tanner to fall completely in love with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Even the perfect marriage has its dark side… &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris and Will's marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris's happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</description>

  <description>There was a time when the world was sweeter...when the women in Beaufort, North Carolina, wore dresses, and the men donned hats...when something happened to a seventeen-year-old boy that would change his life forever. Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.&lt;br /&gt;Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, &lt;i&gt;The Notebook&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Message in a Bottle&lt;/i&gt;, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories. Now, in &lt;i&gt;A Walk to Remember&lt;/i&gt;, he tells a truly unforgettable story, one that glimmers with all of his magic, holding us spellbound-and reminding us that in life each of us may find one great love, the kind that changes everything...</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Now a major motion picture starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling novel that’s perfect for fans of John Green’s &lt;i&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/i&gt;, two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within a few feet of each other without risking their lives.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you love someone you can never touch?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will’s &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?</description>

  <description>In this heartfelt and emotionally candid contemporary YA, author Jen Malone delves into the life of a teen whose world is brought to an abrupt halt when she learns she’s in dire need of an organ transplant.&lt;br /&gt;Hard-charging and irrepressible eighteen-year-old Amelia Linehan could see a roller derby opponent a mile away—and that’s while crouched down, bent over skates, and zooming around a track at the speed of light. They don’t call her Rolldemort for nothing! What she couldn’t see coming, however, was the unexpected flare-up of a rare liver disorder she was born with. But now it’s the only thing she—and everyone around her—can think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no guarantee of a viable organ transplant, everything Amelia’s been sure of—like her college plans, the mural she’d been commissioned to paint, or the possibility of one day falling in love—has become a huge question mark, threatening to drag her down into a sea of what-ifs she’s desperate to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend from the past shows up. With Will, it’s easy to forget about what’s lurking underneath the lightness of their time together. It’s easy to feel alive when all signs point elsewhere. On the other hand, with the odds decidedly not in her favor, Amelia knows this feeling couldn’t last forever. But what can?</description>

  <description>What does it take to bring the entire Island of Sodor Railway System to a halt? Just a crack in the track. Well, a crack in the track and some hail on the rail . . . and a toad in the road, and a fuss on the bus. In fact, one thing leads to another until just about everything that &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; go wrong &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; go wrong. Luckily, there’s a breakdown train with a couple of cranes that can fix a big mess!</description>

  <description>As everyone knows, &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; is sweeter than tiny baby fingers and chubby baby toes. . . . And here, from two of the most gifted picture-book creators of our time, is a celebration of baby fingers, baby toes, and the joy they—and the babies they belong to—bring to everyone, everywhere, all over the world! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gorgeously simple picture book for very young children, and once you finish the rhythmic, rhyming text, all you’ll want to do is go back to the beginning . . . and read it again! The luminous watercolor illustrations of these roly-poly little ones from a variety of backgrounds are adorable, quirky, and true to life, right down to the wrinkles, dimples, and pudges in their completely squishable arms, legs, and tummies.</description>

Like, so many awful things are already happening that it is actually possible it could go as far as it does in this book. And that’s horrible.

  <description>Every family has its issues. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Maddy, life is all about routine. It has to be, to keep her autistic sister happy and healthy. With just Maddy and her mother as Bee’s full time carers, there’s no time in Maddy’s life for complications like friends, let alone a boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Bee joins a new Riding for the Disabled stable and they meet Albert, the last thing on Maddy’s mind is falling in love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things, she’s about to learn, are outside of our control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Albert has resigned himself to always being a disappointment to his strict father. When he meets Maddy, he gets a glimpse of what being part of a family can be like, and of the tremendous sacrifices that people will make for the ones that they love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differently Normal is a spellbinding story of love that will leave you breathless.</description>

The last 100ish pages were the best part of the story, as they were filled with emotion and intensity that I though the rest of the book was lacking.

  <description>Even as a child, Serenity Jones knew she possessed unusual psychic gifts. Now, decades later, she’s an acclaimed medium and host of her own widely viewed TV show, where she delivers messages to the living from loved ones who have passed. Lately, though, her efforts to boost ratings and garner fame have compromised her clairvoyant instincts. When Serenity books a young war widow to appear as a guest, the episode quickly unravels, stirring up a troubling controversy. And as she tries to undo the damage—to both her reputation and her show—Serenity finds that pride comes at a high price.</description>

  <description>For fans of television shows &lt;i&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Westworld, &lt;/i&gt; this compelling, mind-bending novel is a twisted look into the future, exploring how far we will go to remake ourselves into the perfect human specimen and what it means to be human at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in our world, spanning the near to distant futures, &lt;i&gt;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is a novel made up of six interconnected stories that ask how far we will go to remake ourselves into the perfect human specimens, and how hard that will push the definition of "human."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This extraordinary work explores the amazing possibilities of genetic manipulation and life extension, as well as the ethical quandaries that will arise with these advances. The results range from the heavenly to the monstrous. Deeply thoughtful, poignant, horrifying, and action-packed, Arwen Elys Dayton's &lt;i&gt;Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful&lt;/i&gt; is groundbreaking in both form and substance.</description>

  <description>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the story of Lara Jean, who has never openly admitted her crushes, but instead wrote each boy a letter about how she felt, sealed it, and hid it in a box under her bed. But one day Lara Jean discovers that somehow her secret box of letters has been mailed, causing all her crushes from her past to confront her about the letters: her first kiss, the boy from summer camp, even her sister's ex-boyfriend, Josh. As she learns to deal with her past loves face to face, Lara Jean discovers that something good may come out of these letters after all.</description>

  <description>'You said I was the perfect boyfriend. If you can prove you really love me, perhaps I can be that way again.'&lt;br /&gt;This is the chilling true story of a woman trapped in a devastating relationship as she tries to prove her love – over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within days of spending their first evening together, Alice and Joe were talking about getting married and spending the rest of their lives with each other. Everything about Joe seemed perfect, and Alice was the happiest she’d ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day Joe saw a message on her phone from an old love, and that changed everything. He ignored Alice’s explanations and desperate pleas. And soon the violence and abuse began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she attempted to prove to Joe that he really was her world, Alice gave up everything that mattered to her, including her family, her friends and her job. But still it wasn’t enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the ‘challenges’ started, and finally Alice dared to hope that this time, maybe this time, Joe might just believe she loved him …</description>

  <description>Hazel Camille Bradford knows she’s a lot to take—and frankly, most men aren’t up to the challenge. If her army of pets and thrill for the absurd don’t send them running, her lack of filter means she’ll say exactly the wrong thing in a delicate moment. Their loss. She’s a good soul in search of honest fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh Im has known Hazel since college, where her zany playfulness proved completely incompatible with his mellow restraint. From the first night they met—when she gracelessly threw up on his shoes—to when she sent him an unintelligible email while in a post-surgical haze, Josh has always thought of Hazel more as a spectacle than a peer. But now, ten years later, after a cheating girlfriend has turned his life upside down, going out with Hazel is a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that Josh and Hazel date. At least, not each other. Because setting each other up on progressively terrible double blind dates means there’s nothing between them...right?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fan favorite character Kenji Kishimoto narrates t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;his gripping companion novella to Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling Shatter Me series, set during the explosive events in &lt;em&gt;Restore Me&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette is still reeling from Warner's betrayal, and Kenji is trying to balance his friendship with her with his responsibilities as a leader of the resistance against the Reestablishment. Things get even more interesting when an unexpected person from Omega Point’s past surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending of &lt;em&gt;Restore Me &lt;/em&gt;left readers gasping, and this novella full of Kenji’s signature sass and big heart is the perfect story to tide fans over until &lt;em&gt;Defy Me&lt;/em&gt;, the shocking fifth book in the Shatter Me series, hits shelves in April 2019.</description>

  <description>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of what really happened the day her daughter died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A standalone romantic thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;H2O&lt;/i&gt;…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's been taught to fear him.&lt;br /&gt;He's been taught to fear her.&lt;br /&gt;What if they're both wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In River's world, XYs are a relic of the past, along with things like war and violence. Thanks to the Global Agreements, River's life is simple, safe, and peaceful...until she comes across a body in the road one day. A body that is definitely male, definitely still alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River isn't prepared for this. There's nothing in the Agreements about how to deal with an XY. Yet one lies before her, sick, suffering, and at her mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;River can kill him, or she can save him. Either way, nothing will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Every day a new body. Every day a new life. Every day a new choice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as long as A can remember, life has meant waking up in a different person's body every day, forced to live as that person until the day ended. A always thought there wasn't anyone else who had a life like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But A was wrong. There are others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A has already been wrestling with powerful feelings of love and loneliness. Now comes an understanding of the extremes that love and loneliness can lead to—and what it's like to discover that you are not alone in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Someday&lt;/i&gt;, David Levithan takes readers further into the lives of A, Rhiannon, Nathan, and the person they may think they know as Reverend Poole, exploring more deeply the questions at the core of Every Day and Another Day: What is a soul? And what makes us human?</description>

  <description>Charlotte has spent her twenties adrift, floating from interest to interest, job to job, and guy to guy, searching for a spark but never quite finding it. All she knows is that she won’t discover it working as a waitress at a pies-and-fries joint in Los Angeles or living with her fun but aimless best friend in a tiny apartment in the Arts District.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Charlotte collides with Adam, a gorgeous and soulful painter who seems just as lost as she feels. Their instant connection turns into a midnight drink… and a whirlwind night of champagne, Chinese food, and the kind of conversation that only happens in romantic comedies. But the next morning, Adam gives Charlotte the cold shoulder, leaving her confused and hurt—and wondering if the few odd moments between them the night before were red flags in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later, Charlotte hasn’t been able to shake Adam, so she decides to find out what happened the morning after their magical night together. This fateful decision rewrites their wild love story, but what Charlotte doesn’t know yet is that the ending has already been written.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; “Have you ever heard of supernovas? They shine brighter than anything else in the sky and then fade out really quickly, a short burst of extraordinary energy. I like to think you and Ben were like that . . . in that short time, you had more passion than some people have in a lifetime.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elsie Porter is an average twentysomething and yet what happens to her is anything but ordinary. On a rainy New Year’s Day, she heads out to pick up a pizza for one. She isn’t expecting to see anyone else in the shop, much less the adorable and charming Ben Ross. Their chemistry is instant and electric. Ben cannot even wait twenty-four hours before asking to see her again. Within weeks, the two are head over heels in love. By May, they’ve eloped.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only nine days later, Ben is out riding his bike when he is hit by a truck and killed on impact. Elsie hears the sirens outside her apartment, but by the time she gets downstairs, he has already been whisked off to the emergency room. At the hospital, she must face Susan, the mother-in-law she has never met—and who doesn’t even know Elsie exists.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Interweaving Elsie and Ben’s charmed romance with Elsie and Susan’s healing process&lt;i&gt;, Forever, Interrupted&lt;/i&gt; will remind you that there’s more than one way to find a happy ending.</description>

  <description>Soon to be a major motion picture from Lionsgate starring Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively and Henry Golding, and directed by Paul Feig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She's your best friend. She knows all your secrets. That's why she's so dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single mother's life is turned upside down when her best friend vanishes in this chilling debut thriller in the vein of Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with a simple favor--an ordinary kindness mothers do for one another. When her best friend, Emily, asks Stephanie to pick up her son Nicky after school, she happily says yes. Nicky and her son, Miles, are classmates and best friends, and the five-year-olds love being together--just like she and Emily. A widow and stay-at-home mommy blogger living in woodsy suburban Connecticut, Stephanie was lonely until she met Emily, a sophisticated PR executive whose job in Manhattan demands so much of her time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Emily doesn't come back. She doesn't answer calls or return texts. Stephanie knows something is terribly wrong--Emily would never leave Nicky, no matter what the police say. Terrified, she reaches out to her blog readers for help. She also reaches out to Emily's husband, the handsome, reticent Sean, offering emotional support. It's the least she can do for her best friend. Then, she and Sean receive shocking news. Emily is dead. The nightmare of her disappearance is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is it? Because soon, Stephanie will begin to see that nothing--not friendship, love, or even an ordinary favor--is as simple as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Simple Favor is a remarkable tale of psychological suspense--a clever and twisting free-fall of a ride filled with betrayals and reversals, twists and turns, secrets and revelations, love and loyalty, murder and revenge. Darcey Bell masterfully ratchets up the tension in a taut, unsettling, and completely absorbing story that holds you in its grip until the final page.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The things I've seen are burned into me, like scars that refuse to fade.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, she lived inside the fence. Before, she was never allowed to leave the property, never allowed to talk to Outsiders, never allowed to speak her mind. Because Father John controlled everything—and Father John liked rules. Disobeying Father John came with terrible consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are lies behind Father John's words. Outside, there are different truths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the fire.</description>

  <description>Lacey Barnes has dreamt of being in a movie for as long as she can remember. However, while her dream did include working alongside the hottest actor in Hollywood, it didn’t involve having to finish up her senior year of high school at the same time she was getting her big break. Although that is nothing compared to Donavan, the straight-laced student her father hires to tutor her, who is a full-on nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lacey struggles to juggle her burgeoning career, some on-set sabotage, and an off-screen romance with the unlikeliest of leading men, she quickly learns that sometimes the best stories happen when you go off script.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A dazzling, razor-sharp debut novel about a woman whose obsession with the beautiful actress on her block drives her to the edge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I’ve never crossed their little fenced-in garden, of course. I stand on the sidewalk in front of the fern-and-ivy-filled planter that hangs from the fence—placed there as a sort of screen, I’m sure—and have a direct line of view into the kitchen at night. I’m grateful they’ve never thought to install blinds. That’s how confident they are. No one would dare stand in front of our house and watch us, they think. And they’re probably right: except for me. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In this taut and thrilling debut, an unraveling woman, unhappily childless and recently separated, becomes fixated on her neighbor—the &lt;i&gt;actress. &lt;/i&gt;The unnamed narrator can’t help noticing with wry irony that, though she and the actress live just a few doors apart, a chasm of professional success and personal fulfillment lies between them. The actress, a celebrity with her face on the side of every bus, shares a gleaming brownstone with her handsome husband and their three adorable children, while the narrator, working in a dead-end job, lives in a run-down, three-story walk-up with her ex-husband’s cat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When an interaction with the actress at the annual block party takes a disastrous turn, what began as an innocent preoccupation spirals quickly, and lethally, into a frightening and irretrievable madness. Searing and darkly witty, &lt;i&gt;Looker &lt;/i&gt;is enormously entertaining—at once a propulsive Hitchcockian thriller and a fearlessly original portrait of the perils of envy.</description>

  <description>Colleen Hoover delivers a tour de force novel about a troubled marriage and the one old forgotten promise that might be able to save it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn and Graham’s perfect love is threatened by their imperfect marriage. The memories, mistakes, and secrets that they have built up over the years are now tearing them apart. The one thing that could save them might also be the very thing that pushes their marriage beyond the point of repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Your Perfects&lt;/i&gt; is a profound novel about a damaged couple whose potential future hinges on promises made in the past. This is a heartbreaking page-turner that asks: Can a resounding love with a perfect beginning survive a lifetime between two imperfect people?</description>

  <description>They say time heals all wounds…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been two years since former engineer Gabriel Ivers lost his wife and accepted a job as a building superintendent to be home with his children. His focus is being both mom and dad to his girls, until the beautiful Amelia Blake moves next door and reminds him he’s a man as well as a dad. Just as he begins to hope that his life can once again hold more than homework, chores, and movie-and-manicure nights with his girls, he discovers the reason for the fragility beneath Lia's warm smile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lia is trying to move on with her life after a miscarriage ends all hope for a baby, and a subsequent betrayal destroys her marriage. She’s charmed by her new neighbor with his sparkling manicure, multi-colored hair clips, and his brood of girls, but disturbed by the sexual tension that sizzles between them. Gabe and his daughters remind her of everything she’s always wanted and it would be so easy to take what he's offering her. But is she ready to risk her heart again, especially when her heart isn't the only one in play?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love is easy. Staying in love is hard. Good thing Gabe is a fighter who's determined to prove to Lia he’s in this for the long haul…the rest of their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A collection of humorous autobiographical essays by the beloved comedic actress known for her roles on &lt;i&gt;Freaks and Geeks&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dawson’s Creek&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Cougartown&lt;/i&gt; who has become “the breakout star on Instagram stories...imagine &lt;i&gt;I Love Lucy &lt;/i&gt;mixed with a modern lifestyle guru” (&lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Busy Philipps’s autobiographical book offers the same unfiltered and candid storytelling that her Instagram followers have come to know and love, from growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona and her painful and painfully funny teen years, to her life as a working actress, mother, and famous best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Busy is the rare entertainer whose impressive arsenal of talents as an actress is equally matched by her storytelling ability, sense of humor, and sharp observations about life, love, and motherhood. Her conversational writing reminds us what we love about her on screens large and small. From film to television to Instagram, Busy delightfully showcases her wry humor and her willingness to bare it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I’ve been waiting my whole life to write this book. I’m just so grateful someone asked. Otherwise, what was the point of any of it??”&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I listened to the audiobook and Busy Phillips narrates the book herself, which I think should always be done, so that was appreciated. This book was okay. I didn’t love it, but I didn’t dislike it either. It definitely kept my interest. Busy is quite quirky and put a lot of animation into her nar...]]>

  <description>In an isolated college town in the hills of Southern California, a freshman girl stumbles into her dorm room, falls asleep—and doesn’t wake up. She sleeps through the morning, into the evening. Her roommate, Mei, cannot rouse her. Neither can the paramedics who carry her away, nor the perplexed doctors at the hospital. Then a second girl falls asleep, and then another, and panic takes hold of the college and spreads to the town. As the number of cases multiplies, classes are canceled, and stores begin to run out of supplies. A quarantine is established. The National Guard is summoned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mei, an outsider in the cliquish hierarchy of dorm life, finds herself thrust together with an eccentric, idealistic classmate. Two visiting professors try to protect their newborn baby as the once-quiet streets descend into chaos. A father succumbs to the illness, leaving his daughters to fend for themselves. And at the hospital, a new life grows within a college girl, unbeknownst to her—even as she sleeps. A psychiatrist, summoned from Los Angeles, attempts to make sense of the illness as it spreads through the town. Those infected are displaying unusual levels of brain activity, more than has ever been recorded. They are dreaming heightened dreams—but of what?</description>

  <description>Andrea Oliver's mother, Laura, is the perfect small-town mum. Laura lives a quiet but happy life in sleepy beachside Belle Isle. She's a pillar of the community: a speech therapist, business owner and everybody's friend. And she's never kept a secret from anyone. Or so Andrea thinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Andrea is caught in a random violent attack at a shopping mall, Laura intervenes and acts in a way that is unrecognisable to her daughter. It's like Laura is a completely different person - and that's because she was. Thirty years ago. Before Andrea. Before Belle Isle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura is hailed as a hero for her actions at the mall but 24 hours later she is in hospital, shot by an intruder, who's spent decades trying to track her down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Andrea's mother trying to hide? As elements of the past return and put them both in danger, Andrea is left to piece together Laura's former identity and discover the truth - for better or worse - about her mother. Is the gentle, loving woman who raised her also a violent killer?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;In this riveting domestic suspense debut, a woman's life shatters when she meets a girl she believes is the daughter she lost years ago--and she finds that reclaiming the life she lost might cost her the life she has. &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;i&gt;Tell Me You're Mine&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; is a story of guilt, grief, and the delicate balance between love and obsession.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where is the line between hope and madness?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three women: one who believes she has found her long lost daughter, one terrified she's about to lose her child, and one determined to understand who she truly is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Widstrand is a psychotherapist, a happily married mother to a thirteen-year-old son. But when a young woman named Isabelle steps into her clinic to begin therapy, Stella's placid life begins to crumble. She is convinced that Isabelle is her daughter, Alice. The baby that tragically disappeared more than twenty years ago on a beach during a family vacation. Alice is believed to have drowned, but her body was never found. Stella has always believed that Alice is alive, somewhere--but everyone around her worries she's delusional. &lt;i&gt;Could this be Alice? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella will risk everything to answer that question, but in doing so she will set in motion a sequence of events beyond her control, endangering herself and everyone she loves.</description>

  <description>In the two weeks since her drunken bike accident, Marcelle has been forced to look deeply at her own life. She’s clean and sober now, attending a tough-love version of after-school rehab, and barely hanging out with her user friends. Then one night she gets a mysterious text from her best friend, Hannah, asking Marcelle to cover for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a small, simple lie. But Marcelle learned in group therapy not to enable her drug-using friends. One lie could lead Marcelle back to a dark, dangerous place. But it’s Hannah: beautiful, messed-up, in-deeper-than-anyone-knows Hannah. So Marcelle gives in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, Hannah is missing. Marcelle was the last one to hear from her . . . and now she’s lying to everyone—her parents, Hannah’s mom, and Hannah’s troubled boyfriend. How long can Marcelle go on before she admits to herself what she has to do? If she comes clean about what she knows, can she save Hannah?</description>

  <description>Roses are read, violets are blue, if you hurt us, we’re coming for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deeply secretive Black Coats have been exacting vengeance on men who hurt girls and women for years. And Thea has just received an invitation to join them. This is the opportunity she’s been waiting for to finally get justice for her cousin Natalie, whose killer went free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thea dives head first into the group, training every day with other girls whose stories rival hers. Together they carry out Balancings—acts of revenge guaranteed to teach a lesson. With every predator threatened, every blackmailer exposed, and every date rapist punished, Thea can feel herself getting closer to avenging Natalie’s death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the Balancings begin to escalate in brutality, and Thea discovers that the Black Coats are not all they seem to be. Thea must confront just how far she’s willing to go for justice—and what kind of justice Natalie, and Thea herself, deserve. Because when the line between justice and revenge is razor thin, it’s hard not to get cut.</description>

  <description>At the Medio School for Girls, distinguished young women are trained for one of two roles in their polarized society. Depending on her specialization, a graduate will one day run a husband’s household or raise his children, but both are promised a life of comfort and luxury, far from the frequent political uprisings of the lower class. Daniela Vargas is the school’s top student, but her bright future depends upon no one discovering her darkest secret—that her pedigree is a lie. Her parents sacrificed everything to obtain forged identification papers so Dani could rise above her station. Now that her marriage to an important politico’s son is fast approaching, she must keep the truth hidden or be sent back to the fringes of society, where famine and poverty rule supreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On her graduation night, Dani seems to be in the clear, despite the surprises that unfold. But nothing prepares her for all the difficult choices she must make, especially when she is asked to spy for a resistance group desperately fighting to bring equality to Medio. Will Dani cling to the privilege her parents fought to win for her, or to give up everything she’s strived for in pursuit of a free Medio—and a chance at a forbidden love?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An Amazon Best Book of the Month! A captivating and powerful exploration of the opioid crisis—the deadliest drug epidemic in American history—through the eyes of a college-bound softball star. Edgar Award-winning author Mindy McGinnis delivers a visceral and necessary novel about addiction, family, friendship, and hope. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a car crash sidelines Mickey just before softball season, she has to find a way to hold on to her spot as the catcher for a team expected to make a historic tournament run. Behind the plate is the only place she’s ever felt comfortable, and the painkillers she’s been prescribed can help her get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills do more than take away pain; they make her feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a new circle of friends—fellow injured athletes, others with just time to kill—Mickey finds peaceful acceptance, and people with whom words come easily, even if it is just the pills loosening her tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the pressure to be Mickey Catalan heightens, her need increases, and it becomes less about pain and more about want, something that could send her spiraling out of control.</description>

      <![CDATA[Reading these types of stories as a parent is so much different than reading them as a non-parent. Trust me. I kept picturing Mickey as my daughter in the future and that picture is terrifying. But really, this is so incredibly common and who know what the future will bring? Like I said, terrifyi...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Comedian and star of &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ellie Kemper delivers a hilarious, refreshing, and inspiring collection of essays “teeming with energy and full of laugh-out-loud moments” (Associated Press).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A pleasure. Ellie Kemper is the kind of stable, intelligent, funny, healthy woman that usually only exists in yogurt commercials. But she’s real and she’s all ours!”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; —&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tina Fey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Ellie is a hilarious and talented writer, although we’ll never know how much of this book the squirrel wrote.”—Mindy Kaling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meet Ellie, the best-intentioned redhead next door. You’ll laugh right alongside her as she shares tales of her childhood in St. Louis, whether directing and also starring in her family holiday pageant, washing her dad’s car with a Brillo pad, failing to become friends with a plump squirrel in her backyard, eating her feelings while watching PG-13 movies, or becoming a “sports monster” who ends up warming the bench of her Division 1 field hockey team in college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll learn how she found her comedic calling in the world of improv, became a wife, mother and New Yorker, and landed the role of a bridesmaid (while simultaneously being a bridesmaid) in &lt;i&gt;Bridesmaids. &lt;/i&gt;You’ll get to know and love the comic, upbeat, perpetually polite actress playing Erin Hannon on &lt;i&gt;The Office&lt;/i&gt;, and the exuberant, pink-pants-wearing star of &lt;i&gt;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve ever been curious about what happens behind the scenes of your favorite shows, what it really takes to be a soul cycle “warrior,” how to recover if you accidentally fall on Doris Kearns Goodwin or tell Tina Fey on meeting her for the first time that she has “great hair—really strong and thick,” this is your chance to find out. But it’s also a laugh-out-loud primer on how to keep a positive outlook in a world gone mad and how not to give up on your dreams. Ellie “dives fully into each role—as actor, comedian, writer, and also wife and new mom—with an electric dedication, by which one learns to reframe the picture, and if not exactly &lt;i&gt;become&lt;/i&gt; a glass-half-full sort of person, at least become able to appreciate them” (Vogue.com).</description>

  <description>People travel from afar to the small isle in the Aegean Sea hoping for a single glimpse of Princess Psyche. Their adoration for the mortal woman is so all-consuming that citizens begin to shower her with the very gifts and offerings they once left at the alter of Venus, goddess of love and beauty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But gods are known for their jealousy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cupid, the god of love, takes pleasure in causing strife and mischief in the lives of humans. He uses love as a weapon, humoring in the weakness of people at the whims of their feelings. When his mother Venus approaches him about punishing the human girl who dares to steal her offerings and affections from the people, Cupid gladly accepts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Psyche's punishment is to be given to a mysterious creature who only comes to her in the dark of night under the pact that she will never lay eyes on him. She is terrified of this stranger, who the oracle described as a serpent. Her mate, however, is masterful in his dealings with his bride. He takes his time, morphing her fears into different sensations completely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the Roman/Greek mythology of Cupid and Psyche by Lucius Apuleius, New York Times bestseller Wendy Higgins brings the tale to life, weaving layers that show exactly how a sacrificial lamb can be enchanted by an unseen monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult Historical Fantasy. Standalone.</description>

  <description>It’s 2002, a year after 9/11. It’s an extremely turbulent time politically, but especially so for someone like Shirin, a sixteen-year-old Muslim girl who’s tired of being stereotyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirin is never surprised by how horrible people can be. She’s tired of the rude stares, the degrading comments—even the physical violence—she endures as a result of her race, her religion, and the hijab she wears every day. So she’s built up protective walls and refuses to let anyone close enough to hurt her. Instead, she drowns her frustrations in music and spends her afternoons break-dancing with her brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then she meets Ocean James. He’s the first person in forever who really seems to want to get to know Shirin. It terrifies her—they seem to come from two irreconcilable worlds—and Shirin has had her guard up for so long that she’s not sure she’ll ever be able to let it down.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It’s been five years since Summer Marks was brutally murdered in the woods. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks Mia and Brynn killed their best friend. That driven by their obsession with a novel called &lt;em&gt;The Way into Lovelorn&lt;/em&gt; the three girls had imagined themselves into the magical world where their fantasies became twisted, even deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only thing is: they didn’t do it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the anniversary of Summer’s death, a seemingly insignificant discovery resurrects the mystery and pulls Mia and Brynn back together once again. But as the lines begin to blur between past and present and fiction and reality, the girls must confront what really happened in the woods all those years ago—no matter how monstrous.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-time FindingJoy.net blogger, speaker, marketer, podcaster, and single mom of seven, Rachel Marie Martin presents a rallying cry to anyone who believes the lie that she is "just a mom."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, you willingly pour everything you have into your family, but in the process, you lose the essence of who you are. In her characteristic raw and visceral style, Rachel teaches you how to rewrite the pages of your story, follow your passion, and discover the beauty of who you are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on lessons from her own incredible journey--together with insight from conversations with thousands of other women--Rachel encourages moms to break cycles, take off masks, and prevent fear from taking control. She balances her "no excuses" approach with breathing room and grace for those messy moments in life and mothering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel reminds you there is always a reason to hope, to move forward, and to dare the impossible. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make changes. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pursue dreams, find yourself, and live a life of deep happiness and boundless joy. Stop waiting for "someday." Take hold of the moment, and say yes to your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One night in March, a terrible tragedy shakes the Queens neighborhood where Jessica Nolan and Lucas Rossi live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The year since the shooting has played out differently for Jess and Lucas, both of whom were affected by that night in eerily similar, and deeply personal, ways. Lucas has taken up boxing and lives under the ever-watchful eye of his overprotective parents, while trying to put good into the world through random acts of kindness — to pay back a debt he feels he owes the universe for taking the wrong brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jess struggles to take care of her depressed mother, with the help of her elderly next-door neighbor, and tries to make ends meet. Without her best friend, who’s across the country at a special post-trauma boarding school, and her brother, who died that night, Jess feels totally alone in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jess and Lucas's paths cross at their shared after-school job, they start to become friends… and then more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their community — and their families — were irrevocably changed by a senseless act of violence. But as Jess and Lucas fall in love, they'll learn to help each other heal and move forward — together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;That Night&lt;/i&gt; is an emotional and ultimately hopeful story about tragedy, love, and learning to heal.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>Toddlers can drive you bonkers...so adorable and fun one minute...so stubborn and demanding the next! Yet, as unbelievable as it sounds, there is a way to turn the daily stream of "nos" and "don'ts" into "yeses" and hugs...if you know how to speak your toddler's language. In one of the most useful advances in parenting techniques of the past twenty-five years, Dr. Karp reveals that toddlers, with their immature brains and stormy outbursts, should be thought of not as pint-size people but as pintsize...cavemen. &lt;br /&gt;Having noticed that the usual techniques often failed to calm crying toddlers, Dr. Karp discovered that the key to effective communication was to speak to them in their own primitive language. When he did, suddenly he was able to soothe their outbursts almost every time! This amazing success led him to the realization that children between the ages of one and four go through four stages of "evolutionary" growth, each linked to the development of the brain, and each echoing a step in prehistoric humankind's journey to civilization: &lt;br /&gt;- The "Charming Chimp-Child" (12 to 18 months): Wobbles around on two legs, grabs everything in reach, plays a nonstop game of "monkey see monkey do."&lt;br /&gt;- The "Knee-High Neanderthal" (18 to 24 months): Strong-willed, fun-loving, messy, with a vocabulary of about thirty words, the favorites being "no" and "mine."&lt;br /&gt;- The "Clever Caveman" (24 to 36 months): &lt;br /&gt;Just beginning to learn how to share, make friends, take turns, and use the potty.&lt;br /&gt;- The "Versatile Villager" (36 to 48 months): Loves to tell stories, sing songs and dance, while trying hard to behave. &lt;br /&gt;To speak to these children, Dr. Karp has developed two extraordinarily effective techniques: &lt;br /&gt;1) The "fast food" rule--restating what your child has said to make sure you got it right;&lt;br /&gt;2) The four-step rule--using gesture, repetition, simplicity, and tone to help your &lt;br /&gt;irate Stone-Ager be happy again. &lt;br /&gt;Once you've mastered "toddler-ese," you will be ready to apply behavioral techniques specific to each stage of your child's development, such as teaching patience and calm, doing time-outs (and time-ins), praise through "gossiping," and many other strategies. Then all the major challenges of the toddler years--including separation anxiety, sibling rivalry, toilet training, night fears, sleep problems, picky eating, biting and hitting, medicine taking "-- "can be handled in a way that will make your toddler feel understood. The result: fewer tantrums, less yelling, and, best of all, more happy, loving time for you and your child. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Everyone is ugly sometimes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world not unlike our own, there is a phenomenon called the INEXPLICABLE DEVELOPMENT—a rare occurrence with permanent consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Average-looking, under-the-radar sixteen-year-old Konrad Wolnik's life is turned upside down when, one morning, he wakes up stunningly attractive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That same day, his classmate, Camilla Hadi, has her own transformation; the lean, pretty athlete is now devastatingly ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teens face the cruel world of high school from very different perspectives. Konrad shoots to the top of the pecking order, Camilla slips into pariah status. But soon the school starts rallying around Camilla, and Konrad’s sudden popularity sours as people blame him for her transformation. And, the truth is, so does she. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All he wants is for everyone to like him. All she wants is to destroy his perfect life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if they could use each other for personal gain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in dual POV.</description>

  <description>When college sophomore Angela Birch sneaks from Texas to Mexico for Spring Break, she believes the worst that can happen is her parents finding out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst is falling for the ruse of handsome, alluring Fernando. One spontaneous choice whisks Angela across the world to the pseudo paradise of Spain’s Mediterranean Riviera where she has another choice to make: live cooperatively as one of billionaire Marco Ruiz’s slaves, or die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colin Douglas’s future was seized and choked when deliberate tragedy struck his Scottish family at the age of sixteen. He spent his remaining youthful years infiltrating the U.K.’s crime world, seeking power, control, and revenge, all leading to a position as an undercover agent. With nothing to lose, Colin accepts the seemingly impossible job of rescuing America’s famous missing girl, Angela Birch. Colin knows that to enter a snake lair, one must become a snake. It turns out to be a mission which will put his desire for control to the ultimate test, and make him wish for things he never knew he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*AUTHOR'S NOTE* Escape from Paradise is a work of fiction intended for adult readers, containing graphic sexual scenarios and strong language.</description>

  <description>As Darby Dixon sits in a tiny Texas church bathroom on her wedding day holding a positive pregnancy test, she realizes that of all the bad decisions she's made in her life, marrying her abusive fiancé would be the worst. She's never been able to stand up for herself, but she'll sure as hell stand up for her baby. With just the cash she has on hand, she runs to get a bus ticket to the farthest place she can afford. Between her sheer grit and pageant-queen smile, she lands a job as a front desk clerk at the Colorado Springs Hotel. It's not a glamorous life, but she and her baby are all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A former Marine, Scott "Trex" Trexler has worked in the most dangerous, corrupt, war-torn places on earth. Now he finally has a chance to return to the last place he'd felt at peace--Colorado Springs, Colorado, to take a new job with the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, a top-secret military installation buried deep within the granite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment Trex walks into the inn, Darby knows he's dangerous. There's no way she wants to get involved with another man who seems to be keeping way too many secrets. As charming and devastatingly gorgeous as Trex is, he clearly isn't telling her everything. But as wildfires rage on the mountain and Darby's ex-fiancé shows he isn't so willing to let her go, both she and Trex are soon to find out that what you don't know absolutely can hurt you.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Poignant and chilling by turns, &lt;em&gt;The Opposite of Innocent&lt;/em&gt; is award-winning author Sonya Sones’s most gripping novel in verse yet. It’s the story of a girl named Lily, who’s been crushing on a man named Luke, a friend of her parents, ever since she can remember.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke has been away for two endless years, but he’s finally returning today. Lily was only twelve when he left. But now, at fourteen, she feels transformed. She can’t wait to see how Luke will react when he sees the new her. And when her mother tells her that Luke will be staying with them for a while, in the bedroom right next to hers, her heart nearly stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having Luke back is better than Lily could have ever dreamed. His lingering looks set Lily on fire. Is she just imagining them? But then, when they’re alone, he kisses her. Then he kisses her again. Lily’s friends think anyone &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; age who wants to be with a fourteen-year-old must be really messed up. Maybe even dangerous. But Luke would never do anything to hurt her...would he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this powerful tale of a terrifying leap into young adulthood, readers will accompany Lily on her harrowing journey from hopelessness to hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Wonder Weeks. How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward&lt;/i&gt; describes in easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes that all babies go through during the first 20 months of their lives. This is the extended, "fat" edition with 2 more chapters covering 2 more leaps in the mental development of your baby up to the end of the sensorimotor period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is based on the discovery of a little known phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more tearful, troublesome, demanding and clingy at very nearly the same ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback -- everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Week-by-week guide to baby's behavior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- An explanation of the markers for cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior and how to deal with them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fun games and gentle activities you can do with your child&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book offers parents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Support in times of trouble&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Self-confidence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Help in understanding their baby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hints on how to help their baby play and learn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A unique account of their baby's development&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more detailed information about contents and the research behind the book, please visit &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.thewonderweeks.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.thewonderweeks.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>The gripping fifth installment in the New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly bestselling Shatter Me series. Will Juliette’s broken heart make her vulnerable to the strengthening darkness within her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette’s short tenure as the supreme commander of North America has been an utter disaster. When the children of the other world leaders show up on her doorstep, she wants nothing more than to turn to Warner for support and guidance. But he shatters her heart when he reveals that he’s been keeping secrets about her family and her identity from her—secrets that change everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliette is devastated, and the darkness that’s always dwelled within her threatens to consume her. An explosive encounter with unexpected visitors might be enough to push her over the edge.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this gripping page-turner, an ex-agent on the run from her former employers must take one more case to clear her name and save her life.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used to work for the U.S. government, but very few people ever knew that. An expert in her field, she was one of the darkest secrets of an agency so clandestine it doesn't even have a name. And when they decided she was a liability, they came for her without warning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she rarely stays in the same place or uses the same name for long. They've killed the only other person she trusted, but something she knows still poses a threat. They want her dead, and soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her former handler offers her a way out, she realizes it's her only chance to erase the giant target on her back. But it means taking one last job for her ex-employers. To her horror, the information she acquires only makes her situation more dangerous. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resolving to meet the threat head-on, she prepares for the toughest fight of her life but finds herself falling for a man who can only complicate her likelihood of survival. As she sees her choices being rapidly whittled down, she must apply her unique talents in ways she never dreamed of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tautly plotted novel, Meyer creates a fierce and fascinating new heroine with a very specialized skill set. And she shows once again why she's one of the world's bestselling authors.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Not every mistake deserves a consequence. Sometimes the only thing it deserves is forgiveness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Voss family is anything but normal. They live in a repurposed church, newly baptized Dollar Voss. The once cancer-stricken mother lives in the basement, the father is married to the mother’s former nurse, the little half-brother isn’t allowed to do or eat anything fun, and the eldest siblings are irritatingly perfect. Then, there’s Merit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merit Voss collects trophies she hasn’t earned and secrets her family forces her to keep. While browsing the local antiques shop for her next trophy, she finds Sagan. His wit and unapologetic idealism disarm and spark renewed life into her—until she discovers that he’s completely unavailable. Merit retreats deeper into herself, watching her family from the sidelines when she learns a secret that no trophy in the world can fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up with the lies, Merit decides to shatter the happy family illusion that she’s never been a part of before leaving them behind for good. When her escape plan fails, Merit is forced to deal with the staggering consequences of telling the truth and losing the one boy she loves.</description>

  <description>An ode to Put the Damn Guns Down, this is &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller Jason Reynolds’s fiercely stunning novel that takes place in sixty potent seconds—the time it takes a kid to decide whether or not he’s going to murder the guy who killed his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cannon. A strap.&lt;br /&gt; A piece. A biscuit.&lt;br /&gt; A burner. A heater.&lt;br /&gt; A chopper. A gat.&lt;br /&gt; A hammer&lt;br /&gt; A tool&lt;br /&gt; for RULE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, you can call it a gun. That’s what fifteen-year-old Will has shoved in the back waistband of his jeans. See, his brother Shawn was just murdered. And Will knows the rules. No crying. No snitching. &lt;i&gt;Revenge&lt;/i&gt;. That’s where Will’s now heading, with that gun shoved in the back waistband of his jeans, the gun that was his brother’s gun. He gets on the elevator, seventh floor, stoked. He knows who he’s after. Or does he? As the elevator stops on the sixth floor, on comes Buck. Buck, Will finds out, is who gave Shawn the gun before Will took the gun. Buck tells Will to check that the gun is even loaded. And that’s when Will sees that one bullet is missing. And the only one who could have fired Shawn’s gun was Shawn. Huh. Will didn’t know that Shawn had ever actually USED his gun. Bigger huh. BUCK IS DEAD. But Buck’s in the elevator? Just as Will’s trying to think this through, the door to the next floor opens. A teenage girl gets on, waves away the smoke from Dead Buck’s cigarette. Will doesn’t know her, but she knew him. Knew. When they were eight. And stray bullets had cut through the playground, and Will had tried to cover her, but she was hit anyway, and so what she wants to know, on that fifth floor elevator stop, is, what if Will, Will with the gun shoved in the back waistband of his jeans, MISSES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it goes, the whole long way down, as the elevator stops on each floor, and at each stop someone connected to his brother gets on to give Will a piece to a bigger story than the one he thinks he knows. A story that might never know an END…if WILL gets &lt;i&gt;off &lt;/i&gt;that elevator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told in short, fierce staccato narrative verse, &lt;i&gt;Long Way Down&lt;/i&gt; is a fast and furious, dazzlingly brilliant look at teenage gun violence, as could only be told by Jason Reynolds.</description>

  <description>Thousands of books have examined the effects of parents on their children. But almost none have thought to ask: What are the effects of children on their parents?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;All Joy and No Fun&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior tries to tackle this question, isolating and analyzing the many ways in which children reshape their parents' lives, whether it's their marriages, their jobs, their habits, their hobbies, their friendships, or their internal senses of self. She argues that changes in the last half century have radically altered the roles of today's mothers and fathers, making their mandates at once more complex and far less clear. Recruiting from a wide variety of sources—in history, sociology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology—she dissects both the timeless strains of parenting and the ones that are brand new, and then brings her research to life in the homes of ordinary parents around the country. The result is an unforgettable series of family portraits, starting with parents of young children and progressing to parents of teens. Through lively and accessible storytelling, Senior follows these mothers and fathers as they wrestle with some of parenthood's deepest vexations—and luxuriate in some of its fi nest rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meticulously researched yet imbued with emotional intelligence, &lt;em&gt;All Joy and No Fun&lt;/em&gt; makes us reconsider some of our culture's most basic beliefs about parenthood, all while illuminating the profound ways children deepen and add purpose to our lives. By focusing on parenthood, rather than parenting, the book is original and essential reading for mothers and fathers of today—and tomorrow.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Abby Turner’s summer isn’t going the way she’d planned. She has a not-so-secret but definitely unrequited crush on her best friend, Cooper. She hasn’t been able to manage her mother’s growing issues with anxiety. And now she’s been rejected from an art show because her work “has no heart.” So when she gets another opportunity to show her paintings Abby isn’t going to take any chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is where the list comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby gives herself one month to do ten things, ranging from face a fear (#3) to learn a stranger’s story (#5) to fall in love (#8). She knows that if she can complete the list she’ll become the kind of artist she’s always dreamed of being. But as the deadline approaches, Abby realizes that getting through the list isn’t as straightforward as it seems… and that maybe—just maybe—she can’t change her art if she isn’t first willing to change herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first in a set of three standalone books with crossover characters.</description>

  <description>When seventeen-year-old Zae Monroe gets cheated on by the only guy she’s ever loved, then watches her parents' marriage crumble, she decides to forget about relationships and turn the tables on the boys of the world. It’s time to take what she wants, and what she wants are kisses. Athletes, musicians, poets, and bad boys—their lips are all on her agenda, and it's time to collect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zae proposes a contest with her friends to see who can kiss the most boys during spring break. But what starts as a harmless competition leads to a downward spiral she can’t seem to break free of. As family, academic, friend, and guy drama come to a head, Zae is forced to face the reasons behind her boy angst, and starts to wonder if she was wrong about the male race...or at least some of them.</description>

  <description>Since that first bus ride to Camp Chinooka twenty long years ago, Gigi Goldstein has been pining for her best friend’s guy. She knows her crush is wrong and has to stop, but her heart won’t listen to reason. To escape the agony of their impending wedding, Gigi accepts a summer job at the only place she’s ever been happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But working at Chinooka isn’t all campfire songs and toasting marshmallows. Gigi’s girls are determined to make her look bad in front of the boys’ Head Counselor—the sexy but infuriating Perry—and every inch of the campground is laced with memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gigi realizes she can’t fix the present by hiding in the past, she’s forced to reexamine her choices. Maybe everything she thought she wanted wasn’t what she actually needed... But if she can get her act together, Gigi might have one last shot at the summer love of her dreams.</description>

  <description>Juliette Ferrars thought she'd won. She took over Sector 45, was named the new Supreme Commander, and now has Warner by her side. But she's still the girl with the ability to kill with a single touch—and now she's got the whole world in the palm of her hand. When tragedy hits, who will she become? Will she be able to control the power she wields and use it for good?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Debut author Dawn Kurtagich is &lt;i&gt;dead on &lt;/i&gt;in this terrifying psychological thriller!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Over two decades have passed since the fire at Elmbridge High, an inferno that took the lives of five teenagers. Not much was known about the events leading up to the tragedy - only that one student, Carly Johnson, vanished without a trace...&lt;br /&gt;...until a diary is found hidden in the ruins.&lt;br /&gt;But the diary, badly scorched, does not belong to Carly Johnson. It belongs to Kaitlyn Johnson, a girl who shouldn't exist Who was Kaitlyn? Why did she come out only at night? What is her connection to Carly?&lt;br /&gt;The case has been reopened. Police records are being reexamined: psychiatric reports, video footage, text messages, e-mails. And the diary.&lt;br /&gt;The diary that paints a much more sinister version of events than was ever made publicly known.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;A revenge that will consume her. A love that will ruin her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emelina Flores has nothing. Her home in Ruina has been ravaged by war. She lacks the powers of her fellow Ruined. Worst of all, she witnessed her parents’ brutal murders and watched helplessly as her sister, Olivia, was kidnapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because Em has nothing, she has nothing to lose. Driven by a blind desire for revenge, Em sets off on a dangerous journey to the enemy kingdom of Lera. Somewhere within Lera’s borders, Em hopes to find Olivia. But in order to find her, Em must infiltrate the royal family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a brilliant, elaborate plan of deception and murder, Em marries Prince Casimir, next in line to take Lera’s throne. If anyone in Lera discovers Em is not Casimir’s true betrothed, Em will be executed on the spot. But it’s the only way to salvage Em’s kingdom and what is left of her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Em is determined to succeed, but the closer she gets to the prince, the more she questions her mission. Em’s rage-filled heart begins to soften. But with her life—and her family—on the line, love could be Em’s deadliest mistake.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Wattpad phenom Sarah White comes a steamy teen romance about one girl’s quest to find herself after a traumatic breakup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing worse than having your boyfriend dump you is having him dump you for your best friend. For Everly Morgan the betrayal came out of nowhere. One moment she had what seemed like the perfect high school relationship, and the next, she wanted to avoid the two most important people in her life. Every time she sees them kiss in the hallways her heart breaks a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing on Everly’s mind is getting into another relationship, but when she meets Gabe in her therapist’s waiting room she can’t deny their immediate connection. Somehow he seems to understand Everly in a way that no one else in her life does, and maybe it’s because Gabe also has experience grappling with issues outside of his control. Just because they share so many of the same interests and there is an undeniable spark between them doesn’t mean Everly wants anything more than friendship. After all, when you only barely survived your last breakup, is it really worth risking your heart again?</description>

  <description>***Angelbound is now an audio book read by the author, Christina Bauer***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eighteen year old Myla Lewis is a girl who loves two things: kicking ass and kicking ass. She’s not your every day quasi-demon, half-demon and half-human, girl. For the past five years, Myla has lived for the days she gets to fight in Purgatory’s arena. When souls want a trial by combat for their right to enter heaven or hell, they go up against her, and she hasn’t lost a battle yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as she starts her senior year at Purgatory High, the arena fights aren’t enough to keep her spirits up anymore. When the demons start to act weird, even for demons, and the King of the Demons, Armageddon, shows up at Myla’s school, she knows that things are changing and it’s not looking good for the quasi-demons. Myla starts to question everything, and doesn’t like the answers she finds. What happened seventeen years ago that turned the quasi-demons into slave labor? Why was her mom always so sad? And why won’t anyone tell her who her father is? Things heat up when Myla meets Lincoln, the High Prince of the Thrax, a super sexy half-human and half-angel demon hunter. But what’s a quasi-demon girl to do when she falls for a demon hunter? It’s a good thing that Myla’s not afraid of breaking a few rules. With a love worth fighting for, Myla’s going to shake up Purgatory.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A three-time winner of Goodreads Choice Awards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil’s name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what really went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does—or does not—say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.</description>

  <description>USA Today and New York Times bestselling author, Wendy Higgins, brings you the gripping, sensual conclusion to her apocalyptic trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber Tate never dreamed their heart-wrenching escape from the enemy’s attack would lead them to the most beautiful place she’s ever seen, marred by one ugly fact; it’s under enemy control. Like everywhere else in the world, Elmendorf military base in Alaska has been captured, and it’s time to take it back—all of it—one base, one city at a time. After losing so much, Amber clings to the only precious person she has left, and vows to sacrifice everything to help save the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remy Haines is a lover, not a fighter, so when she finds herself in enemy territory, expected to feign allegiance while gathering intel for the rebel cause, she’s never been more out of her element. Tensions only increase when her feelings for Jacob “Tater” Tate won’t go away, and the enemy’s leader takes an interest in her. She’s torn between what her heart wants, and what she knows she should do. As for what her body needs…well, it’s always had a mind of its own.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Wendy Higgins brings you the second book in this thrilling war-torn world... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Being on the run in the desert means food and sanctuary are hard to come by, but Amber Tate and her crew are not about to give up. Not after having the things they love brutally ripped from them by an unknown enemy who sent their world into the apocalypse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Survival takes precedence, but once safe shelter is found, their guards fall and the emotions they've been holding in are finally released. Anger, insecurities...lust. In their tight quarters, Amber, Rylen, Tater, and Remy can't escape it. The past must be faced, and passions run even stronger in the darkest of times. In the midst of unrest, their worlds are rocked again when they discover the truth about the war that's ruined their lives. They thought finding out the enemy's identity would give them the edge; instead it's revealed terrifying dangers they never thought possible.</description>

  <description>A terrifying psychological thriller about obsession and power, perfect for fans of Gone Girl and Before I Go to Sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarissa is becoming more and more frightened of her colleague, Rafe. He won’t leave her alone, and he refuses to take no for an answer. He is always there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being selected for jury service is a relief. The courtroom is a safe haven, a place where Rafe can’t be. But as a violent tale of kidnap and abuse unfolds, Clarissa begins to see parallels between her own situation and that of the young woman on the witness stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing that she bears the burden of proof, Clarissa unravels the twisted, macabre fairytale that Rafe has spun around them – and discovers that the ending he envisions is more terrifying than she could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It all started at a dinner party. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;A domestic suspense debut about a young couple and their apparently friendly neighbors--a twisty, rollercoaster ride of lies, betrayal, and the secrets between husbands and wives. . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne and Marco Conti seem to have it all--a loving relationship, a wonderful home, and their beautiful baby, Cora. But one night when they are at a dinner party next door, a terrible crime is committed. Suspicion immediately focuses on the parents. But the truth is a much more complicated story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the curtained house, an unsettling account of what actually happened unfolds. Detective Rasbach knows that the panicked couple is hiding something. Both Anne and Marco soon discover that the other is keeping secrets, secrets they've kept for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is the nerve-racking unraveling of a family--a chilling tale of deception, duplicity, and unfaithfulness that will keep you breathless until the final shocking twist.</description>

  <description>A work of great personal courage and a literary tour de force, this bestseller is Styron's true account of his descent into a crippling and almost suicidal depression.

  <description>In this breathless third installment to Victoria Aveyard’s bestselling Red Queen series, allegiances are tested on every side. And when the Lightning Girl's spark is gone, who will light the way for the rebellion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mare Barrow is a prisoner, powerless without her lightning, tormented by her lethal mistakes. She lives at the mercy of a boy she once loved, a boy made of lies and betrayal. Now a king, Maven Calore continues weaving his dead mother's web in an attempt to maintain control over his country—and his prisoner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Mare bears the weight of Silent Stone in the palace, her once-ragtag band of newbloods and Reds continue organizing, training, and expanding. They prepare for war, no longer able to linger in the shadows. And Cal, the exiled prince with his own claim on Mare's heart, will stop at nothing to bring her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When blood turns on blood, and ability on ability, there may be no one left to put out the fire—leaving Norta as Mare knows it to burn all the way down.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?</description>

  <description>The Emmy Award-winning comedian, actress, writer, and star of &lt;i&gt;Inside Amy Schumer &lt;/i&gt;and the acclaimed film &lt;i&gt;Trainwreck&lt;/i&gt; has taken the entertainment world by storm with her winning blend of smart, satirical humor. Now, Amy Schumer has written a refreshingly candid and uproariously funny collection of (&lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt;) personal and observational essays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo&lt;/i&gt;, Amy mines her past for stories about her teenage years, her family, relationships, and sex and shares the experiences that have shaped who she is - a woman with the courage to bare her soul to stand up for what she believes in, all while making us laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranging from the raucous to the romantic, the heartfelt to the harrowing, this highly entertaining and universally appealing collection is the literary equivalent of a night out with your best friends - an unforgettable and fun adventure that you wish could last forever. Whether she's experiencing lust-at-first-sight while in the airport security line, sharing her own views on love and marriage, admitting to being an introvert, or discovering her cross-fit instructor's secret bad habit, Amy Schumer proves to be a bighearted, brave, and thoughtful storyteller that will leave you nodding your head in recognition, laughing out loud, and sobbing uncontrollably - but only because it's over.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If there’s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it’s that she’s different.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mare Barrow’s blood is red—the color of common folk—but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince—the friend—who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not the only one of her kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of rebellion? Or have treachery and betrayal hardened her forever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electrifying next installment in the Red Queen series escalates the struggle between the growing rebel army and the blood-segregated world they’ve always known—and pits Mare against the darkness that has grown in her soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Ellen Degeneres' winning, upbeat candor has made her show one of the most popular, resilient and honored daytime shows on the air, and her life makes for great (and very funny) reading.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I've experienced a whole lot the last few years and I have a lot to share. So I hope that you'll take a moment to sit back, relax and enjoy the words I've put together for you in this book.

      <![CDATA[3.5/5 stars<br /><br />This review and more: <a href="http://sharinginspiredkreations.com" rel="nofollow">Sharing Inspired Kreations</a><br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I expected to. I thought that it was going to be a bit more real and just more about her life than it actually was. The synopsis makes it sound like Ellen humorously talks about her life...</a>]]>

  <description>An irresistible story from Kasie West that explores the timeless question: What do you do when you fall for the person you least expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Autumn Collins finds herself accidentally locked in the library for an entire weekend, she doesn't think things could get any worse. But that's before she realizes that Dax Miller is locked in with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autumn doesn't know much about Dax except that he's trouble. Between the rumors about the fight he was in (and that brief stint in juvie that followed it) and his reputation as a loner, he's not exactly the ideal person to be stuck with. Still, she just keeps reminding herself that it is only a matter of time before Jeff, her almost-boyfriend, realizes he left her in the library and comes to rescue her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only he doesn't come. No one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead it becomes clear that Autumn is going to have to spend the next couple of days living off vending-machine food and making conversation with a boy who clearly wants nothing to do with her. Except there is more to Dax than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he and Autumn at first grudgingly, and then not so grudgingly, open up to each other, Autumn is struck by their surprising connection. But can their feelings for each other survive once the weekend is over and Autumn's old life, and old love interest, threaten to pull her from Dax's side?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Fate. Hate. Love. Lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which four letter word will change their lives forever?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney Paige was never so mortified to hear the words "wrong number" in her life. She meant to tell off the guy who broke her best friend's heart but unleashed her anger on a perfect stranger instead. And now her world is turned upside down by the captivating man who wants to keep her on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian Savage is living a life he's quickly come to hate-until Sydney's wild rant has him hooked and hungry for more. Soon the sexy woman on the phone becomes the lover in his bed. But Brian has secrets, and the closer he lets Syd get, the harder it is to shield her from the devastating mistakes of his past . . .</description>

  <description>The past few years have held more surprises than part-angel Clara Gardner could ever have anticipated. Yet from the dizzying highs of first love, to the agonizing low of losing someone close to her, the one thing she can no longer deny is that she was never meant to live a normal life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since discovering the special role she plays among the other angel-bloods, Clara has been determined to protect Tucker Avery from the evil that follows her . . . even if it means breaking both their hearts. Leaving town seems like the best option, so she’s headed back to California - and so is Christian Prescott, the irresistible boy from the vision that started her on this journey in the first place.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Clara makes her way in a world that is frighteningly new, she discovers that the fallen angel who attacked her is watching her every move. And he’s not the only one. . . . With the battle against the Black Wings looming, Clara knows she must finally fulfill her destiny. But it won’t come without sacrifices and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the riveting finale of the Unearthly series, Clara must decide her fate once and for all.</description>

However, I would say that it was my least favourite out of the three. Why? Well, I’m not really sure. Something about it failed to captivate me as wonderfully as the first two books did.

  <description>For months Clara Gardner trained to face the fire from her visions, but she wasn't prepared for the choice she had to make that day. And in the aftermath, she discovered that nothing about being part angel is as straightforward as she thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, torn between her love for Tucker and her complicated feelings about the roles she and Christian seem destined to play in a world that is both dangerous and beautiful, Clara struggles with a shocking revelation: Someone she loves will die in a matter of months. With her future uncertain, the only thing Clara knows for sure is that the fire was just the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this compelling sequel to &lt;em&gt;Unearthly&lt;/em&gt;, Cynthia Hand captures the joy of first love, the anguish of loss, and the confusion of becoming who you are.</description>

  <description>Raising Ellie as a single mom in San Francisco, Mele Bart navigates the mommy minefields to the best of her ability. She’s found her parent group – Annie, Barrett, Georgia, and Henry – who have meaningful playground conversations and complain about the parents who try too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Bobby returns with the news he’s getting married and wants Ellie to be the flower girl. Plagued by her obsession over Bobbie and his cheese-making, Napa-residing, ever-so-perfect fiancée, Male seeks a distraction and finds it in a cookbook-writing contest sponsored by the San Francisco Mommy Club. She interviews members of her parenting group for inspiration – the results and explosively, hilariously honest. Mele doesn’t expect to ignite long-latent appetites, both culinary and romantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the author whose work has been lauded as “funny, insightful, and unsentimental” (&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;); “gorgeous sand smart” (&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;); “sad and exhilarating” (&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;) and who strikes “an enviable balance of humour and gravitas” (&lt;i&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;How to Party with an Infant&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant and piercing journey through the helicopter parenting of the twenty-first century, guided by the unforgettable Male Bart.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;So many secrets are buried within these compound walls. &lt;br /&gt;I used to be one of those secrets.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After returning to the Diotech compound and undergoing an experimental new memory alteration, Seraphina is now a loyal, obedient servant to Dr. Alixter and the powerful company that created her. Happy and in love with Kaelen, another scientifically-enhanced human designed to be her perfect match, Sera’s history with a boy named Zen is just a distant memory from a rebellious past she longs to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Sera and Kaelen embark on a nationwide tour to promote Diotech’s new product line—a collection of controversial genetic modifications available to the public—Sera’s mind starts to rebel. She can’t stop the memories of Zen from creeping back in.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As more secrets are revealed, more enemies are uncovered, and the reality of a Diotech-controlled world grows closer every day, Sera will have to choose where her true loyalties lie, but it’s a choice that may cost her everything she’s ever loved.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Some memories are better left forgotten...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a daring escape from the scientists at Diotech who created her, Seraphina believes she is finally safe from the horrors of her past. But new threats await Sera and her boyfriend, Zen, at every turn as Zen falls prey to a mysterious illness and Sera’s extraordinary abilities make it more and more difficult to stay hidden. Meanwhile, Diotech has developed a dangerous new weapon designed to apprehend her. A weapon that even Sera will be powerless to stop. Her only hope of saving Zen’s life and defeating the company that made her is a secret buried deep within her mind. A secret that Diotech will kill to protect. And it won’t stay forgotten for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packed with mystery, suspense, and romance, this riveting second installment of Jessica Brody’s Unremembered trilogy delivers more heart-pounding action as loyalties are tested, love becomes a weapon, and no one’s memories are safe.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Before the crash of Freedom Airlines flight 121...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a top-secret research compound hidden deep in the desert.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was a girl held prisoner in a restricted sector. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there was a boy who found her. And risked everything to set her free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romantic and action-packed, Undiscovered is sure to thrill fans of Jessica Brody’s Unremembered trilogy. In this 100-page novella, told from Zen’s point of view, more secrets are revealed about Seraphina’s forgotten past, the corporation that created her, and the boy who fell in love with her. Undiscovered also includes a sneak peek of Unforgotten, the anticipated second book in the trilogy.</description>

  <description>One introverted girl.&lt;br /&gt;One extroverted guy.&lt;br /&gt;One assignment.&lt;br /&gt;One afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;Then everything changed…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You destroyed me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novah wanted nothing more than to walk away, never see him again. She was determined to pick up the pieces of her tarnished reputation and move on. Her torture became her muse, earning her well-deserved notoriety for capturing beauty with her lens. She had come full circle. She had it all…until he returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nolan found himself surrounded by the grim facets of life, no longer the prominent boy from an affluent family who’d caught Novah’s eye. The years had been unkind and left him in the dark, painful trenches of life. He needed her help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen years can equate to a lifetime of change, neither one the same person they once were. Despite the humiliation, the latent wounds, the missing years…they’re destined to heal one another in unexpected ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You saved me.”</description>

  <description>When a bestselling debut novel from mysterious author J.Colby becomes the literary event of the year, Emiline reads it reluctantly. As an adjunct writing instructor at UC San Diego with her own stalled literary career and a bumpy long-term relationship, Emiline isn’t thrilled to celebrate the accomplishments of a young and gifted writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet from the very first page, Emiline is entranced by the story of Emerson and Jackson, two childhood best friends who fall in love and dream of a better life beyond the long dirt road that winds through their impoverished town in rural Ohio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s because the novel is patterned on Emiline’s own dark and desperate childhood, which means that “J. Colby” must be Jase: the best friend and first love she hasn’t seen in over a decade. Far from being flattered that he wrote the novel from her perspective, Emiline is furious that he co-opted her painful past and took some dramatic creative liberties with the ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way she can put her mind at ease is to find and confront “J. Colby,” but is she prepared to learn the truth behind the fiction?</description>

  <description>In this first installment of NY Times bestselling author, Wendy Higgins's debut New Adult series, a frighteningly realistic apocalyptic America is brought to life, entwined with searing romantic tension that will leave you eager for more. &lt;br /&gt; ***&lt;br /&gt; Amber Tate believes the worst thing she'll suffer in life is dealing with the unrequited love she feels for her brother's best friend, Rylen Fite. She also believes war is something unfortunate that happens places far, far away from her rural Nevada town. She's wrong on both counts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When an unknown organization meticulously bombs major cities in the United States and across the globe, a trickle-down effect spreads to remaining towns at an alarming speed-everything from food and water sources to technology and communications are compromised. Without leadership, the nation is split between paralysis and panic, but Amber isn't one to hide or watch helplessly. She's determined to put her nursing skills to use, despite the danger, even if it means working alongside the man she can never have.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;She's about to make a deal with the college bad boy...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Wells has finally found someone who turns her on. But while she might be confident in every other area of her life, she's carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction. If she wants to get her crush's attention, she'll have to step out of her comfort zone and &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; him take notice... even if it means tutoring the annoying, childish, &lt;i&gt;cocky&lt;/i&gt; captain of the hockey team in exchange for a pretend date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and it's going to be oh so good.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Garrett Graham has ever wanted is to play professional hockey after graduation, but his plummeting GPA is threatening everything he's worked so hard for. If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he's all for it. But when one unexpected kiss leads to the wildest sex of both their lives, it doesn't take long for Garrett to realize that pretend isn't going to cut it. Now he just has to convince Hannah that the man she wants looks a lot like &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Only fools fall in love...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her senior year of high school leaves behind nothing but heartache, Olivia Beaumont is sure of this: She’s no stupid girl. She sets out for Winston University, promising herself that she will remain focused on her first and only love – astronomy. But all it takes is cocky sophomore Brax Jenkins and an accidental collision with a football, to throw her entire year off course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick-tempered Southie who escaped the inner city streets of Boston to pitch for Winston, Brax is known to play way more fields than just the baseball diamond. So, when his name is drawn to take part in his fraternity’s hazing dare, Brax eagerly accepts the mission to take Olivia’s virginity. But he doesn’t plan on falling hard for the sweet and sassy Texas girl who sees right through his bad-boy persona. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Olivia and Brax battle their feelings for each other, echoes of the past year begin to surface. A boy who once turned Olivia’s whole world upside down reappears, and “harmless” pranks wreak havoc. Pretty soon the aspiring astronomer is on the verge of revealing her most difficult, heartbreaking secret. All the while, Brax must wrestle with the irrevocable dare, and Olivia struggles against all logic as she does the one thing only a stupid girl would do: fall in love.</description>

  <description>This is a world divided by blood - red or silver. The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like superpowers. And to Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing will ever change. That is until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace. Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most, Mare discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that threatens to destroy the balance of power. Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver prince. Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help the Red Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime. But this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance - Reds against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart.</description>

  <description>Kate Weston can piece together most of the bash at John Doone’s house: shots with Stacey Stallard, Ben Cody taking her keys and getting her home early—the feeling that maybe he’s becoming more than just the guy she’s known since they were kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a picture of Stacey passed out over Deacon Mills’s shoulder appears online the next morning, Kate suspects she doesn’t have all the details. When Stacey levels charges against four of Kate’s classmates, the whole town erupts into controversy. Facts that can’t be ignored begin to surface, and every answer Kate finds leads back to the same question: Where was Ben when a terrible crime was committed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story—inspired by real events—from debut novelist Aaron Hartzler takes an unflinching look at silence as a form of complicity. It’s a book about the high stakes of speaking up, and the razor thin line between guilt and innocence that so often gets blurred, one hundred and forty characters at a time.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9781594633669&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy. And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar. Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;“Aerity…” Her father paused as if the words he was forming pained him. “I must ask you to sacrifice the promise of love for the sake of our kingdom.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She could only stare back, frozen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a strange beast terrorizes the kingdom of Lochlanach, fear stirs revolt. In an act of desperation, a proclamation is sent to all of Eurona—kill the creature and win the ultimate prize: the daughter of King Lochson’s hand in marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Princess Aerity knows her duty to the kingdom but cannot bear the idea of marrying a stranger... until a brooding local hunter, Paxton Seabolt, catches her attention. There’s no denying the unspoken lure between them... or his mysterious resentment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paxton is not the marrying type. Nor does he care much for spoiled royals and their arcane laws. He’s determined to keep his focus on the task at hand—ridding the kingdom of the beast—but the princess continues to surprise him, and the perilous secrets he’s buried begin to surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the Grimm Brothers’ tale “The Singing Bone,” New York Times bestselling author Wendy Higgins delivers a dark fantasy filled with rugged hunters, romantic tension, and a princess willing to risk all to save her kingdom.</description>

  <description>Livvy is on the run. And she’s escaped to the one place nobody will ever find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the isolated cottage isn’t empty. Her refuge is home to a troubled stranger, Tom, there for reasons of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the intimacy of the abandoned cottage, and the remote wilderness of the island, the electrifying connection between them is impossible to ignore. Both running from their histories and shielding dark secrets, their pasts catch up with them and collide in an unimaginable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep emotions and powerful chemistry face a painful battle with the tangle of lies, and scars of the past. When the truth emerges, hearts will be shattered.</description>

  <description>Schizoaffective disorder: a mental illness in which a person experiences a combination of mood disorder and schizophrenia symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;I know about this illness—very well—because I suffer from it. It’s been four years since my diagnosis, and ever since, I’ve been living in a dark hole. Voices constantly invading my thoughts. Hallucinations. All of which force me to question if what I’m experiencing is even reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here I am, still hanging on, still breathing and living through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until he stumbled into my life. Logan Reed. I don’t want any part of him. I’ve pushed him away, but he isn’t easily deterred. I’ve told him I’m different, but he doesn’t care. He’s trying to slowly break me down. I’m trying just as hard not to let him. He doesn’t know how truly damaged I am; what will happen when he does?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the truth—he’ll never be able to look at me the same way again. Just like everybody else.</description>

  <description>It's customary for Gothic romance novels to include a mysterious girl locked in the attic. Hannah Smith just wishes she wasn't that girl. As a narcoleptic and the companion to an earl's daughter with a strange affliction of her own, Hannah knows she's lucky to have a roof over her head and food in her belly when so many orphans starve on the streets. Yet freedom is something Hannah longs for. She did not, however, want her freedom to arrive in the form of kidnapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken by handsome Jack Langley to a place known as Freak House, she finds herself under the same roof as a mad scientist, his niece, a mute servant and Jack, a fire starter with a mysterious past. They assure Hannah she is not a prisoner and that they want to help her. The problem is, they think she's the earl's daughter. What will they do when they discover they took the wrong girl?</description>

  <description>From author Andrew Fukuda comes &lt;i&gt;The Trap, &lt;/i&gt;the explosive finale to The Hunt trilogy—perfect for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After barely escaping the Mission alive, Gene and Sissy face an impossible task: staying alive long enough to stop an entire world bent on their destruction. Bound on a train heading into the unknown with the surviving Mission girls, Gene, Sissy, David, and Epap must stick together and use everything they have to protect each other and their only hope: the cure that will turn the blood-thirsty creatures around them into humans again. Now that they know how to reverse the virus, Gene and Sissy have one final chance to save those they love and create a better life for themselves. But as they struggle to get there, Gene's mission sets him on a crash course with Ashley June, his first love . . . and his deadliest enemy.</description>

  <description>The battle rages on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Bell and Cole Holland's crew of zombie slayers thought they'd won the war against Anima Industries, the evil company responsible for capturing and experimenting on zombies in an effort to discover the secret to immortality. In the last epic clash, the slayers lost many of their crew and closest friends. But Frosty, the ice man himself, has not recovered from one casualty in particular—the love of his life, Kat Parker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the path to self-annihilation, Frosty receives a message from beyond—Kat's spirit returns, insisting he partner with rogue slayer Camilla Marks. Frosty will do anything for Kat. Except that. Camilla is the one who betrayed them all, leading to Kat's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Anima rises from the grave to become a force the slayers may not have the strength to overcome, Frosty, Camilla and all the slayers will have to work together to survive. And one broken slayer will learn that sometimes, the line between hate and attraction is blurred...and the road to redemption isn't through revenge, but in letting go of the past and grabbing hold of the futur</description>

  <description>HER PERFECT LIFE IS A PERFECT LIE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager at the prestigious Bradley School, Ani FaNelli endured a shocking, public humiliation that left her desperate to reinvent herself. Now, with a glamorous job, expensive wardrobe, and handsome blue blood fiancé, she’s this close to living the perfect life she’s worked so hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ani has a secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something else buried in her past that still haunts her, something private and painful that threatens to bubble to the surface and destroy everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a singular voice and twists you won’t see coming, Luckiest Girl Alive explores the unbearable pressure that so many women feel to “have it all” and introduces a heroine whose sharp edges and cutthroat ambition have been protecting a scandalous truth, and a heart that's bigger than it first appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question remains: will breaking her silence destroy all that she has worked for—or, will it at long last, set Ani free?</description>

  <description>For Gene and the remaining humans—or hepers—death is just a heartbeat away. On the run and hunted by society, they must find a way to survive in The Vast... and avoid the hungry predators tracking them in the dark. But they’re not the only things following Gene. He’s haunted by the girl he left behind and his burgeoning feelings for Sissy, the human girl at his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they discover a refuge of exiled humans living high in the mountains, Gene and his friends think they’re finally safe. Led by a group of intensely secretive elders, the civilisation begins to raise more questions than answers. A strict code of behaviour is the rule, harsh punishments are meted out, young men are nowhere to be found—and Gene begins to wonder if the world they’ve entered is just as evil as the one they left behind. As life at the refuge grows more perilous, he and Sissy only grow closer. In an increasingly violent world, all they have is each other... if they can only stay alive.</description>

  <description>For readers of Claire Messud and Mary Gaitskill comes a striking debut novel of marriage, fidelity, sex, and morality, featuring a fascinating heroine who struggles to live a life with meaning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hausfrau&lt;br /&gt;haus·frau \haus-frau\ n 1: Origin: German.&lt;br /&gt;Housewife, homemaker. 2: A married woman. 3: A novel by Jill Alexander Essbaum &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna was a good wife, mostly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna Benz, an American in her late thirties, lives with her Swiss husband, Bruno—a banker—and their three young children in a postcard-perfect suburb of Zürich. Though she leads a comfortable, well-appointed life, Anna is falling apart inside. Adrift and increasingly unable to connect with the emotionally unavailable Bruno or even with her own thoughts and feelings, Anna tries to rouse herself with new experiences: German language classes, Jungian analysis, and a series of sexual affairs she enters with an ease that surprises even her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Anna can't easily extract herself from these affairs. When she wants to end them, she finds it's difficult. Tensions escalate, and her lies start to spin out of control. Having crossed a moral threshold, Anna will discover where a woman goes when there is no going back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intimate, intense, and written with the precision of a Swiss Army knife, Jill Alexander Essbaum's debut novel is an unforgettable story of marriage, fidelity, sex, morality, and most especially self. Navigating the lines between lust and love, guilt and shame, excuses and reasons, Anna Benz is an electrifying heroine whose passions and choices readers will debate with recognition and fury. Her story reveals, with honesty and great beauty, how we create ourselves and how we lose ourselves and the sometimes disastrous choices we make to find ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nashville meets New Adult in Neon Dreams, a dramatic, sexy series from bestselling author Caisey Quinn, about a country band’s rocky road to fame—and the ambition, dreams, and love of the people who make the music.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dixie Lark hasn’t had it easy. She lost her parents in an accident when she was young and grew up in a ramshackle house on a dirt road in Amarillo with her ailing grandparents and overprotective older brother. Thanks to her grandfather, Dixie learned to play a mean fiddle, inspired by the sounds of the greats—Johnny and June, Waylon, and Hank. Her grandfather’s fiddle changed Dixie’s life forever, giving her an outlet for the turmoil of her broken heart and inspiring a daring dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years later, Dixie and her brother, Dallas, are creating the music they love and chasing fame with their hot band, Leaving Amarillo. But Dixie isn’t enjoying the ride. All she can think about is Gavin, the band’s tattooed, tortured drummer who she’s loved since they were kids. She knows he feels the connection between them, but he refuses see her as more than his best friend’s little sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced that one night with Gavin will get him out of her system, Dixie devises a plan. She doesn’t know that her brother has forbidden Gavin from making a move on her-a promise he swore he’d always keep . . . a promise that once broken will unexpectedly change the future for Dixie, Gavin and the band.</description>

  <description>When a gorgeous young dancer walks through his door, a strip club owner must decide whether to follow his rules or his heart in the third novel by the author of &lt;i&gt;One Tiny Lie&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ten Tiny Breaths&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owning a strip club isn’t the fantasy most guys expect it to be. With long hours, a staff with enough issues to keep a psych ward in business, and the police regularly on his case, twenty-nine-year-old Cain is starting to second guess his unspoken mission to save the women he employs. And then blond, brown-eyed Charlie Rourke walks through his door, and things get really complicated. Cain abides by a strict “no sleeping with the staff” rule. But being around Charlie challenges Cain’s self-control... and it’s been a long time since any woman has done that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Charlie Rourke needs a lot of money, really fast, in order to vanish before it’s too late. Taking her clothes off for men makes her stomach curl but Charlie tells herself that at least she’s putting her acting and dancing skills to good use. And though her fellow dancers seem eager to nab their sexy, sophisticated, and genuinely caring boss, she’s not interested. After all, Charlie Rourke doesn’t really exist—and the girl pretending to be her can't get distracted by romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Charlie soon discovers that developing feelings for Cain is inevitable, and that those feelings may not be unrequited—but losing him when he finds out what she’s involved with will be more painful than any other sentence awaiting her.</description>

  <description>Livie has always been the stable one of the two Cleary sisters, handling her parents' tragic death and Kacey's self-destructive phase with strength and maturity. But underneath that exterior is a little girl hanging onto the last words her father ever spoke to her. “Make me proud,” he had said. She promised she would...and she’s done her best over the past seven years with every choice, with every word, with every action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Livie walks into Princeton with a solid plan, and she’s dead set on delivering on it: Rock her classes, set herself up for medical school, and meet a good, respectable guy that she’s going to someday marry. What isn’t part of her plan are Jell-O shots, a lovable, party animal roommate she can’t say ‘no’ to, and Ashton, the gorgeous captain of the men’s rowing team. Definitely him. He’s an arrogant ass who makes Livie’s usually non-existent temper flare and everything she doesn’t want in a guy. Worse, he’s best friends and roommates with Connor, who happens to fits Livie’s criteria perfectly. So why does she keep thinking about Ashton?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Livie finds herself facing mediocre grades, career aspirations she no longer thinks she can handle, and feelings for Ashton that she shouldn’t have, she’s forced to let go of her last promise to her father and, with it, the only identity that she knows.</description>

  <description>When Dee Dawson meets sexy mohawked guitarist Joel Gibbon, she knows it won’t be long before she has him wrapped around her finger. No guy has ever been able to resist her… but Dee’s met her match in a player like Joel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee’s not the relationship type—not after seeing the pain “love” has caused her friends and family—yet she’s desperate to make Joel want her more than anyone else. He quickly becomes an obsession, and when a reckless attempt to make him jealous ends in disaster, Dee turns into the damsel in distress she never wanted to be. With her carefree world crashing down around her, the last thing she needs is Joel’s pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Joel is suddenly determined to prove he cares, and no matter how hard Dee tries to push him away, he refuses to let her shut him out. Now the girl who swore she’d never say those three little words must choose between guarding her heart and losing Joel forever… or falling head-over-heels for the tattooed rock star of her dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;br /&gt;Joy Fielding expands the scope of her storytelling as never before in this exquisitely moving &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller -- a richly textured love story of astonishing emotional force.&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE FIRST TIME&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After sixteen years of marriage, Mattie Hart discovers that her husband, Jake -- a high-profile Chicago attorney -- is involved in yet another love affair. But a far greater crisis descends upon the Hart family after Jake leaves home: Mattie receives devastating news that will alter their lives. Wracked by guilt, Jake returns to the wife he has never really loved and the teenage daughter who wants nothing to do with him. Here, in these most unexpected of circumstances, Joy Fielding deftly ushers her characters through a poignant drama about love's astonishing power to heal the deepest wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;The First Time&lt;/i&gt; is a dazzling illumination of a marriage at the crossroad, where a long estranged husband and wife discover, for the first time, what love really means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[2.5 stars<br /><br />This book started off interesting and captivating and I was eager to see where it would go. However, after a certain point, it got quite boring. Basically just waiting for the inevitable. I didn’t like Jake as a character, so I wasn’t rooting for his relationship with Mattie....]]>

  <description>When Cora Mason wakes in a desert, she doesn’t know where she is or who put her there. As she explores, she finds an impossible mix of environments—tundra next to desert, farm next to jungle, and a strangely empty town cobbled together from different cultures, all watched over by eerie black windows. And she isn’t alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four other teenagers have also been taken: a beautiful model, a tattooed smuggler, a secretive genius, and an army brat who seems to know too much about Cora’s past. None of them have a clue as to what happened, and all of them have secrets. As the unlikely group struggles for leadership, they slowly start to trust each other. But when their mysterious jailer appears—a handsome young guard called Cassian—they realize that their captivity is more terrifying than they could ever imagine: their captors aren’t from Earth. And they have taken the five teenagers for an otherworldly zoo—where the exhibits are humans.</description>

  <description>Nixy Bauer is a self-made Leveller. Her job? Dragging kids out of virtual reality and back to their parents in the real world. It’s normally easy cash, but Nixy’s latest mission is fraught with real danger, intrigue, and romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nixy Bauer is used to her classmates being very, very unhappy to see her. After all, she’s a bounty hunter in a virtual reality gaming world. Kids in the MEEP, as they call it, play entirely with their minds, while their bodies languish in a sleeplike state on the couch. Irritated parents, looking to wrench their kids back to reality, hire Nixy to jump into the game and retrieve them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the game’s billionaire developer loses track of his own son in the MEEP, Nixy is in for the biggest challenge of her bounty-hunting career. Wyn Salvador isn’t some lazy kid looking to escape his homework: Wyn does not want to be found. And he’s left behind a suicide note. Nixy takes the job but quickly discovers that Wyn’s not hiding—he’s being held inside the game against his will. But who is holding him captive, and why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nixy and Wyn attempt to fight their way out of a mind game unlike any they’ve encountered, and the battle brings them closer than either could have imagined. But when the whole world is virtual, how can Nixy possibly know if her feelings are real?</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Stevie is trapped. In her life. And now in an eating-disorder treatment center on the dusty outskirts of the New Mexico desert.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Life in the center is regimented and intrusive, a nightmare come true. Nurses and therapists watch Stevie at mealtime, accompany her to the bathroom, and challenge her to eat the foods she’s worked so hard to avoid.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her dad has signed her up for sixty days of treatment. But what no one knows is that Stevie doesn't plan to stay that long. There are only twenty-seven days until the anniversary of her brother Josh’s death—the death &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; caused. And if Stevie gets her way, there are only twenty-seven days until she too will end her life.</description>

  <description>When college freshman Rowan Michaels meets gorgeous, up-and-coming rock star Adam Everest, she knows a player like him is the last thing she needs after her ex-boyfriend shattered her heart. But she can't stop thinking about the kiss they shared on his tour bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day of school, Rowan is stunned when Adam saunters into her French class. He's soon failing miserably, and, on a whim, she offers to tutor him. But Adam doesn't recognize her as a makeup-free, glasses-clad college student—a far cry from the beautiful, mysterious "Peach" he met at his concert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a wild weekend on tour with the band, Rowan can't help falling for the sweet guy buried beneath Adam's rocker persona. Yet she knows she could never compete with the girls constantly throwing themselves at his feet. She'd just end up hurt … again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peach is all Adam thinks about, though, and when Rowan realizes this, she has a decision to make: stay just friends to protect her fragile heart … or reveal the truth about the night they met and admit she's fallen completely, hopelessly in love with him.</description>

  <description>A heart-wrenching yet ultimately uplifting story of psychological suspense in which a parent is forced to confront what he does—and does not—know about his teenage son, in the vein of &lt;i&gt;Reconstructing Amelia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Defending Jacob&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;We Need to Talk about Kevin&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While his successful wife goes off to her law office each day, Simon Connolly takes care of their kids, Jake and Laney. Now that they are in high school, the angst-ridden father should feel more relaxed, but he doesn't. He’s seen the statistics, read the headlines. And now, his darkest fear is coming true. There has been a shooting at school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simon races to the rendezvous point, where he’s forced to wait. Do they know who did it? How many victims were there? Why did this happen? One by one, parents are led out of the room to reunite with their children. Their numbers dwindle, until Simon is alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As his worst nightmare unfolds, and Jake is the only child missing, Simon begins to obsess over the past, searching for answers, for hope, for the memory of the boy he raised, for mistakes he must have made, for the reason everything came to this. Where is Jake? What happened in those final moments? Is it possible he doesn’t really know his son? Or he knows him better than he thought?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliantly paced, &lt;i&gt;Finding Jake&lt;/i&gt; explores these questions in a tense and emotionally wrenching narrative. Harrowing and heartbreaking, surprisingly healing and redemptive, &lt;i&gt;Finding Jake&lt;/i&gt; is a story of faith and conviction, strength, courage, and love that will leave readers questioning their own lives, and those they think they know.</description>

  <description>Jacob Kelley's family is turned upside down when an old friend turns up, waving a gun and babbling about an alien quantum intelligence. The mystery deepens when the friend is found dead in an underground bunker…apparently murdered the night before he appeared at Jacob's house. Jacob is arrested for the murder and put on trial.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the details of the crime slowly come to light, the weave of reality becomes ever more tangled, twisted by a miraculous new technology and a quantum creature unconstrained by the normal limits of space and matter. With the help of his daughter, Alessandra, Jacob must find the true murderer before the creature destroys his family and everything he loves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes "Lock In": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as "Haden's syndrome," rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an "integrator" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But "complicated" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It's nothing you could have expected.</description>

  <description>Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old "human error" are much more likely to kill him first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;I've been following her for the past few days. I know where she buys her groceries, where she works. I don't know the color of her eyes or what they look like when she's scared. But I will.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, Mia Dennett enters a bar to meet her on-again, off-again boyfriend. But when he doesn't show, she unwisely leaves with an enigmatic stranger. At first Colin Thatcher seems like a safe one-night stand. But following Colin home will turn out to be the worst mistake of Mia's life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Colin decides to hide Mia in a secluded cabin in rural Minnesota instead of delivering her to his employers, Mia's mother, Eve, and detective Gabe Hoffman will stop at nothing to find them. But no one could have predicted the emotional entanglements that eventually cause this family's world to shatter.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&lt;/i&gt; is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in &lt;i&gt;Graham's Magazine&lt;/i&gt; in 1841. It has been recognized as the first modern detective story; Poe referred to it as one of his "tales of ratiocination".</description>

  <description>Baalboden has been ravaged. The brutal Commander's whereabouts are unknown. And Rachel, grief stricken over her father's death, needs Logan more than ever. With their ragged group of survivors struggling to forge a future, it's up to Logan to become the leader they need—with Rachel by his side. Under constant threat from rival Carrington's army, who is after the device that controls the Cursed One, the group decides to abandon the ruins of their home and take their chances in the Wasteland.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soon their problems intensify tenfold: someone—possibly inside their ranks—is sabotaging the survivors, picking them off one by one. The chaos and uncertainty of each day puts unbearable strain on Rachel and Logan, and it isn't long before they feel their love splintering. Even worse, as it becomes clear that the Commander will stop at nothing to destroy them, the band of survivors begins to question whether the price of freedom may be too great—and whether, hunted by their enemies and the murderous traitor in their midst, they can make it out of the Wasteland alive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this daring sequel to Defiance, with the world they once loved forever destroyed, Rachel and Logan must decide between a life on the run and standing their ground to fight.</description>

  <description>While the other girls in the walled city-state of Baalboden learn to sew and dance, Rachel Adams learns to track and hunt. While they bend like reeds to the will of their male Protectors, she uses hers for sparring practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Rachel's father fails to return from a courier mission and is declared dead, the city's brutal Commander assigns Rachel a new Protector: her father's apprentice, Logan—the boy she declared her love to and who turned her down two years before. Left with nothing but fierce belief in her father's survival, Rachel decides to escape and find him herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Rachel and Logan battle their way through the Wasteland, stalked by a monster that can't be killed and an army of assassins out for blood, they discover romance, heartbreak, and a truth that will incite a war decades in the making.</description>

  <description>Believing William Legrand to have gone insane following an insect bite, his friend initially decries his quest for gold as the ramblings of a madman. Yet when Legrand's conviction fails to waiver, they set off on a bizarre journey, accompanied by Jupiter, Legrand's loyal and equally skeptical servant. What follows is a strange tale of coded messages, hidden treasure, and uncanny prophecy that will both enthrall and baffle even the most perceptive readers.Part horror story, part detective fiction, &lt;u&gt;The Gold Bug&lt;/u&gt; is an ingenious tale bearing all the hallmarks of Poe's extraordinary narrative skill. It is presented here with &lt;u&gt;The Sphinx&lt;/u&gt;, a similarly themed and equally disturbing short story. Wonderfully versatile as an author and best known for his tales of terror and the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) holds a venerable place in the history of American literature.</description>

  <description>Fiction. Hans Phaall, a bankrupt bellows-mender from Rotterdam, thinks up an ingenious scheme to escape from his dreary existence. He constructs a balloon that will carry him all the way to the moon. First published in 1835, when Poe was twenty-five years old and virtually unknown, the tale - much admired by Jules Verne - describes an extraordinary adventure in which Poe's learning and imagination form a hallucinatory mix of science and fiction. For that reason HANS PHAALL is looked upon by many as the first true science-fiction story.</description>

  <description>When Eadlyn became the first princess of Illéa to hold her own Selection, she didn’t think she would fall in love with any of her thirty-five suitors. She spent the first few weeks of the competition counting down the days until she could send them all home. But as events at the palace force Eadlyn even further into the spotlight, she realizes that she might not be content remaining alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eadlyn still isn’t sure she’ll find the fairytale ending her parents did twenty years ago. But sometimes the heart has a way of surprising you…and soon Eadlyn must make a choice that feels more impossible—and more important—than she ever imagined.</description>

  <description>Princess Eadlyn has grown up hearing endless stories about how her mother and father met. Twenty years ago, America Singer entered the Selection and won the heart of Prince Maxon—and they lived happily ever after. Eadlyn has always found their fairy-tale story romantic, but she has no interest in trying to repeat it. If it were up to her, she'd put off marriage for as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a princess's life is never entirely her own, and Eadlyn can't escape her very own Selection—no matter how fervently she protests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eadlyn doesn't expect her story to end in romance. But as the competition begins, one entry may just capture Eadlyn's heart, showing her all the possibilities that lie in front of her . . . and proving that finding her own happily ever after isn't as impossible as she's always thought.</description>

  <description>Bad boy Kaidan Rowe has never wanted for anything—money, popularity, musical talent…hot girls—but seducing them is part of his duty as a Nephilim, slave to the demon Dukes. As the son of the Duke of Lust, Kaidan has learned his father’s ways, becoming a master of passion, a manipulator of chemistry. Disobeying his father would mean certain death. Thankfully for Kaidan, he’s good at his job. And he enjoys it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until he meets Anna Whitt—smart, feisty, and inexplicably &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;—the one girl seemingly immune to his charms. The daughter of a guardian angel and a fallen one, she makes him wish for more than he could ever deserve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to save all the Neph from their dark lives, Anna joins forces with Kaidan to overcome the Dukes’ oppressive ways. In the light of her affections, Kaidan must undergo his toughest test of all, a battle of the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensual and swoonworthy, this companion volume to the Sweet Evil series, told from the perspective of the mysterious Kaidan Rowe, gives readers revealing insights into the true emotions that drive him.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;It’s the end of the line.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;WICKED has taken everything from Thomas: his life, his memories, and now his only friends—the Gladers. But it’s finally over. The trials are complete, after one final test.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will anyone survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What WICKED doesn’t know is that Thomas remembers far more than they think. And it’s enough to prove that he can’t believe a word of what they say.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The truth will be terrifying.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas beat the Maze. He survived the Scorch. He’ll risk anything to save his friends. But the truth might be what ends it all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The time for lies is over.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers. But WICKED isn’t done yet. Phase Two has just begun. The Scorch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are no rules. There is no help. You either make it or you die.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Gladers have two weeks to cross through the Scorch—the most burned-out section of the world. And WICKED has made sure to adjust the variables and stack the odds against them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friendships will be tested. Loyalties will be broken. All bets are off. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are others now. Their survival depends on the Gladers’ destruction—and they’re determined to survive.</description>

  <description>An award-winning memoir and instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller that goes far beyond its riveting medical mystery, &lt;i&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful account of one woman’s struggle to recapture her identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When twenty-four-year-old Susannah Cahalan woke up alone in a hospital room, strapped to her bed and unable to move or speak, she had no memory of how she’d gotten there. Days earlier, she had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: at the beginning of her first serious relationship and a promising career at a major New York newspaper. Now she was labeled violent, psychotic, a flight risk. What happened?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a swift and breathtaking narrative, Cahalan tells the astonishing true story of her descent into madness, her family’s inspiring faith in her, and the lifesaving diagnosis that nearly didn’t happen.</description>

  <description>For the past two months, Kitty Doe's life has been a lie. Forced to impersonate the Prime Minister's niece, her frustration grows as her trust in her fake fiancé cracks, her real boyfriend is forbidden and the Blackcoats keep her in the dark more than ever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the midst of discovering that her role in the Hart family may not be as coincidental as she thought, she's accused of treason and is forced to face her greatest fear: Elsewhere. A prison where no one can escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one shocking revelation leads to the next, Kitty learns the hard way that she can trust no one, not even the people she thought were on her side. With her back against the wall, Kitty wants to believe she'll do whatever it takes to support the rebellion she believes in—but is she prepared to pay the ultimate price?</description>

  <description>For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe she was abandoned, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice’s old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother’s whereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Jenna’s memories dovetail with the events in her mother’s journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish.</description>

  <description>Marriage can be a real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, New York Times bestseller Gillian Flynn takes that statement to its darkest place in this unputdownable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The Chicago Tribune proclaimed that her work “draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.” Gone Girl’s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: gillian-flynn.com</description>

  <description>Unleashed, the romantic, high-stakes sequel to New York Times bestselling author Sophie Jordan's Uninvited, is perfect for fans of James Patterson's Confessions of a Murder Suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davy has spent the last few months trying to come to terms with the fact that she tested positive for the kill gene HTS (also known as Homicidal Tendency Syndrome). She swore she would not let it change her, and that her DNA did not define her . . . but then she killed a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on the run, Davy must decide whether she'll be ruled by the kill gene or if she'll follow her heart and fight for her right to live free. But with her own potential for violence lying right beneath the surface, Davy doesn't even know if she can trust herself.</description>

      <![CDATA[This review and more: <a href="http://www.sharinginspiredkreations.com" rel="nofollow">Sharing Inspired Kreations</a><br /><br />One of the things that bugs me most about Young Adult books lately is the main character’s logic. It seems like all too often a YA novel’s protagonist will have a complete freak-out over something illogical. I guess that’s how teenagers are, though?...</a>]]>

  <description>Me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A leader?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; prove that there's more to Inside than we knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That a whole world exists beyond this cube we live in. And finding that led to a major rebellion—between worker scrubs like me and the snobby uppers who rule our world. Make that &lt;i&gt;ruled.&lt;/i&gt; Because of me, we're free. I thought that meant I was off the hook, and could go off on my own again—while still touching base with Riley, of course. He's the one upper I think I can trust. But then we learned that there's outside and then there is &lt;i&gt;Outside.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And something from Outside wants In.</description>

  <description>Twenty-two -year-old Naya has spent nearly half her life as a sex slave in a government institution called The Line. When she’s kicked out after getting pregnant with twins, she’s got no way to earn a living and a horrifying choice to make: find someone to replace her, or have her babies taken in her stead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A doctor with a history of aiding ex-Line girls, Ric Bennett, wants to help. He runs a team of rebels that can delete Naya’s records and free her forever. But when The Line sniffs out his plan, things get bloody, fast. Naya means more to them than just a chance at fresh faces—her twins are part of the government’s larger plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they hide from government search parties, Ric comes to admire Naya’s quiet strength. And Naya realizes Ric might be a man she can trust. If they make it off the grid, they could build a new life. But first they’ll have to survive the long, vicious reach of The Line.</description>

  <description>Everything hangs in the balance, and nothing is certain: Rachel has been kidnapped by enemy forces and is being taken to Rowansmark while Logan, imprisoned and awaiting trial, is unable to leave Lankenshire. Separated from each other and their Baalboden comrades, each must find a way to achieve what they desperately want: to rid their world once and for all of the Commander and the tech that controls the deadly Cursed One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fighting through her pain and embracing the warrior she’s become, Rachel will do whatever it takes to escape her enemies’ clutches and join Logan in his fight. But when she learns a secret that changes everything, she realizes that escaping Ian and his tracker friends is no longer an option if she wants to save the people she loves. Instead, she’ll have to destroy Rowansmark from the inside out—if she can survive the journey through the Wasteland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan needs allies if he wants to thwart Rowansmark’s power grab and rescue Rachel. But securing allies will mean betraying his beliefs and enlisting the help of the man he hates more than anyone: Commander Jason Chase. Driven by his fierce love for Rachel and his determination to make their world safe, Logan may be just the weapon the city-states need to defeat the Cursed One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Rowansmark bears down and uneasy alliances are tested, will Rachel and Logan’s love for each other be enough to surmount the unbelievable odds against them?</description>

It's interesting, I'm a huge fan of romance, but something about when these two are apart makes me enjoy the story more.

  <description>From the author of the Eve trilogy comes the breathless story of a girl racing to figure out who she is—and how to stay alive. When a nameless girl wakes up on the subway tracks, she knows only one thing for sure: people want her dead. Can she find them before they track her down? This pulse-pounding contemporary thriller is perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Darkest Minds&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Legend&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things I Know Are True: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am in Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I woke up on the train tracks at the Vermont/Sunset station&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a teenage girl &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have long black hair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a bird tattoo on the inside of my right wrist with the letters and numbers FNV02198&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;People are trying to kill me&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The world of Inside is simple. Do your job, stay out of the way and don't dream of anything better. Because as every Scrub knows, there are no other options&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Trella—the Queen of the Pipes, as some call her—gets involved with a revolution that will rock her world….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trella was just doing a favor for a friend—her only friend. Hiding an injured man from the Pop Cops seemed easy enough—though dangerous. But then she discovered that the myths of Outside might be real….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being Inside's hero only left Trella with more work. Ducking those responsibilities, she continued to explore her stark world—and found something she never expected. Strangers. From Outside…</description>

  <description>Ember Miller and Chase Jennings are ready to stop running. After weeks spent in hiding as two of the Bureau of Reformation’s most wanted criminals, they have finally arrived at the safe house, where they hope to live a safe and quiet existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all that’s left is smoking ruins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devastated by the demolition of their last hope, Ember and Chase follow the only thing left to them—tracks leading away from the wreckage. The only sign that there may have been survivors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their high profile, they know they can’t stay out in the open for long. They take shelter in the wilderness and amidst the ruins of abandoned cities as they follow the tracks down the coast, eventually finding refugees from the destroyed safe house. Among them is someone from Chase’s past—someone he never thought he’d see again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Banding together, they search for a place to hide, aiming for a settlement a few of them have heard about…a settlement that is rumored to house the nebulous organization known as Three. The very group that has provided Ember with a tiny ray of hope ever since she was first forced on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three is responsible for the huge network of underground safe houses and resistance groups across the country. And they may offer Ember her only chance at telling the world her story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fighting back.</description>

  <description>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a dead-end town of 12,000 people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather never thought she would compete in Panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher. She’d never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dodge has never been afraid of Panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game, he’s sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he’s not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them—and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.</description>

  <description>Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” She survived—and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She thought it was the end of the world... But it was only the beginning of the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been three months since Amy escaped New Hope. Since she's seen Baby, or Kay, or Rice. And she's been surviving on her own, like she did before she was "rescued" and taken to what she thought was a safe haven. Then, in the midst of foraging for supplies, her former fellow Guardian's voice rings out in her earpiece. And in a desperate tone, Kay utters the four words Any had hoped she would never hear:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Reynolds has Baby.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's a race against time, for Baby is in imminent danger, her life threatened by the malevolent doctor who had helped start the end of the world. In order to save Baby, Amy will have to make her way to Fort Black, a former prison-turned-survivor colony. There she will need to find Ken—Kay's brother—for he holds the key to Baby's survival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before she can do any of this, she'll have to endure the darkest places—and people—of the prison. And one small slip-up could not only cost Baby and Amy their lives, but threaten the survival of he people in the After.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demitria Lunetta has created an utterly compelling conclusion to the story she set forth in &lt;i&gt;In the After&lt;/i&gt;. Readers of the Hunger Games trilogy will not be able to pit down this book, which is gripping from beginning to end.</description>

  <description>Two novellas set in the world of Kiera Cass's #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Selection series are now available in print for the first time. &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Guard&lt;/em&gt; both offer captivating views into the hearts and minds of the two men fighting to win America Singer's love. This collection also features exclusive bonus content, including a sneak peek at &lt;em&gt;The One&lt;/em&gt;, the eagerly anticipated third novel in the Selection series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before America arrived at the palace to compete in the Selection, there was another girl in Prince Maxon's life. &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; opens the week before the Selection begins and follows Maxon through the first day of the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised as a Six, Aspen Leger never dreamed that he would find himself living in the palace as a member of the royal guard. In &lt;em&gt;The Guard&lt;/em&gt;, readers get an inside look at Aspen's life within the palace walls—and the truth about a guard's world that America will never know.</description>

  <description>The Selection began with thirty-five girls. Now, with the group narrowed down to the Elite, the competition to win Prince Maxon's heart is fiercer than ever--and America is still struggling to decide where her own heart truly lies. Is it with Maxon, who could make her life a fairy tale? Or with her first love, Aspen, who she always thought was the one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America is desperate for more time. But the rest of the Elite know exactly what they want--and America's chance to choose is about to slip away.</description>

  <description>Delilah is a bit of a loner who prefers spending her time in the school library with her head in a book—one book in particular. Between the Lines may be a fairy tale, but it feels real. Prince Oliver is brave, adventurous, and loving. He really speaks to Delilah.&lt;br /&gt;And then one day Oliver actually speaks to her. Turns out, Oliver is more than a one-dimensional storybook prince. He’s a restless teen who feels trapped by his literary existence and hates that his entire life is predetermined. He’s sure there’s more for him out there in the real world, and Delilah might just be his key to freedom.&lt;br /&gt;A romantic and charming story, this companion novel to Off the Page will make every reader believe in the fantastical power of fairy tales.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I live for the dream that my children will be born free," she says. "That they will be what they like. That they will own the land their father gave them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I live for you," I say sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eo kisses my cheek. "Then you must live for more."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darrow is a Red, a member of the lowest caste in the color-coded society of the future. Like his fellow Reds, he works all day, believing that he and his people are making the surface of Mars livable for future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet he spends his life willingly, knowing that his blood and sweat will one day result in a better world for his children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Darrow and his kind have been betrayed. Soon he discovers that humanity already reached the surface generations ago. Vast cities and sprawling parks spread across the planet. Darrow—and Reds like him—are nothing more than slaves to a decadent ruling class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this stand-alone companion to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone series comes the story of Mik and Zuzana's fantastical first date—as a gorgeously illustrated gift edition with bonus content included.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her "rabid fairy," her "voodoo eyes" are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or "Violin Boy," her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to make the first move, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. It's a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winter's night before leading him to the treasure: herself! Violin Boy is not going to know what hit him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Laini Taylor brings to life a night only hinted at in the Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone trilogy—the magical first date of fan-favorites Zuzana and Mik. Originally published as an ebook, this new print edition will include breathtaking black and white illustrations, plus bonus content in a gorgeous package perfect for new and current fans of the series.</description>

  <description>Clover lives in the beautiful, crime free City of Eadin. The Wall runs along the city’s eastern boundary, ensuring that the monsters that live on the other side remain safely tucked away. All of the citizens’ worldly needs are provided for them and they are free to spend their days doing whatever pleases them. All this makes for a content and happy society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Clover is about to discover that her world is not the perfect place it seems, that she has been drowning in deception her entire life. The people of Eadin have been lied to, their history has been kept from them, and they have been unknowingly forced into submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Clover’s new knowledge sets in, she learns that even she is not the person she thought she was. In a world where it’s no longer clear which side of the Wall the real monsters live on, Clover, with her new-found sense of self, is determined to set things right.</description>

  <description>The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered - fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningliess. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend to complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, ALLEGIANT, by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the DIVERGENT series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT.</description>

  <description>Can Sloane and James survive the lies and secrets surrounding them, or will The Program claim them in the end? Find out in this sequel to The Program, which Publishers Weekly called “chilling and suspenseful.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you stop an epidemic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sloane and James are on the run after barely surviving the suicide epidemic and The Program. But they’re not out of danger. Huge pieces of their memories are still missing, and although Sloane and James have found their way back to each other, The Program isn’t ready to let them go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Escaping with a group of troubled rebels, Sloane and James will have to figure out who they can trust, and how to take down The Program. But for as far as they’ve come, there’s still a lot Sloane and James can’t remember. The key to unlocking their past lies with the Treatment—a pill that can bring back forgotten memories, but at a high cost. And there’s only one dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately when the stakes are at their highest, can Sloane and James survive the many lies and secrets surrounding them, or will The Program claim them in the end?</description>

  <description>I thought I had nothing left to give. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They started the war. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will end it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice "Ali" Bell thinks the worst is behind her. She's ready to take the next step with boyfriend Cole Holland, the leader of the zombie slayers…until Anima Industries, the agency controlling the zombies, launches a sneak attack, killing four of her friends. It's then she realizes that humans can be more dangerous than monsters…and the worst has only begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets that may tear Ali and Cole apart come to light, and more slayers are taken or killed, Ali will fight harder than ever to bring down Anima—even sacrificing her own life for those she loves.</description>

  <description>It’s either break the rules or die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miki Jones lives her life by her own strict set of rules, to keep control, to keep the gray fog of grief at bay. Then she’s pulled into the Game, where she - and her team - will die unless she follows a new set of rules: those set by the mysterious Committee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But rules don’t mean answers, and without answers, it’s hard to trust. People are dying. The rules are unraveling. And Miki knows she’s being watched, uncertain if it’s the Drau or someone - &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; - else. Forced to make impossible choices and battling to save those she loves, Miki begins to see the Committee in a glaring new light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the Game crosses a new boundary, pushes harder into Miki’s and her friends’ lives, and there’s nothing in the rules that can save them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Push&lt;/i&gt; is the sequel &lt;i&gt;Rush&lt;/i&gt; fans will be screaming for.</description>

  <description>The time is 1981, and Sibyl Danforth has been a dedicated midwife in the rural community of Reddington, Vermont, for fifteen years. But one treacherous winter night, in a house isolated by icy roads and failed telephone lines, Sibyl takes desperate measures to save a baby's life. She performs an emergency Caesarean section on its mother, who appears to have died in labor. But what if—as Sibyl's assistant later charges—the patient wasn't already dead, and it was Sibyl who inadvertently killed her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As recounted by Sibyl's precocious fourteen-year-old daughter, Connie, the ensuing trial bears the earmarks of a witch hunt except for the fact that all its participants are acting from the highest motives—and the defendant increasingly appears to be guilty. As Sibyl Danforth faces the antagonism of the law, the hostility of traditional doctors, and the accusations of her own conscience, &lt;b&gt;Midwives&lt;/b&gt; engages, moves, and transfixes us as only the very best novels ever do.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this pulse-pounding final installment of the &lt;i&gt;Don’t Turn Around&lt;/i&gt; trilogy, Noa and Peter race across the country in their search to destroy Project Persephone before time runs out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a devastating loss, Noa Torson is out of options. On the run with the three remaining teens of Persephone’s Army, she is up against immeasurable odds. The group is outnumbered, outsmarted, and outrun. But they are not giving up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Noa and Peter realize they can’t run anymore, and that Noa’s health is failing, they know they must go back to where this began. But when they come face-to-face with the man who started it all, the question becomes, can they win?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This riveting final book in the &lt;i&gt;Don’t Turn Around&lt;/i&gt; trilogy ratchets up the action as Noa and Peter confront the evil that has chased them and won’t let them go.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Being a force of nature doesn't keep you safe.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter Garrity is used to watching his back. The kids at school sense something different about him. And they're right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunter has powers that have nothing to do with how hard he can throw a punch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that's what Clare Kasten is picking up. She's shy, quiet, and intense, but she's sought him out. There's no telling what she wants from him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Hunter knows enough to sense a secret when it's close. And getting close to Clare is a danger he's ready to face. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Plenty of romance and non-stop action. . ..Elemental is the new series to watch." --Inara Scott, author of &lt;i&gt;The Marked&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Brigid Kemmerer and The Elemental Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Magic, suspense, and enough twists to keep you reading until sunrise. An incredible start to the series!" --Award winning author Erica O'Rourke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Overflowing with action, snappy dialog, and hot guys--The Elemental Series will take your breath away." --Kim Harrington, author of &lt;i&gt;Clarity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brigid Kemmerer&lt;/b&gt; finds time to write between her family and her day job, but sometimes she ends up mothering her coworkers and managing her family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11,000 Words</description>

  <description>3 seconds left to live. Once the countdown starts, it cannot be stopped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 pawns thrown into a brutal underground reality game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kira Jordan survived her family's murder and months on plague-devastated city streets with hard-won savvy and a low-level psi ability. She figures she can handle anything. Until she wakes up in a barren room, chained next to the notorious Rogan Ellis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 reason Kira will never, ever trust Rogan. Even though both their lives depend on it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their every move is controlled and televised for a vicious exclusive audience. And as Kira's psi skill unexpectedly grows and Rogan's secrets prove evermore deadly, Kira's only chance of survival is to risk trusting him as much as her instincts. Even if that means running head-on into the one trap she can't escape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GAME OVER</description>

  &lt;p&gt;The highly anticipated conclusion to Kiera Cass's #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Selection series, &lt;em&gt;The One&lt;/em&gt; will captivate readers who love dystopian YA fiction and fairy tales. &lt;em&gt;The One&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect finale for fans who have followed America's whirlwind romance since it began--and a swoon-worthy read for teens who have devoured Veronica Roth's &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt;, Ally Condie's &lt;em&gt;Matched&lt;/em&gt;, or Lauren Oliver's &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Selection changed America Singer's life in ways she never could have imagined. Since she entered the competition to become the next princess of Illéa, America has struggled with her feelings for her first love, Aspen--and her growing attraction to Prince Maxon. Now she's made her choice . . . and she's prepared to fight for the future she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Find out who America will choose in &lt;em&gt;The One&lt;/em&gt;, the enchanting, beautifully romantic third book in the Selection series!&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>The inspiration for the critically acclaimed Starz miniseries &lt;i&gt;The White Queen&lt;/i&gt;, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Philippa Gregory brings to life the extraordinary story of Elizabeth Woodville, a woman who rises from obscurity to become Queen of England, and changes the course of history forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Woodville is a woman of extraordinary beauty and ambition. Her mother is Jacquetta, also known as the mystical lady of the rivers, and she is even more determined to bring power and wealth to the family line. While riding in the woods one day, Elizabeth captures the attentions of the newly crowned King Edward IV and, despite her common upbringing, marries him in secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she is raised up to be his queen, the English court is outraged, but Elizabeth rises to the demands of her exalted position and fights for her family’s dominance. Yet despite her best efforts, and even with the help of her mother’s powers, her two sons become pawns in a famous unsolved mystery that has confounded historians for centuries: the lost princes in the Tower of London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this dazzling account of the deadly Wars of the Roses, brother turns on brother to win the ultimate prize: the throne of England.</description>

  <description>This 50-page digital original novella introduces readers to &lt;em&gt;Blackout&lt;/em&gt;, a series by acclaimed author Robison Wells that combines the high-stakes intensity of television's &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; with the lightning-fast action of Marie Lu's &lt;em&gt;Legend&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something strange is happening to Krezi. She has a dangerously high fever her doctors can't explain, and objects keep bursting into flames around her—but the fire doesn't seem to hurt her at all. Krezi wants nothing more than to control her mysterious abilities. But what she doesn't know is that there are others like her out there . . . and in the wrong hands, this power could be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going Dark&lt;/em&gt; also features a teaser to &lt;em&gt;Blackout&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.</description>

  <description>"As I sleep, my mind will erase everything I did today. I will wake up tomorrow as I did this morning. Thinking I’m still a child. Thinking I have a whole lifetime of choice ahead of me. . . ."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memories define us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if you lost yours every time you went to sleep?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your name, your identity, your past, even the people you love—all forgotten overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the one person you trust may be telling you only half the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Christine's life.</description>
