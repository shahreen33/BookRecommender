  <description>&lt;b&gt;Poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, &lt;i&gt;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;If you’re planning on falling in love…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the confident, charismatic Caleb Parker, Sadie Lane feels the spark—the kind that comes from rubbing each other the wrong way. She’s a tattoo artist, he’s a straight-laced mogul. But after they accidentally co-rescue an abandoned dog from a storm, Sadie sees a vulnerable side to the seemingly invincible hottie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;you’d better be sure…&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caleb doesn’t do emotions. Growing up the underdog, he’s learned the hard way to build up an impenetrable wall. Perfect for business. Disastrous for relationships. He’s never worried about it before—not until he finally gets behind Sadie’s armor and begins to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;… someone is there to catch you.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both guarded and vulnerable, Sadie and Caleb are complete opposites. Or are they? Shocked at their undeniable connection, can they ever admit to wanting more? That all depends on what they’re each willing to risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Inspector C. D. Sloan prays he will find a nun’s murderer in this crime novel by CWA Diamond Dagger winner Catherine Aird &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The day begins like any other for Sister Mary St. Gertrude. When her alarm sounds at 5 a.m., Sister Mary begins rousting her convent sisters from their beds, starting with the Reverend Mother. Down the Order she goes with a knock and a warm blessing. But when the young nun reaches Sister Anne’s door, there is no answer. She assumes that Sister Anne got up early, and continues on her way.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But later, when a fellow nun leaves a bloody thumbprint on the sheet music for a hymn, and Sister Anne is nowhere to be found, it becomes apparent that something is very wrong. Then Sister Anne’s body is found at the bottom of a steep set of stairs, her veil askew and her head crushed.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Religious Body &lt;/i&gt;introduces the sophisticated Detective Inspector C. D. Sloan along with his eager and trustworthy sidekick, Detective Constable Crosby, and the acerbic Superintendent Leeyes in a mystery of holy proportions that will have readers guessing until the last page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Rainy Day Friends&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lost and Found Sisters&lt;/i&gt; returns to Wildstone, California...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brooke Lemon has always led the life she wanted, wild adventures—and mistakes—included, something her perfect sister, Mindy, never understood. So when Mindy shows up on Brooke’s doorstep in the throes of a break-down with her three little kids in tow, Brooke’s shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting to make amends, Brooke agrees to trade places, taking the kids back to Wildstone for a few days so Mindy can pick up the pieces and put herself back together. What Brooke doesn’t admit is she’s just as broken . . . Also how does one go home after seven years away? It doesn’t take long for Brooke to come face-to-face with her past, in the form of one tall, dark, sexy mistake. But Garrett’s no longer interested. Only his words don’t match his actions, leaving Brooke feeling things she’d shoved deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon the sisters begin to wonder: Are they lemons in life? In love? All they know is that neither seems to be able to run far enough to outpace her demons. And when secrets surface, they’ll have to learn that sometimes the one person who can help you the most is the one you never thought to ask.</description>

  <description>The problem with secrets is that they’re too easy to keep collecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna Allen has done some things she would rather no one ever know about. She also knows that, if she could go back in time, she wouldn’t change a single thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With three sisters she loves, a job she (mostly) adores, and a family built up of friends she’s made over the years, Luna figures everything has worked out the way it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when one of those secrets involves the man who signs her paycheck, she can’t find it in her to regret it. Despite the fact that he’s not the friendliest man in the world. Or the most patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes there are things you’re better off keeping to yourself.</description>

      <![CDATA[hmmm, Mariana Zapata has two genres: sports romances &amp; bad boy romances. I like her sports romances much better, and tend to think her bad boy romances have really unhealthy relationships. This one is better than most of her bad romances and not as problematic, but still not as swoony as her...]]>

  <description>A sense of danger pervades the rambling Victorian mansion in which Jane Marple's friend Carrie Louise lives—and not only because the building doubles as a rehabilitation centre for criminal youths. One inmate attempts, and fails, to shoot dead the administrator. But simultaneously, in another part of the building, a mysterious visitor is less lucky. Miss Marple must employ all her cunning to solve the riddle of the stranger's visit, and his murder—while protecting her friend from a similarly dreadful fate.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER - A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the #1 bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Gifts of Imperfection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"True belonging doesn't require us to &lt;i&gt;change&lt;/i&gt; who we are. It requires us to &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; who we are." Social scientist Brene Brown, PhD, LMSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives--experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In &lt;i&gt;Braving the Wilderness, &lt;/i&gt; Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brown argues that we're experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, "True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that's rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it's easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it's a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It's a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts." Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, "The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it's the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A marriage of convenience turns into a sweetly seductive love-off-the-rails romance in the latest Cowboys of Colorado novel from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jo Goodman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily Salt has sworn off men. After finally gaining her independence, the last thing she needs is another man telling her what to do. But the handsome railroad engineer from New York isn't at all what she expected. He's kind, gentle...and tempting enough to make her wonder what a second chance at love might be worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A self-acknowledged black sheep, Roen Shepard knows what it means to feel alone. Recognizing a kindred spirit in the reserved widow whose fascinating blue-green eyes have seen too much, and charmed by the warmth of her ready-made family, the two begin an unlikely friendship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a complication from his past follows him to Frost Falls, Roen proposes a mad scheme to protect the new life he's built and keep close the stubborn woman he's accidentally fallen for--a marriage of convenience. But Lily has secrets of her own, and the closer he gets to uncovering them, the more he comes to realize that the only truth that matters is the secret to unlocking her heart.</description>

  <description>Maud Demille is a daughter of Innkeepers—a special group who provide ‘lodging’ to other-planetary visitors—so she knows that a simple life isn't in the cards. But even Maud could never have anticipated what Fate would throw at her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a wife to a powerful vampire knight, Maud and her young daughter, Helen, were exiled with him for his treachery to the desolate, savage planet of Karhari. Karhari killed her husband, and Maud—completely abandoned by his family—has spent over a year avenging his debts. Rescued by her sister Dina, she's sworn off all things vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except... In helping Dina save the world, she met Arland, the Marshal of House Krahr, one of the most powerful vampire houses. One thing led to another and he asked for her hand in marriage. She declined. Arland is not used to hearing the word ‘no;’ and try as she might, Maud can't just walk away from Arland. It doesn't help that being human is a lot harder for Maud than being a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sort it all out, she accepts his invitation to visit his home planet. House Krahr is extremely influential and Maud knows that a woman—a human, with a very questionable past—who's turned down a proposal from its most beloved son won't get a warm reception. Maybe she’s not sure about marrying Arland, but House Krahr isn’t going to decide for her. Maud Demille has never run from a fight, and House Krahr will soon discover that there's a lot more to Maud than they’re expecting.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nalini Singh takes us on a new adventure in this next novel of the Psy-Changeling Trinity series...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of Silence was supposed to create a better world for future generations. But trust is broken, and the alliance between Psy, Changeling, and human is thin. The problems that led to Silence are back in full force. Because Silence fixed nothing, just hid the problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, the Psy have to find a real answer to their problems--if one exists. Or their race will soon go extinct in a cascade of violence. The answer begins with an empath who is attuned to monsters--and who is going to charm a wolf into loving her despite his own demons.</description>

  <description>When wilderness guide, Harper Ward, is summoned to the small town sheriff’s office in Helena Springs, Montana, to provide assistance on a case, she is shocked to find that their only suspect in the double murder investigation is a man described as a savage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the longer she watches the man known only as Lucas, on the station surveillance camera, the more intrigued she becomes. He certainly looks primitive with his unkempt appearance and animal skin attire, but she also sees intelligence in his eyes, sensitivity in his expression. Who is he? And how is it possible that he’s lived alone in the forest since he was a small child?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As secrets begin to emerge, Harper is thrust into something bigger and more diabolical than she ever could have imagined. And standing right at the center of it all, is Lucas. But is he truly the wild man he appears to be? A cold blooded killer? An innocent victim? Or a perplexing mix of all three?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harper must find out the answers to these questions because the more time she spends with him, the more she risks losing her heart.</description>

  <description>The Body Farm - a research institute that tests the decomposition of corpses. Black Mountain, North Carolina: a sleepy little town where the local police deal with one homicide a year, if they're unlucky, and where people are still getting used to the idea of locking their doors at night. But violent death is no respecter of venue, and the discovery of the corpse of an 11-year-old girl sends shock waves through the community. Dr Kay Scarpetta, Chief medical Examiner on a similar case in Virginia, is called in to apply her forensic skills to this latest atrocity, but the apparent simplicity of the case proves something of a poisoned chalice - until Scarpetta finds enlightenment through the curious pathologists' playground known as the Body Farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Author’s Website</description>

  <description>Down-and-out drunk Terry Lennox has a problem: his millionaire wife is dead and he needs to get out of LA fast. So he turns to the only friend he can trust: private investigator Philip Marlowe. Marlowe is willing to help a man down on his luck, but later Lennox commits suicide in Mexico and things start to turn nasty. Marlowe is drawn into a sordid crowd of adulterers and alcoholics in LA's Idle Valley, where the rich are suffering one big suntanned hangover. Marlowe is sure Lennox didn't kill his wife, but how many stiffs will turn up before he gets to the truth?</description>

  <description>Mrs. Bertrice Martin—a widow, some seventy-three years young—has kept her youthful-ish appearance with the most powerful of home remedies: daily doses of spite, regular baths in man-tears, and refusing to give so much as a single damn about her Terrible Nephew. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then proper, correct Miss Violetta Beauchamps, a sprightly young thing of nine and sixty, crashes into her life. The Terrible Nephew is living in her rooming house, and Violetta wants him gone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Martin isn’t about to start giving damns, not even for someone as intriguing as Miss Violetta. But she hatches another plan—to make her nephew sorry, to make Miss Violetta smile, and to have the finest adventure of all time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If she makes Terrible Men angry and wins the hand of a lovely lady in the process? Those are just added bonuses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author’s Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sometimes I write villains who are subtle and nuanced. This is not one of those times. The Terrible Nephew is terrible, and terrible things happen to him. Sometime villains really are bad and wrong, and sometimes, we want them to suffer a lot of consequences.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous break up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six, but nobody knows the real reason why they split at the absolute height of their popularity...until now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go-Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it's the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she's twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another band getting noticed is The Six, led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she's pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six&lt;/i&gt;, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.</description>

Not only could her co-workers double as the cast of Parks &amp;amp; Recreation, but she loves finding the unusual sites, hidden gems, and just-plain-odd tourist attractions of her home state. She’s a shoo-in for the director’s job when her boss retires at the end of the year…until hotshot Josh Vaughn shows up to challenge her for the position. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh is all sophisticated polish while Sadie’s country comfort, and the two have very different ideas of what makes a good campaign. So when their boss pits them against each other in a winner-takes-all contest, they’re both willing to fight dirty if it means getting what they want. But it turns out, what Josh and Sadie want could be each other—and Josh’s kisses are the best Kentucky attraction Sadie’s found yet!</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A young widow returns to Lake Sackett, Georgia to face the ghosts of her past—and decide if she’s ready to take another chance on love—in the third sparkling Southern Eclectic novel that “goes down as easy as honey on a deep-fried Twinkie” (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;, on &lt;i&gt;Sweet Tea and Sympathy&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Brewer would never have guessed that her best friend, Duffy McCready (of McCready’s Bait Shop &amp;amp; Funeral Home) has been in love with her since they were kids. Fear of rejection and his own romantic complications prevented Duffy from confessing his true feelings in high school, so he stood by and watched her wed Wayne Bowman right after high school. Wayne had always been a cheapskate, so it comes as no surprise when he suffers a fatal accident while fixing his own truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as her family and friends invade Lucy’s life and insist that the new widow is too fragile to do much beyond weeping, Lucy is ashamed to admit that life without Wayne is easier, less complicated. After all, no one knew what a relentless, soul-grinding trudge marriage to Wayne had been. Only Duffy can tell she’s hiding something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In need of a fresh start, Lucy asks Duffy to put his cabinet-building skills to use, transforming the town's meat shop into a bake shop. As the bakery takes shape, Lucy and Duffy discover the spark that pulled them together so many years ago. Could this finally be the second chance he’s always hoped for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again Molly Harper “writes characters you can’t help but fall in love with” (&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;) in this charming and entertaining love story.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sexy school principal Kyle faces the biggest challenge of his career: getting his (pregnant) event planner girlfriend Margot down the aisle before the baby arrives!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers first fell in love with big city event planner Margot in the first Southern Eclectic novel, &lt;i&gt;Sweet Tea and Sympathy&lt;/i&gt;, as she discovered a long-lost branch of her family—the McCreadys, of McCready's Bait Shop &amp;amp; Funeral Home. To Margot’s surprise, she's taken a liking to life in small-town Georgia...helped along by a romance with the hot elementary school principal.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The two of them have been taking it slow—or they were until Margot gets pregnant! Kyle wants to make an honest woman of her, but Margot's still trying to proceed with caution. After all, she was the best event planner in Chicago before she ever came to Lake Sackett—her wedding has to be perfect, and perfect includes &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; having the baby halfway down the aisle.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; With her trademark witty prose and warmhearted storytelling, Molly Harper’s newest glimpse of the McCready family will be perfect for fans of Christina Lauren and Amy E. Reichert.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From beloved award-winning actor, Neil Patrick Harris, comes the magical first book in a new series with plenty of tricks up its sleeve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When street magician Carter runs away, he never expects to find friends and magic in a sleepy New England town. But like any good trick, things change instantly as greedy B.B. Bosso and his crew of crooked carnies arrive to steal anything and everything they can get their sticky fingers on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a fateful encounter with the local purveyor of illusion, Dante Vernon, Carter teams up with five other like-minded kids. Together, using both teamwork and magic, they'll set out to save the town of Mineral Wells from Bosso's villainous clutches. These six &lt;i&gt;Magic Misfits&lt;/i&gt; will soon discover adventure, friendship, and their own self-worth in this delightful new series.</description>

  <description>Power can change a person…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months Molly Sullivan endures the inexplicable: electrical surges, car breakdowns, visions. She even wonders if she might be the cause… and wonders if she might be crazy. Then she discovers her husband has cheated on her. Again. Now Molly realizes she is a newly awakening witch and a woman pushed over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revenge can shape a person…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josiah Mason is a Powerful witch and the leader of a secret coven with a shared goal: to destroy an ancient enemy who has ruined many lives. Josiah lost years to this man, and his sole focus is revenge. He’s prepared for every contingency—except encountering a beautiful new witch who understands nothing of the immense Power building within her or the attraction she wields over him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danger can bring them together…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When divorcing her husband, Molly uncovers a dangerous secret he’s willing to kill to protect. She turns to Josiah for help, and they discover a connection between Molly’s husband and Josiah’s enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they work together, a spark ignites between them that threatens to become an inferno. But Molly is done compromising herself for any man, and Josiah’s mission is his top priority. And the enemy is cunning, cruel, and drawing ever closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the danger escalates, so does the tension between them. Is a lasting relationship possible? Will either of them live long enough to try?</description>

  <description>Werewolves meet the Wild West in this thrilling final installment of the Wolf Brides trilogy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lucianna Whitlock has her entire life planned out for her by men determined to use her as a pawn in high society marriage games. But when she balks against the cruel man who has won her hand, he rips her life apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A strapping cowboy, half-feral and fully terrifying, saves her life from her ex-fiancé’s vengeance. When her only hope is to escape to America beside the stranger with the inhuman eyes and that thick, southern drawl, she’ll have to decide whether escaping her old life is worth leaving everything she knows behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Gable Dawson has been running as a wolf for over a year, but saving Lucianna is breathing new life into the human form he left behind. To keep her safe, he’ll brave the rough waters of the Atlantic on a merchant ship, and travel back to the home in Colorado Springs he’s been avoiding for years. He’ll need the help of his pack to keep his woman safe. If anyone is worth facing his sordid past for, it’s Lucianna. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if he can claim his mate and protect her from the reach of the brutal man who’s hunting her, he just might save himself along the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, language, badass Wild West werewolves, and sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only shifter romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When playing a game of wits, never ever go up against the woman they call the Hellion . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it's business or pleasure, Lord Robert Carlisle never backs down from a dare. But finding a husband for scandalous Mariah Winslow? It's one challenge he instantly regrets accepting. Even with all his connections—and rakish charms—Robert will have to use every trick in the book to marry off a woman with no dowry and no sense of decorum...no matter how stunningly beautiful she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariah Winslow has no intention of being a pawn in Lord Robert's game. She knows he agreed to play matchmaker only to secure a partnership in her father's shipping company, a partnership that's rightfully hers. For now, though, she'll dress for the elegant balls he throws and dance with the eligible bachelors he chooses. But she won't be outwitted by the devil himself—no matter how tempting and irresistible she finds him.</description>

  <description>Werewolves meet the Wild West in this exciting second installment of the Wolf Brides trilogy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lorelei McGregor has tumbled from the top tier of Turn of the Century Boston society. Determined not to sully her family’s name further, she answers an ad in the newspaper for a mail order bride. The big city is no longer home, so she’ll try her hand at surviving the Wild West cattle town of Colorado Springs with her new stranger husband. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The man she meets is tall and strapping, and about as wild as a person can get. His strange mannerisms scream that something is off, but out of options, Lorelei has to learn to adapt to life on a homestead with a family who doesn’t seem altogether human. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jeremiah Dawson is keeping big secrets from his mail-order bride, but he can’t trust her with the truth until he knows she won’t run from him. When a mission to track down some of the most notorious outlaws in the Colorado territory goes wrong, he’ll have to learn to trust her, or cut her loose to save her from the feral animal inside of him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If he chooses wisely, he just might find the woman who can fix his broken wolf. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, language, badass Wild West werewolves, and sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only shifter romance. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Werewolves meet the Wild West in this captivating new shifter romance series from T. S. Joyce. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristina Yeaton is running from her past as a working girl at a Chicago brothel. Determined to start fresh in the wilds of Colorado, she answers an advertisement in the paper for a wife. So what if she doesn’t fit the description Luke Dawson wants in a woman? She aims to survive the hell that’s coming for her, and for that, she’ll need a strapping man who isn’t afraid to get his hands a little bloody. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kristina expects a hideous husband with a bad attitude to match. What she finds in Colorado Springs is crude talking, sexy as hell, commitment phobic, Luke. Sure, his eyes are a strange color, and the snarl in his throat can be off-putting, but as she gets to know more about him, she falls head over high-backed heels for the growly stranger. If she can get him to the circuit preacher before he learns her secrets, she just might have a shot at staying alive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Werewolf, Luke Dawson, is struggling with dark secrets of his own when Kristina barrels onto his homestead. No doubt she’s hiding something big, but she’s also stirring up feelings he’s never felt before. His wolf is more dangerous to her than she knows though, and he’ll have to work to keep her safe, even from himself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And as it turns out, he’s not the only one hunting her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, language, badass Wild West werewolves, and sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only shifter romance. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Cora Wright is walking a fine line between standing up for what’s right, and keeping her job secure. As a local news reporter, her need to defend the Breck Crew of newly outed bear shifters risks everything she loves about her life. But when she meets Boone Keller, tatted up bad boy bear shifter, her world tilts dangerously on its axis. And the more he lets her into his secret life, the harder she falls for a man she isn’t supposed to love. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If Boone wants to keep the fiery news reporter he’s been secretly coveting safe, the friend-zone is where she’ll have to stay. He’s been doing a bang-up job of avoiding the woman who has been publicly rallying for his crew, but a chance meeting with Cora is killing his reserve. And when she shuts down his attempt to push her away, he’ll have to decide whether to draw her in close to protect her from his secrets, or cut her loose to save her life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Quinn Copeland is starting fresh in a new town where nobody knows about her past. Chronically shy, she is determined to find her courage at her new job at the town veterinary clinic. But when a stoic stranger catches her in a moment of emotional turmoil, she learns that even the toughest looking men can have warm hearts. Unfortunately for her, Dade Keller keeps his secrets close to the vest, and what she doesn’t know about him could kill her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dade doesn’t feel anything. Not until he finds a mousy vet technician huddled in a corner crying. Human, submissive, and shy, Quinn couldn’t be further from what he would need in a mate. The Breck Crew is in the middle of a crisis that will alter their fate forever and throw their loved ones in the crosshairs of the human public. The last thing a woman like Quinn needs is to be weighed down by what he is, but his reluctant attention to her doesn’t go unnoticed, and keeping her out of harm’s way isn’t possible anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With their deepest secrets exposed, Quinn will have to find her bravery and decide if Dade’s fight is now her fight, too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Rory Dodson is done running. After one night of bliss with a man she never thought she’d see again, she’s in trouble with a young son who is housing one ferocious little bear cub inside of him. Desperate to keep her baby’s secret safe, she has nowhere to turn but to the man she was determined to keep in her past. What she doesn’t expect is the instantaneous, heart-pounding connection she remembers from before. But all of the sex appeal in the world can’t hide the fact that Cody Keller is keeping dark secrets of his own. &lt;br /&gt;Alpha bear shifter, Cody, is a firefighter by day but something more sinister by night. Towing a fine line between leading a normal life and keeping the government off his crew’s back, he has been running missions that few sane men would take, and even fewer would survive. But when the woman he has searched six years for blows back into town, toting a kid who bears his mark, his life is about to get a whole lot more complicated. &lt;br /&gt;It’s not enough to protect the Breck Crew from the growing threats around him anymore. Cody will have to push back and stand up for his kind if he wants a shot at keeping his fragile new family safe from what he’s become. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>A Fool Again is the story of Genevieve, who once made a dash to Gretna Greene to marry, but was caught by her father. Now, a few years later, the story opens at the funeral of her elderly husband (not the man she ran away to marry)...and that's all I'm going to say, besides to tell those of you who enjoyed Fool for Love that the hero of this story is Darby's brother, Tobias.&lt;br /&gt;-Eloisa James&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This novella originally appeared in the anthology &lt;i&gt;The One That Got Away&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A MOST INDECENT PROPOSAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annabelle Green needs a husband-and quickly. To inherit the only home she's ever known, she must be married by her twenty-fifth birthday. But finding a suitor has been next to impossible after a reckless rogue named Quinton Carlisle seduced her into a scandalous midnight tryst. Her reputation in ruins, Belle now needs a rather large favor. And she knows just who to turn to . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinn can hardly believe that the shy bookish girl he teased as a child has grown into such a brazen beauty. The very idea of marrying Belle to right the wrongs of his past is downright shocking . . . and deliciously tempting. Too bad marriage, convenient or otherwise, is the last thing Quinn wants. He'll help Belle find a husband and be on his way. But if he can't control his attraction to the bride-to-be, this marriage could go up in flames-of wicked desire.</description>

  <description>**Brand new standalone series from T. S. Joyce. Don’t miss the thrilling first book in Harper’s Mountains.** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Harper Keller is a shifter on borrowed time. After failing to find her treasure, her inner dragon is desperate to find anything to connect with. When a plea for help comes through from an old flame, she puts her life on hold to track him down. But when she finds Wyatt, it’s obvious time has changed him. He isn’t the sweet and steady boy she grew up with anymore, but is now a dominant, rip-roaring grizzly shifter with alpha bloodlines and a mountain of secrets. He’s dug himself into a deep hole, and is surrounded by danger from all sides, and now Harper had a big decision to make. Save herself, or spend her final days saving the man who is laying claim to her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wyatt James is on a mission to save the girl he left behind. He isn’t the man everyone thought he would be, and has been hiding from the people he cares about, including Harper. If she sees him now, she won’t recognize the monster he’s become, but if Wyatt wants a shot at saving her, he has to make his move. Drawing an ailing Bloodrunner Dragon in close will attract the predators though, so he has to be ready for anything. And as the danger that shadows his life grows thicker, he will have to risk everything he’s built to protect the dragon he loves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>Haydan Walker is perfectly content as the only remaining bachelor in the Ashe Crew. Sure, his crew seems happy, but his bear is different and has no urge to find a mate. So when one of the Gray Backs begs him to claim his sister, Haydan’s instinct is to run as far away as he can. Cassie Belle isn’t taking no for an answer, though, and Haydan is about to find out the little sexy-as-hell, smart-mouthed hellion is toting some serious baggage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cassie is no pushover. She knows what she wants, and she patiently hunts until she gets it. And right now, she wants Haydan to claim her so she’ll be under the protection of the giant, tatted-up, steely-eyed bad boy bear shifter. She’ll be the perfect mate—friends with benefits—and she’ll be sure to leave her emotions at the door. It’s a solid plan until Haydan shows her how different life could be if she’d only let someone in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Change is hard, and facing her past even harder, but if she can allow Haydan to help, Cassie just might find the sanctuary she’s been searching for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Danger, betrayal, and redemption come together in the sixth installment in T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Saw Bears series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Riley Miller is on the run. In an effort to do something nice, she lands right in the middle of danger. A trek to the wilderness will put her under Damon Daye’s protection, but it’ll also dump her in the direct path of one sexy, snarly lumberjack werebear, Drew. His interest is stirring up feelings she’s forgotten exist, but she can’t get too attached to him. She has two weeks to spend in the mountains, and after that, she must leave to reclaim her life back in the city. But the Ashe Crew isn’t making it easy on her. Here, she could find the life she’s been looking for if only her demons would stay in her past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Drew Hudson is losing his mind. Coming off a devastating loss, he’s doing anything he can think of to keep his inner bear from going stark raving mad, including risky stunts that threaten to expose the Ashe Crew as bear shifters. When a chance encounter with a sexy hitchhiker settles his animal side, he can’t help but wonder about all the secrets Riley Miller is keeping. But when her past unravels little by little, he’ll have to take control of his animal in order to protect her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And if he can allow this selfless, mind-consuming, tough-as-nails human to soften his heart, he just might find himself again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Arranged marriage, hidden agendas, deep secrets, and heart-pounding romance come together to tell Bruiser’s story in the 5th installment of T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Saw Bears series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Diem Daye has led a sheltered life. As the only breeding female of her kind, her father has kept her tucked away and heavily guarded. But when he makes a deal behind her back, and marries her off to a local lumberjack werebear, she fights everything that is expected of her. As the dust settles and she begins to realize just how special her arranged union to Bruiser Keller is, she’ll have to decide to make the ultimate sacrifice for her kind, or live and love in the safety of her new mate’s protection. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bruiser made a deal with a legendary shifter to save his family, but the consequences run deep when he returns home to the Asheland Mobile Park. Now he must marry a woman he’s never met, and if Diem’s pissed off countenance is anything to go by, she doesn’t want this pairing any more than he does. Bruiser vows to soften her hardened heart, but her secrets could bring danger to his beloved Ashe Crew, and could alter the course of his life forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Love comes at a cost for shifters like Bruiser and Diem. If they want a real shot at happiness, they’ll have to learn how to survive each other. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Slow-simmering romance, secrets by the dozen, heart-warming triumph, and a crew of sexy lumberjack werebears come together to tell Brighton’s story in this fourth installment of T. S. Joyce’s bestselling Saw Bears series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Brighton Beck’s inner grizzly is out of control. It’s been months since he killed his tormentor, but just seeing the man who stole his voice has put his bear on a bender. When a timid woman at a local diner approaches him, he couldn’t be less interested. She’s mousy, submissive, and worst of all…human. Or at least he thinks she is, but she proves to him things aren’t always as they appear. And now it’s up to Brighton, and his broken bear, to find out who Turned her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everly Moore is up to her eyeballs in problems, and at the top of the pile is a sickness her doctors can’t figure out. When Brighton takes an oath to draw her bear from her, it’s apparent he’s not only lost his voice, but he’s lost his mind as well. But when she discovers the dark secret of what’s been done to her, she’ll have to lean on the quiet man who has intrigued her throughout the years. The only problem is, Brighton is fighting demons of his own, and if she can’t reach the animal within her and survive the Change, she and the man she is falling in love with could both be lost. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Danielle Clayton is back in her old stomping grounds after years of avoiding the man she had to leave behind. She’s determined to make Saratoga her home again, but when she sets eyes on her snarly, sexy ex, it’s clear her feelings for him haven’t cooled at all in the years she’s been away. He kept too many secrets the first time around, but Denison has changed. Maybe this time he’ll open up and allow her into his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Country crooner, tatted-up bad boy and grizzly bear shifter, Denison Beck, has been burned by love. He chose a human mate at the tender age of twenty-one, but she left him high and dry with no explanation why. After four years of nursing a vow to never let a woman get close to him again, his ex blows into town and stirs up emotions he hasn’t felt in a long time. When forces beyond their control thrust them together, he’ll have to decide whether to trust her with his heart again or let her go. But if Danielle finds out what is really lurking in his past, it could put her life in danger, as well as that of his crew of lumberjack werebears. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Skyler Drake is in way over her head. As a breeder chosen by a Crestfall warrior, she’s had plenty of time to accept her fate. But when a chance encounter in Saratoga thrusts her into the path of a mysterious, and strange-talking shifter, Kellen, she begins to realize just how big the world is. And when Kellen-the-kidnapper turns out to be a battle-hardened werebear, she’s thinking she just might have stumbled upon someone who could love her despite her flaws—and possibly survive the wrath of her people. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kellen would rather be hanged than watch a woman be hurt and trapped in a life she doesn’t choose, and when he gets a glimpse at just how much Skyler is keeping inside, he doesn’t think, only acts on protective instinct. Sure, he’s kidnapping her, but he knows what she really is, and she can escape any time she wants. Unfortunately, his bold moves and determination to show Skyler just how unbreakable she can be put his crew of lumberjack bear shifters in peril. But if he can toe the edge of danger, and avoid the wrath of his alpha, he just might find a mate worth sharing his secrets with. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>Easton Novak is hiding something fearsome inside of him. An unconventional upbringing has turned his inner grizzly into a berserker—one who has all but destroyed his humanity. Being around people isn’t easy. Not when he doesn’t understand any of their reactions, or half of what they’re saying. And if he can convince his alpha he’s half sane, he just might let Easton live. But when the raven from Easton’s childhood shows up at his door again, he knows he’s slowly sinking into a madness he can’t come back from. &lt;br /&gt;She’s not real. &lt;br /&gt;She can’t be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Raven shifter, Aviana King, is terrified of bears. They’re her people’s natural enemy, but she hasn’t been able to forget the bear cub she befriended all those years ago. Faced with a loveless courtship she doesn’t want, she visits Easton just to see if the sparking feelings she felt for him when they were kids are still there. The only problem is, he thought she was just a friendly raven all those years ago, and now he doesn’t recognize her human form at all. But as she searches for the courage to approach him and his terrifying Gray Back Crew, it becomes clear that the sweet silver bear cub from her childhood has grown into a powerful, dominant, barely-controlled monster grizzly. &lt;br /&gt;Now, the greatest threat to Aviana’s life is the man she loves. &lt;br /&gt;He isn’t Easton Novak anymore. &lt;br /&gt;He’s Beaston. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Content Warning: explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. &lt;br /&gt;Adult only bear shifter romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;In this powerful and exciting fantasy set in the world of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling Others series, humans and the shape-shifting Others will see whether they can live side by side...without destroying one another.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ghost towns in the world—places where the humans were annihilated in retaliation for the slaughter of the shape-shifting Others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of those places is Bennett, a town at the northern end of the Elder Hills—a town surrounded by the wild country. Now efforts are being made to resettle Bennett as a community where humans and Others live and work together. A young female police officer has been hired as the deputy to a Wolfgard sheriff. A deadly type of Other wants to run a human-style saloon. And a couple with four foster children—one of whom is a blood prophet—hope to find acceptance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But as they reopen the stores and the professional offices and start to make lives for themselves, the town of Bennett attracts the attention of other humans looking for profit. And the arrival of the Blackstone Clan, outlaws and gamblers all, will uncover secrets…or bury them.</description>

  <description>A sizzling vampire romance anthology featuring enticing novellas from beloved and bestselling authors Katie MacAlister, Jessica Sims, and Molly Harper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “Shades of Gray” by Katie MacAlister, Noelle is a Guardian: a demon-wrangler, imp-banisher, and all-round secret protector of humans from the Otherworld. While working on the set of a ghost-busting reality show in a haunted castle, she meets a sexy vampire, and together they prevent a Master Demon from killing everyone in the castle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In “&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17373966.Undead_Sublet" title="Undead Sublet" rel="nofollow"&gt;Undead Sublet&lt;/a&gt;” by Molly Harper, executive chef Tess Maitland is banned from her five-star kitchen in Chicago to recover from “exhaustion.” Choosing a random rental house in Half-Moon Hollow to spend time in, she’s unaware that the house comes with a strange man. Even though Sam Masden’s ex-wife has rented the house out from under him, the divorce settlement allows him access to it for another ninety days. With Tess unable to go anywhere else, and Sam unwilling, a war of epic proportions is declared—and romantic sparks and heavy pots fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jessica Sims’s “Out With a Fang” features Ruby Sommers, a lonely were-jaguar who signs up for a blind date through the paranormal dating agency Midnight Liaisons. When she arrives, she finds out that her date, a vampire, was the human she’d been in love with four years ago but was forced to dump.</description>

  <description>It's warring nations, dueling philosophies and the battle of the sexes as American-born Miss Liberty Baylis takes on Simon Lansing, Viscount Brodham, in the fight for her friend's happiness. Brodham wants only to retire to the peace and quiet of his country estate, but he'll take on the cheeky American chit if that's what it takes to keep his nephew safe and happy. The war is on . . . but when banter and flirtation become weapons and kisses disrupt strategies, will Brodham and Liberty ever wish for the battles to end?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Joanna Shupe returns with another unforgettable novel set in the glittering world of New York City’s Gilded Age…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;They call her Lady Unlucky…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With three dead fiancés, Lady Eva Hyde has positively no luck when it comes to love. She sets sail for New York City, determined that nothing will deter her dream of becoming an architect, certainly not an unexpected passionate shipboard encounter with a mysterious stranger. But Eva’s misfortune strikes once more when she discovers the stranger who swept her off her feet is none other than her new employer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or is it Lady Irresistible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillip Mansfield reluctantly agrees to let the fiery Lady Eva oversee his luxury hotel project while vowing to keep their relationship strictly professional. Yet Eva is more capable—and more alluring—than Phillip first thought, and he cannot keep from drawing up a plan of his own to seduce her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a series of onsite “accidents” makes it clear someone wants Lady Unlucky to earn her nickname, Phillip discovers he’s willing to do anything to protect her—even if it requires A SCANDALOUS DEAL.</description>

  <description>In an enthralling new historical novel from national bestselling author Kate Quinn, two women - a female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I and an unconventional American socialite searching for her cousin in 1947 - are brought together in a mesmerizing story of courage and redemption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1947.&lt;/i&gt; In the chaotic aftermath of World War II, American college girl Charlie St. Clair is pregnant, unmarried, and on the verge of being thrown out of her very proper family. She's also nursing a desperate hope that her beloved cousin Rose, who disappeared in Nazi-occupied France during the war, might still be alive. So when Charlie's parents banish her to Europe to have her "little problem" taken care of, Charlie breaks free and heads to London, determined to find out what happened to the cousin she loves like a sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;1915&lt;/i&gt;. A year into the Great War, Eve Gardiner burns to join the fight against the Germans and unexpectedly gets her chance when she's recruited to work as a spy. Sent into enemy-occupied France, she's trained by the mesmerizing Lili, the "Queen of Spies", who manages a vast network of secret agents right under the enemy's nose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirty years later, haunted by the betrayal that ultimately tore apart the Alice Network, Eve spends her days drunk and secluded in her crumbling London house. Until a young American barges in uttering a name Eve hasn't heard in decades, and launches them both on a mission to find the truth ... no matter where it leads.</description>

  <description>In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A sexy standalone novel from New York Times and international bestselling author Elle Kennedy&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone says opposites attract. And they must be right, because there’s no logical reason why I’m so drawn to Colin Fitzgerald. I don’t usually go for tattoo-covered, video-gaming, hockey-playing nerd-jocks who think I’m flighty and superficial. His narrow view of me is the first strike against him. It doesn’t help that he’s buddy-buddy with my brother. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that his best friend has a crush on me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And that I just moved in with them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I not mention we’re roommates? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suppose it doesn’t matter. Fitzy has made it clear he’s not interested in me, even though the sparks between us are liable to burn our house down. I’m not the kind of girl who chases after a man, though, and I’m not about to start. I’ve got my hands full dealing with a new school, a sleazy professor, and an uncertain future. So if my sexy brooding roomie wises up and realizes what he’s missing? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He knows where to find me.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;One little wager will determine their fate—a daring escape or falling into temptation with a rakish lord.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Betsy Wilde’s first season was triumphant by any measure, and a duke has proposed—but before marriage, she longs for one last adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No gentleman would agree to her scandalous plan—but Lord Jeremy Roden is no gentleman. He offers a wager. If she wins a billiards game, he’ll provide the breeches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he wins…she is his, for one wild night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what happens when Jeremy realizes that one night will never be enough? In the most important battle of his life, he’ll have to convince Betsy to say no to the duke.</description>

  <description>What do a Black American soldier, invalided out at Yorktown, and a white British officer who deserted his post have in common? Quite a bit, actually. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;• They attempted to kill each other the first time they met. &lt;br /&gt;• They're liable to try again at some point in the five-hundred mile journey that they're inexplicably sharing. &lt;br /&gt;• They are not falling in love with each other. &lt;br /&gt;• They are not falling in love with each other. &lt;br /&gt;• They are… Oh, no. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pursuit Of…&lt;/em&gt; is about a love affair between two men and the Declaration of Independence. It’s a novella of around 38,000 words.</description>

  <description>This is a short story. It is not a full length book or novella. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;William Hampton, Viscount Worthe, prefers the remote stability and predictability of the stars to the perplexing changeability of people. An astronomer, he’s fashioned for himself a focused, industrious, simple life. He leaves his quiet retreat, however, when his mathematical computations, included in an article on orbital variations, are questioned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Miss Jane Tillney is volunteering at Half Moon House when Lord Worthe finds her. The Viscount is handsome and charming, but unfortunately his entire outlook is miscalculated, not just his astronomical equations. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lord Worthe is intrigued by Jane, her generous spirit and her unusual freckles, but can he find a way to open his heart and let her shine her light on his life? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>All Dr. Sloan Copeland needed was someone to watch her kids. What she found was the man of her dreams…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a nasty divorce and a thousand mile move, Dr. Sloan Copeland and her twin daughters are finally getting the hang of their new life in Los Angeles. When their live-in nanny bails with no warning, Sloan is left scrambling to find a competent caretaker to wrangle her smart, sensitive girls. Nothing less will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Rafe Whitcomb. He's all of those things, not to mention good-natured and one heck of a whiz in the kitchen. He's also tall, and handsome, and bearded, and ripped, and tatted, wrist to neck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't take long for the Copelands to invite Rafe into their home. Just as quickly, both Sloan and Rafe find themselves succumbing to a heady mutual attraction, neither of them wants to deny. With every minute they spend under the same roof, this working mom can't help but wonder if Rafe can handle all her needs...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46690050-marriage-of-inconvenience" rel="nofollow"&gt;B075VVRTJ7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wall Street Journal and USA Today Bestseller&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Kat Tanner (aka Kathleen Tyson. . . and yes, she is *that* Kathleen Tyson): 1) She’s determined to make good decisions, 2) She must get married ASAP, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being a billionaire heiress isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. In fact, it sucks. Determined to live a quiet life, Kat Tanner changed her identity years ago and eschewed her family’s legacy. But now, Kat’s silver spoon past has finally caught up with her, and so have her youthful mistakes. To avoid imminent disaster, she must marry immediately; it is essential that the person she chooses have no romantic feelings for her whatsoever and be completely trustworthy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, she knows exactly who to ask. Dan O’Malley checks all the boxes: single, romantically indifferent to her, completely trustworthy. Sure, she might have a wee little crush on Dan the Security Man, but with clear rules, expectations, and a legally binding contract, Kat is certain she can make it through this debacle with her sanity—and heart—all in one piece. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except, what happens when Dan O’Malley isn’t as indifferent—or as trustworthy—as she thought? &lt;br /&gt;</description>

He’d also like to forget her entirely, but that’s never going to happen. Roscoe remembers everything—every look, every word, every single unrequited second—and the last thing he needs is another memory of Simone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after one chance encounter, Simone keeps popping up everywhere he happens to be . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after Roscoe Winston dropped out of her life, all Simone Payton wants is to exploit him. She’d also like some answers from her former best friend about why he ghosted her, but if she never gets those answers, that’s a-okay. Simone let go of the past a long time ago. Seriously, she has. She totally, totally has. She is definitely not still thinking about Roscoe. Nope. She’s more than happy to forget he exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, she needs just one teeny-tiny favor . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Strange Beard is a full-length romantic comedy novel, can be read as a stand-alone, and is the fifth book in the USA TODAY bestselling Winston Brothers series.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[huh. Love Penny Reid but this one was just so so. She likes to write characters with quirks but it feels like she forgets about Roscoe's quirk for half this book (his photographic memory). It just pops in and out, but is mostly forgotten. Loved the multiracial couple element though.]]>

  <description>From Taylor Jenkins Reid, “a genius when it comes to stories about life and love” (&lt;i&gt;Redbook&lt;/i&gt;), comes an unforgettable and sweeping novel about one classic film actress’s relentless rise to the top—the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Written with Reid’s signature talent for “creating complex, likable characters” (&lt;i&gt;Real Simple&lt;/i&gt;), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Everything you wanted from a sexy gay werewolf but were afraid to read.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max fails at magic, relationships, and life. So he works as a sumage, cleaning up other mages’ messes. The job sucks and he’s in no mood to cope with redneck biker werewolves. Unfortunately, there’s something irresistible about the sexy muscled Beta visiting his office for processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryan is gay but he’s not out. There’s a good chance Max might be reason enough to leave the closet, if he can only get the man to go on a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows werewolves hate mages, but Bryan is determined to prove everyone wrong, even the mage in question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYT bestseller Gail Carriger, writing as G. L. Carriger, presents an offbeat gay romance in which a sexy werewolf with a white knight complex meets a bad boy mage with an attitude problem. Sparks (and other things) fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The San Andreas Shifter books stand alone and do not have to be read in any particular order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delicate Sensibilities?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story contains M/M sexitimes and horrible puns. If you get offended easily, then you probably will. The San Andreas Shifter stories include blue language, dirty deeds, and outright admiration for the San Francisco Bay Area. Not for the faint of heart/mouth/tongue…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Kiss Quotient&lt;/i&gt; comes a romantic novel about love that crosses international borders and all boundaries of the heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions — like grief. And love. He thinks he's defective. His family knows better— that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can't turn it down, thinking this could be the break her family needs. Seducing Khai, however, doesn't go as planned. Esme's lessons in love seem to be working... but only on herself. She's hopelessly smitten with a man who's convinced he can never return her affection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With Esme's time in the United States dwindling, Khai is forced to understand he's been wrong all along. And there's more than one way to love.</description>

  <description>Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.</description>

  <description>A serial murderer known only by a grotesquely apt nickname—Buffalo Bill—is stalking women. He has a purpose, but no one can fathom it, for the bodies are discovered in different states. Clarice Starling, a young trainee at the FBI Academy, is surprised to be summoned by Jack Crawford, chief of the Bureau's Behavioral Science section. Her assignment: to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter—Hannibal the Cannibal—who is kept under close watch in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lecter is a former psychiatrist with a grisly history, unusual tastes, and an intense curiosity about the darker corners of the mind. His intimate understanding of the killer and of Clarice herself form the core of &lt;i&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/i&gt;—an ingenious, masterfully written book and an unforgettable classic of suspense fiction.</description>

  <description>After three failed seasons and a disastrous jilting, Lady Dorothea Beaumont has had more than enough of her family’s scheming. She won’t domesticate a duke, entangle an earl, or vie for a viscount. She will quietly exit to her aunt’s Irish estate for a life of blissful freedom. Until an arrogant, sinfully handsome duke singles her out for a waltz, making Thea the most popular belle of the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duke ruined her plans and he’ll just have to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garrett, Duke of Osborne, is far too heartless for debutantes or marriage—he uses dalliances and public spectacle to distract from his real purpose: finding the man who destroyed his family. When his search leads to Ireland, the last thing he needs is the determined, achingly innocent Thea, who arrives in the dead of night demanding he escort her to her aunt. His foolish agreement may prove his undoing. The road to the Emerald Isle is fraught with unforeseen dangers, but the greatest peril of all might just be discovering that he has a heart . . . and he’s losing it to Thea. </description>

  <description>A Half Moon House Novella! Tall, practical girls might not be worth much in a man's world, but Miss Lisbeth Moreton knows she's worth more than the squire's prized heifer. To change her fate she's run off to a date with destiny at the British Museum. Her would-be suitor never shows, but an unexpected encounter with Lord Cotwell and his lonely ward might lead to altogether new prospects . . . and perhaps to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The old eddas speak of &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt;—fabled creatures that haunt the depths of Iceland's volcanoes and steal away fair maidens.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haakon wants none of such myths. For years he's searched for the beast that stole his wife, desperate to slay the golden &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt; and rescue his precious Árja. He has sacrificed everything to find her—including his honor—but now Haakon knows the truth. His entire marriage was a lie. The woman he knew as his wife was no victim, but the &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt; herself. And when he finally tracks down the deceitful princess, there will be a reckoning of passion and glory....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She came to him on a storm...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long ago, Árdís gave her heart to a mortal man, despite knowing it could only end in tragedy. When her clan summoned her home, she had no choice but to leave—or see her husband pitted against her vicious cousin, Sirius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sirius insists upon a betrothal that will help him gain the &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt; throne, she is forced to flee—straight into the arms of the now-ruthless dragon hunter she once called husband. But can Haakon ever forgive her deceit? And can she save him from a spurned dreki prince who would see them both dead?</description>

  <description>The arrogant Duke of Trent intends to marry a well-bred Englishwoman. The last woman he would ever consider marrying is the adventuresome Merry Pelford - an American heiress who has infamously jilted two fiancés. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after one provocative encounter with the captivating Merry, Trent desires her more than any woman he has ever met. He is determined to have her as his wife, no matter what it takes. And Trent is a man who always gets what he wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, Merry is already betrothed, and the former runaway bride has vowed to make it all the way to the altar. As honor clashes with irresistible passion, Trent realizes the stakes are higher than anyone could have imagined. In his battle to save Merry and win her heart, one thing becomes clear: All is fair in love and war.</description>

  <description>The Reluctant Royals series returns with a good girl searching for the life that’s not too big, and not too small, and the bad boy prince who might be just right for her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya Jerami fled Thesolo for the glitz and glamour of NYC but discovered that her Prince Charming only exists in her virtual dating games. When Nya returns home for a royal wedding, she accidentally finds herself up close and personal—in bed—with the real-life celebrity prince who she loves to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Johan von Braustein, the red-headed step-prince of Liechtienbourg, acting as paparazzi bait is a ruse that protects his brother—the heir to the throne—and his own heart. When a royal referendum threatens his brother’s future, a fake engagement is the perfect way to keep the cameras on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nya and Johan both have good reasons to avoid love, but as desires are laid bare behind palace doors, they must decide if their fake romance will lead to a happily-ever-after.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semi Finalist: Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Romance 2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All is fair in love and auto maintenance.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Beau Winston is the nicest, most accommodating guy in the world. Usually. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Handsome as the devil and twice as charismatic, Beau lives a charmed life as everyone’s favorite Winston Brother. But since his twin decided to leave town, and his other brother hired a stunning human-porcupine hybrid as a replacement mechanic for their auto shop, Beau Winston’s charmed life has gone to hell in a handbasket. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shelly Sullivan is not nice and is never accommodating. Ever. &lt;br /&gt;She mumbles to herself, but won’t respond when asked a question. She glares at everyone, especially babies. She won’t shake hands with or touch another person, but has no problems cuddling with a dog. And her damn parrot speaks only in curse words. Beau wants her gone. He wants her out of his auto shop, out of Tennessee, and out of his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only problem is, learning why this porcupine wears her coat of spikes opens a Pandora’s box of complexity—exquisite, tempting, heartbreaking complexity—and Beau Winston soon discovers being nice and accommodating might mean losing what matters most.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47172693-dating-ish" rel="nofollow"&gt;B06XCJ53V5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now a USA TODAY BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Marie Harris: &lt;br /&gt;1) She’s fed up with online dating, &lt;br /&gt;2) She’s so fed up, she’s willing to forego the annoyance and consider more creative alternatives, and &lt;br /&gt;3) She knows how to knit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the most bizarre and irritating first date in the history of human kind, Marie is looking for an alternative to men. With the help of her friends, she quickly identifies a few possibilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a cuddle? Use a professional cuddler. Need affirmation? Get yourself a life coach. Need an orgasm? Try orgasm meditation! Why does she need the hassle of a romantic partner when she can meet all her needs with paid services?&lt;br /&gt;But then her irritating date resurfaces. And he’s not at all the person she thought he was. And he suggests a different—and crazier—solution to her dilemma . . .&lt;br /&gt;As everyone knows (or will soon come to realize), traditional relations between humans are a thing of the past. Robots are our future. And if robots are our future, then why do we need other people at all?</description>

  <description>Set in the Georgian period, about 20 years before the Regency, These Old Shades is considered to be the book that launched Heyer's career. It features two of Heyer's most memorable characters: Justin Alastair, the Duke of Avon, and Leonie, whom he rescues from a life of ignomy and comes to love and marry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Duke is known for his coldness of manner, his remarkable omniscience, and his debauched lifestyle. Late one evening, he is accosted by a young person dressed in ragged boy's clothing running away from a brutal rustic guardian. The Duke buys "Leon" and makes the child his page. "Leon" is in fact Leonie, and she serves the Duke with deep devotion. When he uncovers the true story of her birth, he wreaks an unforgettable revenge on her sinister father in a chilling scene of public humiliation.ce!</description>

      <![CDATA[Hmm, Georgette doesn't portray women in a very likeable light in this book. And much of the drama could have been avoided if the male lead hadn't treated the female lead like an unreliable &amp; untrustworthy woman. Not a fan of this one. ]]>

The first 16k words of this novella are from the short scenes included in 'Scenes from the City', which is no longer for sale.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[this series is amazing. My favorite of the books is #2, and #1 is also dang good, this book is not as brilliant as the other two, it has moments of the same OH MY GOD sentiment and the ending is good imo, so taken as a whole series I am extremely happy!]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh continues her Hard Play series with a sweet, sexy romance featuring big, fat, OTT weddings, a meddling grandma, and a too-serious hero who needs to be unbuttoned…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nayna Sharma agreed to an arranged marriage in the hope it would heal the fractures in her beloved family… only to realize too late that a traditional marriage is her personal nightmare. Panicked, she throws caution to the winds, puts on the tiniest dress she can find, and ends up in the arms of a tall, rough-edged hunk of a man who has abs of steel—and who she manages to mortally insult between one kiss and the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned as a child, then adopted into a loving family, Raj Sen believes in tradition, in continuity. Some might call him stiff and old-fashioned, but he knows what he wants—and it’s a life defined by rules… yet he can’t stop thinking about the infuriating and sexy woman who kissed him in the moonlight then disappeared. When his parents spring an introduction on him, the last woman he expects is her. Beautiful. Maddening. A rulebreaker in the making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He’s all wrong for her. She’s all wrong for him. And love is about to make rebels of them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Who needs mistletoe?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people wouldn’t think of a bad Santa case as the perfect Christmas gift. Then again, Molly Malone, office manager at Hunt Investigations, isn’t most people, and she could really use a distraction from the fantasies she’s been having since spending the night with her very secret crush, Lucas Knight. Nothing happened, not that Lucas knows that—but Molly just wants to enjoy being a little naughty for once ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiskey and pain meds for almost-healed bullet wounds don’t mix. Lucas needs to remember that next time he’s shot on the job, which may be sooner rather than later if Molly’s brother, Joe, finds out about them. Lucas can’t believe he’s drawing a blank on his (supposedly) passionate tryst with Molly, who’s the hottest, smartest, strongest woman he’s ever known. Strong enough to kick his butt if she discovers he’s been assigned to babysit her on her first case. And hot enough to melt his cold heart this Christmas.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>The sequel to VICIOUS, V.E. Schwab's first adult novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sydney once had Serena—beloved sister, betrayed enemy, powerful ally. But now she is alone, except for her thrice-dead dog, Dol, and then there's Victor, who thinks Sydney doesn't know about his most recent act of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victor himself is under the radar these days—being buried and re-animated can strike concern even if one has superhuman powers. But despite his own worries, his anger remains. And Eli Ever still has yet to pay for the evil he has done.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;These casually drawn, perfectly on-point comics by the hugely popular young Brooklyn-based artist Sarah Andersen are for the rest of us. They document the wasting of entire beautiful weekends on the internet, the unbearable agony of holding hands on the street with a gorgeous guy, and dreaming all day of getting home and back into pajamas. In other words, the horrors and awkwardnesses of young modern life. Oh and they are totally not autobiographical. At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adulthood Is a Myth&lt;/i&gt; presents many fan favorites plus dozens of all-new comics exclusive to this book. Like the work of fellow Millennial authors Allie Brosh, Grace Helbig, and Gemma Correll, Sarah's frankness on personal issues like body image, self-consciousness, introversion, relationships, and the frequency of bra-washing makes her comics highly relatable and deeply hilarious. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Award-winning author Alyssa Cole’s Reluctant Royals series continues with a woman on a quest to be the heroine of her own story and the duke in shining armor she rescues along the way…&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City socialite and perpetual hot mess Portia Hobbs is tired of disappointing her family, friends, and—most importantly—herself. An apprenticeship with a struggling swordmaker in Scotland is a chance to use her expertise and discover what she’s capable of. Turns out she excels at aggravating her gruff silver fox boss…when she’s not having inappropriate fantasies about his sexy Scottish burr&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavish McKenzie doesn’t need a rich, spoiled American telling him how to run his armory…even if she is infuriatingly good at it. Tav tries to rebuff his apprentice—and his attraction to her—but when Portia accidentally discovers that he’s the secret son of a duke, rough-around-the-edges Tav becomes her newest makeover project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forging metal into weapons and armor is one thing, but when desire burns out of control and the media spotlight gets too hot to bear, can a commoner turned duke and his posh apprentice find lasting love?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I was a loner for a reason.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had too many secrets, too much to hide, and way too much at stake. So, when a stranger showed up at my door, with her talk of saving the world, I should have sent her away. &lt;br /&gt;I didn’t. &lt;br /&gt;I had to have her, even if I was a criminal...and a virgin. &lt;br /&gt;So, I let her in, made her mine. &lt;br /&gt;Then everything went to hell. And I had to decide, just how far would I go to keep my woman? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loving the Secret Billionaire is a sexy standalone novella, in the Love at Last series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Originally published in the Rogue Affair anthology, this edition has been expanded with new material.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"Everyone knows a rancher in possession of a large spread needs a wife."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lacy Williams is a &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the acclaimed Wyoming Legacy and Cowboy Fairytales series.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About Cowboy Pride: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;First impressions count.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Liza Bennett has two missions in life: keep the family’s shop afloat, and ensure her shy sister finds love. Sparks fly when she meets rancher Rob Darcy at a town dance, but when she overhears him insult her, she vows to put the man out of her mind. Rob Darcy is instantly attracted to the vivacious Liza but a lack of social graces and the promise he’s keeping ruin his chances of winning her. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once jilted, Janie Bennett is appropriately gun-shy of falling in love again. But she doesn't seem to be able to help herself when she meets charming Nathan Bingley. Bingley desperately wants a wife and family of his own. Can he trust that Janie returns his feelings? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Janie is injured in a spring storm, she and Liza are sequestered on Nathan’s ranch. Hearts and emotions get tangled, but will first impressions prove true, or false? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Cowboy Pride is a Wild West version of Pride and Prejudice with dual love stories.&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>EFFICIENT SPINSTER OR DESIRABLE WOMAN? Adopting the guise of a buttoned-up spinster is nothing new for Chloe Hardwick. But under the watchful eye of her unnervingly handsome employer, the Marquess of Marland, for the first time Chloe yearns to be &lt;i&gt;unbuttoned&lt;/i&gt;! Yet he sees her only as his assistant, the efficient Hardwick-not as Chloe the woman.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to escape Braedon's cold detachment, Chloe leaves. And when he pursues her to London, determined to entice her back, Braedon is utterly unprepared for what he finds there-the &lt;i&gt;real &lt;/i&gt;Chloe Hardwick....</description>

  <description>In Prattville (formerly called Dead Dog), Oklahoma, in 1916, Tulsa May Bruder has given up on love. Her first and only suitor -- Doctor Odysseus P. Foote, better known as Doc Odie -- has jilted her at their very public engagement party. The whole town is talking and Tulsa May feels like the local wallflower. But then Luther Harlan Briggs, who has been like a brother to her for the last decade, tries to retrieve Tulsa's standing by pretending to court her, knowing that a new gentleman caller -- especially one with his wild reputation -- will replace the old one in the town folks' gossip. Suddenly, Tulsa May sees a face she's known forever in a whole new light - and realizes that, as Luther says, "friendship can turn to romance in the blink of an eye."</description>

  <description>Aerospace engineer Esther Abbott doesn’t believe in love, but she’s perfectly happy hating her screenwriter neighbor, Jonathan. Until she’s forced to make a devil’s bargain with him: if he distracts her best friend from a mouth-breather ex, Esther will be his science advisor for the sci-fi script he's writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her patience is put to the test when it’s time to fulfill her end of the deal. But the more time she spends with her nemesis, the more hate turns into attraction—and attraction into something much deeper. As Esther’s carefully-constructed defenses start to crumble, will love be her undoing or her salvation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intermediate Thermodynamics&lt;/i&gt; follows in the tradition of contemporary romantic comedy favorites like Penny Reid, Sally Thorne, and Jennifer Crusie. This sweet, enemies-to-lovers romance is the second in a series of standalone rom-coms featuring geeky heroines who work in STEM fields.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The richest bachelor in England plays matchmaker…for an heiress he wants for himself!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beautiful, witty Lavinia Gray, there's only one thing worse than having to ask the appalling Parth Sterling to marry her: being turned down by him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the richest bachelor in England, Parth is not about to marry a woman as reckless and fashion-obsessed as Lavinia; he's chosen a far more suitable bride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he learns of Lavinia's desperate circumstances, he offers to find her a husband. Even better, he'll find her a prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, there's no problem Parth can't fix. But the more time he spends with the beguiling Lavinia, the more he finds himself wondering…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does the woman who's completely wrong feel so right in his arms?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An updated cover edition can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40785611-the-princess-trap" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He’s reckless, dominant, and deliciously dirty. This prince is no fairytale. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Ruben of Helgmøre knows &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what he wants—and his current obsession is Cherry Neita. Everything from her rollercoaster curves to her fearsome attitude commands his attention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And best of all? She has no idea who Ruben is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the paparazzi catch them in a dark alley, her scarlet lipstick smudged, and his hands somewhere naughty…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Cherry wanted was a night or two with the hottest man she’d ever seen. Turns out, that man is actually a &lt;i&gt;prince,&lt;/i&gt; and now he needs her to play princess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, princess-to-be. &lt;b&gt;One year as his fake fiancée, and he’ll make all her problems disappear.&lt;/b&gt; Easy. Right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closer Cherry gets to Ruben, the brighter their passion burns. But the royal family hides dark secrets, and their palace is a diamond-studded trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can true love bloom from false beginnings? Or will this fairytale end in a happy-never-after?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Princess Trap is a steamy, standalone BWWM royal romance. Warning: this book is 70,000+ words of extreme pleasure and intense romance, ending in a HEA. NO cliffhangers and NO cheating. Enjoy responsibly!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Please be aware: this story contains scenes of abuse that could potentially trigger certain audiences.***</description>

  <description>Two teens are forced to murder—maybe each other—in the first in a chilling new series from Neal Shusterman, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Unwind dystology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where disease has been eliminated, the only way to die is to be randomly killed (“gleaned”) by professional reapers (“scythes”). Citra and Rowan are teenagers who have been selected to be scythe’s apprentices, and—despite wanting nothing to do with the vocation—they must learn the art of killing and come to understand the necessity of what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one of them will be chosen as a scythe’s apprentice. And when it becomes clear that the winning apprentice’s first task will be to glean the loser, Citra and Rowan are pitted against one another in a fight for their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of the Killer Instincts novels “knows how to write scorching sexual tension” &lt;i&gt;(USA Today)&lt;/i&gt;. Now she really sets it on fire in a new series about men and women living on the edge of violence, sex, and life and death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a devastating war decimated most of the world, Hudson Lane has only known the oppressive life under her own father’s tyranny. She finally escapes, branding herself an outlaw and hunted by the Enforcers. Her best chance at survival is Connor Mackenzie, an aggressively sensual fugitive who opens her eyes to the wicked possibilities of a world without rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the leader of a band of outlaw fighters, Connor can’t resist the beautiful stranger who asks for his protection. Despite his reservations, he agrees to introduce her to a whole new way of life. But when Connor discovers Hudson’s connection to the enemies of liberty, he wonders how far he can trust the woman who has abandoned all inhibitions to challenge every forbidden desire.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One summer, two sisters and a chance to start over…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the burglary that shattered her confidence, Phoenix Rose had a fiancé, a successful store and a busy, happy existence. After months spent adrift, she takes a job at the lakeside resort of Cooper’s Charm. Surrounded by beautiful scenery, friendly colleagues and a charismatic, widowed boss, Phoenix is slowly inching her way back into the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visiting Cooper’s Charm to check up on her little sister, Ridley Rose impulsively agrees to fill in as housekeeper. Still reeling from an ego-bruising divorce, she finds satisfaction in a job well done—and in the attention of the resort’s handsome scuba instructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Phoenix and Ridley, Cooper’s Charm is supposed to be merely temporary. But this detour may lead to the place they most need to be, where the future is as satisfying as it is surprising…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt; A dragon as a handyman? Ridiculous.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least Liam Steel thinks so. Sure, he and his crew of newly-awakened metal dragons are experts at building things, but after being sunk at the bottom of a frozen ocean, all they want is to find the mates they were sailing in search of in the first place, and Liam isn't sure how that can happen while he's playing in the dirt. Until he meets his first client, a sweet, curvy, no-nonsense business-woman busy taking care of everyone but herself. His heart screams 'mate', and he's ready to get his hands on more than her yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate Hinton doesn't know what to make of the beefcake Rent-A-Dragon sent over to help with her yard. Impossibly tall with soulful teal eyes, dark hair, and the features of a male model, she's pretty sure he should be walking a runway rather than digging trenches in her yard. And the way he looks at her? Like nothing else matters in the world. But the more she gets to know her kind, friendly, amazingly efficient handyman, the more she is realizing he's not from her world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lives in a remodeled castle. He doesn't know certain modern words. And he definitely doesn't understand the rules of modern courtship. But somehow, Kate is finding herself falling in love with this 'dragon' all the same, and finding out there is a whole other world outside her own. One full of secrets, and danger, and maybe even the love of a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Steel is the first book in the Rent-A-Dragon series! It contains stubborn dragons, action-packed fights, and hot, steamy dragon romance. Enjoy!&lt;/b&gt;

  <description>Welcome to Nocturne Falls, the town that celebrates Halloween 365 days a year. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The tourists think it's all a show: the vampires, the werewolves, the witches, the occasional gargoyle flying through the sky. But the supernaturals populating the town know better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Living in Nocturne Falls means being yourself. Fangs, fur, and all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When Delaney Ellingham enters the Nocturne Falls Valentine’s Day Bake-Off, she has no idea that an old rival will create such havoc. Her husband, Hugh, and her friends all come to her aid, but even they can’t guess the surprise that lays in store…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist: Goodreads Choice Awards, Best Romance 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make a deal with the devil and you might get what you want, but will it be what you need?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Sylvester wants one thing, and that one thing is NOT to be Tennessee’s reigning Banana Cake Queen. Ever the perpetual good girl and obedient daughter, Jennifer is buckling under the weight of her social media celebrity, her mother’s ambitions, and her father’s puritanical mandates. Jennifer is officially desperate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And desperate times call for Cletus Winston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cletus Winston is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery covered in conundrum sauce, and now he’s in a pickle. Despite being convinced of his own omniscience, extortion by the exalted Banana Cake Queen of Green Valley has taken him completely by surprise. So... what’s a maniacal mastermind to do? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely, the last thing you expect.</description>

  <description> There's a first time for everything.  &lt;br /&gt;Lark Wainright used to be fearless. Her life was a series of adventures, each one more exhilarating than the last. But her recent overseas adventure was one too many. Now she’s home and in one piece. Mostly. But her nights are filled with terror. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When her best friend offers her a stay at the orchard in exchange for help at the farmers’ markets, Lark jumps at the chance to spend fall in Vermont. But her nightmares don’t stop. Desperate to keep her fragile state a secret, she relies on the most soft-spoken resident of the Shipley Farm to soothe her when her dreams prove too much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zachariah is a survivor, too. It’s been four years since he was tossed aside by the polygamist cult where he grew up. He’s found a peaceful existence on the Shipley’s farm, picking apples and fixing machinery. But getting thrown away by your own people at nineteen leaves a mark on a guy. He doesn’t always know what to make of a world where movie quotes are the primary means of communication. Before hitchhiking to Vermont, he’d never watched TV or spoken on the phone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Actually, there are a lot of things he’s never done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Zach and Lark slowly grow to trust one another. One night they become even closer than they’d planned. But Lark may still be too broken to trust anyone. When she pushes Zach away, he will have to prove to himself that he's good for much more than farm labor.</description>

  <description> She’s the only one who ever loved him—and the only one he can never have.  &lt;br /&gt;Jude lost everything one spring day when he crashed his car into an apple tree on the side of the road. A man is dead, and there's no way he can ever right that wrong. He’d steer clear of Colebury, Vermont forever if he could. But an ex-con in recovery for his drug addiction can’t find a job just anywhere. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sophie Haines is stunned by his reappearance. After a three year absence, the man who killed her brother and broke her heart is suddenly everywhere she turns. It’s hard not to stare at how much he’s changed. The bad boy who used to love her didn’t have big biceps and sun-kissed hair. And he’d never volunteer in the church kitchen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No one wants to see Sophie and Jude back together, least of all Sophie's police chief father. But it's a small town. And forbidden love is a law unto itself.</description>

  <description>Lead, captain of an elite team of powerful dragons, is about to embark on the most difficult mission he's ever undertaken: trying not to fall in love with the cute, curvy woman he saved and is now tasked with protecting. But how is he supposed to do that when everything inside the honor-obsessed dragon roars "mate" whenever he sees her?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brittany is just a regular human. She never expected to be kidnapped by wolves or for six ridiculously hot dragon shifters to rescue her. But there's one dragon, with bright golden eyes, dark hair and the composure of a warrior that she can't seem to stop thinking about. Especially while she's living in a mansion with him and his sexy friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sexual tension between them rises like dragon flame, Lead and Brittany will have to navigate the blurred lines of duty and integrity in a world that is only getting more confusing with each passing day. And with a sinister new evil on the horizon, Lead may need to reconsider what honor really means if he wants to protect his mate.</description>

      <![CDATA[Oh dear. The traveling to other worlds subgenre to the Paranormal Romance genre for some reason never has the highest caliber of writing. In fact, this is pretty good writing comparitively, but that's not saying a whole lot. Still the story was interesting enough that I will try one more book. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the internationally bestselling author Sarah Winman comes an unforgettable and heartbreaking novel celebrating love in all of its forms and the little moments that make up the life of an autoworker in a small working-class town.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is almost a love story. But it's not as simple as that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellis and Michael are twelve when they first become friends, and for a long time it is just the two of them, cycling the streets of Oxford, teaching themselves how to swim, discovering poetry, and dodging the fists of overbearing fathers. And then one day this closest of friendships grows into something more.&lt;br /&gt;     But then we fast forward a decade or so, to find that Ellis is married to Annie, and Michael is nowhere in sight. Which leads to the question, what happened in the years between? &lt;br /&gt;     With beautiful prose and characters that are so real that they jump off the page, &lt;i&gt;Tin Man&lt;/i&gt; is a love letter to human kindness and friendship, and to loss and living.</description>

  <description>When Jamie Flipkens signed on as a pilot and engineer for a small medical research company, she never expected to end up on a mercenary ship full of hulking soldiers who want to make her their latest conquest. The captain has been good to her--it doesn't hurt that he's her boss's new beau--but she's on the verge of quitting when a strange man shows up at her shuttle door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sergei Zharkov claims to be an old friend of the captain's. He neglects to mention that he's also an assassin, a dangerous man who even the hardened mercenaries avoid. Jamie should avoid him, too, but she's drawn to the charm that sometimes escapes from beneath his grim facade. She finds herself wanting to give him a reason to smile--and maybe a little more than that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? There's a fresh bounty on the captain's head, and it's possible Sergei is there to collect it.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When Wicked Comes Calling...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a mysterious stranger finds his way into her bedchamber and offers his help in landing a duke, Lady Felicity Faircloth agrees—on one condition. She's seen enough of the world to believe in passion, and won't accept a marriage without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wallflower Makes a Dangerous Bargain...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bastard son of a duke and king of London's dark streets, Devil has spent a lifetime wielding power and seizing opportunity, and the spinster wallflower is everything he needs to exact a revenge years in the making. All he must do is turn the plain little mouse into an irresistible temptress, set his trap, and destroy his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Promise of Passion...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's nothing plain about Felicity Faircloth, who quickly decides she'd rather have Devil than another. Soon, Devil's carefully laid plans are in chaos, and he must choose between everything he's ever wanted...and the only thing he's ever desired.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No day is ordinary in a world where Technology and Magic compete for supremacy…But no matter which force is winning, in the apocalypse, a sword will always work.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugh d’Ambray, Preceptor of the Iron Dogs, Warlord of the Builder of Towers, served only one man. Now his immortal, nearly omnipotent master has cast him aside. Hugh is a shadow of the warrior he was, but when he learns that the Iron Dogs, soldiers who would follow him anywhere, are being hunted down and murdered, he must make a choice: to fade away or to be the leader he was born to be. Hugh knows he must carve a new place for himself and his people, but they have no money, no shelter, and no food, and the necromancers are coming. Fast. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Elara Harper is a creature who should not exist. Her enemies call her Abomination; her people call her White Lady. Tasked with their protection, she's trapped between the magical heavyweights about to collide and plunge the state of Kentucky into a war that humans have no power to stop. Desperate to shield her people and their simple way of life, she would accept help from the devil himself—and Hugh d’Ambray might qualify. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugh needs a base, Elara needs soldiers. Both are infamous for betraying their allies, so how can they create a believable alliance to meet the challenge of their enemies? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As the prophet says: “It is better to marry than to burn.” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hugh and Elara may do both. &lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity, and is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods: witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When love drives Circe to cast a dark spell, wrathful Zeus banishes her to the remote island of Aiaia. There she learns to harness her occult craft, drawing strength from nature. But she will not always be alone; many are destined to pass through Circe's place of exile, entwining their fates with hers. The messenger god, Hermes. The craftsman, Daedalus. A ship bearing a golden fleece. And wily Odysseus, on his epic voyage home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is danger for a solitary woman in this world, and Circe's independence draws the wrath of men and gods alike. To protect what she holds dear, Circe must decide whether she belongs with the deities she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Author of &lt;i&gt;Act Like It&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pretty Face&lt;/i&gt; Lucy Parker returns readers to the West End, where it’s fireworks onstage and off in a sexy enemies-to-lovers showdown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, circus artist Trix Lane was the best around. Her spark vanished with her confidence, though, and reclaiming either has proved…difficult. So when the star of The Festival of Masks is nixed and Trix is unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight, it’s exactly the push she needs. But the joy over her sudden elevation in status is cut short by a new hire on the makeup team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo Magasiva: disgraced wizard of special effects. He of the beautiful voice and impressive beard. Complete dickhead and—in an unexpected twist—an enragingly good kisser. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Leo, something about Trix is…different. Lovely. Beautiful, even though the pint-size, pink-haired former bane of his existence still spends most of her waking hours working to annoy him. They’ve barely been able to spend two minutes together for years, and now he can’t get enough of her. On stage. At home. In his bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to commitment, Trix has been there, done that, never wants to do it again. Leo’s this close to the job of a lifetime, which would take him away from London—and from Trix. Their past is a constant barrier between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utterly impossible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is approximately 82,000 words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One-click with confidence. This title is part of the Carina Press Romance Promise: all the romance you’re looking for with an HEA/HFN. It’s a promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carina Press acknowledges the editorial services of Deborah Nemeth</description>

  <description>“A tale of murder and intrigue that will ensnare knitters and non-knitters alike. I couldn’t put it down.”—Barbara Ross, author of &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Musseled Out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Time has not been kind to sleepy Dorset Falls, Connecticut, where an erstwhile resident is hoping to bring a tattered yarn shop back to life—but with a murderer on the loose, the whole town is in knots…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Josie Blair left Dorset Falls twelve years ago in hopes of making it big in New York City. But after earning an overpriced master’s degree and getting fired by a temperamental designer, she finds herself heading back to her hometown. Her great-uncle was injured in a car accident, and newly unemployed Josie is the only person available to take care of him. Uncle Eb’s wife didn’t survive the crash, so Josie is also tasked with selling the contents of her Aunt Cora’s yarn shop. But the needling ladies of the Charity Knitters Association pose a far bigger challenge than a shop full of scattered skeins…&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Miss Marple Knits is one of the few businesses still open in the dreary downtown. Josie can’t imagine how it stayed open for so long, yet something about the cozy, resilient little shop appeals to her. But when one of the town’s most persnickety knitters turns up dead in a pile of cashmere yarn, Josie realizes there’s something truly twisted lurking beneath the town’s decaying façade…&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; INCLUDES ORIGINAL KNITTING PATTERNS!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From acclaimed author Alyssa Cole comes the tale of a city Cinderella &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;and her Prince Charming in disguise . . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between grad school and multiple jobs, Naledi Smith doesn’t have time for fairy tales…or patience for the constant e-mails claiming she’s betrothed to an African prince. Sure. Right. &lt;em&gt;Delete! &lt;/em&gt;As a former foster kid, she’s learned that the only things she can depend on are herself and the scientific method, and a silly e-mail won’t convince her otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Thabiso is the sole heir to the throne of Thesolo, shouldering the hopes of his parents and his people. At the top of their list? His marriage. Ever dutiful, he tracks down his missing betrothed. When Naledi mistakes the prince for a pauper, Thabiso can’t resist the chance to experience life—and love—without the burden of his crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between them is instant and irresistible, and flirty friendship quickly evolves into passionate nights. But when the truth is revealed, can a princess in theory become a princess ever after?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the world to predict what will make your heart tick.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases — a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice — with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan — from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making her feel. Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will convince Stella that love is the best kind of logic...</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the CEO and her lawyers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/i&gt; got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the &lt;i&gt;Journal&lt;/i&gt; were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Nevada Frida Baylor and Connor Ander Rogan cordially invite you to join their wedding celebration. Summoning, weather manipulation, and other magical activities strictly forbidden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catalina Baylor is looking forward to wearing her maid of honor dress and watching her older sister walk down the aisle. Then the wedding planner gets escorted off the premises, the bride’s priceless tiara disappears, and Rogan's extensive family overruns his mother’s home. Someone is cheating, someone is lying, and someone is plotting murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this wedding happen, Catalina will have to do the thing she fears most: use her magic. But she’s a Baylor and there’s nothing she wouldn't do for her sister's happiness. Nevada will have her fairy tale wedding, even if Catalina has to tear the mansion apart brick by brick to get it done.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; • &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The haunting true story of the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California during the 70s and 80s, and of the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case—which was solved in April 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Introduction by Gillian Flynn •&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; Afterword by Patton Oswalt&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.&lt;p&gt;Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called "the Golden State Killer." Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll Be Gone in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Utterly original and compelling, it has been hailed as a modern true crime classic—one which fulfilled Michelle's dream: helping unmask the Golden State Killer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Rocket science is no problem. Falling in love, on the other hand…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;College student Melody Gage is craving a night of no-strings fun when she meets charming out-of-towner Jeremy, and that’s exactly what she gets. Until three years later, when Melody relocates to Los Angeles and finds herself thrust back into Jeremy’s orbit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does her hunky one-night stand work at the same aerospace company where she’s just started her dream job, he’s the CEO’s son. Jeremy’s got a girlfriend and a reputation as a bad boy, so Melody resolves to keep her distance. Despite her good intentions, a series of awkward circumstances—including an embarrassing crying jag, a latte vs. computer catastrophe, and an emergency fake date—throw her together with the heavenly-smelling paragon of hotness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the billionaire playboy and nerdy IT girl forge an unlikely friendship, Melody’s attraction to Jeremy grows deeper than she’s ready to admit. Will she risk it all for a shot at her happy ending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The debut novel from author Susannah Nix, &lt;i&gt;Remedial Rocket Science&lt;/i&gt; follows in the tradition of contemporary romantic comedy favorites like Penny Reid, Sally Thorne, and Jennifer Crusie. This lighthearted slow burn romance is the first in a series of standalone rom-coms featuring geeky heroines who work in STEM fields.&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>After a difficult few years, Tilly Adams is ready for life to start going right. Though she has a case of first-day nerves teaching art at the local community college, she knows it isn’t anything a few snuggles from her rescue puppy won’t cure. Until she sees Dylan Scott again, her one-time BFF and first love sitting in the front row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan knows he should’ve left well enough alone, but when he sees Tilly living her dream, he can’t help but make contact. Ten years ago, he left Wildstone and everything in it behind, including Tilly. He had his reasons, but now he wants her back in his life, anyway he can get her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Tilly agrees to design the logo for Dylan’s new helicopter touring company, it’s business only . . . until she finds herself falling into his arms once again. Can she possibly open her heart back up to the only man who’s ever broken it? But soon they’re both realizing the truth—love always deserves a second chance.</description>

  <description>Guilty of an indiscretion? Time to marry a werewolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEREWOLVES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monsters left Faith ruined in the eyes of society, so now they’re her only option. Rejected by her family, Faith crosses the Atlantic, looking for a marriage of convenience and revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things are done differently in London. Werewolves are civilized. At least they pretend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMERICANS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backward heathens with no culture, Major Channing has never had time for any of them. But there’s something special about Faith. Channing finds himself fighting to prove himself and defend his species. But this werewolf has good reason not to trust human women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if they learn to love, can either of them forgive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the Parasol Protectorate series comes a stand alone romance set in the same universe. Look out for appearances from favorite characters and the serious consequences of unwarranted geology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Note On Chronology&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Claw &amp;amp; Courtship novellas can be read in any order. This book can be enjoyed without having read any of Gail’s other works. Set in the spring of 1895 this story occurs after events chronicled in Romancing the Werewolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More? &lt;br /&gt;This story is contemporaneous with events at the beginning of Reticence (final Custard Protocol book). Channing is first introduced to readers in the second Parasol Protectorate book, Changeless. He also appears briefly in Romancing the Inventor.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;No one is more surprised than Lord North when he returns from war to find his ex-fiancee in his ancestral home...working as a governess...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handsome, rakish heir to a dukedom, Lord Roland Northbridge Wilde—known to his friends as North—left England two years ago, after being jilted by Miss Diana Belgrave. He returns from war to find that he’s notorious: polite society has ruled him “too wild to wed.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana never meant to tarnish North’s reputation, or his heart, but in her rush to save a helpless child, there was no time to consider the consequences of working as a governess in Lindow Castle. Now everyone has drawn the worst conclusions about the child’s father, and Diana is left with bittersweet regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When North makes it clear that he still wants her for his own, scandal or no, Diana has to fight to keep from losing her heart to the man whom she still has no intention of marrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet North is returning a hardened warrior—and this is one battle he’s determined to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants Diana, and he’ll risk everything to call her his own.</description>

  <description>Mila Flores and her best friend Riley have always been inseparable. There's not much excitement in their small town of Cross Creek, so Mila and Riley make their own fun, devoting most of their time to Riley's favorite activity: amateur witchcraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Riley and two Fairmont Academy mean girls die under suspicious circumstances, Mila refuses to believe everyone's explanation that her BFF was involved in a suicide pact. Instead, armed with a tube of lip gloss and an ancient grimoire, Mila does the unthinkable to uncover the truth: she brings the girls back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Riley, June, and Dayton have no recollection of their murders, but they do have unfinished business to attend to. Now, with only seven days until the spell wears off and the girls return to their graves, Mila must wrangle the distracted group of undead teens and work fast to discover their murderer...before the killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New York’s Finest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogging as *The Socialmedialite*&lt;br /&gt;April 22&lt;br /&gt;LADIES AND GENTS! I have an announcement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that guy I featured on my blog a few months ago? The really, really hot Irish rugby player who plays the position of ‘hooker’ in the RLI (Rugby League International)? The one with the anger management issues, the body of a gladiator and the face of a movie star? The one with the questionable fashion choices leading me to ask whether he was the lovechild of a leprechaun and a hobbit? Ronan Fitzpatrick? Yeah, that guy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have a confession to make…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HERMIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annie Catrel, social media expert extraordinaire at Davidson &amp;amp; Croft Media and clandestine celebrity blogger, can make anyone shine in the court of public opinion. She is the Socialmedialite, anonymous creator of New York’s Finest and the internet’s darling. Virtual reality is Annie’s forte, but actual reality? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HOOKER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronan Fitzpatrick, aka the best hooker the world of rugby has seen in decades, despises the media—social or otherwise. The press has spun a web of lies depicting him as rugby’s wild and reckless bad boy. Suspended from his team, Ronan has come to Manhattan to escape the drama, lay low, fly under the radar. Only, Ronan isn’t easy to overlook, and he can’t escape the notice of the Socialmedialite…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PLAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Ronan is sent to Davidson &amp;amp; Croft Media to reshape his public image, he never expects to cross paths with shy but beautiful Annie, nor does he expect his fierce attraction to her. He couldn’t be happier when her boss suggests pairing them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lengths will Annie take to keep her virtual identity concealed? And what happens when the hooker discovers who the hermit really is?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Set in New York City’s Gilded Age, Joanna Shupe’s Avon debut introduces an English beauty with a wicked scheme to win the man she loves—and the American scoundrel who ruins her best laid plans…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Honora Parker must get engaged as soon as possible, and only a particular type of man will do. Nora seeks a mate so abhorrent, so completely unacceptable, that her father will reject the match—leaving her free to marry the artist she desires. Who then is the most appalling man in Manhattan? The wealthy, devilishly handsome financier, Julius Hatcher, of course….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julius is intrigued by Nora’s ruse and decides to play along. But to Nora’s horror, Julius transforms himself into the perfect fiancé, charming the very people she hoped he would offend. It seems Julius has a secret plan all his own—one that will solve a dark mystery from his past, and perhaps turn him into the kind of man Nora could truly love.</description>

  <description>On the night of her high school graduation, Vale McKinley and her boyfriend Crawford are in a terrible car accident that leaves Crawford in a coma. They were supposed to spend the summer planning for college, for a bright future full of possibility. Together. Instead, Vale spends long days in the hospital, hoping Crawford will awaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slate Allen, a college friend of Vale's brother, has been visiting his dying uncle at the same hospital. When he and Vale meet, she can't deny the flutter of an illicit attraction. She tries to ignore her feelings, but she's not immune to Slate's charm. Slowly, they form a cautious friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Crawford wakes up . . . with no memory of Vale or their relationship. Heartbroken, Vale opts to leave for college and move on with her life. Except now, she's in Slate's territory, and their story is about to take a very strange turn.</description>

      <![CDATA[huh. The first 3/4 was veeery conventional new adult. The twist though made it much more interesting, but not enough to make me love it, because most of the book was so formulaic. Abbi Glines should have had the twist earlier in the book and spent a little more time fleshing out the post twistine...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47170476-happily-ever-ninja" rel="nofollow"&gt;B016YOCL02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a full length, 100k word novel, and is the 5th book in the Knitting in the City Series. All books in the series can be read as a standalone except book #1.5 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Fiona Archer… I would tell you what they are, but then I’d have to kill you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you that Fiona’s husband—the always irrepressible and often cantankerous Greg Archer—is desperately in love with his wife. He aches for her when they are apart, and is insatiable when they are together. Yet as the years pass, Greg has begun to suspect that Fiona is a ninja. A ninja mom. A ninja wife. A ninja friend. After fourteen years of marriage, Greg is trying not to panic. Because Fiona’s talent for blending in is starting to resemble fading away. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, when unexpected events mean Fiona must take center stage to keep her family safe, her response stuns everyone—Greg most of all. It seems like Greg’s wish has come true. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Except… not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When all is said and done, can Greg handle this new version of his wife? Will his irrepressible cantankerousness push her away? Or can the couple find a way forward without either being forced to step back into the shadows?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;He’s been a bad, bad rake—and it takes a governess to teach him a lesson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The accidental governess&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her livelihood slips through her fingers, Alexandra Mountbatten takes on an impossible post: transforming a pair of wild orphans into proper young ladies. However, the girls don’t need discipline. They need a loving home. Try telling that to their guardian, Chase Reynaud: duke’s heir in the streets and devil in the sheets. The ladies of London have tried—and failed—to make him settle down. Somehow, Alexandra must reach his heart . . . without risking her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The infamous rake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-respecting libertine, Chase lives by one rule: no attachments. When a stubborn little governess tries to reform him, he decides to give her an education—in pleasure. That should prove he can’t be tamed. But Alexandra is more than he bargained for: clever, perceptive, passionate. She refuses to see him as a lost cause. Soon the walls around Chase’s heart are crumbling . . . and he’s in danger of falling, hard.</description>

  <description>They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of Australia’s most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and that’s why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they’re always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s his game and his rules. He’s content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, she’s exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and language.</description>

  <description>Sir Richard Kenworthy has less than a month to find a bride. He knows he can't be too picky, but when he sees Iris Smythe-Smith hiding behind her cello at her family's infamous musicale, he thinks he might have struck gold. She's the type of girl you don't notice until the second—or third—look, but there's something about her, something simmering under the surface, and he knows she's the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iris Smythe–Smith is used to being underestimated. With her pale hair and quiet, sly wit she tends to blend into the background, and she likes it that way. So when Richard Kenworthy demands an introduction, she is suspicious. He flirts, he charms, he gives every impression of a man falling in love, but she can't quite believe it's all true. When his proposal of marriage turns into a compromising position that forces the issue, she can't help thinking that he's hiding something . . . even as her heart tells her to say yes.</description>

      <![CDATA[This has the type of melodramatic story I love. But I think Julia Quinn should have spent less time BEFORE he revealed his secret, because that part dragged a bit. Whereas I felt the reconciliation after the big reveal felt rushed from an emotional catharsis stance. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;BRING THE TECHNIQUES OF THE STAGE TO THE BOARDROOM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For more than a decade, Belle Linda Halpern and Kathy Lubar have applied the lessons and expertise they have learned as performing artists to the work of their company, The Ariel Group. Halpern and Lubar have helped tens of thousands of executives at major companies around the country and the globe, including General Electric, Mobil Oil, Capital One, and Deloitte. In &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt;, they make their time-tested strategies available to everyone, from high-profile CEOs to young professionals seeking promotion. Their practical, proven approach will enable you to develop the skills necessary to inspire confidence, command respect, build credibility, and motivate others. Halpern and Lubar teach you:&lt;br /&gt; * How to handle tough situations with heightened confidence and flexibility&lt;br /&gt; * How to build your relationships to enhance collaboration and business development&lt;br /&gt; * How to express yourself dramatically and motivate others&lt;br /&gt; * How to integrate your personal values into communication to inspire others and become a more effective leader&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Learning the skills of the true performance experts, readers will understand why &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt; is the key to dynamic and authentic leadership. BACKCOVER: As a leader, you are always in the spotlight. &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt; teaches how to be masterful under that bright light...connecting more profoundly to those you lead and to yourself. A thought-provoking and highly practical guide to realizing your leadership potential." &lt;br /&gt; Jay Conger&lt;br /&gt; Professor, London Business School&lt;br /&gt; Author, Building Leaders &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Based on years teaching senior executives at the Columbia Business School I can say that the ideas in this book are easy to apply and make a dramatic difference in leadership effectiveness. Infused with the magic of theater and illustrated with compelling stories, &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt; is a fantastic resource for executives and executive educators!" &lt;br /&gt; Professor Michael J. Fenlon, Associate Dean for Executive MBA Programs, Columbia Business School &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "In &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt;, Halpern and Lubar reveal what great leaders have always known: that the secret to having a commanding presence isn't about personal power, but about empowering others. Its inspiring stories will speak to anyone who interacts with others. It will be especially useful for experienced leaders who feel they aren't coming across as powerfully as they'd like." &lt;br /&gt; Kenneth H. Blanchard, Co-author of &lt;i&gt;The One Minute Manager&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Full Steam Ahead!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "The foundation of success in business (and in life) is the ability to authentically engage and connect with others. Using the profession of acting as the perfect metaphor, this book is a masterful guide for achieving true leadership success. I loved the mix of personal stories from clients and well-known actors and found &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt; to be a powerful teaching tool. This book isn't just for business leaders, it's for anyone who wants to bring more passion, empathy and presence to all their relationships. I highly recommend it!" &lt;br /&gt; Cheryl Richardson, author of &lt;i&gt;Take Time for Your Life&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Stand Up for Your Life&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "The ability to inspire and move others is difficult to define, yet impossible to ignore. &lt;i&gt;Leadership Presence&lt;/i&gt; unlocks the secrets of one of the most decisive and powerful aspects of human communication. If you want to better understand and develop leadership presence in yourself and others, read this book. Like its subject, this book is compelling and impossible to ignore.</description>

  <description>After ten years of flying freighter ships from planet to planet, Val Calendula never thought she would apply for a job as a combat pilot in a mercenary outfit. But her brother has gotten himself into financial trouble, and he’s heading to a mining prison if Val can’t pay off his debts. Mercenaries don’t always live long... but they make good money while they’re alive. A few combat bonuses, and Val could earn what she needs. The problem? She might have graduated from the military flight academy, but she hasn’t fought anything more dangerous than dust bunnies on the bridge lately. To make matters worse, the man in charge of hiring pilots was her instructor back at the academy. Commander Thatcher was almost as brilliant as he was arrogant and condescending, and he never seemed to think Val was smart enough to be there. She has no idea if she’ll be able to convince him otherwise now... or if she’ll be able to stand working with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gregor Thatcher left the military, he never expected to run into any of his former acquaintances, much less the one he admired and mooned over during his two years teaching at the academy. Back then, he never told Val Calendula he cared for her, partially because officers weren’t supposed to have relations with cadets, but mostly because he didn’t know how to speak of his feelings. He might not have any trouble grasping navigational mathematics and astrodynamics, but people are more problematic. Gregor is elated that Val has entered his life again, but he’s fairly certain she hates him. Worse, he’s responsible for deciding whether she’s qualified to be a combat pilot. How can he judge fairly when his tongue tangles and idiotic words come out of his mouth whenever she’s around? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the captain sends Val and Gregor on a mission to pick up a military advisor and deliver him to a planet at war, Val hopes she’ll have an opportunity to prove herself capable of the piloting position. Gregor hopes he’ll have the opportunity to improve Val’s opinion of him. But when the military advisor goes missing, and they’re forced to divert to a dangerous moon base, the mission turns into a fight for survival. Val may learn too late that there’s more to Gregor than that aloof exterior… and that inside is a man she could love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trial and Temptation is a full-length science fiction romance novel of 73,000 words. It is part of the “Mandrake Company” series and is recommended for readers who enjoy space-based adventure (such as Firefly) and steamy love stories (in the style of Linnea Sinclair).</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You’ve Got Tail&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Renee George is a laugh-out-loud cozy mystery. Kidnapping, murder, and a town full of people hiding the truth will keep Sunny Haddock busy as she tries to unravel the strange happenings in Peculiar, Missouri. Fall in love with a hilarious cast of characters in Book 1 of &lt;i&gt;Peculiar Mysteries&lt;/i&gt;; a paranormal romantic comedy that will not only have you laughing… it will also melt your heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Peculiar, Missouri!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunny Haddock, an animal-loving vegetarian psychic, is stoked to leave California behind to start a new life in the Ozark town of Peculiar with her best friend Chavvah Trimmel. She ups the moving date when Chav goes missing, and Sunny high tails it to the small town. What Sunny doesn’t realize is that she’s moving into a community of were-shifters, and they don’t want a human resident. Especially one dumb enough to arrive a couple of days before the full moon — the only night of the month shifters have to take their pure animal forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the gorgeous Babel Trimmel, Chav's younger brother, (along with the sheriff, the mayor, and some other nice folk) suggests Sunny haul her U-haul and butt back out of town, she’s undeterred. Her psychic abilities might be out-of-whack, and blood makes her faint, but she’s not a quitter. Besides, she's not about to go anywhere until she finds out what happened to Chavvah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Sunny has more to deal with than unfriendly townsfolk... like disturbing killer visions and the dog-like animal no one else sees that seems to be stalking her every move. To make matters worse, she is finding Babel to be more irresistible than crack on a donut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunny needs to get her ability and her hormones under control if she wants to solve the mystery and save her best friend.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, &amp;amp; USA TODAY bestselling series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna Diaz is everyone’s favorite “fat” funny lady. The movie studio executives can’t explain it, but her films are out-grossing all the fit and trim headliners and Hollywood’s most beautiful elite. The simple truth is, everyone loves plus-sized Sienna. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she has a problem, she can’t read maps and her sense of direction is almost as bad as her comedic timing is stellar. Therefore, when Sienna’s latest starring role takes her to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park she finds herself continually lost while trying to navigate the backroads of Green Valley, Tennessee. Much to her consternation, Sienna’s most frequent savior is a ridiculously handsome, charming, and cheeky Park Ranger by the name of Jethro Winston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna is accustomed to high levels of man-handsome, so it’s not Jethro’s chiseled features or his perfect physique that make Sienna stutter. It’s his southern charm. And gentlemanly manners. And habit of looking at her too long and too often. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sienna has successfully navigated the labyrinth of Hollywood heart-throbs. But can she traverse the tenuous trails of Tennessee without losing her head? Or worse, her heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s official Take a Psycho to Work Day. Why else would I be here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunted. Hated. Betrayed. Dagger Ixur is on the run for his life. As one of the most recognizable members of his royal house, he has a bounty on his head that guarantees him no quarter from any friend or even family. But surrender isn’t in him. He will fight to the bitter end. A resolve that is sorely tested when he narrowly escapes a trap that leaves him severely wounded. With what he believes is his dying breath, he saves a boy born to an extinct race from a group out to enslave the kid for his legendary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ushara Altaan has spent her entire life hating those born to nobility. After all, it was a royal house that drove her entire species into virtual extinction. As a rare Andarion Fyreblood, she is sworn to end the existence of any royal she finds. But when Dagger saves her son’s life, she is torn between her people and a debt that can never be repaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet worse than Dagger’s family that’s still out to end hers, are the League assassins after him who will stop at nothing to claim the lives of her Tavali family. The only hope she has to save them all is to put their future and her faith into the hands of the very enemy whose grandmother personally extinguished Ushara’s legendary lineage. But how can she ever trust Dagger when he is a disinherited outlaw whose very name is synonymous with betrayal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The old eddas speak of &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt;—fabled creatures who haunt the depths of Iceland's volcanoes and steal away fair maidens.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Freyja wants none of such myths. &lt;i&gt;Dreki&lt;/i&gt; seducing young ladies? Ha. They probably eat such foolish girls. But when the local &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt; steals her last ram—costing her any chance of feeding her ill father through the winter—Freyja intends to confront the fearsome myth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sentenced to a life of exile from his clan, Rurik is fascinated by the furious woman who comes to claim her ram. She reeks of mysterious magic and challenges him at every step. He intends to claim the passionate firebrand, but to do so he must take mortal form. It's the only time the &lt;i&gt;dreki&lt;/i&gt; are vulnerable, and with a dragon-hunter arriving on the shores of Iceland, he can barely afford the risk—but lonely Freyja, with her elf-cursed eyes and pragmatic soul, tempts him in ways he's never felt before. Is she the key to reclaiming his heritage? Or will she be his downfall? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't miss any of the Legends of the Storm books!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Heart of fire &lt;br /&gt;2. Storm of Desire (coming 2018) &lt;br /&gt;3.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Who Writes Cinderella Stories Better than Eloisa James?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Eloisa James fan should miss these enchanting short stories!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer Night's Disgrace&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​Eloisa revisits the ​scintillating world of the Essex Sisters with a story featuring a young lady, Cecilia Bellingworth, who has decided she would rather ruin her reputation than endure further speculation about whether her children will be "silly," like her brother, Billy.​ ​After two failed seasons, ​Cecilia ​decides she ​will dress as she likes​ (in a scandalous red dress!)​ and flirt outrageously​ (with a scandalous pianist!)​. Fortunately, a gorgeous musician at the Duchess of Ormond's house party presents the perfect candidate for scandal…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​Previously published in the &lt;i&gt;Essex Sisters Official Companion Guide&lt;/i&gt; (e only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;At Midnight&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;​Elias Hempleworth-Gray has one thing and one thing only of value—his title, Earl of Leyton. Determined to leave England and the scandal of his gambler father behind, Elias hopes to turn his fortunes around and come back a respectable man to claim the only woman for him, Miss Penelope White. But Penny has other plans for the man she has loved all her life…plans that include a masquerade, a stolen kiss and a lost shoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published in the Fairy Tale sampler (print only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Ever After&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she was sixteen, Miss Violet Leighton spent one blissful month romping around her family estate with Rothwell Talcott…thirty days of shared kisses, culminating in a very illicit afternoon in a berry patch. As Rothwell leaves for his grand tour, he gives his word of honor that he will return for her. Four years and seven refused proposals later, Violet is about to give up and marry when he finally returns. Now the Duke of Cambridge, Rothwell wants to make her his duchess. But how can Violet trust the man who stole her virtue—and then broke her heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously published in &lt;i&gt;The Ugly Duchess&lt;/i&gt; (print only).</description>

  <description>If someone were to ask Jasmine Santos to describe the last few years of her life with a single word, it would definitely be a four-letter one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seventeen years—and countless broken bones and broken promises—she knows her window to compete in figure skating is coming to a close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the offer of a lifetime comes in from an arrogant idiot she’s spent the last decade dreaming about pushing in the way of a moving bus, Jasmine might have to reconsider everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including Ivan Lukov.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Penelope Ward, comes a new, sexy standalone novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up, the three of us were friends.&lt;br /&gt;He was the nerd.&lt;br /&gt;I was the playboy.&lt;br /&gt;She was the beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep down, I only ever wanted her. I kept it inside because Rory and I made a pact that our friend, Amber, was off-limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went off to college, and he got the girl.&lt;br /&gt;Amber never knew how I felt.&lt;br /&gt;They were together for years—before he broke her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through it all and across the miles, she and I casually stayed in touch.&lt;br /&gt;When my job sent me to Boston for a three-month contract position, Amber let me stay in her spare room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still reeling from her breakup, she’d sworn off men.&lt;br /&gt;One night, I opened her computer to find the shock of my life. She’d hesitantly contacted a male escort company. Afraid to date and get her heart broken again, she was looking for sex with no strings.&lt;br /&gt;Every emotion imaginable ran through me: protectiveness, jealousy—curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;Amber had chosen Gentleman Number Nine and sent him a message.&lt;br /&gt;She opened up to him, confessing, among other things, her physical attraction to her friend—me. But she considered me off-limits—and she thought I was a manwhore. (Ironic, considering the circumstances.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, she set up a date to meet Gentleman Nine at a hotel. &lt;br /&gt;When she showed up several nights later to meet him, she was stunned to see me standing there—with an offer I hoped she wouldn’t refuse.</description>

  <description>One night. No one will know. &lt;p&gt;That was the deal. Every year, Livvy Kane and Nicholas Chandler would share one perfect night of illicit pleasure. The forbidden hours let them forget the tragedy that haunted their pasts—and the last names that made them enemies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the night she didn’t show up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Nicholas has an empire to run. He doesn’t have time for distractions and Livvy’s sudden reappearance in town is a major distraction. She’s the one woman he shouldn’t want . . . so why can’t he forget how right she feels in his bed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livvy didn’t come home for Nicholas, but fate seems determined to remind her of his presence—and their past. Although the passion between them might have once run hot and deep, not even love can overcome the scandal that divided their families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being together might be against all the rules . . . but being apart is impossible. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>London weather is chilly—and the social scene even more so.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, Bridget Forrester is just getting warmed up…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridget longs to meet a gentleman who doesn’t mention her beautiful sister upon shaking her hand. But since being branded a shrew after a disastrous social season, Bridget knows she’s lucky to even have a man come near her. It’s enough to make a lady flee the country…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Bridget heads to Venice for music lessons with the renowned Italian composer Vincenzo Carpenini, with whom she’s been corresponding. But not only is Carpenini not expecting her, he doesn’t even remember her! His friend, theater owner Oliver Merrick, does, though. And one look into her tantalizing green eyes has him cursing his impulsive letter-writing, which brought her across the continent. Yet before Merrick can apologize, Carpenini has ordered her away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little does either man know that they will soon be embroiled in a wager that will require the beautiful Miss Forrester’s help—or that there’ll be far more at stake in this gamble than money…</description>

      <![CDATA[This started out reeaaaaaaalllllly slow to me. Though I did like the premise that this was a Regency Romance that doesn't take place in England which is really nice, but I did not like Carpenini. And Kate Noble rather sneakily slow rolls the development of the Oliver character, but once he kind o...]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35838294-beauty-and-the-mustache" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00MRQJ5M4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length novel, can be read as a standalone, and is the fourth book in the 'Knitting in the City' series. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Ashley Winston: 1) She has six brothers and they all have beards, 2) She is a reader, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Former beauty queen, Ashley Winston’s preferred coping strategy is escapism. She escaped her Tennessee small town, loathsome father, and six brothers eight years ago. Now she escapes life daily via her Amazon kindle one-click addiction. However, when a family tragedy forces her to return home, Ashley can’t escape the notice of Drew Runous— local Game Warden, bear wrestler, philosopher, and everyone’s favorite guy. Drew’s irksome philosophizing in particular makes Ashley want to run for the skyscrapers, especially since he can’t seem to keep his exasperating opinions— or his soulful poetry, steadfast support, and delightful hands— to himself. Pretty soon the girl who wanted nothing more than the escape of the big city finds she’s lost her heart in small town Tennessee.</description>

  <description>To the ranks of great sleuths of ages past, add a new candidate - Julian Kestrel - a detective as historically authentic as Brother Cadfael and as dashing as Lord Peter Wimsey. Kestrel is the reigning dandy of London in the 1820s, famous for his elegant clothes and his unflappable sangfroid. One night he rescues a young aristocrat named Hugh Fontclair from a gambling house, and in gratitude Hugh invites him to be best man at his wedding. But when Kestrel goes to stay with the Fontclairs at their sumptuous country house, he is caught in the crossfire of the bride's and groom's warring families. Soon, discord erupts into murder. In a world without fingerprinting, chemical analysis, or even police, murder poses a baffling challenge. Undaunted, Kestrel sets out to solve the crime. With the help of his Cockney manservant, Dipper a (mostly) reformed pickpocket, Kestrel delves beneath the Fontclairs' respectable surface. What he finds is a trail of crime, deception, and forbidden lust that leads him at last to the killer. The combination of a new author, a charming new sleuth, and a strikingly original setting adds up to a smashing mystery that moves with force and intelligence - and expert suspense - from beginning to end.</description>

  <description>Years ago, family loyalty caused Fain Hauk to give up everything he loved: His military career. His planet. His fiancée. Even his name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now decades later, everything has changed. He’s built a new life out of the ashes of his old, and he’s vowed to never let anything threaten his loved ones again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when old enemies align themselves with new ones, he’s caught in the middle of a brutal war. And when fate throws his former fiancée back into his world and she has her own agenda that includes taking his head for what he did to her years ago, more than just his life is at stake. The fate of the Ichidian universe and that of his brothers-in-arms hangs in the balance. Winner take all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s killed or be killed, and never has the battle been more fierce...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or more fun. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Born an Outcast, Talyn Batur has spent the whole of his life fighting against the prejudice of his people. An Andarion without a father is not something anyone wants to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when his companion's brother draws him into a plot against the Andarion crown, he finds himself torn between the loyalty to their planetary government that his mother has beaten into him and his own beliefs of justice and right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he must decide for himself to remain a pawn of their government or to defy everything and everyone he's ever known to stand up to tyranny. It's a gamble that will either save his life or end it. And when old enemies align with new ones, it's more than just his own life at risk. And more than just his homeworld that will end should he fail, in &lt;i&gt;Born of Defiance&lt;/i&gt;, the next League novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Jo Goodman delivers the unforgettable story of a beautiful young woman who believes someone wants to kill her. Only one man can reveal if she's truly in peril—or if she's going mad. But will his forbidden kiss lead to a dangerous seduction?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shy by nature, Emma Hathaway usually leaves the drama to her rebellious cousin, Marisol. But when Emma agrees to meet with her cousin's secret lover to end the affair, she is pulled into a dangerous game. Now Emma is convinced her involvement in the scandal has put her life in jeopardy. The trouble is none of Emma's confidantes believe anyone is trying to harm her. As whispers of madness begin, Emma turns to the only person who might be able to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very handsome, barely respectable Restell Gardner has gained a reputation for helping people out of compromising positions. Never one to turn away a lady in need, Restell agrees to help solve the intrigue. Sensing there is more to the green-eyed beauty than meets the eye, Restell feels himself falling for Emma. But he resists succumbing to his passion...at least until he learns the truth about the danger that is haunting her. For if he gives in to temptation too soon, he could lose Emma forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Lady Sophia Barnes doesn’t take no for an answer. Especially when she’s roaming London’s seedy underground…dressed as a man.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A rabble rouser for justice, Sophie’s latest mission is to fight for the rights of the poor, the wretched—and the employees at Madame Hartley’s brothel. She’s not concerned about the criminals who will cross her path, for Sophie has mastered the art of deception—including the art of wearing trousers. Now her fate is in her own hands, along with a loaded gun. All she needs is instruction on how to shoot it. But only one person can help her: Lord Quint, the man who broke her heart years ago. The man she won’t let destroy her again…&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The last thing Damien Beecham, Viscount Quint, needs is an intrusion on his privacy, especially from the beautiful, exasperating woman he’s never stopped wanting. A woman with a perilously absurd request, no less. For Damien is fighting a battle of his own, one he wishes to keep hidden—along with his feelings for Lady Sophia. Yet that fight is as hopeless as stopping her outlandish plan. Soon all Quint knows for certain is that he will die trying to protect her…</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Love isn’t always NEAT…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bartender and all round bad boy, Eric Collins, has come to a crossroads. It’s time to take life seriously and maybe even attempt to settle down. If only the person he was hoping to settle down with didn’t turn out to be pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting over in a small town, Jean is determined to turn her wild lifestyle around and be the kind of mother she always wished she’d had. Since local bar owner and all round hottie, Eric, is now determined to steer clear of her pregnant self, it should be easy. When she goes into labor during a snowstorm and her car slides on some ice, however, it’s Eric who comes to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a bond between them now, but is it enough? And can Eric give up his manwhore ways to be the man Jean needs?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The pleasure of your company is requested at Warbury Park. Four lovely ladies will arrive… but only one can become a duchess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James, the scandalously uncivilized Duke of Harland, requires a bride with a spotless reputation for a strictly business arrangement. Lust is prohibited and love is out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four ladies. Three days. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;She is not like the others…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlene Beckett, the unacknowledged daughter of an earl and a courtesan, has just been offered a life-altering fortune to pose as her half-sister, Lady Dorothea, and win the duke’s proposal. All she must do is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Be the perfect English rose [Ha!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Breathe, smile, and curtsy in impossibly tight gowns [blast Lady Dorothea’s sylph-like figure]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Charm and seduce a wild duke [without appearing to try]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Keep said duke far, far from her heart [no matter how tempting]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When secrets are revealed and passion overwhelms, James must decide if the last lady he should want is really everything he needs. And Charlene must decide if the promise of a new life is worth risking everything . . . including her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A LESSON IN SEDUCTION . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miranda Hodgkins has only ever wanted one thing: to marry Robert Carlisle. And she simply can't wait a moment longer. During the Carlisle family masquerade ball, Miranda boldly sneaks into his bedchamber with seduction on her mind. Soon she's swept into rock-hard arms for the most breathtaking kiss of her life. But when the masks come off, she's horrified to find herself face-to-face with Sebastian, the Duke of Trent—Robert's formidable older brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shocked to find Miranda in his bed, Sebastian quickly offers her a deal to avoid scandal: He'll help her win his brother's heart if she'll find him the perfect wife. But what begins as a simple negotiation soon spirals out of control. For the longer this reformed rake tries to make a match for Miranda, the more he wants to keep her all to himself.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Where Secrets Smolder...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm. Cool. Collected. Gisele Whitby has perfected the art of illusion—her survival, after all, has depended upon it. Years ago, to escape an abusive husband, Gisele "disappeared." Now she must risk revealing her new identity to save another innocent girl from the same fate. But she needs a daring man for her scheme, and the rogue in question shows a remarkable talent . . . for shattering Gisele's carefully constructed façade and igniting her deepest desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;...Passion Ignites.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't the first time Jamie Montcrief has awakened naked and confused from a night of drinking. It is, however, the first time a stunningly beautiful woman offers him &lt;i&gt;payment&lt;/i&gt; afterward. Gisele has a business proposition for him, a mission involving cunning thievery and a brazen rescue. How can he say no to a plot this dangerous . . . and a woman this delectable?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Maggie, Lady Hawkins, had a debut she’d rather forget—along with her first marriage. Today, the political cartoonist is a new woman. A thoroughly modern woman. So much so that her clamoring public believes she’s a man…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FACT:&lt;/b&gt; Drawing under a male pseudonym, Maggie is known as Lemarc. Her (his!) favorite object of ridicule: Simon Barrett, Earl of Winchester. He’s a rising star in Parliament—and a former confidant and love interest of Maggie’s who believed a rumor that vexes her to this day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FICTION:&lt;/b&gt; Maggie is the Half-Irish Harlot who seduced her best friend’s husband on the eve of their wedding. She is to be feared and loathed, as she will lift her skirts for anything in breeches.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Still crushed by Simon’s betrayal, Maggie has no intention of letting the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; crush her as well. In fact, Lemarc’s cartoons have made Simon a laughingstock…but now it appears that Maggie may have been wrong about what happened years ago, and that Simon has been secretly yearning for her since…forever. Could it be that the heart is mightier than the pen and the sword after all?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Le Carré meets &lt;i&gt;Cabaret&lt;/i&gt; in this debut spy thriller as a gay double-agent schemes to protect his smuggler lover during the rise of a fascist government coup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Amberlough City, the illustrious but corrupt cosmopolitan beacon of Gedda. The radical One State Party—nicknamed the Ospies—is gaining popular support to unite Gedda's four municipal governments under an ironclad, socially conservative vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone agrees with the Ospies' philosophy, including master spy Cyril DePaul and his lover Aristide Makricosta, smuggler and emcee at the popular Bumble Bee Cabaret. When Cyril's cover is blown on a mission, however, he must become a turncoat in exchange for his life. Returning to Amberlough under the Ospies' watchful eye, Cyril enters a complex game of deception. One of his concerns is safeguarding Aristide, who refuses to let anyone—the crooked city police or the homophobic Ospies—dictate his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter streetwise Cordelia Lehane, top dancer at the Bee and Aristide’s runner, who could be the key to Cyril’s plans—if she can be trusted. As the twinkling lights of nightclub marquees yield to the rising flames of a fascist revolution, these three will struggle to survive using whatever means—and people—necessary. Including each other.</description>

  <description>Mystery novelist Harriet Vane knew all about poisons, and when her fiancé died in the manner prescribed in one of her books, a jury of her peers had a hangman's noose in mind. But Lord Peter Wimsey was determined to find her innocent—as determined as he was to make her his wife.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47171748-love-hacked" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00IS98B24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Sandra Fielding: 1) She makes all her first dates cry, 2) She hasn't been kissed in over two years, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sandra has difficulty removing her psychotherapist hat. Of her last 30 dates, 29 have ended the same way: the man sobbing uncontrollably. After one such disaster, Sandra--near desperation and maybe a little tipsy--gives in to a seemingly harmless encounter with her hot waiter, Alex. Argumentative, secretive, and hostile Alex may be the opposite of everything Sandra knows is right for her. But now, the girl who has spent all her life helping others change for the better, must find a way to cope with falling for someone who refuses to change at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a full-length, 110k word novel and is the third book in the Knitting in the City series. All books in the series can be read as a standalone.</description>

  <description>He was someone who belonged in my wildest fantasies instead of a rest stop in the middle of Nebraska.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sexy, cocky, Australian named Chance was the last person I expected to run into on my cross-country drive.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my car broke down, we made a deal. Next thing I knew, we were traveling together, spending sexually-tense nights in hotels and taking unplanned detours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ordinary road trip turned into the adventure of a lifetime. It was all fun and games until things got intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted him, but Chance wouldn’t make a move. I thought he wanted me too, but something was holding him back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn’t supposed to fall for the cocky bastard, especially when I knew we’d be going our separate ways.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All good things must come to an end, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Except our ending was one I didn’t see coming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author's note - Cocky Bastard is a full-length standalone novel. Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;When love drives you crazy . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When sexy Joe Malone never calls after their explosive kiss, Kylie shoves him out of her mind. Until she needs a favor, and it’s a doozy. Something precious to her has been stolen and there’s only one person with unique finder-and-fixer skills that can help—Joe. It means swallowing her pride and somehow trying to avoid the temptation to throttle him—or seduce him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;the best thing to do . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, Joe didn’t call after the kiss. He’s the fun time guy, not the forever guy. And Kylie, after all she’s been through, deserves a good man who will stay. But everything about Kylie makes it damned hard to focus, and though his brain knows what he has to do, his heart isn’t getting the memo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;… is enjoy the ride.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Kylie and Joe go on the scavenger hunt of their lives, they discover surprising things about each other. Now, the best way for them to get over “that kiss” might just be to replace it with a hundred more.</description>

  <description>Carl and Marianne were high school sweethearts, loving the way only teenagers can—with no thought to logic or pride, just a bone-headed, optimistic frenzy of unicorns and hormones. That was all they needed. Or so Carl thought.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scared of being stuck in Lake Sackett, Georgia, like so many of her friends—without a real shot at a future or achieving her own dreams—Marianne panicked and bolted to college after stomping Carl’s heart into the high grass. But when she returns to Lake Sackett for the summer with her family after years away, she and Carl are drawn together like moths to a flame. As they rekindle their old romance and remember what it was like to be in love, they have to wonder: is this, finally, their real chance at happiness?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perfect for fans of Kristan Higgins and Amy E. Reichert, this warmhearted and witty love story introduces Molly Harper’s new Southern Eclectic series set in the small town of Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 3 hrs and 32 mins</description>

  <description>An Atlanta ex-cop comes to sleepy Lake Sackett, Georgia, seeking peace and quiet—but he hasn’t bargained on falling for Frankie, the cutest coroner he’s ever met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie McCready talks to dead people. Not like a ghost whisperer or anything—but it seems rude to embalm them and not at least say hello.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, at the McCready Family Funeral Home &amp;amp; Bait Shop, Frankie’s eccentricities fit right in. Lake Sackett’s embalmer and county coroner, Frankie’s goth styling and passion for nerd culture mean she’s not your typical Southern girl, but the McCreadys are hardly your typical Southern family. Led by Great-Aunt Tootie, the gambling, boozing, dog-collecting matriarch of the family, everyone looks out for one another—which usually means getting up in everyone else’s business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe that’s why Frankie is so fascinated by new sheriff Eric Linden...a recent transplant from Atlanta, he sees a homicide in every hunting accident or boat crash, which seems a little paranoid for this sleepy tourist town. What’s he so worried about? And what kind of cop can get a job with the Atlanta PD but can’t stand to look at a dead body?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Frankie has other questions that need answering first—namely, who’s behind the recent break-in attempts at the funeral home, and how can she stop them? This one really does seem like a job for the sheriff—and as Frankie and Eric do their best Scooby-Doo impressions to catch their man, they get closer to spilling some secrets they thought were buried forever.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Ain’t She a Peach&lt;/i&gt;, Molly Harper proves once again that she “never lets the reader down with her delightfully entertaining stories” (&lt;i&gt;Single Titles&lt;/i&gt;).</description>

  <description>From beloved romance author Molly Harper (&lt;i&gt;Half-Moon Hollow&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Nice Girls&lt;/i&gt; series) comes the first title in her new rom-com women’s fiction series, Southern Eclectic, which features the lives, losses and loves of the McCready family as they manage their family’s generational funeral home and bait shop (you read that correctly) on the shore of picturesque Lake Sackett, Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type-A Margot Cary is the leading event planner for the crème de la crème of Chicago high society. No request is too extravagant for her to execute with trademark perfection. That is, until an unfortunate incident involving a shrimp tower, live flamingos, and a shellfish allergy puts her on the black list of the rich and social and out of a job. With the lights about to be shut off in the trendy condo she can no longer afford, and her savings account dwindling, Margot’s situation is near to desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In steps her birth father’s side of the family (who she’s never met), the McCreadys…the McCreadys of the McCready Family Funeral Home and Bait Shop in small town Georgia—and as luck would have it, they’re looking for an event planner and don’t care about her reputation among the A-list crowd. As Margot tackles small town life—where everyone knows everything about everyone—and builds a relationship with a father who she’d never known, she discovers the comforts that community, a rather large extended family, and a rugged, unpretentious country man can offer...&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back in the final installment of Darynda Jones’ New York Times bestselling paranormal series!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charley Davidson, Grim Reaper extraordinaire, is pissed. She’s been kicked off the earthly plain for eternity – which is the appropriate amount of time to make a person starkraving mad. But someone’s looking out for her, and she’s allowed to return after a mere hundred years in exile. Is it too much to hope for that not much has changed? Apparently it is. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s missed Reyes and her daughter, Beep, but now that she’s back on earth, it’s time to put to rest burning questions that need answers. What happened to her mother? How did she really die? Who killed her? And are cupcakes or coffee the best medicine? It all comes to a head in an epic showdown between good and evil in this final smart and hilarious novel.</description>

      <![CDATA[Hmmm, I love this series. This book wasn't, I felt, the strongest standalone book in the series. I don't mind how they wrapped everything up, it was more that I felt the Earth Threatening Threat in this one was somehow not climactic enough for the Final Bad Guys. Perhaps that's because we need to...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;As the Civil War rages between the states, a courageous pair of spies plunge fearlessly into a maelstrom of ignorance, deceit, and danger, combining their unique skills to alter the course of history and break the chains of the past . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle Burns is a former slave with a passion for justice and an eidetic memory. Trading in her life of freedom in Massachusetts, she returns to the indignity of slavery in the South—to spy for the Union Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm McCall is a detective for Pinkerton's Secret Service. Subterfuge is his calling, but he’s facing his deadliest mission yet—risking his life to infiltrate a Rebel enclave in Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two undercover agents who share a common cause—and an undeniable attraction—Malcolm and Elle join forces when they discover a plot that could turn the tide of the war in the Confederacy's favor. Caught in a tightening web of wartime intrigue, and fighting a fiery and forbidden love, Malcolm and Elle must make their boldest move to preserve the Union at any cost—even if it means losing each other . . .</description>

  <description>The day I met Bishop Callehurst he was standing half-naked in the massive kitchen of his over the top Hollywood mansion, drinking a glass of water and letting it drip all over his impossibly solid body.&lt;br /&gt;I didn't know he was royalty. I was too distracted by his hungry stare... and how he kept smirking every time he stole a peek down my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this prince needs a baby, and fast. &lt;br /&gt;He swears it's about keeping access to his money. Love or romance? They don't factor in. &lt;br /&gt;But if that's true, why doesn't he pick one of the hundreds of gorgeous women his mom parades in front of him to be his baby-mamma? Why me? I'm not special—I can barely walk his two Pomeranians without falling over.&lt;br /&gt;His royal sexiness has plans for me. Dirty, wild plans that can only happen between the sheets. There's a million reasons not to go along with what he wants, but with him kissing my thighs and holding me close...&lt;br /&gt;I've forgotten all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is a re-release of the Dog Walker &amp;amp; the Prince (a limited time story that was in the Royally Mine Anthology) with a brand new epilogue!</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47172251-neanderthal-marries-human" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00L02RW2G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is not a standalone. It is the sequel to ‘Neanderthal Seeks Human,’ it is book #1.5 in the ‘Knitting in the City’ series, and it is a full length, 105k word novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you should know about Quinn Sullivan: 1) He is madly in love with Janie Morris, 2) He’s not above playing dirty to get what (or who) he wants, and 3) He doesn’t know how to knit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just five months of dating Janie, Quinn—former Wendell and unapologetic autocrat—is ready to propose marriage. In fact, he’s more than ready. If it were up to Quinn, he would efficiently propose, marry, and beget Janie with child all in the same day—thereby avoiding the drama and angst that accompanies the four stages of pre-matrimony: engagement, meeting the parents, bachelor/bachelorette party, and overblown, superfluous wedding day traditions. But Janie, much to Quinn’s dismay, tosses a wrench in his efficacious endeavors and challenges him to prove his devotion by going through the matrimonial motions, no matter how minute and mundane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Quinn last until the wedding day? Or will he yield to his tyrant impulses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, one thing is for certain, Quinn Sullivan will have to learn to expect the Spanish Inquisition (i.e. the unexpected) if he plans to have and keep Janie Morris as his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, you must read ‘Neanderthal Seeks Human’ first before reading this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is written in first person, alternating POV (Janie Morris AND Quinn Sullivan; but more Janie than Quinn)</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From subway to Broadway to happily ever after. Modern love in all its thrill, hilarity, and uncertainty has never been so compulsively readable as in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 international bestselling author Christina Lauren’s (&lt;i&gt;Beautiful Bastard, Dating You / Hating You&lt;/i&gt;) new romance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marriages of convenience are so…&lt;i&gt;inconvenient. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rescued by Calvin McLoughlin from a would-be subway attacker, Holland Bakker pays the brilliant musician back by pulling some of her errand-girl strings and getting him an audition with a bigtime musical director. When the tryout goes better than even Holland could have imagined, Calvin is set for a great entry into Broadway—until he admits his student visa has expired and he’s in the country illegally.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Holland impulsively offers to wed the Irishman to keep him in New York, her growing infatuation a secret only to him. As their relationship evolves from awkward roommates to besotted lovers, Calvin becomes the darling of Broadway. In the middle of the theatrics and the acting-not-acting, what will it take for Holland and Calvin to realize that they both stopped pretending a long time ago?</description>

  <description>In her newest work, the stunning beginning to an epic hardcover trilogy, #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts weaves an enthralling saga of suspense, survival, and the journey that will unite a desperate group of people to fight the battle of their lives…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sickness came on suddenly, and spread quickly. The fear spread even faster. Within weeks, everything people counted on began to fail them. The electrical grid sputtered; law and government collapsed—and more than half of the world’s population was decimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as the power of science and technology receded, magic rose up in its place. Some of it is good, like the witchcraft worked by Lana Bingham, practicing in the loft apartment she share with her lover, Max. Some of it is unimaginably evil, and it can lurk anywhere, around a corner, in fetid tunnels beneath the river—or in the ones you know and love the most. As word spreads that neither the immune nor the gifted are safe from the authorities who patrol the ravaged streets, Lana and Max make their way out of a wrecked New York City. At the same time, other travelers are heading west too, into a new frontier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world of survivors where every stranger encountered could be either a savage or a savior, none of them knows exactly where they are heading, or why. But a purpose awaits them that will shape their lives and the lives of all those who remain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end has come. The beginning comes next.</description>

  <description>Gambled away by her brother, Freya is now bound to the music world's resident bad boy Liam Henderson as his live-in maid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freya Coleman is a struggling artist who can hardly get by. With a past she would rather not revisit and a future that didn't extend past her next cup of coffee, something had to change. Freya just didn't know how much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liam Henderson lives in the spotlight. His wild nights and latest conquests make every woman want him, and every man want to be him. The rockstar has a carefully constructed persona to keep everyone out. That is, until a drunken night gets out of hand and he finds himself with the winning hand in a poker game, and the prize is a feisty redhead. A prize who just might break down the walls he has been so desperately hiding behind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together, these two are a disaster waiting to happen. A disaster the world is eager to watch and comment on until their fingers drop off. What starts off as a fake relationship to improve Liam’s image, blossoms into so much more, and Freya is swept up into the world of bright lights and illusions. Everyone has an opinion when the lights are shining on their beloved rock god Liam Henderson, and they are eagerly waiting to tear down anyone who is bathed in the famous glow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can happily ever after exist when the whole world is watching?</description>

      <![CDATA[The first quarter of this book was actually pretty interesting, in that guilty pleasure crack way, but then it just drags on soooo long and it's such a destructive relationship and no one is enjoying it AT ALL. I can't believe I just read an 800-page contemporary romance. ]]>

  <description>Werewolf in trouble... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Biffy, newly minted Alpha of the London Pack, is not having a good Christmas. His Beta abandoned him, his werewolves object to his curtain choices, and someone keeps leaving babies on his doorstep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Professor Randolph Lyall returns home to London after twenty years abroad, afraid of what he might find. With his pack in chaos and his Alpha in crisis, it will take all his Beta efficiency to set everything to rights. Perhaps, in the process, he may even determine how to mend his own heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;New York Times bestselling author Gail Carriger presents a charming gay love story set in her popular steampunk Parasolverse. Featuring the long-awaited reunion between everyone’s favorite quietly capable Beta and the werewolf Alpha dandy who let him slip away. This sweet romance is full of unexpected babysitting, holiday decorations, and no small amount of pining. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Delicate Sensibilities? &lt;br /&gt;Contains men who love other men and have waited decades to do so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wait, where does this one fit? &lt;br /&gt;The Supernatural Society novellas stand alone and may be read in any order. But if you’re a stickler, this story chronologically follows Imprudence and ties specifically to events in Timeless. Look for surprise appearances from popular side characters and the occasional strategic application of italics.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Love—on the rocks….&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing Vaughan Hewson expects to find when he returns to his childhood home is a broken hearted bride in his shower, let alone the drama and chaos that come with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lydia Green doesn't know whether to scream or cry in a corner. Discovering the love of your life is having an affair on your wedding day is bad enough. Finding out it's with his best man is another thing all together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when this runaway bride has nowhere left to turn, a handsome stranger offers her a broad, muscular shoulder to cry on. Vaughan is the exact opposite of the picture perfect, respected businessmen she's normally drawn to. This former musician-turned-bartender is rough around the edges and is facing his own crossroads. But Lydia's already tried Mr. Right and discovered he's all wrong--maybe it's time to give Mr. Right Now a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, what's wrong with getting dirty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dirty &lt;/i&gt;is the first book in the Dive Bar series from bestselling author Kylie Scott.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Nalini Singh dives beneath the surface of her Psy-Changeling world into a story of passionate devotion and selfless love...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Security specialist Bowen Knight has come back from the dead. But there's a ticking time bomb in his head: a chip implanted to block telepathic interference that could fail at any moment--taking his brain along with it. With no time to waste, he should be back on land helping the Human Alliance. Instead, he's at the bottom of the ocean, consumed with an enigmatic changeling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaia Luna may have traded in science for being a chef, but she won't hide the facts of Bo's condition from him or herself. She's suffered too much loss in her life to fall prey to the dangerous charm of a human who is a dead man walking. And she carries a devastating secret Bo could never imagine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Kaia is taken by those who mean her deadly harm, all bets are off. Bo will do anything to get her back--even if it means striking a devil's bargain and giving up his mind to the enemy...</description>

  <description>"For every action there is an equal or opposite reaction."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every choice you make there are rewards, &lt;br /&gt;or there are consequences.&lt;br /&gt;It was my choice to walk away the first time.&lt;br /&gt;And my choice to chase her the second.&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes you don't get a choice, &lt;br /&gt;and all you get are the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, &lt;br /&gt;while loving someone deeply gives you courage.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless that someone is Logan Matthews. &lt;br /&gt;Because loving him didn't give me &lt;br /&gt;the strength to walk away.&lt;br /&gt;It didn't give me &lt;br /&gt;the courage to fight for him.&lt;br /&gt;And when it was over, &lt;br /&gt;all it gave me was a broken heart.</description>

  <description>Danger shouldn't be this sexy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cougar shifter Abby Carter always plays it safe. That's why she's an accountant--no excitement, no danger, and no cocky alpha males. She loves her quiet life, but fate has other plans. When Abby uncovers the shady dealings of an anti-shifter organization, she'll have to trust the too-sexy-for-her-peace-of-mind werewolf Declan Reed... or end up six feet under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Declan Reed is starting over. After two years with Shifter Operations Command, it's time to put his past behind him. Now Declan is the only thing standing between the gorgeous Abby and an early grave, and if he's going to have any chance of keeping her alive, he'll have to embrace the darkness he's fought to keep at bay. But first he has to convince Abby that there's no safer place in the world than the arms of a big bad werewolf.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;She's bad at love, but he's even worse...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Marina is hot, blonde, and wickedly smart, but when it comes to men? She's hopeless. Between her quirks and her lack of filter, there isn't a man in Los Angeles that will stick around after the third date. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Her handsome, charming friend Lazarus has the opposite problem. Everyone wants to be the sexy Brit's girlfriend, but he gets bored and moves on quickly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There's only one way to figure out why neither of them has cracked this love thing-- they'll date each other. On paper, it's the perfect experiment. But in reality, things between Marina and Laz get complicated quickly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They might be bad at love, but they are even worse at being friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This full-length romance is a complete standalone with no relation to any other books and was inspired by the Halsey song "Bad at Love." &lt;br /&gt;It does contain ample amounts of profanity, filthy language and graphic sex scenes. &lt;br /&gt;Sensitive readers should be advised.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Skulking around in the ruins on a planet swarming with treasure hunters, slavers, and bounty hunters isn’t good for one’s health. But Ankari Markovich needs a few archaeological samples for her latest business venture, a venture that might prove lucrative enough to move her family off the impoverished planet where she grew up. Unfortunately, she has no sooner collected her samples than she’s captured by a band of brawny mercenaries. The captain might be handsome, but he’s intent on turning her over to some finance lord who has, for reasons unknown, put a bounty on her head, a ridiculously large one at that. If she can’t figure out a way to escape before she’s delivered to the lord’s home world, she could be forced into a life of indentured servitude—or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Viktor Mandrake doesn’t usually take on piddling bounty hunting gigs, but when his intelligence officer informs him of a criminal on a nearby planet, he decides it wouldn’t hurt to take a shuttle down to collect the woman. But Ankari Markovich is trouble from the start, nearly eluding his elite forces, then fighting and tricking his people left and right. He finds himself admiring her spirit, but according to her warrant, she’s a criminal. The safest thing is to keep her in the brig and ignore her until she can be handed off to the man who wants her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the situation grows more complicated when other bounty hunters show up, wanting to claim Ankari for themselves. Thanks to this woman, Viktor’s ship is in danger, his crew members are going missing, and he’s fighting enemies he never asked for in a jungle in the middle of a hurricane. He’s either going to strangle Ankari… or fall in love. Either scenario could get him killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mercenary Instinct is a full-length, stand-alone novel of 90,000 words. It is part of the “Mandrake Company” series of science fiction romance stories and is recommended for readers who enjoy space-based adventure (such as Firefly) and steamy love stories (in the style of Linnea Sinclair).</description>

  <description>Geeky introvert Tessa Rodriguez will do whatever it takes to get promoted to video game engineer– including create a fandom-based video game in just three weeks. The only problem is, she can't do it alone. Now, she needs to strong-arm, cajole, and otherwise socialize with her video game coworkers, especially her roommate, Adam, who’s always been strictly business with her. The more they work together, though, the closer they get…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam London has always thought of his roomie Tessa as “one of the guys” until he agreed to help her with this crazy project. Now, he’s thinking of her all the time… and certainly as something more than just a roommate! But his last girlfriend broke up with him to follow her ambitions, and he knows that Tessa is obsessed with getting ahead in the video game world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going from friends to something more is one hell of a challenge. Can Tessa and Adam level up their relationship to love?</description>

That is, until the disappearance of the Southern Cross dregs up skeletons from her past, shedding light on a bigger, more sinister conspiracy. As the refinery she works on descends into chaos, Hazel teams up with some unlikely friends and loads her service blaster one last time--taking aim at the very company that now employs her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methane, ice, hell, and iron: The search for the Southern Cross begins on Titan.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Daughter of immortals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Princess Diana longs to prove herself to her legendary warrior sisters. But when the opportunity finally comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law—risking exile—to save a mortal. Diana will soon learn that she has rescued no ordinary girl, and that with this single brave act, she may have doomed the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daughter of death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Alia Keralis just wanted to escape her overprotective brother with a semester at sea. She doesn’t know she is being hunted by people who think her very existence could spark a world war. When a bomb detonates aboard her ship, Alia is rescued by a mysterious girl of extraordinary strength and forced to confront a horrible truth: Alia is a Warbringer—a direct descendant of the infamous Helen of Troy, fated to bring about an age of bloodshed and misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Together.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two girls will face an army of enemies—mortal and divine—determined to either destroy or possess the Warbringer. Tested beyond the bounds of their abilities, Diana and Alia must find a way to unleash hidden strengths and forge an unlikely alliance. Because if they have any hope of saving both their worlds, they will have to stand side by side against the tide of war.</description>

  <description>Collects The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #5-8, GLX-Mas Special #1 (first story), The Thing #8 (pages 1-8), Age of Heroes #3 (Squirrel Girl story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The breakout character of 2015 continues her one-woman crusade against injustice, criminals and jerks! Squirrel Girl meets potential new allies including Chipmunk Hunk, Koi Boi and...Girl Squirrel?! Yes! But the two rodent-themed heroines don't quite see eye to beady eye — and Squirrel Girl's dislike might be justified! Now, as the world goes mad and the Avengers attack, Squirrel Girl must face Ratatoskr, the Norse God of Squirrels! There's a theme in this book, I don't know if you can tell. The fate of the world hangs in the balance, though, we promise. Featuring fights! Feelings! Sass! Punches! Friendship! A character named Hippo who is literally a hippo! And several tails (tales) of Squirrel Girl from all kinds of perspectives!</description>

  <description>I kissed her, then I left her. My best friend’s sister. The only girl I ever loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that kiss? Gave new meaning to the words, “pinball machine.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the army called. No matter what, I am a man of honor. I’ll always do my duty. Even at great personal cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, four years later, I’m back. A little older. A little wiser. And unfortunately, the bearer of horrifically tragic news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s no one else to do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll go to the ends of the earth to find her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don’t know what will happen after I hand her that letter.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up&lt;br /&gt; — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.</description>

  <description>Dante Sinclair never cared about his family’s money. All the young billionaire ever wanted was to be a cop; and now that he’s a homicide detective in Los Angeles, he’s a damn good one. But when he is injured and loses his partner in the line of duty, he returns to his vacation home in Amesport, Maine, to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Baxter, a brilliant young doctor still struggling with her stifled upbringing, has recently moved from Chicago to sleepy Amesport to escape her past, hoping to find peace. When Sarah is assigned to Dante’s case, there’s an instant heat between them. They couldn’t possibly be more different, yet their igniting passion is impossible to ignore. As new feelings awaken within Sarah, her haunted past returns, threatening her once again. But can Dante overcome his grief and discover the secrets Sarah is hiding in time to protect and rescue her?</description>

  <description>An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22324795-painted-faces" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Come forth with an open mind, for an unconventional tale of love...&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dublin native Freda Wilson considers herself to be an acquired taste. She has a habit of making offensive jokes and speaking her mind too often. She doesn't have the best track record with first impressions, which is why she gets a surprise when her new neighbour Nicholas takes a shine to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicholas is darkly handsome, funny and magnetic, and Freda feels like her black and white existence is plunged into a rainbow of colour when she's around him. When he walks into a room he lights it up, with his quick wit and charisma. He is a travelling cabaret performer, but Freda doesn't know exactly what that entails until the curtains pull back on his opening night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is gob-smacked and entirely intrigued to see him take to the stage in drag. Later on, Nicholas asks her if she would like to become his show assistant. Excited by the idea, she jumps at the chance. Soon she finds herself immersed in a world of wigs, make-up and high heels, surrounded by pretty men and the temptation of falling for her incredibly beautiful employer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this story of passion and sexual discovery, Nicholas and Freda will contend with jealousy, emotional highs and lows, and the kind of love that only comes around once in a lifetime.</description>

  <description>Eleven thousand years ago, before the seas swallowed the &lt;i&gt;Atlanteans, Poseidon assigned a few chosen warriors to act as sentinels for humans in the new world. There was only one rule-desiring them was forbidden. But rules were made to be broken...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;When she calls...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riley Dawson is more than a dedicated Virginia Beach social worker. She's blessed with a mind link that only Atlanteans have been able to access for thousands of years. Being an "empath" may explain her wistful connection to the roiling waves of the ocean, the sanctuary it provides, and the sexual urges that seem to emanate from fathoms below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;He will come.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conlan, the High Prince of Atlantis, has surfaced on a mission to retrieve Poseidon's stolen trident. Yet something else has possessed Conlan: the intimate emotions-and desires-of a human. Irresistibly drawn to the uncanny beauty, Conlan soon shares more than his mind. But in the midst of a battle to reclaim Poseidon's power, how long can a forbidden love last between two different souls from two different worlds?</description>

  <description>For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn’t just a game—it’s a way of life. The obsession started ten years ago and its fan base now spans the globe, some eager to escape from reality and others hoping to make a profit. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. But the bounty hunting world is a competitive one, and survival has not been easy. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships—only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convinced she’s going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game’s creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. He needs a spy on the inside of this year’s tournament in order to uncover a security problem . . . and he wants Emika for the job. With no time to lose, Emika’s whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she’s only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/i&gt; explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Bernadette Fox has vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her daughter Bee claims a family trip to Antarctica as a reward for perfect grades, Bernadette, a fiercely intelligent shut-in, throws herself into preparations for the trip. But worn down by years of trying to live the Seattle life she never wanted, Ms. Fox is on the brink of a meltdown. And after a school fundraiser goes disastrously awry at her hands, she disappears, leaving her family to pick up the pieces--which is exactly what Bee does, weaving together an elaborate web of emails, invoices, and school memos that reveals a secret past Bernadette has been hiding for decades. &lt;i&gt;Where'd You Go Bernadette&lt;/i&gt; is an ingenious and unabashedly entertaining novel about a family coming to terms with who they are and the power of a daughter's love for her mother.</description>

  <description>There are bad boys and then there are the men of Devil’s Rock . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some men come with a built-in warning label. Knox Callaghan is one of them. Danger radiates from every lean, muscled inch of him, and his deep blue eyes seem to see right through to Briar Davis’s most secret fantasies. But there’s one major problem: Briar is a nurse volunteering at the local prison, and Knox is an inmate who should be off-limits in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knox feels it too—a shocking animal magnetism that drives him to risk his own life to protect Briar’s. Paroled at last, he tries to resist her. She’s too innocent, too sweet, and she has no idea what Knox is capable of. But a single touch can lead to a kiss—and a taste . . . until the only crime is denying what feels so right . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“When the prison doors are open, the real dragon will fly out.”—Ho Chi Minh</description>

      <![CDATA[ok, my first foray into the subgenre of prisoner romance wasn't bad. I thought the female lead was ridiculously scared of everything and her sister went from "keep him away from my family" to "oh what the heck, date the felon" strangely quickly, but I appreciate someone telling a somewhat new sto...]]>

  <description>He may be the last of a species whose sexual talents were the envy of the galaxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat is an enslaved warrior from a race with a feline gene that gives him awesome beauty, fearsome strength, and sensuality and sexual prowess unmatched by any other males in the universe. Even filthy, chained, and beaten, he gives off an aura of power and virility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacinth is an intergalactic trader on a rescue mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has spent years pursuing her kidnapped sister from planet to planet. Now her quest leads her to a place where all the women are slaves. "Jack" needs a slave of her own-one who can masquerade as her master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enmeshed in a tangle of deception, lust and love, they must elude a race of violent killers out to destroy Cat, and together forge a bond stronger than any chains.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;This is a previously-published edition - ASIN: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46736386-friends-without-benefits" rel="nofollow"&gt;B00FJJN0WC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friends Without Benefits can be read as a standalone, is a full length 120k word novel, and is book#2 in the Knitting in the City Series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things you need to know about Elizabeth Finney: 1) She suffers from severe sarcastic syndrome, especially when she's unnerved, 2) No one unnerves her like Nico Manganiello, and 3) She knows how to knit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Finney is almost always right about everything: the musical merits of boy bands are undervalued by society, “benefits” with human Ken dolls are better without friendship, and the sun has set on her once-in-a-lifetime chance for true love. But when Elizabeth’s plans for benefits without friendship are disarmed by the irritatingly charismatic and chauvinistic Nico Manganiello- her former nemesis- she finds herself struggling to maintain the electric fence around her heart while avoiding electrocution or, worse, falling in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;'Tis the Season to Be Naughty&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connor McClain knows what he wants. And after four harrowing years in Afghanistan, that's a quiet life in the lakeside town of Evergreen Cove. But coming home has land mines of its own-the most dangerous of them being long-legged bombshell Faith Garrett. Now getting her into his arms this holiday is going to require more than mistletoe . . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a cheating ex behind her, all Faith wants is a relaxing holiday free from man drama. And even though every moment with gorgeous Connor is a sweet temptation, Faith is determined not to give in. But Jack Frost has other plans, and soon Faith and Connor are snowbound in a winter wonderland with only the sparks flying between them to keep them warm. As one hot kiss leads to another, they'll have to decide if they're ready to give each other the best gift of all-love. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Everything I love in a romance."&lt;br /&gt;--- Lori Foster, 2014</description>

  <description>Callypso Lillis is a siren with a very big problem, one that stretches up her arm and far into her past. For the last seven years she’s been collecting a bracelet of black beads up her wrist, magical IOUs for favors she’s received. Only death or repayment will fulfill the obligations. Only then will the beads disappear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that if you need a favor, you go to the Bargainer to make it happen. He’s a man who can get you anything you want … at a price. And everyone knows that sooner or later he always collects. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But for one of his clients, he’s never asked for repayment. Not until now. When Callie finds the fae king of the night in her room, a grin on his lips and a twinkle in his eye, she knows things are about to change. At first it’s just a chaste kiss—a single bead’s worth—and a promise for more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the Bargainer, it’s more than just a matter of rekindling an old romance. Something is happening in the Otherworld. Fae warriors are going missing one by one. Only the women are returned, each in a glass casket, a child clutched to their breast. And then there are the whispers among the slaves, whispers of an evil that’s been awoken. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If the Bargainer has any hope to save his people, he’ll need the help of the siren he spurned long ago. Only, his foe has a taste for exotic creatures, and Callie just happens to be one.</description>

  <description>Bobbi Richmond has always been in love with her best friend, Gabe Braddock, even if Gabe, who works for her media mogul father, has always treated Bobbi like a kid sister, calling her “Runt.”&lt;p&gt;After a tipsy Bobbi kisses Gabe at a party, Gabe is surprised to find “Runt” becoming the object of his fantasies, and Bobbi is shocked to find her advances suddenly reciprocated. When Gabe suggests adding “benefits” to their friendship—while keeping their new arrangement secret from their families, of course—should Bobbi feel flattered, or insulted by his insistence on casual sex? Are they even a match? Slick and conservative Gabe dates coiffed blondes, while the tomboyish Bobbi spends much more time fixing cars than her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gabe’s twin brother, Chase, senses something’s up between the old friends, he forces Gabe to confront his real feelings for Bobbi—and decide whether or not he could live without her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>How to seduce an estranged husband—and banish debt!—in four wickedly improper, shockingly pleasurable steps...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Learn the most intimate secrets of London’s leading courtesan.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pretend to be a courtesan yourself, using the name Juliet Leighton.&lt;br /&gt;3. Travel to Venice and locate said husband.&lt;br /&gt;4. Seduce husband, conceive an heir, and voilà, your future is secure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Julia, the Duchess of Colton, such a ruse promises to be foolproof. After all, her husband has not bothered to lay eyes on her in eight years, since their hasty wedding day when she was only sixteen. But what begins as a tempestuous flirtation escalates into full-blown passion—and the feeling is mutual. Could the man the Courtesan Duchess married actually turn out to be the love of her life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The powerful passion in this riveting tale of betrayal and forgiveness will knock your socks off!"&lt;br /&gt;-- NY Times bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries</description>

  <description>Tall and thin, twenty-eight-year-old Bronwyn Palmer has become positively gaunt, a ghost of her former self. That self was—and still is—the wife of a rich, handsome executive with an ocean-view house and his own security staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was in that house, two years ago, that Bryce Palmer learned Bronwyn was pregnant with their first child. But Bryce’s rage over his impending fatherhood touched off a chain reaction of emotional and physical traumas that wounded them both. For Bronwyn, it meant fleeing the perfect marriage to start over with nothing but a precocious daughter named Kayla to care for. For Bryce, it meant a tortuous two years spent blaming his wife for deserting him, and living with the pain of not knowing his child. Now a chance encounter has brought Bronwyn back into Bryce’s life, both bearing scars...and neither knowing the whole truth of that fateful night that drove them apart.</description>

  <description>When Earth intercepts a message from a long-extinct alien race, it seems like the solution the planet has been waiting for. The Undying's advanced technology has the potential to undo environmental damage and turn lives around, and Gaia, their former home planet, is a treasure trove waiting to be uncovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Jules Addison and his fellow scholars, the discovery of an alien culture offers unprecedented opportunity for study... as long as scavengers like Amelia Radcliffe don't loot everything first. Mia and Jules' different reasons for smuggling themselves onto Gaia put them immediately at odds, but after escaping a dangerous confrontation with other scavvers, they form a fragile alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to penetrate the Undying temple and reach the tech and information hidden within, the two must decode the ancient race's secrets and survive their traps. But the more they learn about the Undying, the more their presence in the temple seems to be part of a grand design that could spell the end of the human race...</description>

(What, you have a problem with one-stop shopping?) Two McCready brothers started two separate businesses in the same building back in 1928, and now it’s become one big family affair. And true to form in small Southern towns, family business becomes &lt;i&gt;everybody’s &lt;/i&gt;business.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Margot Cary has spent her life immersed in everything Lake Sackett is not. As an elite event planner, Margot’s rubbed elbows with the cream of Chicago society, and made elegance and glamour her business. She’s riding high until one event goes tragically, spectacularly wrong. Now she’s blackballed by the gala set and in dire need of a fresh start—and apparently the McCreadys are in need of an event planner with a tarnished reputation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As Margot finds her footing in a town where everybody knows not only your name, but what you had for dinner last Saturday night and what you’ll wear to church on Sunday morning, she grudgingly has to admit that there are some things Lake Sackett does better than Chicago—including the dating prospects. Elementary school principal Kyle Archer is a fellow fish-out-of-water who volunteers to show Margot the picture-postcard side of Southern living. The two of them hit it off, but not everybody is happy to see an outsider snapping up one of the town's most eligible gentleman. Will Margot reel in her handsome fish, or will she have to release her latest catch?</description>

      <![CDATA[Not as good as Molly Harper's paranormal series, but charming enough. Margot herself was passable if not enthralling. The southern setting was intriguing. I did find the McCready family adorable and look forward to further books featuring them!]]>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The privileged members of the Knickerbocker Club can never climb too high up the social ladder. But for one charming New York bachelor, does the ascent take precedence over love in the Gilded Age?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;As owner of a well-respected national newspaper, Calvin Cabot has the means to indulge his capricious taste for excess—and the power to bring the upper crust of society to its knees. So when a desperate heiress from his past begs for his help, Calvin agrees . . . as long as she promises to stay out of his way. Except, like the newsman, this willful beauty always gets what she wants . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian Davies lives a life brimming with boundless parties, impressive yachts, and exotic getaways. But when her brother disappears, Lily knows that blood runs thicker than champagne and she’ll spare nothing to bring him back alive. Unfortunately, the only man who can help her is the one she never wanted to see again. Can Lily keep Calvin at arm’s length long enough to save her brother and protect her name . . . even when the tenacious powerbroker turns out to be absolutely irresistible?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Lionheart is the final story in the Moonshadow trilogy…&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;King Oberon reigned over his Dark Court in Lyonesse for centuries, until an assassination attempt laid him low. Now he lies unconscious in his snow-bound palace, while his Power battles the enchantment that threatens to end his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A skilled trauma surgeon and magic-user, Dr. Kathryn Shaw reigns at the top of her profession in New York. Then comes a challenge she can’t resist—she is asked to cure the uncureable. Just getting close enough to try healing Oberon is a dangerous proposition. When she does reach him, he awakens too soon. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Roused from darkness by Kathryn’s presence, Oberon confronts the beautiful stranger who claims she wants to save his life. But the enchantment has frozen his emotions. How can he learn to trust her when he can’t feel anything? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oberon’s desire is icy, devoid of all tenderness. Not only must Kathryn match wits with him, she must also fight her reaction to his touch, because there is so much more at stake than her own endangered heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the Dark Court faces its most deadly peril yet. Its ancient enemy Isabeau, Queen of the Light Court, is obsessed with its annihilation, and Oberon must be brought to remember his loyalty and affection for his people. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because if he won’t fight for them, Lyonesse itself may very well be destroyed…&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>Leader of a human colony planet, Taryn Demara has much more on her plate than maintaining peace or ensuring her people have enough to eat. Due to a virus that affects male embryos in the womb, there is a shortage of men. For decades, her people have enticed ships to their planet and tricked the men into staying. However, a ship hasn’t been spotted in eight years. So when the blip finally shows on the radar, Taryn is determined to conquer the newcomers at any cost to ensure her people’s survival. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Prince Kason tro de Vallen needs to find a suitable planet for his people to colonize. The Kelderans are running out of options despite the fact one is staring them in the face—Planet Jasvar. Because a group of Kelderan scientists disappeared there a decade ago never to return, his people dismiss the planet as cursed. But Kason doesn’t believe in curses and takes on the mission to explore the planet to prove it. As his ship approaches Jasvar, a distress signal chimes in and Kason takes a group down to the planet’s surface to explore. What he didn’t expect was for a band of females to try and capture him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As Taryn and Kason measure up and try to outsmart each other, they soon realize they’ve found their match. The only question is whether they ignore the spark between them and focus on their respective people’s survival or can they find a path where they both succeed?</description>
